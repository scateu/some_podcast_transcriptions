EDL	00:00:37,458	00:00:38,583	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 1.1 secs ]
EDL	00:00:38,583	00:00:40,458	| Kissinger |	Henry Kissinger's undergraduate thesis
EDL	00:00:40,458	00:00:42,000	| Kissinger |	set a record at Harvard.
EDL	00:00:42,000	00:00:43,333	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 1.3 secs ]
EDL	00:00:43,333	00:00:46,958	| Kissinger |	At 383 pages, it is thought to be the
EDL	00:00:46,958	00:00:48,083	| Kissinger |	longest ever written.
EDL	00:00:48,083	00:00:49,416	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 1.3 secs ]
EDL	00:00:49,416	00:00:51,625	| Kissinger |	So lengthy that future projects were
EDL	00:00:51,625	00:00:53,416	| Kissinger |	limited to a third of the size.
EDL	00:00:53,416	00:00:54,583	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]
EDL	00:00:54,583	00:00:56,541	| Kissinger |	It examined the meaning of history

EDL	00:00:57,541	00:00:58,250	| Kissinger |	and the role that

EDL	00:01:06,208	00:01:07,583	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 1.4 secs ]
EDL	00:01:07,583	00:01:09,500	| Kissinger |	Eventually, the thesis was awarded the

EDL	00:01:10,625	00:01:12,708	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 2.1 secs ]
EDL	00:01:12,708	00:01:14,375	| Kissinger |	For the best part of a century,
EDL	00:01:14,375	00:01:14,916	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:01:14,916	00:01:16,250	| Kissinger |	Kissinger has thought a lot about the
EDL	00:01:16,250	00:01:17,166	| Kissinger |	relationships between
EDL	00:01:17,166	00:01:18,208	| Kissinger |	the world's great powers

EDL	00:01:18,958	00:01:21,000	| Kissinger |	and how to prevent war between them.
EDL	00:01:21,000	00:01:23,500	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 2.5 secs ]
EDL	00:01:23,500	00:01:24,458	| Kissinger |	Today, a sense of
EDL	00:01:24,458	00:01:25,458	| Kissinger |	that threat is palpable.
EDL	00:01:25,458	00:01:26,166	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]
EDL	00:01:26,166	00:01:27,333	| Kissinger |	From Washington and
EDL	00:01:27,333	00:01:29,041	| Kissinger |	Beijing, the problems are clear.
EDL	00:01:29,041	00:01:29,916	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]
EDL	00:01:29,916	00:01:32,541	| Kissinger |	Mutual suspicion, little contact, a
EDL	00:01:32,541	00:01:33,500	| Kissinger |	struggle for dominance.
EDL	00:01:33,500	00:01:35,333	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 1.8 secs ]
EDL	00:01:35,333	00:01:37,625	| Kissinger |	Meanwhile, Europe is at war and Russia is
EDL	00:01:37,625	00:01:39,000	| Kissinger |	tumbling into China's orbit.
EDL	00:01:39,000	00:01:40,500	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 1.5 secs ]
EDL	00:01:40,500	00:01:41,708	| Kissinger |	For a sobering analysis
EDL	00:01:41,708	00:01:43,291	| Kissinger |	of how grave the risks are,
EDL	00:01:43,291	00:01:43,708	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:01:43,708	00:01:45,583	| Kissinger |	you just need to go to midtown Manhattan.
EDL	00:01:45,583	00:01:47,375	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 1.8 secs ]
EDL	00:01:47,375	00:01:48,166	| Kissinger |	There are so many

EDL	00:01:53,166	00:01:56,166	| Kissinger |	victory here in this corner?
EDL	00:01:56,166	00:01:57,208	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]
EDL	00:01:57,208	00:01:58,541	| Kissinger |	To presidents you served?
EDL	00:01:58,541	00:01:59,666	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 1.1 secs ]
EDL	00:01:59,666	00:02:01,458	| Kissinger |	Kissinger first arrived in New York in
EDL	00:02:01,458	00:02:04,541	| Kissinger |	1938 as a refugee fleeing Nazi Germany.
EDL	00:02:04,541	00:02:05,833	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 1.3 secs ]
EDL	00:02:05,833	00:02:08,000	| Kissinger |	He became one of the towering figures of
EDL	00:02:08,000	00:02:09,416	| Kissinger |	20th century foreign affairs.
EDL	00:02:09,416	00:02:10,625	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]
EDL	00:02:10,625	00:02:11,541	| Kissinger |	First as a scholar
EDL	00:02:11,541	00:02:13,166	| Kissinger |	and then a practitioner,
EDL	00:02:13,166	00:02:13,750	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:02:13,750	00:02:15,500	| Kissinger |	national security adviser and secretary
EDL	00:02:15,500	00:02:17,875	| Kissinger |	of state to presidents Nixon and Ford.
EDL	00:02:17,875	00:02:18,416	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:02:18,416	00:02:20,708	| Kissinger |	He shaped some of the most controversial
EDL	00:02:20,708	00:02:22,291	| Kissinger |	and consequential episodes
EDL	00:02:22,291	00:02:23,583	| Kissinger |	of American foreign policy.
EDL	00:02:23,583	00:02:24,958	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 1.4 secs ]
EDL	00:02:24,958	00:02:26,250	| Kissinger |	For the past half century,
EDL	00:02:26,250	00:02:26,750	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:02:26,750	00:02:28,625	| Kissinger |	Kissinger emerged as a quiet counselor
EDL	00:02:28,625	00:02:30,458	| Kissinger |	and emissary to presidents,
EDL	00:02:30,458	00:02:30,958	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:02:30,958	00:02:31,833	| Kissinger |	prime ministers and
EDL	00:02:31,833	00:02:33,166	| Kissinger |	monarchs around the world.
EDL	00:02:33,166	00:02:35,416	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 2.2 secs ]
EDL	00:02:35,416	00:02:35,833	| Kissinger |	I'm Zannie
EDL	00:02:35,833	00:02:37,583	| Kissinger |	Minton-Beddows, editor of The Economist,
EDL	00:02:37,583	00:02:38,166	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:02:38,166	00:02:40,541	| Kissinger |	and this is a podcast special featuring
EDL	00:02:40,541	00:02:43,041	| Kissinger |	our conversation with Henry Kissinger,
EDL	00:02:43,041	00:02:45,000	| Kissinger |	which we're publishing just days before
EDL	00:02:45,000	00:02:46,083	| Kissinger |	his hundredth birthday.
EDL	00:02:46,083	00:02:51,375	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 5.3 secs ]
EDL	00:02:51,375	00:02:53,416	| Kissinger |	I was joined in the interview by our
EDL	00:02:53,416	00:02:54,750	| Kissinger |	deputy editor, Ed Carr,
EDL	00:02:54,750	00:02:55,291	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:02:55,291	00:02:56,416	| Kissinger |	who also joins me in
EDL	00:02:56,416	00:02:57,541	| Kissinger |	the studio here today.
EDL	00:02:57,541	00:02:58,041	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:02:58,041	00:02:59,375	| Kissinger |	Ed, hi, nice to see you.
EDL	00:02:59,375	00:03:00,333	| Kissinger |	Hi, Zannie, good to be here.
EDL	00:03:00,333	00:03:00,833	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:03:00,833	00:03:02,208	| Kissinger |	What was your impression of Kissinger?
EDL	00:03:02,208	00:03:03,666	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 1.5 secs ]
EDL	00:03:03,666	00:03:06,000	| Kissinger |	Well, for me, what was really interesting
EDL	00:03:06,000	00:03:09,750	| Kissinger |	is perhaps there were 20 or 30 years
EDL	00:03:09,750	00:03:11,833	| Kissinger |	when Kissinger's thought wasn't
EDL	00:03:11,833	00:03:13,041	| Kissinger |	especially relevant after the
EDL	00:03:13,041	00:03:13,916	| Kissinger |	collapse of the Soviet Union.
EDL	00:03:13,916	00:03:16,791	| Kissinger |	It was all about jihadism, about America
EDL	00:03:16,791	00:03:18,750	| Kissinger |	as an overwhelming superpower.
EDL	00:03:18,750	00:03:19,500	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	00:03:19,500	00:03:22,041	| Kissinger |	With the rise of China and the arrival of
EDL	00:03:22,041	00:03:23,083	| Kissinger |	dangerous new
EDL	00:03:23,083	00:03:24,875	| Kissinger |	technologies and weapons systems,
EDL	00:03:24,875	00:03:25,750	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]
EDL	00:03:25,750	00:03:28,166	| Kissinger |	it's as if Kissinger's historical
EDL	00:03:28,166	00:03:30,541	| Kissinger |	relevance has come storming back.
EDL	00:03:30,541	00:03:31,083	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:03:31,083	00:03:33,875	| Kissinger |	He himself draws comparisons to the world
EDL	00:03:33,875	00:03:35,333	| Kissinger |	before the First World War
EDL	00:03:35,333	00:03:37,125	| Kissinger |	with Germany as the rising
EDL	00:03:37,125	00:03:39,375	| Kissinger |	power, with the weapons system, machine
EDL	00:03:39,375	00:03:41,291	| Kissinger |	guns, the beginnings of tanks,
EDL	00:03:41,291	00:03:43,291	| Kissinger |	the beginnings of planes and huge cannons
EDL	00:03:43,291	00:03:45,166	| Kissinger |	as this enormous
EDL	00:03:45,166	00:03:47,000	| Kissinger |	destructive power that was unleashed
EDL	00:03:47,000	00:03:49,791	| Kissinger |	on the world. And the longer we spoke,
EDL	00:03:49,791	00:03:50,291	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:03:50,291	00:03:51,875	| Kissinger |	the more engaged he became
EDL	00:03:51,875	00:03:54,000	| Kissinger |	and the more focused he became
EDL	00:03:54,000	00:03:55,208	| Kissinger |	and the more insights
EDL	00:03:55,208	00:03:56,875	| Kissinger |	sort of tumbled out of him.
EDL	00:03:56,875	00:03:57,625	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	00:03:57,625	00:03:59,208	| Kissinger |	For a man who's approaching his hundredth
EDL	00:03:59,208	00:04:00,375	| Kissinger |	birthday, he does have
EDL	00:04:00,375	00:04:01,416	| Kissinger |	an unbelievable amount
EDL	00:04:01,416	00:04:03,083	| Kissinger |	of stamina. I think I was probably more
EDL	00:04:03,083	00:04:04,791	| Kissinger |	tired at the end of the seven
EDL	00:04:04,791	00:04:06,208	| Kissinger |	and a half hours than he was.
EDL	00:04:06,208	00:04:07,250	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]
EDL	00:04:07,250	00:04:09,083	| Kissinger |	But Henry Kissinger, he's an incredibly
EDL	00:04:09,083	00:04:10,208	| Kissinger |	polarizing character.
EDL	00:04:10,208	00:04:10,916	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]
EDL	00:04:10,916	00:04:13,625	| Kissinger |	He is, let's remember, a man hugely
EDL	00:04:13,625	00:04:15,875	| Kissinger |	criticized, vilified even, particularly
EDL	00:04:15,875	00:04:17,041	| Kissinger |	by those on the left,
EDL	00:04:17,041	00:04:19,708	| Kissinger |	as a war criminal or at the very least as
EDL	00:04:19,708	00:04:21,500	| Kissinger |	someone who was associated
EDL	00:04:21,500	00:04:22,666	| Kissinger |	with terrible human rights
EDL	00:04:22,666	00:04:25,250	| Kissinger |	abuses, whether from Chile to Bangladesh.
EDL	00:04:25,250	00:04:26,416	| Kissinger |	And this is something that he, of course,
EDL	00:04:26,416	00:04:26,791	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:04:26,791	00:04:29,291	| Kissinger |	would absolutely deny, but he is still, I
EDL	00:04:29,291	00:04:31,791	| Kissinger |	think, a figure of who many
EDL	00:04:31,791	00:04:33,291	| Kissinger |	people have very strong views.
EDL	00:04:33,291	00:04:34,083	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	00:04:34,083	00:04:36,208	| Kissinger |	Nonetheless, he is not a person who lives
EDL	00:04:36,208	00:04:37,875	| Kissinger |	in the past. A conversation
EDL	00:04:37,875	00:04:39,708	| Kissinger |	with him is very contemporary.
EDL	00:04:39,708	00:04:41,875	| Kissinger |	It's about today and indeed it's about
EDL	00:04:41,875	00:04:42,333	| Kissinger |	the future.
EDL	00:04:42,333	00:04:43,625	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 1.3 secs ]
EDL	00:04:43,625	00:04:46,000	| Kissinger |	Specifically, I wanted to talk to him
EDL	00:04:46,000	00:04:48,708	| Kissinger |	about how to avoid World War Three. Now,
EDL	00:04:48,708	00:04:51,458	| Kissinger |	that might sound hyperbolic, but having
EDL	00:04:51,458	00:04:52,375	| Kissinger |	just been to Beijing
EDL	00:04:52,375	00:04:52,875	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:04:52,875	00:04:55,916	| Kissinger |	and to Washington frequently, I am struck
EDL	00:04:55,916	00:04:57,958	| Kissinger |	by just how poor the
EDL	00:04:57,958	00:04:59,041	| Kissinger |	relationship is between
EDL	00:04:59,041	00:04:59,750	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]
EDL	00:04:59,750	00:05:02,250	| Kissinger |	the US and China. It seems genuinely
EDL	00:05:02,250	00:05:04,625	| Kissinger |	broken. So that's where we began.
EDL	00:05:04,625	00:05:05,458	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]



EDL	00:05:05,458	00:05:08,208	| Kissinger |	Can we start with your assessment? How

EDL	00:12:39,041	00:12:43,000	| Kissinger |	In my first conversation with Zhou Enlai,
EDL	00:12:43,000	00:12:43,666	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]
EDL	00:12:43,666	00:12:47,041	| Kissinger |	I had prepared a little
EDL	00:12:47,041	00:12:49,750	| Kissinger |	speech of how we got there
EDL	00:12:49,750	00:12:55,750	| Kissinger |	and it ended with, so we now find
EDL	00:12:55,750	00:12:57,791	| Kissinger |	ourselves in what was
EDL	00:12:57,791	00:12:59,166	| Kissinger |	the land of ministry,
EDL	00:12:59,166	00:13:00,416	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]
EDL	00:13:00,416	00:13:02,625	| Kissinger |	and before I finished.
EDL	00:13:02,625	00:13:04,333	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 1.7 secs ]
EDL	00:13:04,333	00:13:07,958	| Kissinger |	So as I was saying, he said, "May I
EDL	00:13:07,958	00:13:11,333	| Kissinger |	interrupt? Tell me what is
EDL	00:13:11,333	00:13:13,333	| Kissinger |	so mysterious about China."
EDL	00:13:13,333	00:13:15,333	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 2.0 secs ]
EDL	00:13:15,333	00:13:20,166	| Kissinger |	And I gave a banal answer because he
EDL	00:13:20,166	00:13:24,541	| Kissinger |	said, "Let us see that we can
EDL	00:13:24,541	00:13:26,250	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 1.7 secs ]
EDL	00:13:26,250	00:13:27,833	| Kissinger |	take the mystery out of it."
EDL	00:13:27,833	00:13:30,083	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 2.2 secs ]
EDL	00:13:30,083	00:13:34,083	| Kissinger |	And after you know us better and there is
EDL	00:13:34,083	00:13:37,916	| Kissinger |	a billion of us, I hope it
EDL	00:13:37,916	00:13:40,208	| Kissinger |	will not be so mysterious, do you?
EDL	00:13:40,208	00:13:41,583	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 1.4 secs ]
EDL	00:13:41,583	00:13:43,458	| Kissinger |	It was so funny listening to him saying
EDL	00:13:43,458	00:13:45,166	| Kissinger |	that. I thought, you know,
EDL	00:13:45,166	00:13:46,791	| Kissinger |	how true that still is today,
EDL	00:13:46,791	00:13:49,916	| Kissinger |	that people find China a land of mystery
EDL	00:13:49,916	00:13:50,583	| Kissinger |	in the sense that
EDL	00:13:50,583	00:13:52,083	| Kissinger |	wherever you are, whether in
EDL	00:13:52,083	00:13:54,083	| Kissinger |	Europe or in Washington, people aren't
EDL	00:13:54,083	00:13:56,541	| Kissinger |	quite sure what China is trying to do.
EDL	00:13:56,541	00:13:57,125	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:13:57,125	00:13:59,625	| Kissinger |	And so many people in Washington think
EDL	00:13:59,625	00:14:00,708	| Kissinger |	that China's real goal
EDL	00:14:00,708	00:14:02,083	| Kissinger |	is to supplant the US
EDL	00:14:02,083	00:14:03,500	| Kissinger |	as the world's leading power.
EDL	00:14:03,500	00:14:04,041	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:14:04,041	00:14:06,416	| Kissinger |	And interestingly, when you go to China,
EDL	00:14:06,416	00:14:08,333	| Kissinger |	you hear the complete contrary of that,
EDL	00:14:08,333	00:14:10,708	| Kissinger |	that the United States is determined to
EDL	00:14:10,708	00:14:12,916	| Kissinger |	keep China down at any price.
EDL	00:14:12,916	00:14:13,458	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:14:13,458	00:14:15,958	| Kissinger |	That's true, Ed, but Kissinger, he
EDL	00:14:15,958	00:14:17,500	| Kissinger |	disputed the common view
EDL	00:14:17,500	00:14:19,083	| Kissinger |	in Washington about China's
EDL	00:14:19,083	00:14:20,000	| Kissinger |	intentions, right?
EDL	00:14:20,000	00:14:20,875	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]
EDL	00:14:20,875	00:14:23,500	| Kissinger |	So I think this is a very Kissingerian
EDL	00:14:23,500	00:14:25,583	| Kissinger |	insight, and it's really one that says,
EDL	00:14:25,583	00:14:27,333	| Kissinger |	"China's becoming more powerful,
EDL	00:14:27,333	00:14:27,750	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:14:27,750	00:14:29,916	| Kissinger |	inevitably, as it does so,
EDL	00:14:29,916	00:14:31,041	| Kissinger |	it wants a greater say in the
EDL	00:14:31,041	00:14:32,708	| Kissinger |	way the world works." And that's only
EDL	00:14:32,708	00:14:34,791	| Kissinger |	natural. But to say that
EDL	00:14:34,791	00:14:36,875	| Kissinger |	that means it wants complete
EDL	00:14:36,875	00:14:39,750	| Kissinger |	domination of the world is to go too far.
EDL	00:14:39,750	00:14:40,083	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:14:40,083	00:14:41,000	| Kissinger |	Remember, he thinks of
EDL	00:14:41,000	00:14:42,375	| Kissinger |	the world in terms of
EDL	00:14:42,375	00:14:45,208	| Kissinger |	balances. And as China's weight in the
EDL	00:14:45,208	00:14:47,000	| Kissinger |	world increases, it only
EDL	00:14:47,000	00:14:48,416	| Kissinger |	makes sense that the scales
EDL	00:14:48,416	00:14:49,916	| Kissinger |	adjust to reflect that.
EDL	00:14:49,916	00:14:50,250	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:14:50,250	00:14:52,666	| Kissinger |	But he also left open the possibility
EDL	00:14:52,666	00:14:54,291	| Kissinger |	that there might be malign intent.
EDL	00:14:54,291	00:14:54,875	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:14:54,875	00:14:57,291	| Kissinger |	Kissinger is often seen as a bit of a
EDL	00:14:57,291	00:14:58,583	| Kissinger |	China hugger. I mean,
EDL	00:14:58,583	00:15:00,458	| Kissinger |	after he left office, his
EDL	00:15:00,458	00:15:02,583	| Kissinger |	consulting company had a lot of business
EDL	00:15:02,583	00:15:04,125	| Kissinger |	in China. But he
EDL	00:15:04,125	00:15:05,791	| Kissinger |	acknowledged that, you know,
EDL	00:15:05,791	00:15:06,500	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]
EDL	00:15:06,500	00:15:08,625	| Kissinger |	we wouldn't know and we don't know what
EDL	00:15:08,625	00:15:09,916	| Kissinger |	China really wants. And
EDL	00:15:09,916	00:15:11,500	| Kissinger |	so deterrence through a
EDL	00:15:11,500	00:15:13,583	| Kissinger |	strong military is absolutely essential.
EDL	00:15:13,583	00:15:19,625	| Kissinger |	Well, the basic question is this. Is it
EDL	00:15:19,625	00:15:22,583	| Kissinger |	possible for China and the United States
EDL	00:15:22,583	00:15:24,000	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 1.4 secs ]
EDL	00:15:24,000	00:15:30,333	| Kissinger |	to coexist without this threat of all-out
EDL	00:15:30,333	00:15:31,541	| Kissinger |	war with each other?
EDL	00:15:31,541	00:15:33,375	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 1.8 secs ]
EDL	00:15:33,375	00:15:38,375	| Kissinger |	I thought and still think the negative
EDL	00:15:38,375	00:15:40,625	| Kissinger |	proof of that has not yet been given
EDL	00:15:40,625	00:15:41,583	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]
EDL	00:15:41,583	00:15:49,541	| Kissinger |	because Taiwan is a special case. Every
EDL	00:15:49,541	00:15:54,625	| Kissinger |	Chinese leader has asserted its essential
EDL	00:15:54,625	00:15:56,750	| Kissinger |	connection to China.
EDL	00:15:56,750	00:15:57,666	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]
EDL	00:15:57,666	00:15:59,500	| Kissinger |	Kissinger launches into this story about
EDL	00:15:59,500	00:16:01,583	| Kissinger |	how when Mao and Nixon
EDL	00:16:01,583	00:16:03,416	| Kissinger |	met, Nixon being Nixon
EDL	00:16:03,416	00:16:05,500	| Kissinger |	tries to negotiate a whole lot of deals
EDL	00:16:05,500	00:16:06,583	| Kissinger |	and Mao interrupts him and
EDL	00:16:06,583	00:16:07,916	| Kissinger |	says, "I'm a philosopher.
EDL	00:16:07,916	00:16:08,416	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:16:08,416	00:16:10,708	| Kissinger |	I don't deal with these subjects. Let
EDL	00:16:10,708	00:16:12,500	| Kissinger |	John Kissinger deal with this."
EDL	00:16:12,500	00:16:13,250	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	00:16:13,250	00:16:14,958	| Kissinger |	And that all goes on fine,
EDL	00:16:14,958	00:16:16,708	| Kissinger |	except when it comes to Taiwan.
EDL	00:16:16,708	00:16:17,208	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:16:17,208	00:16:17,916	| Kissinger |	When it comes to
EDL	00:16:17,916	00:16:21,083	| Kissinger |	Taiwan, it was very explicit.
EDL	00:16:21,083	00:16:22,708	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 1.6 secs ]
EDL	00:16:22,708	00:16:25,125	| Kissinger |	He said, "There are a bunch of
EDL	00:16:25,125	00:16:26,458	| Kissinger |	counter-revolutionaries.
EDL	00:16:26,458	00:16:27,583	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 1.1 secs ]
EDL	00:16:27,583	00:16:29,333	| Kissinger |	We don't need them now.
EDL	00:16:29,333	00:16:30,750	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 1.4 secs ]
EDL	00:16:30,750	00:16:32,458	| Kissinger |	We can wait a hundred years.
EDL	00:16:32,458	00:16:33,916	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 1.5 secs ]
EDL	00:16:33,916	00:16:35,666	| Kissinger |	Someday we will ask for them."
EDL	00:16:35,666	00:16:37,958	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 2.3 secs ]
EDL	00:16:37,958	00:16:42,458	| Kissinger |	But that's a long distance away. So this
EDL	00:16:42,458	00:16:45,000	| Kissinger |	became the basis of our arrangement
EDL	00:16:45,000	00:16:45,833	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	00:16:45,833	00:16:50,916	| Kissinger |	that the Chinese on both sides of the
EDL	00:16:50,916	00:16:53,875	| Kissinger |	Taiwan Strait affirm
EDL	00:16:53,875	00:16:56,291	| Kissinger |	their goal of one China.
EDL	00:16:56,291	00:16:57,750	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 1.5 secs ]
EDL	00:16:57,750	00:16:59,875	| Kissinger |	The United States does not
EDL	00:16:59,875	00:17:01,625	| Kissinger |	challenge that proposition.
EDL	00:17:01,625	00:17:02,000	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:17:02,000	00:17:08,250	| Kissinger |	It's no doubt that the implication of our
EDL	00:17:08,250	00:17:10,958	| Kissinger |	conversations was
EDL	00:17:10,958	00:17:13,791	| Kissinger |	that we would not support
EDL	00:17:13,791	00:17:17,500	| Kissinger |	the two China policy and
EDL	00:17:17,500	00:17:18,958	| Kissinger |	that they would not use force.
EDL	00:17:18,958	00:17:20,583	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 1.6 secs ]
EDL	00:17:20,583	00:17:24,541	| Kissinger |	Let's fast forward to today. Have either
EDL	00:17:24,541	00:17:26,500	| Kissinger |	or both of those elements changed?
EDL	00:17:26,500	00:17:27,166	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]
EDL	00:17:27,166	00:17:30,333	| Kissinger |	Has the US position changed on Taiwan?
EDL	00:17:30,333	00:17:32,750	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 2.4 secs ]
EDL	00:17:32,750	00:17:38,000	| Kissinger |	Well, that policy was continued until the
EDL	00:17:38,000	00:17:39,166	| Kissinger |	Trump administration.
EDL	00:17:39,166	00:17:41,625	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 2.5 secs ]
EDL	00:17:41,625	00:17:45,875	| Kissinger |	He wanted to be perceived as exacting
EDL	00:17:45,875	00:17:49,083	| Kissinger |	demand he made in the economic field.
EDL	00:17:49,083	00:17:50,250	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]
EDL	00:17:50,250	00:17:55,208	| Kissinger |	I agreed with the objectives he had to
EDL	00:17:55,208	00:17:56,916	| Kissinger |	get a better balance,
EDL	00:17:56,916	00:17:57,500	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:17:57,500	00:17:59,666	| Kissinger |	but he then turned it
EDL	00:17:59,666	00:18:00,333	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]
EDL	00:18:00,333	00:18:03,208	| Kissinger |	into quite a confrontational matter.
EDL	00:18:03,208	00:18:04,666	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 1.5 secs ]
EDL	00:18:04,666	00:18:06,541	| Kissinger |	Trump went to try and negotiate some
EDL	00:18:06,541	00:18:07,875	| Kissinger |	trade concessions from
EDL	00:18:07,875	00:18:10,250	| Kissinger |	China, an objective that
EDL	00:18:10,250	00:18:12,333	| Kissinger |	actually Kissinger agreed with. But what
EDL	00:18:12,333	00:18:14,666	| Kissinger |	he didn't agree with was after this in
EDL	00:18:14,666	00:18:15,500	| Kissinger |	the press conference
EDL	00:18:15,500	00:18:15,833	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:18:15,833	00:18:17,750	| Kissinger |	when Trump claimed that he'd extracted
EDL	00:18:17,750	00:18:19,333	| Kissinger |	these concessions and
EDL	00:18:19,333	00:18:21,458	| Kissinger |	sort of humiliated China.
EDL	00:18:21,458	00:18:22,041	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:18:22,041	00:18:23,458	| Kissinger |	And Kissinger, that was a turning point.
EDL	00:18:23,458	00:18:24,125	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]
EDL	00:18:24,125	00:18:27,291	| Kissinger |	And he also argued, I think accurately,
EDL	00:18:27,291	00:18:29,750	| Kissinger |	actually, that broadly the Trumpian
EDL	00:18:29,750	00:18:31,500	| Kissinger |	policies towards China have been
EDL	00:18:31,500	00:18:31,833	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:18:31,833	00:18:33,583	| Kissinger |	continued by the Biden administration
EDL	00:18:33,583	00:18:35,708	| Kissinger |	with slightly more liberal rhetoric.
EDL	00:18:35,708	00:18:36,583	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]
EDL	00:18:36,583	00:18:40,791	| Kissinger |	So the margin for concession here is very
EDL	00:18:40,791	00:18:43,500	| Kissinger |	limited. On the other hand,
EDL	00:18:43,500	00:18:44,791	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 1.3 secs ]
EDL	00:18:44,791	00:18:48,375	| Kissinger |	the way things have evolved now, it is
EDL	00:18:48,375	00:18:51,666	| Kissinger |	not a simple matter for the United States
EDL	00:18:51,666	00:18:55,708	| Kissinger |	to abandon Taiwan without
EDL	00:18:55,708	00:18:58,375	| Kissinger |	undermining its position elsewhere.

EDL	00:19:02,708	00:19:04,541	| Kissinger |	In dealing with Beijing, the US has

EDL	00:24:25,041	00:24:31,000	| Kissinger |	by Putin. The evolution towards it. I
EDL	00:24:31,000	00:24:33,000	| Kissinger |	thought that the decision

EDL	00:24:43,208	00:24:47,708	| Kissinger |	unwise. Because if you
EDL	00:24:47,708	00:24:49,208	| Kissinger |	looked at it from the Russian
EDL	00:24:49,208	00:24:53,916	| Kissinger |	point of view, in 89 they controlled

EDL	00:25:04,416	00:25:06,083	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 1.7 secs ]
EDL	00:25:06,083	00:25:07,333	| Kissinger |	The only thing that was
EDL	00:25:07,333	00:25:11,291	| Kissinger |	left was a country they always
EDL	00:25:11,291	00:25:17,041	| Kissinger |	considered as the little brother closest
EDL	00:25:17,041	00:25:21,958	| Kissinger |	to them organically or
EDL	00:25:21,958	00:25:25,375	| Kissinger |	historically. And now that is going
EDL	00:25:25,375	00:25:30,416	| Kissinger |	into NATO. So I think for Putin it was a
EDL	00:25:30,416	00:25:33,500	| Kissinger |	final turning point. And
EDL	00:25:33,500	00:25:37,541	| Kissinger |	at that time, Putin was even
EDL	00:25:37,541	00:25:38,083	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:25:38,083	00:25:42,000	| Kissinger |	saying in conversation with me that he
EDL	00:25:42,000	00:25:44,875	| Kissinger |	didn't object to Ukraine
EDL	00:25:44,875	00:25:47,041	| Kissinger |	becoming part of an economic
EDL	00:25:47,041	00:25:52,000	| Kissinger |	system with Europe. And then if you look
EDL	00:25:52,000	00:25:55,625	| Kissinger |	at it last year, he made a
EDL	00:25:55,625	00:25:57,958	| Kissinger |	proposal on long-term NATO

EDL	00:25:59,666	00:26:04,166	| Kissinger |	and we didn't take it seriously. So at
EDL	00:26:04,166	00:26:05,666	| Kissinger |	this point Kissinger restates
EDL	00:26:05,666	00:26:07,375	| Kissinger |	an argument he's made that is
EDL	00:26:07,375	00:26:09,416	| Kissinger |	quite controversial. That it was a
EDL	00:26:09,416	00:26:13,250	| Kissinger |	mistake for NATO in 2008 to
EDL	00:26:13,250	00:26:15,208	| Kissinger |	dangle the possibility of NATO
EDL	00:26:15,208	00:26:17,375	| Kissinger |	membership to Ukraine. It's interesting
EDL	00:26:17,375	00:26:19,416	| Kissinger |	because in offering Ukraine
EDL	00:26:19,416	00:26:21,625	| Kissinger |	membership to NATO, NATO is
EDL	00:26:21,625	00:26:23,416	| Kissinger |	doing something that's bound to anger
EDL	00:26:23,416	00:26:26,125	| Kissinger |	Russia. But at the same time, NATO is not
EDL	00:26:26,125	00:26:27,500	| Kissinger |	really serious about
EDL	00:26:27,500	00:26:29,125	| Kissinger |	the office. So it's not doing anything to
EDL	00:26:29,125	00:26:31,458	| Kissinger |	protect Ukraine. So it's
EDL	00:26:31,458	00:26:32,625	| Kissinger |	just adding to instability.
EDL	00:26:32,625	00:26:36,041	| Kissinger |	So now we're, I don't know, two and a
EDL	00:26:36,041	00:26:37,583	| Kissinger |	half hours into this mammoth

EDL	00:27:07,833	00:27:09,791	| Kissinger |	mean. But quite clearly, Henry Kissinger
EDL	00:27:09,791	00:27:12,375	| Kissinger |	a few years ago decided
EDL	00:27:12,375	00:27:15,291	| Kissinger |	that this new AI technology was
EDL	00:27:15,291	00:27:16,916	| Kissinger |	going to be transformative and has
EDL	00:27:16,916	00:27:18,666	| Kissinger |	already written one book on it, is
EDL	00:27:18,666	00:27:21,041	| Kissinger |	planning another, and sees this
EDL	00:27:21,041	00:27:24,041	| Kissinger |	as one of the great threats facing
EDL	00:27:24,041	00:27:27,250	| Kissinger |	humanity. We may well
EDL	00:27:27,250	00:27:29,250	| Kissinger |	wind up destroying ourselves

EDL	00:27:30,083	00:27:36,041	| Kissinger |	and a point is now quite reachable where

EDL	00:27:48,666	00:27:52,583	| Kissinger |	So you have the risks that come from both

EDL	00:27:55,291	00:27:58,000	| Kissinger |	There are the risks that come from

EDL	00:28:11,416	00:28:13,208	| Kissinger |	I think the technology will

EDL	00:28:16,583	00:28:17,916	| Kissinger |	combined with the other

EDL	00:28:29,750	00:28:31,625	| Kissinger |	Biden and quite possibly

EDL	00:28:40,708	00:28:44,208	| Kissinger |	Yeah, I don't think Biden can supply the

EDL	00:28:47,541	00:28:48,083	| Kissinger |	hoping that the Republicans

EDL	00:29:04,250	00:29:06,333	| Kissinger |	is a total abdication.
EDL	00:29:06,333	00:29:15,458	| Kissinger |	I think in Kissinger's view of
EDL	00:29:15,458	00:29:17,625	| Kissinger |	leadership, a real leader is someone
EDL	00:29:17,625	00:29:20,416	| Kissinger |	who's prepared to face up to the

EDL	00:29:22,875	00:29:24,666	| Kissinger |	themselves or taking false comfort in
EDL	00:29:24,666	00:29:25,500	| Kissinger |	anything. That's a leader
EDL	00:29:25,500	00:29:30,791	| Kissinger |	who does not abdicate responsibility, but seizes it. That's our big challenge. We must serve if we don't, the predictions of failure will be proved true.

EDL	00:32:07,000	00:32:07,916	| Kissinger |	Kissinger set out the

EDL	00:32:17,750	00:32:19,833	| Kissinger |	In the second half, he proposed
EDL	00:32:19,833	00:32:23,125	| Kissinger |	solutions. He started with
EDL	00:32:23,125	00:32:25,000	| Kissinger |	how to rebuild trust between
EDL	00:32:25,000	00:32:33,375	| Kissinger |	Washington and Beijing. I hope that both

EDL	00:32:36,750	00:32:38,500	| Kissinger |	fundamental understanding.
EDL	00:32:38,500	00:32:44,000	| Kissinger |	Traditionally, in diplomacy, settle

EDL	00:32:58,500	00:32:59,750	| Kissinger |	I don't think it will by

EDL	00:33:01,958	00:33:07,750	| Kissinger |	So the key question now is, is it
EDL	00:33:07,750	00:33:09,500	| Kissinger |	possible for China and the
EDL	00:33:09,500	00:33:11,750	| Kissinger |	United States to establish a

EDL	00:33:20,833	00:33:23,750	| Kissinger |	thought that if the two presidents

EDL	00:33:35,750	00:33:36,875	| Kissinger |	let's say the American

EDL	00:33:47,125	00:33:50,791	| Kissinger |	in the sense that we have the

EDL	00:33:57,833	00:34:05,041	| Kissinger |	I think we should agree between ourselves

EDL	00:34:08,791	00:34:14,791	| Kissinger |	We should appoint each of us as more

EDL	00:34:17,625	00:34:19,750	| Kissinger |	these advisors should have

EDL	00:34:29,208	00:34:31,458	| Kissinger |	relatively brief intervals,

EDL	00:34:32,375	00:34:33,833	| Kissinger |	but long enough so that

EDL	00:34:34,166	00:34:40,791	| Kissinger |	And then you and I should meet once or

EDL	00:34:42,416	00:34:44,208	| Kissinger |	to review that agenda.

EDL	00:34:46,166	00:34:47,625	| Kissinger |	He makes it sound very simple, doesn't
EDL	00:34:47,625	00:34:49,708	| Kissinger |	he, Ed? You get the
EDL	00:34:49,708	00:34:50,750	| Kissinger |	two presidents together,
EDL	00:34:50,750	00:34:52,458	| Kissinger |	they agree to meet twice a year, they
EDL	00:34:52,458	00:34:54,375	| Kissinger |	appoint some advisors who also meet
EDL	00:34:54,375	00:34:55,333	| Kissinger |	reasonably regularly,
EDL	00:34:55,333	00:34:56,875	| Kissinger |	and one boom, you've sorted the world
EDL	00:34:56,875	00:34:57,208	| Kissinger |	out. What's very Kissingerian about this proposal is that
EDL	00:34:57,208	00:35:03,250	| Kissinger |	it's a small group of people meeting in

EDL	00:35:05,125	00:35:07,458	| Kissinger |	changing any policy. His time
EDL	00:35:07,458	00:35:09,958	| Kissinger |	in office was marked out by this kind of
EDL	00:35:09,958	00:35:13,166	| Kissinger |	secret diplomacy, where the State
EDL	00:35:13,166	00:35:14,041	| Kissinger |	Department didn't have
EDL	00:35:14,041	00:35:15,791	| Kissinger |	a clue what he was doing as National
EDL	00:35:15,791	00:35:17,541	| Kissinger |	Security Advisor. And it's
EDL	00:35:17,541	00:35:18,750	| Kissinger |	a similar thing, it's a sort

EDL	00:35:22,291	00:35:22,875	| Kissinger |	going. Kissinger, Mark II.
EDL	00:35:22,875	00:35:28,625	| Kissinger |	We saw Kissinger over two days, and
EDL	00:35:28,625	00:35:30,250	| Kissinger |	overnight between the first
EDL	00:35:30,250	00:35:31,458	| Kissinger |	and the second parts of our
EDL	00:35:31,458	00:35:34,166	| Kissinger |	interview, the news broke that Xi Jinping
EDL	00:35:34,166	00:35:37,541	| Kissinger |	had, for the first time and at last,
EDL	00:35:37,541	00:35:38,125	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:35:38,125	00:35:40,166	| Kissinger |	called Volodymy Zelensky, President of
EDL	00:35:40,166	00:35:42,500	| Kissinger |	Ukraine. The Chinese
EDL	00:35:42,500	00:35:43,375	| Kissinger |	have called the Ukrainians,
EDL	00:35:43,375	00:35:53,791	| Kissinger |	and then have begun to be mediators.
EDL	00:35:53,791	00:35:54,208	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:35:54,208	00:35:56,500	| Kissinger |	Exactly. I was going to ask you about it,
EDL	00:35:56,500	00:35:58,250	| Kissinger |	I thought this was exactly the kind of
EDL	00:35:58,250	00:35:59,750	| Kissinger |	thing that you would be recommending.
EDL	00:35:59,750	00:36:01,250	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 1.5 secs ]
EDL	00:36:01,250	00:36:05,916	| Kissinger |	Well, when you read our statements on
EDL	00:36:05,916	00:36:08,291	| Kissinger |	that subject, we say,
EDL	00:36:08,291	00:36:09,583	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 1.3 secs ]
EDL	00:36:09,583	00:36:12,250	| Kissinger |	when will the Chinese wake up
EDL	00:36:12,250	00:36:13,625	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 1.4 secs ]
EDL	00:36:13,625	00:36:17,791	| Kissinger |	and call the Russians aggressors? But
EDL	00:36:17,791	00:36:19,958	| Kissinger |	that's not how the Chinese think.
EDL	00:36:19,958	00:36:21,583	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 1.6 secs ]
EDL	00:36:21,583	00:36:24,625	| Kissinger |	The Chinese don't enter this as moral
EDL	00:36:24,625	00:36:27,833	| Kissinger |	judges. They enter it as an
EDL	00:36:27,833	00:36:30,458	| Kissinger |	expression of their national
EDL	00:36:30,458	00:36:31,041	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:36:31,041	00:36:34,291	| Kissinger |	interest. China does at least want some
EDL	00:36:34,291	00:36:35,250	| Kissinger |	things that Kissinger
EDL	00:36:35,250	00:36:36,541	| Kissinger |	thinks are essential, which is
EDL	00:36:36,541	00:36:38,208	| Kissinger |	Ukraine surviving as an independent
EDL	00:36:38,208	00:36:41,458	| Kissinger |	state, and a downplaying of the nuclear
EDL	00:36:41,458	00:36:43,500	| Kissinger |	threat. But Kissinger's
EDL	00:36:43,500	00:36:47,458	| Kissinger |	analysis here is that China's entry into
EDL	00:36:47,458	00:36:48,625	| Kissinger |	this complicates things,
EDL	00:36:48,625	00:36:49,500	| Kissinger |	and it comes for a number of
EDL	00:36:49,500	00:36:51,500	| Kissinger |	reasons. One is that China's close to
EDL	00:36:51,500	00:36:53,875	| Kissinger |	Russia, and the other is
EDL	00:36:53,875	00:36:55,458	| Kissinger |	that China doesn't want NATO
EDL	00:36:55,458	00:36:58,291	| Kissinger |	expansion. Initially, Kissinger himself
EDL	00:36:58,291	00:37:00,750	| Kissinger |	was against Ukraine joining NATO, but his
EDL	00:37:00,750	00:37:02,125	| Kissinger |	analysis has changed.
EDL	00:37:02,125	00:37:03,166	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]
EDL	00:37:03,166	00:37:07,083	| Kissinger |	So now I'm in the weird position that
EDL	00:37:07,083	00:37:08,875	| Kissinger |	people say, look at him, he's
EDL	00:37:08,875	00:37:10,541	| Kissinger |	changed his mind. Now he's for
EDL	00:37:10,541	00:37:17,958	| Kissinger |	membership of Ukraine and NATO. And my
EDL	00:37:17,958	00:37:20,083	| Kissinger |	reason for that is twofold.
EDL	00:37:20,083	00:37:21,458	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 1.4 secs ]
EDL	00:37:21,458	00:37:25,208	| Kissinger |	One, Russia is no longer the
EDL	00:37:25,208	00:37:29,041	| Kissinger |	conventional threat it used to be. And
EDL	00:37:29,041	00:37:32,625	| Kissinger |	secondly, we have now armed
EDL	00:37:32,625	00:37:37,041	| Kissinger |	Ukraine to a point where it will
EDL	00:37:37,041	00:37:40,875	| Kissinger |	be the best armed, most modern country,
EDL	00:37:40,875	00:37:42,208	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 1.3 secs ]
EDL	00:37:42,208	00:37:42,958	| Kissinger |	and with the least
EDL	00:37:42,958	00:37:46,166	| Kissinger |	experienced leadership in Europe.
EDL	00:37:46,166	00:37:48,916	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 2.8 secs ]
EDL	00:37:48,916	00:37:52,625	| Kissinger |	So for the safety of Europe, it is better
EDL	00:37:52,625	00:37:54,500	| Kissinger |	to have Ukraine and NATO.
EDL	00:37:54,500	00:37:57,166	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 2.7 secs ]
EDL	00:37:57,166	00:37:59,250	| Kissinger |	So your argument for having Ukraine and
EDL	00:37:59,250	00:38:01,791	| Kissinger |	NATO is an argument for
EDL	00:38:01,791	00:38:04,875	| Kissinger |	reducing the risks of Ukraine to
EDL	00:38:04,875	00:38:07,208	| Kissinger |	Europe rather than an argument about the
EDL	00:38:07,208	00:38:10,291	| Kissinger |	defense of Ukraine. No, but
EDL	00:38:10,291	00:38:13,500	| Kissinger |	it's also, we've proved now
EDL	00:38:13,500	00:38:16,500	| Kissinger |	we're going to defend Ukraine. In my
EDL	00:38:16,500	00:38:19,833	| Kissinger |	view, it's madly dangerous because the
EDL	00:38:19,833	00:38:20,791	| Kissinger |	Europeans are saying
EDL	00:38:20,791	00:38:22,666	| Kissinger |	we don't want them in NATO because
EDL	00:38:22,666	00:38:26,041	| Kissinger |	they're too risky. And therefore we'll
EDL	00:38:26,041	00:38:27,375	| Kissinger |	arm the hell out of them
EDL	00:38:27,375	00:38:31,250	| Kissinger |	and give them the most advanced weapons.
EDL	00:38:31,250	00:38:31,750	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:38:31,750	00:38:35,041	| Kissinger |	And how can that possibly work?
EDL	00:38:35,041	00:38:36,583	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 1.5 secs ]
EDL	00:38:36,583	00:38:38,625	| Kissinger |	It's a great power view of the world that
EDL	00:38:38,625	00:38:40,416	| Kissinger |	you hear from Kissinger. I mean, what
EDL	00:38:40,416	00:38:41,708	| Kissinger |	Ukraine itself might
EDL	00:38:41,708	00:38:44,541	| Kissinger |	want is of much less importance to him, I
EDL	00:38:44,541	00:38:45,208	| Kissinger |	think, than how it all
EDL	00:38:45,208	00:38:46,500	| Kissinger |	fits into the big mosaic.
EDL	00:38:46,500	00:38:49,166	| Kissinger |	And all those other countries around
EDL	00:38:49,166	00:38:50,291	| Kissinger |	Europe and other members of
EDL	00:38:50,291	00:38:51,416	| Kissinger |	NATO who have a say in whether
EDL	00:38:51,416	00:38:51,833	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:38:51,833	00:38:55,000	| Kissinger |	Ukraine can join. And actually that also
EDL	00:38:55,000	00:38:56,083	| Kissinger |	goes for the other point
EDL	00:38:56,083	00:38:57,833	| Kissinger |	that Kissinger was keen to
EDL	00:38:57,833	00:39:00,916	| Kissinger |	underline, which is that Russia needs to
EDL	00:39:00,916	00:39:02,500	| Kissinger |	be welcomed back into
EDL	00:39:02,500	00:39:06,500	| Kissinger |	Europe. It's not wise for us to say
EDL	00:39:06,500	00:39:07,125	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:39:07,125	00:39:11,708	| Kissinger |	we want to split them from China, but
EDL	00:39:11,708	00:39:13,750	| Kissinger |	it's something which
EDL	00:39:13,750	00:39:15,583	| Kissinger |	we should have in mind.
EDL	00:39:15,583	00:39:15,916	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:39:15,916	00:39:20,875	| Kissinger |	And the prerequisite for it is to give
EDL	00:39:20,875	00:39:22,666	| Kissinger |	Russia, first of all, not to
EDL	00:39:22,666	00:39:25,041	| Kissinger |	destroy it totally in the war.

EDL	00:39:27,250	00:39:33,750	| Kissinger |	And after the war, to declare its

EDL	00:39:35,708	00:39:37,750	| Kissinger |	an important objective.

EDL	00:40:11,208	00:40:13,541	| Kissinger |	on domestic factors, on political

EDL	00:44:07,625	00:44:09,750	| Kissinger |	talks were stalled. The next
EDL	00:44:09,750	00:44:11,958	| Kissinger |	day Hanoi was bombed, the French embassy
EDL	00:44:11,958	00:44:13,083	| Kissinger |	was bombed. Fortunately
EDL	00:44:13,083	00:44:14,125	| Kissinger |	it was the French embassy
EDL	00:44:14,125	00:44:15,625	| Kissinger |	because had it not been the French

EDL	00:44:22,166	00:44:23,458	| Kissinger |	debate what impact the
EDL	00:44:23,458	00:44:25,000	| Kissinger |	bombing in Cambodia had on the
EDL	00:44:25,000	00:44:27,250	| Kissinger |	course of the war in Vietnam. But for
EDL	00:44:27,250	00:44:29,416	| Kissinger |	Cambodia, it contributed to instability
EDL	00:44:29,416	00:44:31,375	| Kissinger |	and energized a violent
EDL	00:44:31,375	00:44:33,708	| Kissinger |	revolutionary faction, fueling a bloody
EDL	00:44:33,708	00:44:36,125	| Kissinger |	civil war. The extent and
EDL	00:44:36,125	00:44:37,291	| Kissinger |	timing of the bombing would
EDL	00:44:37,291	00:44:39,625	| Kissinger |	eventually become public, along with the
EDL	00:44:39,625	00:44:41,125	| Kissinger |	exposure of another case of
EDL	00:44:41,125	00:44:42,583	| Kissinger |	deception at the heart of the

EDL	00:44:53,958	00:44:55,750	| Kissinger |	period, Ed, I think was the
EDL	00:44:55,750	00:44:58,916	| Kissinger |	period that crystallized in the public
EDL	00:44:58,916	00:45:02,125	| Kissinger |	the polarizing nature of
EDL	00:45:02,125	00:45:04,250	| Kissinger |	Henry Kissinger and the
EDL	00:45:04,250	00:45:06,625	| Kissinger |	sense that the US lost track of its
EDL	00:45:06,625	00:45:08,625	| Kissinger |	values at what made America
EDL	00:45:08,625	00:45:10,333	| Kissinger |	exceptional. But that's an
EDL	00:45:10,333	00:45:11,333	| Kissinger |	assessment I think that Henry Kissinger
EDL	00:45:11,333	00:45:13,041	| Kissinger |	would balk at. Kissinger
EDL	00:45:13,041	00:45:14,583	| Kissinger |	thought that America was in
EDL	00:45:14,583	00:45:16,958	| Kissinger |	terrible decline at the beginning of the
EDL	00:45:16,958	00:45:19,458	| Kissinger |	70s and Nixon's foreign
EDL	00:45:19,458	00:45:21,791	| Kissinger |	policy doctrine was one of living

EDL	00:45:24,416	00:45:26,333	| Kissinger |	US. And there's something
EDL	00:45:26,333	00:45:29,375	| Kissinger |	similar today, I think, in that
EDL	00:45:29,375	00:45:31,041	| Kissinger |	case, Kissinger thinks the US has to take
EDL	00:45:31,041	00:45:33,083	| Kissinger |	a hard-nosed calculation
EDL	00:45:33,083	00:45:35,375	| Kissinger |	about what is in its interests.

EDL	00:45:47,250	00:45:49,000	| Kissinger |	to bring China into

EDL	00:46:03,125	00:46:06,833	| Kissinger |	have to relearn their own domestic

EDL	00:46:24,250	00:46:27,000	| Kissinger |	surely America's values impose

EDL	00:46:39,375	00:46:42,458	| Kissinger |	this as a universal principle that you

EDL	00:47:43,083	00:47:45,000	| Kissinger |	totally agree that there needs

EDL	00:47:51,000	00:47:53,875	| Kissinger |	as I think the US did with some, for

EDL	00:47:58,000	00:48:00,958	| Kissinger |	Nonetheless, it's felt to me that where

EDL	00:48:04,500	00:48:07,958	| Kissinger |	too pragmatic, too realpolitik for my

EDL	00:48:12,166	00:48:14,083	| Kissinger |	To me, it's the big question in the next
EDL	00:48:14,083	00:48:15,791	| Kissinger |	20 or 30 years is how
EDL	00:48:15,791	00:48:17,291	| Kissinger |	that's struck. I mean,
EDL	00:48:17,291	00:48:17,666	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:48:17,666	00:48:20,208	| Kissinger |	we've been living for the past 30 years
EDL	00:48:20,208	00:48:22,041	| Kissinger |	through a period in which,
EDL	00:48:22,041	00:48:23,291	| Kissinger |	you know, for most of that
EDL	00:48:23,291	00:48:24,666	| Kissinger |	American power is completely
EDL	00:48:24,666	00:48:27,500	| Kissinger |	unchallenged. And it was possible for the
EDL	00:48:27,500	00:48:28,791	| Kissinger |	West to make conditions.
EDL	00:48:28,791	00:48:32,000	| Kissinger |	But it hasn't worked terribly well. If
EDL	00:48:32,000	00:48:33,833	| Kissinger |	you look at the global
EDL	00:48:33,833	00:48:35,791	| Kissinger |	south and its response to

EDL	00:48:36,166	00:48:39,250	| Kissinger |	calls to condemn the invasion of Ukraine
EDL	00:48:39,250	00:48:41,125	| Kissinger |	by Russia, well, actually,
EDL	00:48:41,125	00:48:41,541	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:48:41,541	00:48:42,833	| Kissinger |	people say, no, you know,
EDL	00:48:42,833	00:48:44,208	| Kissinger |	what we think the West are hypocrites and
EDL	00:48:44,208	00:48:45,666	| Kissinger |	we're not inclined to join
EDL	00:48:45,666	00:48:47,833	| Kissinger |	their side. So where Kissinger
EDL	00:48:47,833	00:48:49,958	| Kissinger |	just hits something right is that we have
EDL	00:48:49,958	00:48:51,041	| Kissinger |	to be sure that those
EDL	00:48:51,041	00:48:53,208	| Kissinger |	policies are actually designed
EDL	00:48:53,208	00:48:54,916	| Kissinger |	to bring about change for the better,
EDL	00:48:54,916	00:48:56,458	| Kissinger |	rather than just to solve
EDL	00:48:56,458	00:48:58,041	| Kissinger |	our own consciences while

EDL	00:49:01,875	00:49:02,791	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]
EDL	00:49:02,791	00:49:03,833	| Kissinger |	That's certainly clear. It's been the
EDL	00:49:03,833	00:49:05,916	| Kissinger |	basis for much perfectly reasonable
EDL	00:49:05,916	00:49:08,416	| Kissinger |	accusation of hypocrisy. But what really
EDL	00:49:08,416	00:49:10,750	| Kissinger |	matters is how you ensure

EDL	00:49:12,083	00:49:13,500	| Kissinger |	effective, because I think we can all

EDL	00:49:22,833	00:49:24,791	| Kissinger |	very down on the prospect of American
EDL	00:49:24,791	00:49:28,000	| Kissinger |	leadership. But what I don't want to do
EDL	00:49:28,000	00:49:29,458	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 1.5 secs ]
EDL	00:49:29,458	00:49:33,083	| Kissinger |	is to sound pessimistic. You're doing a
EDL	00:49:33,083	00:49:34,708	| Kissinger |	very bad job in that case.
EDL	00:49:34,708	00:49:35,458	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	00:49:35,458	00:49:39,458	| Kissinger |	Because I know I'm doing a bit. This is a
EDL	00:49:39,458	00:49:40,791	| Kissinger |	problem that has to be
EDL	00:49:40,791	00:49:44,000	| Kissinger |	solved. And I believe
EDL	00:49:44,000	00:49:44,875	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]
EDL	00:49:44,875	00:49:48,541	| Kissinger |	I've spent my life trying to deal with
EDL	00:49:48,541	00:49:52,666	| Kissinger |	it. It's not a problem
EDL	00:49:52,666	00:49:54,583	| Kissinger |	easily solved right now.
EDL	00:49:54,583	00:49:55,916	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 1.3 secs ]
EDL	00:49:55,916	00:49:57,958	| Kissinger |	And I don't necessarily know
EDL	00:49:57,958	00:49:59,458	| Kissinger |	how it's going to be solved.
EDL	00:49:59,458	00:50:01,291	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 1.8 secs ]
EDL	00:50:01,291	00:50:03,458	| Kissinger |	Normally, when you talk to people about
EDL	00:50:03,458	00:50:06,666	| Kissinger |	global affairs and foreign policy,
EDL	00:50:06,666	00:50:09,125	| Kissinger |	they're very strong on the analysis and
EDL	00:50:09,125	00:50:10,625	| Kissinger |	quite weak on the
EDL	00:50:10,625	00:50:12,541	| Kissinger |	prescriptions. And Kissinger
EDL	00:50:12,541	00:50:13,208	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]
EDL	00:50:13,208	00:50:17,333	| Kissinger |	actually, he brought to bear a lifetime's
EDL	00:50:17,333	00:50:18,916	| Kissinger |	thought on these issues.
EDL	00:50:18,916	00:50:19,541	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:50:19,541	00:50:20,500	| Kissinger |	And it's a thought that has a
EDL	00:50:20,500	00:50:22,625	| Kissinger |	new relevance today, because we are at a
EDL	00:50:22,625	00:50:24,208	| Kissinger |	particularly perilous
EDL	00:50:24,208	00:50:26,333	| Kissinger |	moment. And for those
EDL	00:50:26,333	00:50:28,333	| Kissinger |	who think that Kissinger is just a
EDL	00:50:28,333	00:50:30,000	| Kissinger |	warmonger, what was
EDL	00:50:30,000	00:50:31,708	| Kissinger |	interesting was that a lot of these
EDL	00:50:31,708	00:50:33,125	| Kissinger |	thoughts were brought to bear on how to
EDL	00:50:33,125	00:50:34,833	| Kissinger |	bring about peace, how to
EDL	00:50:34,833	00:50:36,500	| Kissinger |	lower the tensions, how to
EDL	00:50:36,500	00:50:39,291	| Kissinger |	make the world safer. They weren't about
EDL	00:50:39,291	00:50:41,125	| Kissinger |	going ahead and
EDL	00:50:41,125	00:50:43,125	| Kissinger |	blithely fighting wars and
EDL	00:50:43,125	00:50:45,208	| Kissinger |	bombing Cambodia. They were quite
EDL	00:50:45,208	00:50:47,208	| Kissinger |	different from the Kissinger that most
EDL	00:50:47,208	00:50:48,291	| Kissinger |	people have in their mind.

EDL	00:50:49,000	00:50:50,250	| Kissinger |	And at the end of our many,
EDL	00:50:50,250	00:50:51,666	| Kissinger |	many hours of conversation,
EDL	00:50:51,666	00:50:52,458	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	00:50:52,458	00:50:53,875	| Kissinger |	Kissinger went back to a philosopher he
EDL	00:50:53,875	00:50:54,541	| Kissinger |	decided in his
EDL	00:50:54,541	00:50:57,125	| Kissinger |	undergraduate thesis, Immanuel Kant.
EDL	00:50:57,125	00:51:02,750	| Kissinger |	I don't compare myself with Immanuel
EDL	00:51:02,750	00:51:05,000	| Kissinger |	Kant, but Kant in his
EDL	00:51:05,000	00:51:07,375	| Kissinger |	essay on universal peace said
EDL	00:51:07,375	00:51:10,541	| Kissinger |	peace will come about in one of two ways,
EDL	00:51:10,541	00:51:11,291	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	00:51:11,291	00:51:13,625	| Kissinger |	either through human understanding

EDL	00:51:15,125	00:51:18,041	| Kissinger |	or through catastrophes of a magnitude
EDL	00:51:18,041	00:51:20,708	| Kissinger |	that impale human understanding.

EDL	00:51:21,291	00:51:26,708	| Kissinger |	And he didn't say which he thought it
EDL	00:51:26,708	00:51:28,458	| Kissinger |	could come about by reason,
EDL	00:51:28,458	00:51:29,791	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 1.3 secs ]
EDL	00:51:29,791	00:51:32,958	| Kissinger |	but he didn't guarantee it.
EDL	00:51:32,958	00:51:33,666	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]
EDL	00:51:33,666	00:51:37,875	| Kissinger |	For almost 100 years, you've been in a

EDL	00:51:40,916	00:51:44,708	| Kissinger |	progress has been made. But after some
EDL	00:51:44,708	00:51:45,250	| Kissinger |	very terrible period.
EDL	00:51:45,250	00:51:46,250	| Kissinger |	[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]
EDL	00:51:46,250	00:51:49,458	| Kissinger |	After some very terrible periods. Now, as

EDL	00:52:02,375	00:52:09,208	| Kissinger |	Look, my life has been difficult, but it
EDL	00:52:09,208	00:52:11,041	| Kissinger |	keeps ground for optimism.
EDL	00:52:11,041	00:52:16,583	| Kissinger |	I think to inspire the young generation,
EDL	00:52:16,583	00:52:22,666	| Kissinger |	they need a demonstration of
