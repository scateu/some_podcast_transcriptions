EDL	00:01:53,408	00:01:55,200	| IOT091 |	Which is not
EDL	00:01:55,712	00:01:56,480	| IOT091 |	Despite the fact
EDL	00:01:56,480	00:01:58,784	| IOT091 |	Next Bachelor
EDL	00:01:58,784	00:01:59,552	| IOT091 |	Police
EDL	00:01:59,552	00:02:02,112	| IOT091 |	In Arkansas
EDL	00:02:02,624	00:02:03,904	| IOT091 |	Walmart Walmart
EDL	00:02:05,184	00:02:05,696	| IOT091 |	For data
EDL	00:02:09,792	00:02:15,424	| IOT091 |	Yeah well this is only a matter of time and then anything that captures information recordings and such
EDL	00:02:15,936	00:02:17,728	| IOT091 |	It's likely to be
EDL	00:02:17,728	00:02:19,008	| IOT091 |	Subpoena door
EDL	00:02:19,008	00:02:20,032	| IOT091 |	Requested
EDL	00:02:20,032	00:02:21,312	| IOT091 |	DL warrant
EDL	00:02:21,312	00:02:24,640	| IOT091 |	This if I read correctly was unfortunate you know a murder case
EDL	00:02:25,152	00:02:25,920	| IOT091 |	It is
EDL	00:02:25,920	00:02:28,736	| IOT091 |	The information which actually found this
EDL	00:02:28,736	00:02:30,016	| IOT091 |	Story first
EDL	00:02:30,016	00:02:32,064	| IOT091 |	Amazon Echo in the hot tub
EDL	00:02:32,576	00:02:33,600	| IOT091 |	Which I have to say
EDL	00:02:34,368	00:02:35,136	| IOT091 |	Good headlines
EDL	00:02:36,928	00:02:39,744	| IOT091 |	So what happened is the police
EDL	00:02:39,744	00:02:42,048	| IOT091 |	A gentleman named Bates is a suspect
EDL	00:02:42,560	00:02:43,328	| IOT091 |	James and Ruby
EDL	00:02:44,352	00:02:45,120	| IOT091 |	Which is really on
EDL	00:02:46,144	00:02:48,192	| IOT091 |	I'm in the police are looking for
EDL	00:02:48,192	00:02:52,800	| IOT091 |	Any audio recordings from the echo that he had and he also actually
EDL	00:02:53,312	00:02:55,104	| IOT091 |	Had several other smart device
EDL	00:02:55,104	00:02:56,384	| IOT091 |	Vices
EDL	00:02:56,384	00:03:00,992	| IOT091 |	Pizza set to go to trial for the first-degree murder of a man named Victor Collins
EDL	00:03:01,760	00:03:06,624	| IOT091 |	And what they're arguing they're looking actually not for like the murder caught on tape
EDL	00:03:07,136	00:03:08,416	| IOT091 |	But understanding
EDL	00:03:08,416	00:03:10,464	| IOT091 |	Who was in the House basic
EDL	00:03:10,464	00:03:12,768	| IOT091 |	Looking for voices that were in the house
EDL	00:03:12,768	00:03:13,280	| IOT091 |	At the time
EDL	00:03:13,792	00:03:17,120	| IOT091 |	Interest so Amazon didn't get the police any information
EDL	00:03:17,120	00:03:21,216	| IOT091 |	Did the echo dog down its servers but it did Handover Bates Account Details In purchases
EDL	00:03:21,984	00:03:24,544	| IOT091 |	Police say they were able to pull some data off the speaker
EDL	00:03:25,056	00:03:27,872	| IOT091 |	So they were able to access physical data from the
EDL	00:03:28,384	00:03:28,896	| IOT091 |	The device
EDL	00:03:32,480	00:03:38,624	| IOT091 |	Confiscated yeah that that's correct him and my guess is the because you have control over those recordings of Snippets
EDL	00:03:39,648	00:03:41,184	| IOT091 |	After you say the Wake word
EDL	00:03:41,184	00:03:46,048	| IOT091 |	Those are all saved for an indeterminate amount of time but you can go and delete them
EDL	00:03:46,560	00:03:48,352	| IOT091 |	Obviously this person did not
EDL	00:03:48,352	00:03:49,888	| IOT091 |	Do that mean who would you know
EDL	00:03:50,400	00:03:53,984	| IOT091 |	Honestly really premeditated everything
EDL	00:03:58,848	00:04:02,176	| IOT091 |	That's good to know I'm glad you're taking care of
EDL	00:04:03,712	00:04:04,736	| IOT091 |	Yeah
EDL	00:04:04,736	00:04:08,064	| IOT091 |	My understanding is that Amazon felt that the
EDL	00:04:08,576	00:04:10,624	| IOT091 |	Warrant request was too broad
EDL	00:04:10,624	00:04:12,160	| IOT091 |	To actually hand over everything
EDL	00:04:12,672	00:04:14,208	| IOT091 |	Including the recordings
EDL	00:04:14,208	00:04:14,720	| IOT091 |	Yes
EDL	00:04:15,488	00:04:16,256	| IOT091 |	What was
EDL	00:04:17,024	00:04:21,631	| IOT091 |	And I know that the echo is like everybody's focused on that and it is
EDL	00:04:21,631	00:04:23,167	| IOT091 |	Voice at scary
EDL	00:04:23,167	00:04:27,775	| IOT091 |	Police also say that Bates had other smart home devices including
EDL	00:04:28,287	00:04:29,311	| IOT091 |	A water meter
EDL	00:04:29,823	00:04:34,431	| IOT091 |	And that show that 140 gallons of water were used between 1 a.m. and 3 a.m.
EDL	00:04:34,943	00:04:37,503	| IOT091 |	The night that Collins was found dead in Bates hot tub
EDL	00:04:38,015	00:04:42,367	| IOT091 |	Yeah that's probably more of the cortical Smoking Gun if anything
EDL	00:04:43,391	00:04:44,159	| IOT091 |	Still
EDL	00:04:44,159	00:04:45,183	| IOT091 |	Stantial
EDL	00:04:45,183	00:04:46,463	| IOT091 |	Yes
EDL	00:04:46,463	00:04:47,999	| IOT091 |	I'm sure he's going to be asked
EDL	00:04:47,999	00:04:54,399	| IOT091 |	Simcorp what did you do with Outer 40 oz of water between 1 a.m. and 3 a.m. and specially if that coincides with it
EDL	00:04:54,399	00:04:55,935	| IOT091 |	What time of death and so on so
EDL	00:04:55,935	00:04:58,495	| IOT091 |	Is there a useful information for the
EDL	00:04:58,495	00:05:00,031	| IOT091 |	Prosecution
EDL	00:05:00,031	00:05:02,335	| IOT091 |	And I would not have thought
EDL	00:05:02,335	00:05:05,663	| IOT091 |	That my Smart Water since I don't have one but if I had one
EDL	00:05:06,175	00:05:09,759	| IOT091 |	Deck that could be used against me you just a water sensor like
EDL	00:05:10,527	00:05:11,551	| IOT091 |	Wrightwood
EDL	00:05:12,319	00:05:13,087	| IOT091 |	Beautiful format
EDL	00:05:14,367	00:05:14,879	| IOT091 |	Well
EDL	00:05:17,695	00:05:21,535	| IOT091 |	I am not let's make that very clear right now on the air
EDL	00:05:21,535	00:05:24,607	| IOT091 |	So I will say in this sounds really creeptastic
EDL	00:05:24,607	00:05:26,911	| IOT091 |	Behavior but when I am away from town
EDL	00:05:27,423	00:05:28,959	| IOT091 |	Sometimes I look in
EDL	00:05:29,727	00:05:34,847	| IOT091 |	At the sensors in my house so I look at my Nest Thermostat I can't even look at like I have
EDL	00:05:34,847	00:05:36,895	| IOT091 |	Devices that measure sound in my house
EDL	00:05:37,919	00:05:42,271	| IOT091 |	When I can look at that and I can see like oh this is my family talking at The Breakfast Table
EDL	00:05:42,783	00:05:44,575	| IOT091 |	You know cuz you can see this biking
EDL	00:05:45,343	00:05:46,623	| IOT091 |	Decibels right
EDL	00:05:46,623	00:05:48,415	| IOT091 |	If you have a humidity meter
EDL	00:05:48,415	00:05:52,767	| IOT091 |	You know in your house you can actually see when people have someone is taking a shower because the humidity rise
EDL	00:05:52,767	00:05:53,791	| IOT091 |	Isis
EDL	00:05:54,303	00:05:56,095	| IOT091 |	People may not be aware of it but
EDL	00:05:56,607	00:05:58,655	| IOT091 |	And it is kind of creepy that I'm like
EDL	00:05:59,167	00:06:03,263	| IOT091 |	I miss my family let me go look in the blinds are open they must be awake
EDL	00:06:05,823	00:06:11,967	| IOT091 |	No it's actually it really illustrates that by understanding what's going on inside the privacy of your own home
EDL	00:06:12,991	00:06:17,343	| IOT091 |	You can actually piece together what is going on right you totally can in
EDL	00:06:17,855	00:06:21,183	| IOT091 |	I have motion sensors for example on a bathroom light
EDL	00:06:21,183	00:06:23,487	| IOT091 |	And you know that motion sensor goes off in
EDL	00:06:23,999	00:06:25,279	| IOT091 |	I know someone has
EDL	00:06:26,303	00:06:28,351	| IOT091 |	Walked in at least and then walked out of the bathroom
EDL	00:06:28,863	00:06:29,887	| IOT091 |	Aunt
EDL	00:06:29,887	00:06:30,655	| IOT091 |	The closet or the laundry
EDL	00:06:31,167	00:06:31,679	| IOT091 |	So
EDL	00:06:32,447	00:06:34,239	| IOT091 |	People may not be aware and it's
EDL	00:06:34,239	00:06:35,775	| IOT091 |	It's fine because it's
EDL	00:06:36,287	00:06:37,311	| IOT091 |	Private butt
EDL	00:06:37,311	00:06:41,663	| IOT091 |	What people don't necessarily understand is some of these privacy policies
EDL	00:06:41,663	00:06:45,503	| IOT091 |	May make that information public and it is easy to piece together this
EDL	00:06:46,527	00:06:51,391	| IOT091 |	And part of me says that this is just an extension of the date of this already available
EDL	00:06:51,391	00:06:53,439	| IOT091 |	Through traditional smartphone usage
EDL	00:06:53,439	00:06:54,719	| IOT091 |	You know where you are
EDL	00:06:54,719	00:06:56,511	| IOT091 |	What you're connecting to
EDL	00:06:56,511	00:06:59,327	| IOT091 |	When you were out of place who you talkin to
EDL	00:07:01,119	00:07:04,191	| IOT091 |	It does because now your instrumenting so many different
EDL	00:07:04,191	00:07:05,727	| IOT091 |	Other physical thing
EDL	00:07:06,495	00:07:12,127	| IOT091 |	And that can get in when you take the Telemetry data from all those things you can really piece together
EDL	00:07:12,639	00:07:16,479	| IOT091 |	Timelines of actions and locations
EDL	00:07:16,479	00:07:17,759	| IOT091 |	Far more
EDL	00:07:17,759	00:07:18,527	| IOT091 |	Accurately
EDL	00:07:19,039	00:07:22,367	| IOT091 |	And in the case of Christmas I'm going to let you guys know that you know
EDL	00:07:22,879	00:07:24,159	| IOT091 |	After we installed Arkin
EDL	00:07:24,159	00:07:25,439	| IOT091 |	Connected doorbell cameras
EDL	00:07:25,439	00:07:27,743	| IOT091 |	I realize this was a side benefit but
EDL	00:07:28,255	00:07:30,303	| IOT091 |	When people are walking up the stairs with
EDL	00:07:30,303	00:07:31,839	| IOT091 |	Your Christmas presents like they're about to
EDL	00:07:31,839	00:07:32,607	| IOT091 |	To wrap them
EDL	00:07:32,607	00:07:33,887	| IOT091 |	You can actually see them
EDL	00:07:33,887	00:07:34,655	| IOT091 |	Doorbell camera
EDL	00:07:37,215	00:07:39,519	| IOT091 |	The point we're making here is
EDL	00:07:39,519	00:07:45,151	| IOT091 |	It's light and fun baby when it's you looking in on your family and everyone is aware of these things
EDL	00:07:45,663	00:07:47,199	| IOT091 |	But this is information that
EDL	00:07:48,479	00:07:49,247	| IOT091 |	Part of your digitalfit
EDL	00:07:50,015	00:07:50,783	| IOT091 |	Redis
EDL	00:07:50,783	00:07:52,319	| IOT091 |	And if we don't have
EDL	00:07:52,319	00:07:55,391	| IOT091 |	A real clear understanding of how laws are going to
EDL	00:07:55,391	00:07:56,415	| IOT091 |	Protect that we're not
EDL	00:07:57,183	00:07:57,951	| IOT091 |	So
EDL	00:07:57,951	00:07:59,231	| IOT091 |	This cases
EDL	00:07:59,231	00:07:59,999	| IOT091 |	You know
EDL	00:07:59,999	00:08:06,143	| IOT091 |	A really good example and you know the attorney for Bates is arguing that this is private information so we'll see what happens
EDL	00:08:06,143	00:08:09,215	| IOT091 |	I want to follow what happens with this because I do want to
EDL	00:08:09,215	00:08:10,239	| IOT091 |	See what how
EDL	00:08:10,239	00:08:13,567	| IOT091 |	The Court's address the Privacy Issue Number 1
EDL	00:08:13,567	00:08:15,615	| IOT091 |	But I would hope that people
EDL	00:08:16,383	00:08:22,783	| IOT091 |	Listen to show or just aren't interested in IRT don't just say I'm not going to do any smart all morality stuff
EDL	00:08:22,783	00:08:23,295	| IOT091 |	Because
EDL	00:08:23,807	00:08:28,415	| IOT091 |	Look what can happen if these are simply tools and just like any tool how you use
EDL	00:08:29,439	00:08:30,463	| IOT091 |	And what's your doing
EDL	00:08:31,231	00:08:34,047	| IOT091 |	Tools themselves are not inherently bad as what
EDL	00:08:34,047	00:08:34,559	| IOT091 |	What I want to get at
EDL	00:08:35,071	00:08:36,351	| IOT091 |	Yes and I think
EDL	00:08:36,863	00:08:40,959	| IOT091 |	To me because there's so many benefits of having this information
EDL	00:08:40,959	00:08:42,751	| IOT091 |	This is really a wake-up call
EDL	00:08:42,751	00:08:43,519	| IOT091 |	Or
EDL	00:08:43,519	00:08:45,823	| IOT091 |	Consumers and the industry to
EDL	00:08:46,335	00:08:47,871	| IOT091 |	Actually start thinking
EDL	00:08:47,871	00:08:48,639	| IOT091 |	About
EDL	00:08:48,639	00:08:49,151	| IOT091 |	Privacy
EDL	00:08:50,431	00:08:51,967	| IOT091 |	And how do we want to regulate
EDL	00:08:51,967	00:08:56,319	| IOT091 |	Because we can't just say we'll figure it out regulation will come eventually
EDL	00:08:56,319	00:08:58,879	| IOT091 |	Because right now I'm having his regulations going to come
EDL	00:08:58,879	00:08:59,647	| IOT091 |	Quartz
EDL	00:08:59,647	00:09:00,671	| IOT091 |	And that's always real
EDL	00:09:01,695	00:09:02,207	| IOT091 |	Elation
EDL	00:09:02,719	00:09:04,255	| IOT091 |	So that's our thoughts here
EDL	00:09:04,767	00:09:06,303	| IOT091 |	Kevin has exciting news
EDL	00:09:06,303	00:09:07,583	| IOT091 |	We should note
EDL	00:09:07,583	00:09:08,095	| IOT091 |	Kevin works
EDL	00:09:09,375	00:09:09,887	| IOT091 |	Baidu
EDL	00:09:12,191	00:09:17,567	| IOT091 |	That's correct and this is not internal information which obviously I wouldn't have no could I share
EDL	00:09:17,567	00:09:22,175	| IOT091 |	There's some information from The Verge who Intergroup interview Jeff Chang
EDL	00:09:22,175	00:09:26,527	| IOT091 |	The product manager of Android Wear at Google so we'll talk wearables for a few seconds here
EDL	00:09:27,295	00:09:31,647	| IOT091 |	The folks who can't follow the Android Wear platform
EDL	00:09:32,159	00:09:34,719	| IOT091 |	He probably already knows about recap real quick that
EDL	00:09:34,719	00:09:38,559	| IOT091 |	It's been several developer previews of Android Wear 2.0
EDL	00:09:38,559	00:09:39,839	| IOT091 |	Over the past
EDL	00:09:39,839	00:09:43,167	| IOT091 |	Toss a 6-7 months and
EDL	00:09:43,167	00:09:49,567	| IOT091 |	The final version of Android Wear 200 is expected in 2017 will all along with that software
EDL	00:09:49,567	00:09:55,711	| IOT091 |	Jeff Chang is told of hers there will be two new flagship smart watches in the first quarter of 2017
EDL	00:09:56,223	00:09:57,247	| IOT091 |	From Google
EDL	00:09:57,247	00:10:02,111	| IOT091 |	They probably would have assumed similar to the Nexus and pixel devices where
EDL	00:10:02,879	00:10:03,903	| IOT091 |	Hardware is
EDL	00:10:03,903	00:10:05,439	| IOT091 |	Me to showcase the software
EDL	00:10:05,951	00:10:08,511	| IOT091 |	Interesting ladies will not be
EDL	00:10:08,511	00:10:11,583	| IOT091 |	Branded Google or pixel which is the new
EDL	00:10:11,583	00:10:13,119	| IOT091 |	Google Hardware branding
EDL	00:10:13,119	00:10:15,679	| IOT091 |	Which is kind of surprising to me
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:16,191	| IOT091 |	Together
EDL	00:10:16,703	00:10:20,543	| IOT091 |	Yeah I don't understand that so I mean there's so many
EDL	00:10:20,543	00:10:22,079	| IOT091 |	Harbor partners that
EDL	00:10:22,079	00:10:26,431	| IOT091 |	I've created Android Wear watches so I presume one of them will partner with us and it will be
EDL	00:10:26,431	00:10:29,503	| IOT091 |	There branding on back of Union Motorola LG
EDL	00:10:30,271	00:10:32,063	| IOT091 |	Casio polar
EDL	00:10:32,063	00:10:38,463	| IOT091 |	HTC Huawei a sus a whole bunch of folks have partnered so I don't know who the part
EDL	00:10:38,463	00:10:41,023	| IOT091 |	There isn't an Jeff Chang did not say who it will be but
EDL	00:10:41,535	00:10:43,839	| IOT091 |	It'll be interesting to see what
EDL	00:10:43,839	00:10:49,983	| IOT091 |	Hardware showcases the software is as I said before so we'll find out early in the first quarter of 2017
EDL	00:10:51,263	00:10:52,031	| IOT091 |	Okay
EDL	00:10:52,031	00:10:53,567	| IOT091 |	What are the features that you feel like
EDL	00:10:54,335	00:10:55,359	| IOT091 |	You're the smart watch
EDL	00:10:57,407	00:11:00,223	| IOT091 |	Way too many of them
EDL	00:11:00,223	00:11:03,551	| IOT091 |	What are the features that you're like
EDL	00:11:03,551	00:11:05,087	| IOT091 |	If you are going to play in this area
EDL	00:11:05,855	00:11:06,367	| IOT091 |	Unitus
EDL	00:11:06,879	00:11:10,207	| IOT091 |	Table Stakes on a smartwatch these days are obviously the time
EDL	00:11:10,719	00:11:14,047	| IOT091 |	Smartphone notifications Rich notifications that you can interact with
EDL	00:11:14,815	00:11:21,215	| IOT091 |	Very contextual notifications that we get today from a Google Now for example Siri does this to a
EDL	00:11:21,215	00:11:23,007	| IOT091 |	Small smaller or lesser extent
EDL	00:11:23,519	00:11:25,567	| IOT091 |	APA contextual notifications are important
EDL	00:11:26,079	00:11:29,407	| IOT091 |	AI Voice Assistant type thing so I
EDL	00:11:29,407	00:11:30,943	| IOT091 |	Presuming I do not know
EDL	00:11:30,943	00:11:32,735	| IOT091 |	I'm just answering your question
EDL	00:11:32,735	00:11:34,527	| IOT091 |	I would hope to see
EDL	00:11:34,527	00:11:35,551	| IOT091 |	Google Assistant
EDL	00:11:36,063	00:11:37,087	| IOT091 |	Which is
EDL	00:11:37,087	00:11:41,951	| IOT091 |	Davi rebranded Google now that's in Google home for example and on the pixel phones
EDL	00:11:41,951	00:11:45,791	| IOT091 |	I would expect to see that in a flagship Google Android Wear device
EDL	00:11:46,303	00:11:47,327	| IOT091 |	And then
EDL	00:11:47,327	00:11:50,911	| IOT091 |	Sensors for your exercise and health tracking
EDL	00:11:51,423	00:11:57,823	| IOT091 |	Are important to me I mean percentile so I can see GPS because I run with just a watch and listen to music through Bluetooth so
EDL	00:11:57,823	00:12:00,127	| IOT091 |	So I wouldn't say that
EDL	00:12:00,127	00:12:01,151	| IOT091 |	I must have
EDL	00:12:01,151	00:12:02,431	| IOT091 |	Those are the
EDL	00:12:02,431	00:12:03,199	| IOT091 |	Key
EDL	00:12:03,199	00:12:04,479	| IOT091 |	Things I would like to say
EDL	00:12:05,503	00:12:06,015	| IOT091 |	I would like it to be
EDL	00:12:10,111	00:12:10,623	| IOT091 |	But that's just
EDL	00:12:11,903	00:12:12,927	| IOT091 |	Evans like I want
EDL	00:12:13,951	00:12:14,975	| IOT091 |	No no no no no
EDL	00:12:15,743	00:12:21,887	| IOT091 |	There are many SmartWatches that I bought are not very pretty and some that I really like the design of
EDL	00:12:21,887	00:12:23,423	| IOT091 |	With apple you get
EDL	00:12:23,935	00:12:26,495	| IOT091 |	1 basic look and you can customize
EDL	00:12:26,495	00:12:27,263	| IOT091 |	With color War
EDL	00:12:27,775	00:12:28,287	| IOT091 |	Bands
EDL	00:12:28,799	00:12:34,431	| IOT091 |	With Android where they're actually you do have a very wise choice and get a Michael Kors Smartwatch for example that
EDL	00:12:34,943	00:12:40,063	| IOT091 |	It's a little more upscale in the fashion area fossil q line is also another
EDL	00:12:40,063	00:12:40,831	| IOT091 |	Nice-looking
EDL	00:12:41,343	00:12:46,463	| IOT091 |	Line of Android Wear watches and then there's some of their very utilitarian and those are the ones that I have bought because
EDL	00:12:46,463	00:12:50,815	| IOT091 |	Included a GPS where is the fashion ones did not examine the Stake Center
EDL	00:12:50,815	00:12:54,911	| IOT091 |	Or whatnot so you actually have more choice I think when it comes to Android Wear
EDL	00:12:54,911	00:12:59,775	| IOT091 |	Whether or not they suffer experiences the right one for you or with platform use that's that's personal choice
EDL	00:13:01,311	00:13:02,079	| IOT091 |	Okay
EDL	00:13:02,079	00:13:02,591	| IOT091 |	So
EDL	00:13:03,103	00:13:04,383	| IOT091 |	Will bring this into a
EDL	00:13:04,895	00:13:06,431	| IOT091 |	I think Stacy is found on the internet
EDL	00:13:06,943	00:13:07,967	| IOT091 |	Really excited
EDL	00:13:08,735	00:13:09,503	| IOT091 |	Product category
EDL	00:13:14,623	00:13:19,231	| IOT091 |	I was actually in my in my perusal of Amazon's smart home stuff
EDL	00:13:19,231	00:13:20,511	| IOT091 |	I discovered
EDL	00:13:20,511	00:13:24,351	| IOT091 |	GE Z-Wave Wireless smart door sensor
EDL	00:13:24,351	00:13:26,655	| IOT091 |	It fits over your hinge
EDL	00:13:26,655	00:13:27,679	| IOT091 |	Pin on your door
EDL	00:13:28,191	00:13:29,727	| IOT091 |	So it's like invisible
EDL	00:13:29,727	00:13:33,823	| IOT091 |	So it is got a ten year battery life
EDL	00:13:33,823	00:13:35,103	| IOT091 |	And now this product
EDL	00:13:35,103	00:13:36,127	| IOT091 |	Has kind of
EDL	00:13:36,127	00:13:37,663	| IOT091 |	It looks like calibrating it
EDL	00:13:37,663	00:13:40,479	| IOT091 |	Is tough so I ordered one because by golly
EDL	00:13:41,247	00:13:42,271	| IOT091 |	Why not
EDL	00:13:42,783	00:13:47,391	| IOT091 |	So what we'll see how this works but it's $40 in the idea is when you open the door
EDL	00:13:47,903	00:13:48,927	| IOT091 |	It could trigger
EDL	00:13:48,927	00:13:49,439	| IOT091 |	An action
EDL	00:13:49,951	00:13:55,071	| IOT091 |	Or I guess if you close the door in this kind of gets rid of like the open clothes sensors that
EDL	00:13:55,071	00:13:55,583	| IOT091 |	You know I
EDL	00:13:56,607	00:14:00,703	| IOT091 |	Because I test so many things I have so many open close sensor stuck to various stores at
EDL	00:14:02,239	00:14:05,311	| IOT091 |	Nintendo's those are all add-ons to the
EDL	00:14:05,311	00:14:06,335	| IOT091 |	Traditional door
EDL	00:14:06,847	00:14:07,871	| IOT091 |	Right you have like this
EDL	00:14:08,383	00:14:12,223	| IOT091 |	This thing that you have to add to a door frame or inside the door someone
EDL	00:14:12,223	00:14:17,087	| IOT091 |	This actually replaces a part that's on existing door which I like the concept here
EDL	00:14:17,599	00:14:18,879	| IOT091 |	I think it goes over
EDL	00:14:19,903	00:14:22,719	| IOT091 |	So it doesn't replace it I'm look at
EDL	00:14:23,487	00:14:27,583	| IOT091 |	When when it arrives I will tell you what it does because
EDL	00:14:27,583	00:14:28,607	| IOT091 |	It's a little unclear
EDL	00:14:28,607	00:14:29,375	| IOT091 |	But yes
EDL	00:14:30,143	00:14:30,911	| IOT091 |	You don't have to remove the door
EDL	00:14:31,423	00:14:32,191	| IOT091 |	Kiss
EDL	00:14:32,959	00:14:37,567	| IOT091 |	The best way to ruin a marriage is to try to install a door with
EDL	00:14:38,847	00:14:40,383	| IOT091 |	It's literally the hinge
EDL	00:14:40,383	00:14:41,663	| IOT091 |	Canton that you're replacing
EDL	00:14:42,943	00:14:44,223	| IOT091 |	Yes you just left.
EDL	00:14:44,223	00:14:44,735	| IOT091 |	I'll be right back in there
EDL	00:14:45,247	00:14:45,759	| IOT091 |	Right
EDL	00:14:47,039	00:14:49,599	| IOT091 |	So if this works with lissy according to the instructions
EDL	00:14:50,367	00:14:53,183	| IOT091 |	It works with SmartThings Nexia Trane
EDL	00:14:53,695	00:14:55,999	| IOT091 |	LG Smart Security + Lowe's Iris system
EDL	00:14:56,511	00:14:57,279	| IOT091 |	And
EDL	00:14:58,303	00:14:59,583	| IOT091 |	I guess we'll see
EDL	00:14:59,583	00:15:00,095	| IOT091 |	But
EDL	00:15:00,863	00:15:02,143	| IOT091 |	For those of you guys who are like
EDL	00:15:02,655	00:15:06,495	| IOT091 |	Oh that sounds good cuz I hate those ugly open close sensors on my door
EDL	00:15:06,495	00:15:07,263	| IOT091 |	Free
EDL	00:15:07,263	00:15:12,639	| IOT091 |	Someone also pointed out to me a company called sensitive I will put this in the show notes but it's
EDL	00:15:12,639	00:15:14,687	| IOT091 |	Sensa
EDL	00:15:14,687	00:15:16,223	| IOT091 |	Tive
EDL	00:15:16,223	00:15:18,015	| IOT091 |	If he's already $60
EDL	00:15:18,527	00:15:21,087	| IOT091 |	They look like double-sided tape they're just
EDL	00:15:25,183	00:15:28,255	| IOT091 |	It's literally just a 3 mm thick strip
EDL	00:15:28,767	00:15:32,863	| IOT091 |	That you put in like you would put in door insulation or something you know
EDL	00:15:33,887	00:15:36,447	| IOT091 |	Not visible to eat it's not noticeable either
EDL	00:15:36,959	00:15:38,495	| IOT091 |	And it's a Z-Wave product as well
EDL	00:15:39,007	00:15:41,823	| IOT091 |	I had never even seen his Heir Apparent
EDL	00:15:41,823	00:15:42,335	| IOT091 |	Leah crowdfunding
EDL	00:15:44,127	00:15:47,711	| IOT091 |	It'll so if you're in the market for non-intrusive sensors
EDL	00:15:47,711	00:15:49,247	| IOT091 |	Both of these options look really interesting
EDL	00:15:50,015	00:15:52,575	| IOT091 |	So I just thought I'd throw that out there since you guys
EDL	00:15:53,087	00:15:55,903	| IOT091 |	My listeners are always like a great
EDL	00:15:55,903	00:16:02,047	| IOT091 |	I also will caution though with this open close thing I've been kind of thinking about that cuz I started putting motion sensors to control lights around my house
EDL	00:16:02,559	00:16:04,351	| IOT091 |	It is very hard
EDL	00:16:04,863	00:16:05,631	| IOT091 |	Defined
EDL	00:16:06,399	00:16:09,215	| IOT091 |	You know you want to think about when I open the door
EDL	00:16:09,215	00:16:11,007	| IOT091 |	Do I want the same thing to happen
EDL	00:16:11,007	00:16:11,519	| IOT091 |	Everysing
EDL	00:16:12,543	00:16:18,943	| IOT091 |	Not necessarily but I think it at a basic level you could either you would either a want to a notification that
EDL	00:16:18,943	00:16:21,759	| IOT091 |	Somebody has entered or left your house would be
EDL	00:16:21,759	00:16:22,783	| IOT091 |	In certain
EDL	00:16:22,783	00:16:24,319	| IOT091 |	Times of the day
EDL	00:16:24,319	00:16:28,159	| IOT091 |	You may want a nearby lake to go on as you walk into the house
EDL	00:16:28,159	00:16:29,439	| IOT091 |	Yes and that's
EDL	00:16:29,439	00:16:31,231	| IOT091 |	I'm thinking you know you could
EDL	00:16:31,999	00:16:38,143	| IOT091 |	This is interesting because I could open when I open my front door for example my patio lights could go on when it's
EDL	00:16:38,143	00:16:38,655	| IOT091 |	Dark
EDL	00:16:40,447	00:16:45,311	| IOT091 |	This would be awesome until like the one day I'm like trying to see like if there's a burglar outside and I hope
EDL	00:16:45,311	00:16:45,823	| IOT091 |	Victoria Justice
EDL	00:16:46,591	00:16:47,615	| IOT091 |	To see what I can see and then
EDL	00:16:48,127	00:16:48,895	| IOT091 |	The lights go out
EDL	00:16:49,663	00:16:50,943	| IOT091 |	This is me always thinking the worst case
EDL	00:16:52,991	00:16:53,759	| IOT091 |	Moving right along
EDL	00:16:55,807	00:16:56,575	| IOT091 |	Cea

EDL	00:16:59,135	00:16:59,903	| IOT091 |	We'll talk a little bit about it
EDL	00:17:00,415	00:17:03,743	| IOT091 |	Just a little because I am not going

EDL	00:17:28,063	00:17:29,087	| IOT091 |	Guess what
EDL	00:17:30,111	00:17:30,623	| IOT091 |	Add
EDL	00:17:31,647	00:17:37,791	| IOT091 |	While I'm there so next week's podcast you're actually going to get some really exciting news we're not going to talk about
EDL	00:17:37,791	00:17:39,327	| IOT091 |	Some of the things that are happening
EDL	00:17:39,327	00:17:40,351	| IOT091 |	Because I can't yet
EDL	00:17:40,351	00:17:41,375	| IOT091 |	But I will say
EDL	00:17:41,887	00:17:42,911	| IOT091 |	Voice is going to be big
EDL	00:17:43,935	00:17:47,263	| IOT091 |	Service providers people who are you know
EDL	00:17:47,263	00:17:51,615	| IOT091 |	Making these iot experiences they're actually there's some really good stuff happening there
EDL	00:17:52,127	00:17:54,943	| IOT091 |	And there's some great news for lighting
EDL	00:17:54,943	00:17:55,711	| IOT091 |	So
EDL	00:17:55,711	00:17:57,759	| IOT091 |	If you guys are like on the fence about to
EDL	00:17:57,759	00:17:59,295	| IOT091 |	Click Buy on a lake
EDL	00:17:59,295	00:18:00,319	| IOT091 |	Fighting kind of product
EDL	00:18:00,831	00:18:01,343	| IOT091 |	Wait
EDL	00:18:02,367	00:18:08,767	| IOT091 |	I often tell people to wait on consumer electronic purchases at this point in time just because you know the consumer electronic show is
EDL	00:18:08,767	00:18:10,303	| IOT091 |	Going to have a gazillion different
EDL	00:18:10,303	00:18:11,839	| IOT091 |	New options
EDL	00:18:11,839	00:18:14,399	| IOT091 |	Not all of them are readily available as of
EDL	00:18:14,399	00:18:16,703	| IOT091 |	The Daily Show so that's something to keep in mind as well
EDL	00:18:17,471	00:18:18,239	| IOT091 |	Mynews however
EDL	00:18:19,519	00:18:21,055	| IOT091 |	Subway time
EDL	00:18:22,847	00:18:24,383	| IOT091 |	That is my advice to you
EDL	00:18:24,383	00:18:26,431	| IOT091 |	I mean you don't have to if you really want to buy it but you
EDL	00:18:29,247	00:18:29,759	| IOT091 |	Which status
EDL	00:18:30,783	00:18:33,343	| IOT091 |	All right before I get too philosophical
EDL	00:18:33,343	00:18:34,111	| IOT091 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:18:34,623	00:18:36,159	| IOT091 |	We don't actually talk a lot about
EDL	00:18:36,159	00:18:39,231	| IOT091 |	Some of these other hoes like Nexia are very light
EDL	00:18:39,231	00:18:39,999	| IOT091 |	But
EDL	00:18:39,999	00:18:42,815	| IOT091 |	I saw it a new story about Intel and Amazon
EDL	00:18:43,327	00:18:45,887	| IOT091 |	Are demoing a tiny smart
EDL	00:18:46,655	00:18:47,679	| IOT091 |	And it's powered
EDL	00:18:48,191	00:18:49,471	| IOT091 |	Spy software called
EDL	00:18:49,983	00:18:51,263	| IOT091 |	Neo s
EDL	00:18:51,263	00:18:52,543	| IOT091 |	Aosm iOS
EDL	00:18:54,079	00:18:55,615	| IOT091 |	Maybe it's my
EDL	00:18:56,895	00:18:59,199	| IOT091 |	Well it could be a capital M little eye
EDL	00:18:59,199	00:19:00,479	| IOT091 |	Big big ass
EDL	00:19:01,759	00:19:02,527	| IOT091 |	So
EDL	00:19:02,527	00:19:03,551	| IOT091 |	Maybe they were little I
EDL	00:19:07,903	00:19:09,439	| IOT091 |	I just gets no love
EDL	00:19:09,439	00:19:09,951	| IOT091 |	No love for the
EDL	00:19:10,463	00:19:13,279	| IOT091 |	Okay so meiosis is the meiosis
EDL	00:19:13,279	00:19:15,327	| IOT091 |	Is the company behind the vire
EDL	00:19:15,839	00:19:17,119	| IOT091 |	Xavier light system
EDL	00:19:17,119	00:19:19,167	| IOT091 |	Which is a Z-Wave smart home system
EDL	00:19:19,679	00:19:20,447	| IOT091 |	It
EDL	00:19:20,447	00:19:21,215	| IOT091 |	I've tried
EDL	00:19:21,727	00:19:22,751	| IOT091 |	It's okay
EDL	00:19:22,751	00:19:24,799	| IOT091 |	It's all Z-Wave so it's never
EDL	00:19:25,823	00:19:28,895	| IOT091 |	But I kind of want to do because I want to throw a bunch of stuff in there
EDL	00:19:28,895	00:19:30,687	| IOT091 |	But it is a solid system
EDL	00:19:31,199	00:19:32,735	| IOT091 |	I'm they work hard to support
EDL	00:19:32,735	00:19:33,759	| IOT091 |	Wings it Iz
EDL	00:19:33,759	00:19:34,527	| IOT091 |	Totally reasonable
EDL	00:19:35,039	00:19:35,551	| IOT091 |	So
EDL	00:19:36,063	00:19:37,599	| IOT091 |	What they did is
EDL	00:19:37,599	00:19:39,903	| IOT091 |	They have a Gateway with Intel Core processor
EDL	00:19:40,415	00:19:42,207	| IOT091 |	And Amazon Echo
EDL	00:19:42,207	00:19:43,487	| IOT091 |	Is doing the voice control
EDL	00:19:43,487	00:19:44,255	| IOT091 |	So
EDL	00:19:45,023	00:19:48,351	| IOT091 |	The Cee Pro is reporting that so far
EDL	00:19:48,863	00:19:50,911	| IOT091 |	This product that is being demonstrated
EDL	00:19:51,423	00:19:52,959	| IOT091 |	Controls Philips Hue Lights
EDL	00:19:53,471	00:19:54,239	| IOT091 |	Oh
EDL	00:19:54,239	00:19:56,287	| IOT091 |	I wonder if that's who a new hardware.
EDL	00:19:57,311	00:20:01,151	| IOT091 |	If that's through the Gateway that's interesting cuz that means that
EDL	00:20:01,663	00:20:03,967	| IOT091 |	But it could be just the echoing
EDL	00:20:03,967	00:20:07,551	| IOT091 |	Philips Hue with you have a nest thermostat a Sonos player
EDL	00:20:08,063	00:20:09,343	| IOT091 |	Soundbar and subwoofer
EDL	00:20:09,343	00:20:10,879	| IOT091 |	So not the actual speakers
EDL	00:20:10,879	00:20:12,927	| IOT091 |	Legrand Motors motorized shade
EDL	00:20:13,695	00:20:15,487	| IOT091 |	Somfy motorized awning
EDL	00:20:15,487	00:20:17,279	| IOT091 |	I wonder if they can also do the song people right shade
EDL	00:20:18,815	00:20:21,631	| IOT091 |	Avira security cameras
EDL	00:20:21,631	00:20:22,911	| IOT091 |	Amazon Fire TV
EDL	00:20:22,911	00:20:24,447	| IOT091 |	The Plex Home media software
EDL	00:20:25,215	00:20:26,239	| IOT091 |	And
EDL	00:20:26,239	00:20:28,287	| IOT091 |	A Wi-Fi Gateway with Intel
EDL	00:20:28,287	00:20:29,311	| IOT091 |	Anyone
EDL	00:20:29,311	00:20:29,823	| IOT091 |	Anyway in
EDL	00:20:30,335	00:20:31,359	| IOT091 |	Any Quinn
EDL	00:20:31,871	00:20:32,383	| IOT091 |	Why do.
EDL	00:20:33,919	00:20:35,455	| IOT091 |	I'm going to go try to find this
EDL	00:20:35,455	00:20:36,223	| IOT091 |	It's a yes
EDL	00:20:36,223	00:20:36,991	| IOT091 |	Embassy
EDL	00:20:36,991	00:20:38,015	| IOT091 |	What's Happening Here
EDL	00:20:38,015	00:20:38,527	| IOT091 |	Cuz
EDL	00:20:39,295	00:20:41,599	| IOT091 |	Yeah I'm curious if it's more
EDL	00:20:42,623	00:20:44,159	| IOT091 |	Demo and not a
EDL	00:20:44,671	00:20:47,231	| IOT091 |	To gauge if there's interest in a product
EDL	00:20:47,231	00:20:47,999	| IOT091 |	Maybe
EDL	00:20:47,999	00:20:49,791	| IOT091 |	So I will say
EDL	00:20:50,303	00:20:51,327	| IOT091 |	Lutron sent me
EDL	00:20:51,839	00:20:53,119	| IOT091 |	A casita
EDL	00:20:53,119	00:20:54,143	| IOT091 |	Bridge
EDL	00:20:54,143	00:20:55,679	| IOT091 |	To test with homekit
EDL	00:20:56,447	00:20:59,519	| IOT091 |	And as part of my homekit testing which
EDL	00:20:59,519	00:21:01,567	| IOT091 |	I guess I won't tell you it because next week's can be
EDL	00:21:01,567	00:21:03,359	| IOT091 |	He probably also yes all the time
EDL	00:21:03,359	00:21:05,151	| IOT091 |	Sometime in January
EDL	00:21:05,151	00:21:05,919	| IOT091 |	We're going to get into my house
EDL	00:21:05,919	00:21:06,687	| IOT091 |	Homekit stuff
EDL	00:21:06,687	00:21:09,759	| IOT091 |	I'm thinking I might actually be able to get rid of my wings
EDL	00:21:10,271	00:21:10,783	| IOT091 |	Hub
EDL	00:21:11,551	00:21:14,879	| IOT091 |	Use the Lutron caseta to control my Lutron stuff
EDL	00:21:15,391	00:21:16,672	| IOT091 |	Amend
EDL	00:21:17,440	00:21:21,024	| IOT091 |	And various Echo skills to control everything else plus I have the Hue hub
EDL	00:21:21,536	00:21:22,816	| IOT091 |	Already so
EDL	00:21:22,816	00:21:23,840	| IOT091 |	I'm actually going to
EDL	00:21:23,840	00:21:25,632	| IOT091 |	Going to try to see how far I can
EDL	00:21:25,632	00:21:26,144	| IOT091 |	Go
EDL	00:21:27,424	00:21:28,704	| IOT091 |	Without having
EDL	00:21:28,704	00:21:30,496	| IOT091 |	Like a SmartThings like a big brain hub
EDL	00:21:31,008	00:21:33,056	| IOT091 |	Write the traditional
EDL	00:21:33,056	00:21:33,824	| IOT091 |	Smart home hub
EDL	00:21:34,336	00:21:35,104	| IOT091 |	So
EDL	00:21:35,104	00:21:36,384	| IOT091 |	We'll see cuz
EDL	00:21:36,384	00:21:37,152	| IOT091 |	I think
EDL	00:21:37,152	00:21:38,688	| IOT091 |	For a lot of consumers that
EDL	00:21:39,200	00:21:39,712	| IOT091 |	Mets
EDL	00:21:41,248	00:21:41,760	| IOT091 |	I don't know
EDL	00:21:42,272	00:21:48,672	| IOT091 |	It depends I mean you know what you'll be using the echo.for a lot of your interface and interaction I suspect so
EDL	00:21:48,672	00:21:50,464	| IOT091 |	For consumers who don't have an echo
EDL	00:21:50,464	00:21:52,000	| IOT091 |	I don't know that I would get rid of
EDL	00:21:52,000	00:21:52,512	| IOT091 |	A hub
EDL	00:21:53,024	00:21:55,072	| IOT091 |	In that case
EDL	00:21:56,352	00:21:56,864	| IOT091 |	Listen sometimes
EDL	00:21:58,400	00:21:59,936	| IOT091 |	Like I have to tell you
EDL	00:21:59,936	00:22:03,776	| IOT091 |	In the middle of the night when our house cuz it's been like 80 degrees here in Austin this week
EDL	00:22:03,776	00:22:05,312	| IOT091 |	When our house gets too hot on like
EDL	00:22:06,080	00:22:07,616	| IOT091 |	I want to tell the echo to
EDL	00:22:08,640	00:22:09,920	| IOT091 |	Turn the nest down
EDL	00:22:11,200	00:22:12,992	| IOT091 |	I can't cuz my husband sleeping next to me safety

EDL	00:23:23,392	00:23:24,672	| IOT091 |	This is nothing like
EDL	00:23:24,672	00:23:25,952	| IOT091 |	The idea of
EDL	00:23:25,952	00:23:26,976	| IOT091 |	Animated
EDL	00:23:27,488	00:23:28,768	| IOT091 |	Virtual girlfriend
EDL	00:23:28,768	00:23:29,536	| IOT091 |	Japanese
EDL	00:23:30,048	00:23:31,584	| IOT091 |	Men is nothing new
EDL	00:23:31,584	00:23:33,120	| IOT091 |	The home automation is a newt
EDL	00:23:33,120	00:23:34,656	| IOT091 |	Twist it got me thinking like
EDL	00:23:35,168	00:23:36,960	| IOT091 |	What do we want I mean like
EDL	00:23:36,960	00:23:38,496	| IOT091 |	Are smart home
EDL	00:23:38,496	00:23:40,544	| IOT091 |	Controller to look like does it need to be
EDL	00:23:40,544	00:23:41,568	| IOT091 |	Anthropomorphism
EDL	00:23:42,592	00:23:43,360	| IOT091 |	Well
EDL	00:23:43,360	00:23:46,176	| IOT091 |	Dino that was big bonus points for Stacy
EDL	00:23:46,688	00:23:50,272	| IOT091 |	A lot of people talk about like Rosie from The Jetsons and they're like
EDL	00:23:50,272	00:23:52,576	| IOT091 |	Opposite of this little creature
EDL	00:23:52,576	00:23:53,344	| IOT091 |	Turn the lava lamp
EDL	00:23:54,624	00:23:56,160	| IOT091 |	Do we want this like
EDL	00:23:56,160	00:23:59,744	| IOT091 |	And all the voices right now or female so like do we want this like
EDL	00:23:59,744	00:24:00,256	| IOT091 |	Woman
EDL	00:24:01,280	00:24:02,816	| IOT091 |	Actual figure to be one of them
EDL	00:24:02,816	00:24:03,584	| IOT091 |	Woman's voice like
EDL	00:24:04,096	00:24:10,496	| IOT091 |	First of all I'm in some some of the assistance that are out there you can change the voice to male or have a different diet
EDL	00:24:10,496	00:24:12,032	| IOT091 |	Elector or accent
EDL	00:24:12,544	00:24:14,848	| IOT091 |	So I think Siri you can have a male voice if you want to
EDL	00:24:16,640	00:24:21,504	| IOT091 |	So but I think going back to your original question it's do we want to see the interface
EDL	00:24:22,016	00:24:23,552	| IOT091 |	What do we want something like
EDL	00:24:23,552	00:24:24,576	| IOT091 |	In the movie Her
EDL	00:24:25,344	00:24:30,208	| IOT091 |	Which is sort of what we have today with voice controls and and response back and
EDL	00:24:30,208	00:24:33,024	| IOT091 |	As you said right before the show we were discussing this briefly
EDL	00:24:33,536	00:24:37,888	| IOT091 |	It seems like apples going that way with the airpods and Siri access in there
EDL	00:24:38,400	00:24:39,680	| IOT091 |	Whereas
EDL	00:24:39,680	00:24:40,448	| IOT091 |	Amazon is looking
EDL	00:24:40,960	00:24:41,728	| IOT091 |	Wer
EDL	00:24:41,728	00:24:45,056	| IOT091 |	Distributing The Voice through multiple devices in a house not to
EDL	00:24:45,056	00:24:51,456	| IOT091 |	Two headphones that you could have Amazon voice services in in a single device that you wear for exam
EDL	00:24:51,456	00:24:52,480	| IOT091 |	That could happen
EDL	00:24:52,480	00:24:56,832	| IOT091 |	I think it comes down to especially after looking at this video do you want to see your assistant
EDL	00:24:57,600	00:24:58,112	| IOT091 |	And do you want
EDL	00:24:59,392	00:25:05,536	| IOT091 |	Well you shouldn't you should be able to have him or her look at the way you want because it's a personal assistant but
EDL	00:25:05,536	00:25:07,328	| IOT091 |	It's early days yet so
EDL	00:25:07,328	00:25:09,888	| IOT091 |	Japan has this little blue anime girl
EDL	00:25:09,888	00:25:12,960	| IOT091 |	Fine I'm sure but I don't know that I want to see
EDL	00:25:12,960	00:25:13,728	| IOT091 |	A virtual
EDL	00:25:14,240	00:25:15,008	| IOT091 |	Assistant
EDL	00:25:15,008	00:25:17,824	| IOT091 |	I mean if I'm going to see something that I want something like
EDL	00:25:17,824	00:25:18,848	| IOT091 |	An actual Android
EDL	00:25:19,616	00:25:21,408	| IOT091 |	Natsu Landry buy a robotic
EDL	00:25:21,408	00:25:22,432	| IOT091 |	Android that can
EDL	00:25:22,944	00:25:27,296	| IOT091 |	Physically do things around the house to that mean I'm going to buy Bicentennial Manwich
EDL	00:25:27,296	00:25:28,320	| IOT091 |	My favorite movies
EDL	00:25:28,832	00:25:33,440	| IOT091 |	And that's that's so cuz there's all these like Jibo in these little robot things that
EDL	00:25:33,440	00:25:34,208	| IOT091 |	Can I put a
EDL	00:25:34,208	00:25:36,256	| IOT091 |	Face again a face to
EDL	00:25:36,256	00:25:37,024	| IOT091 |	A voice
EDL	00:25:37,024	00:25:39,328	| IOT091 |	But for me I feel like if I'm going to have
EDL	00:25:40,864	00:25:41,632	| IOT091 |	Robot
EDL	00:25:41,632	00:25:42,400	| IOT091 |	Or like
EDL	00:25:42,400	00:25:44,448	| IOT091 |	A robot my house I want to have arms so it can
EDL	00:25:45,216	00:25:47,008	| IOT091 |	Right where I mean if you're going to go
EDL	00:25:47,520	00:25:49,056	| IOT091 |	Go all the way at this point
EDL	00:25:50,080	00:25:54,176	| IOT091 |	We'll see at CES a laundry folding robot although it takes a really long time to
EDL	00:25:54,176	00:25:54,944	| IOT091 |	Tefl those
EDL	00:25:54,944	00:25:55,968	| IOT091 |	Those towels
EDL	00:25:55,968	00:25:57,760	| IOT091 |	May takes me a long time to but
EDL	00:25:58,528	00:26:02,624	| IOT091 |	It's funny because I think I'm the last show we just talked about the
EDL	00:26:02,624	00:26:04,416	| IOT091 |	Personality of some of these
EDL	00:26:04,416	00:26:08,000	| IOT091 |	Services assistant devices where it said
EDL	00:26:08,000	00:26:12,608	| IOT091 |	I often after speak to my echo will say thank you after she does something for me
EDL	00:26:13,120	00:26:17,984	| IOT091 |	I already have that personal connection I don't need to see anything to get a more personal connection
EDL	00:26:18,496	00:26:19,776	| IOT091 |	But that's just me
EDL	00:26:21,056	00:26:22,336	| IOT091 |	This is one of those things for him like
EDL	00:26:23,104	00:26:24,896	| IOT091 |	I know I don't want like a little weird
EDL	00:26:25,408	00:26:26,944	| IOT091 |	Avatar thing and I've never been in
EDL	00:26:27,456	00:26:29,504	| IOT091 |	I think the Jibo and those kind of robots
EDL	00:26:29,504	00:26:32,320	| IOT091 |	Cool but I don't realize I would never spend the money on it cuz I'm like
EDL	00:26:33,600	00:26:35,904	| IOT091 |	Already have most of that and
EDL	00:26:35,904	00:26:38,208	| IOT091 |	Haven't seen roaming around my house doesn't
EDL	00:26:39,744	00:26:40,768	| IOT091 |	No no
EDL	00:26:41,280	00:26:42,816	| IOT091 |	And you know I dedicated robot
EDL	00:26:43,328	00:26:43,840	| IOT091 |	The price that it would
EDL	00:26:44,608	00:26:45,120	| IOT091 |	Write a program
EDL	00:26:47,168	00:26:53,568	| IOT091 |	But there's there's hope 10 20 years from now maybe it's but no it's not something that most people going to
EDL	00:26:53,568	00:26:56,896	| IOT091 |	Get in there so few options out there to being with right now anyway
EDL	00:26:56,896	00:26:57,920	| IOT091 |	Right I'll save my money for
EDL	00:26:57,920	00:26:58,432	| IOT091 |	The self-driving car
EDL	00:27:00,992	00:27:03,552	| IOT091 |	So I have to say that we had
EDL	00:27:03,552	00:27:04,320	| IOT091 |	An awesome
EDL	00:27:04,320	00:27:05,088	| IOT091 |	Comment
EDL	00:27:05,088	00:27:08,672	| IOT091 |	As last week's episode where we kind of was like
EDL	00:27:08,672	00:27:10,976	| IOT091 |	Hey this is what we've done to automate our house
EDL	00:27:11,488	00:27:12,768	| IOT091 |	And Scott
EDL	00:27:12,768	00:27:15,840	| IOT091 |	Lawrence Lawson left a comment on a Blog and he
EDL	00:27:15,840	00:27:17,376	| IOT091 |	It's great idea
EDL	00:27:17,376	00:27:17,888	| IOT091 |	Which is
EDL	00:27:18,400	00:27:23,264	| IOT091 |	Change the switch or the plug on your garbage disposal to a connected one
EDL	00:27:23,264	00:27:25,824	| IOT091 |	So you can use voice control with the echo
EDL	00:27:25,824	00:27:26,592	| IOT091 |	Orbitz Google
EDL	00:27:27,104	00:27:28,896	| IOT091 |	And he gave it with
EDL	00:27:28,896	00:27:30,432	| IOT091 |	Hey smart thing
EDL	00:27:30,432	00:27:32,480	| IOT091 |	Turn on off the drain
EDL	00:27:32,480	00:27:34,272	| IOT091 |	And he said this is really useful
EDL	00:27:34,272	00:27:35,296	| IOT091 |	When doing dishes with wet hair
EDL	00:27:35,808	00:27:36,576	| IOT091 |	Its and it's
EDL	00:27:38,368	00:27:40,160	| IOT091 |	I want to see I would never have thought of this
EDL	00:27:40,672	00:27:42,208	| IOT091 |	Possibly because
EDL	00:27:42,208	00:27:43,744	| IOT091 |	My garbage disposal
EDL	00:27:44,256	00:27:45,280	| IOT091 |	Yes which is just covered
EDL	00:27:45,792	00:27:46,304	| IOT091 |	Mike Massey Pizza

EDL	00:27:57,824	00:28:00,384	| IOT091 |	Guys feel free if you have these like
EDL	00:28:00,384	00:28:02,688	| IOT091 |	Easy things send them our way because
EDL	00:28:02,688	00:28:04,224	| IOT091 |	The beauty of
EDL	00:28:04,224	00:28:10,624	| IOT091 |	All of the stuff is there's a long tail of things you can do in most of us just don't even think about it until it's
EDL	00:28:10,624	00:28:12,160	| IOT091 |	But basically tossed in her face
EDL	00:28:13,696	00:28:15,744	| IOT091 |	Almost done with this week show but first

EDL	00:30:28,864	00:30:31,424	| IOT091 |	So where we can virtualize products
EDL	00:30:31,424	00:30:33,984	| IOT091 |	We can then store data from those products
EDL	00:30:33,984	00:30:36,032	| IOT091 |	Control products manage those products
EDL	00:30:36,544	00:30:38,336	| IOT091 |	And then it's also
EDL	00:30:38,336	00:30:39,104	| IOT091 |	Rapt
EDL	00:30:39,104	00:30:40,640	| IOT091 |	In an API first
EDL	00:30:40,640	00:30:42,944	| IOT091 |	Design methodology so people can
EDL	00:30:42,944	00:30:46,528	| IOT091 |	Then also writes drawing apps for those products
EDL	00:30:46,528	00:30:50,112	| IOT091 |	And also do connections to other services and other cloud
EDL	00:30:50,624	00:30:54,976	| IOT091 |	Okay so this sounds a lot like something that manufacturers might be interested in
EDL	00:30:54,976	00:31:00,352	| IOT091 |	Systems integrators and I heard you say security a couple times so I'd love for you to talk to me
EDL	00:31:00,352	00:31:01,376	| IOT091 |	About what's unique
EDL	00:31:01,888	00:31:03,424	| IOT091 |	Here on Arctic
EDL	00:31:03,424	00:31:05,472	| IOT091 |	We have an end-to-end platform
EDL	00:31:05,472	00:31:06,496	| IOT091 |	For manufacturers
EDL	00:31:07,008	00:31:08,032	| IOT091 |	Systems integrators
EDL	00:31:08,032	00:31:11,616	| IOT091 |	To use in creating product iot connected product
EDL	00:31:11,616	00:31:12,896	| IOT091 |	But as We Know
EDL	00:31:12,896	00:31:14,688	| IOT091 |	You know from any of the reports
EDL	00:31:14,688	00:31:19,808	| IOT091 |	And even things that are going on in the world right now security is top-of-mind
EDL	00:31:19,808	00:31:21,856	| IOT091 |	We sealed platform development.
EDL	00:31:21,856	00:31:22,624	| IOT091 |	The best place to
EDL	00:31:22,624	00:31:25,440	| IOT091 |	To put security think it through at the beginning
EDL	00:31:25,440	00:31:26,208	| IOT091 |	And
EDL	00:31:26,208	00:31:26,976	| IOT091 |	Been implemented
EDL	00:31:27,488	00:31:33,376	| IOT091 |	And what we've implemented for security is a best-in-class methodology known as AAA security
EDL	00:31:33,376	00:31:34,912	| IOT091 |	It's Authentication
EDL	00:31:34,912	00:31:37,472	| IOT091 |	Authorization and ability to audit
EDL	00:31:37,472	00:31:40,032	| IOT091 |	What we do there is we have Hannah Kate
EDL	00:31:40,544	00:31:42,592	| IOT091 |	The user and a device
EDL	00:31:43,104	00:31:46,432	| IOT091 |	So that falls into the module offering that we have
EDL	00:31:46,944	00:31:50,272	| IOT091 |	Write and in the software we have for that software for onboarding
EDL	00:31:50,784	00:31:51,552	| IOT091 |	The end product
EDL	00:31:52,064	00:31:54,368	| IOT091 |	We Them secure the trance
EDL	00:31:54,368	00:31:55,648	| IOT091 |	Sport into the cloud
EDL	00:31:56,160	00:31:59,232	| IOT091 |	So the second thing we offer is authorization
EDL	00:31:59,232	00:32:00,256	| IOT091 |	So what authorization
EDL	00:32:01,280	00:32:02,816	| IOT091 |	Is the user
EDL	00:32:02,816	00:32:04,352	| IOT091 |	That utilizing this
EDL	00:32:04,352	00:32:05,120	| IOT091 |	Product
EDL	00:32:05,120	00:32:07,680	| IOT091 |	Do they have the proper role are they authorized
EDL	00:32:07,680	00:32:09,216	| IOT091 |	To do what they are trying to do
EDL	00:32:09,216	00:32:12,288	| IOT091 |	And we use certificate-based Authentication
EDL	00:32:12,288	00:32:13,568	| IOT091 |	For that process
EDL	00:32:13,568	00:32:16,128	| IOT091 |	And then we have the ability to audit what has happened
EDL	00:32:16,128	00:32:20,480	| IOT091 |	In addition to security what are the other benefits of having an end-to-end
EDL	00:32:21,504	00:32:24,064	| IOT091 |	Tell the benefits of an end-to-end platform
EDL	00:32:24,064	00:32:27,648	| IOT091 |	Are that when a manufacturer is looking at
EDL	00:32:27,648	00:32:30,464	| IOT091 |	Building a thing to be iot connected
EDL	00:32:30,464	00:32:32,000	| IOT091 |	It's a change in their business
EDL	00:32:32,000	00:32:34,304	| IOT091 |	Generally for a manufacturer
EDL	00:32:34,304	00:32:37,376	| IOT091 |	There is the electronics there's the software there's the product
EDL	00:32:37,888	00:32:44,032	| IOT091 |	But now on top of that they have to consider RF design they have to consider protocol they have to consider cloud
EDL	00:32:44,544	00:32:46,080	| IOT091 |	I also have to consider
EDL	00:32:46,080	00:32:47,104	| IOT091 |	Mobile app development
EDL	00:32:47,616	00:32:48,896	| IOT091 |	And each of these
EDL	00:32:48,896	00:32:54,784	| IOT091 |	Are additional software development efforts that they have to do on top of their normal product developer
EDL	00:32:55,552	00:32:58,368	| IOT091 |	So utilizing an end-to-end platform
EDL	00:32:58,368	00:32:59,392	| IOT091 |	Simplify stock
EDL	00:32:59,904	00:33:02,720	| IOT091 |	And gives them single SDK
EDL	00:33:02,720	00:33:04,512	| IOT091 |	Where can I find
EDL	00:33:05,280	00:33:07,584	| IOT091 |	You can find out more at dub dub dub
EDL	00:33:07,584	00:33:13,984	| IOT091 |	Arctic. IO that's Arctic artik. IO
EDL	00:33:13,984	00:33:20,384	| IOT091 |	Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things
EDL	00:33:20,384	00:33:26,528	| IOT091 |	Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest is gaurav Garg who is a partner at
EDL	00:33:26,528	00:33:27,552	| IOT091 |	Wing venture
EDL	00:33:28,320	00:33:29,344	| IOT091 |	Hi darling how are you doing
EDL	00:33:30,112	00:33:30,880	| IOT091 |	Great
EDL	00:33:30,880	00:33:31,392	| IOT091 |	Thanks for having
EDL	00:33:31,904	00:33:34,208	| IOT091 |	I am super glad so basically
EDL	00:33:34,720	00:33:35,488	| IOT091 |	You guys
EDL	00:33:36,000	00:33:40,864	| IOT091 |	Actually earlier this year wrote a really awesome report that delved into kind of some funding
EDL	00:33:40,864	00:33:47,264	| IOT091 |	Not just funding information but also Trends in The Internet of Things space and I will link to that in the show notes but I thought it'd be fun
EDL	00:33:47,264	00:33:48,800	| IOT091 |	Fun to have you on here to talk about
EDL	00:33:49,312	00:33:50,080	| IOT091 |	Kind of
EDL	00:33:50,080	00:33:53,664	| IOT091 |	What you think the role of the internet of things is going to be
EDL	00:33:53,664	00:33:56,992	| IOT091 |	Going forward and how that's kind of influence in your investment strategy
EDL	00:33:57,760	00:34:03,648	| IOT091 |	Let's dig in if I'm looking at this world how do I break up the opportunities
EDL	00:34:04,160	00:34:04,672	| IOT091 |	I had
EDL	00:34:05,184	00:34:10,816	| IOT091 |	So there are very practical things that you mention like for example security
EDL	00:34:15,936	00:34:16,448	| IOT091 |	Place to be
EDL	00:34:16,960	00:34:19,520	| IOT091 |	Authorized user interaction there's also
EDL	00:34:19,520	00:34:22,848	| IOT091 |	Lake life cycle management there's so much to think about
EDL	00:34:22,848	00:34:23,360	| IOT091 |	So
EDL	00:34:24,128	00:34:26,688	| IOT091 |	Where do you think the date opportunities
EDL	00:34:26,688	00:34:31,040	| IOT091 |	Are that makes sense from this maybe not the ones we can't see cuz who knows what those are
EDL	00:34:31,040	00:34:32,832	| IOT091 |	But some of the ones that are a little bit more visible
EDL	00:34:34,112	00:34:35,648	| IOT091 |	What looks the first thing is
EDL	00:34:35,648	00:34:37,184	| IOT091 |	If you think about what we talked about
EDL	00:34:37,184	00:34:38,464	| IOT091 |	It would seem a patent
EDL	00:34:38,464	00:34:39,232	| IOT091 |	They at
EDL	00:34:39,232	00:34:42,560	| IOT091 |	Driven by iot in various definitions of iot
EDL	00:34:44,096	00:34:46,912	| IOT091 |	Technology ecosystem will probably expand
EDL	00:34:47,424	00:34:50,240	| IOT091 |	Buy a very large amount relative Americans today
EDL	00:34:50,240	00:34:51,008	| IOT091 |	Maybe for 5X
EDL	00:34:52,032	00:34:56,640	| IOT091 |	And occupy an even larger portion of GDP than it does today
EDL	00:34:56,640	00:34:58,176	| IOT091 |	It's not very much
EDL	00:34:58,944	00:35:01,504	| IOT091 |	Whatever is kind of every decade right
EDL	00:35:01,504	00:35:04,832	| IOT091 |	Footprint of the technology Industries got up by 5 to 10 a.m.
EDL	00:35:06,112	00:35:08,160	| IOT091 |	Imagine that happening enabled
EDL	00:35:08,672	00:35:09,696	| IOT091 |	Baidu news
EDL	00:35:11,232	00:35:12,000	| IOT091 |	So
EDL	00:35:12,000	00:35:14,816	| IOT091 |	Where are we in the life cycle this earlier very early
EDL	00:35:14,816	00:35:15,840	| IOT091 |	Maybe
EDL	00:35:15,840	00:35:16,864	| IOT091 |	1% aloe vera
EDL	00:35:17,376	00:35:18,912	| IOT091 |	The way I look at it is that
EDL	00:35:19,680	00:35:22,496	| IOT091 |	Any new ecosystem like this
EDL	00:35:22,496	00:35:24,288	| IOT091 |	Did usually starts with
EDL	00:35:24,800	00:35:25,568	| IOT091 |	Semiconductors
EDL	00:35:26,080	00:35:26,848	| IOT091 |	Which are
EDL	00:35:27,360	00:35:28,896	| IOT091 |	August a hard place to invest
EDL	00:35:29,408	00:35:30,688	| IOT091 |	Blood in iot
EDL	00:35:30,688	00:35:31,968	| IOT091 |	One can imagine
EDL	00:35:31,968	00:35:32,736	| IOT091 |	In the short-term
EDL	00:35:33,248	00:35:34,528	| IOT091 |	Meaning the next 4-5 years
EDL	00:35:35,040	00:35:41,440	| IOT091 |	That there will be opportunities driven by specialized semiconductors I'm not an expert in semiconductors
EDL	00:35:41,440	00:35:41,952	| IOT091 |	Imagination
EDL	00:35:42,464	00:35:43,488	| IOT091 |	But the power honesty
EDL	00:35:44,512	00:35:45,536	| IOT091 |	No pun intended
EDL	00:35:45,536	00:35:47,328	| IOT091 |	You're going to have to stop at semiconductors
EDL	00:35:47,328	00:35:49,632	| IOT091 |	Then there's a phase of Platforms in
EDL	00:35:49,632	00:35:50,144	| IOT091 |	Assistance
EDL	00:35:50,656	00:35:52,192	| IOT091 |	Which becomes important
EDL	00:35:52,192	00:35:53,728	| IOT091 |	Yeah stings proliferate
EDL	00:35:54,240	00:35:55,008	| IOT091 |	And
EDL	00:35:55,008	00:35:55,776	| IOT091 |	Come off
EDL	00:35:56,288	00:35:58,080	| IOT091 |	Operating systems that are
EDL	00:35:58,080	00:35:59,104	| IOT091 |	Peterbilt for
EDL	00:35:59,872	00:36:00,896	| IOT091 |	Industrial
EDL	00:36:01,408	00:36:04,224	| IOT091 |	Networks from 30 years ago or beds
EDL	00:36:04,224	00:36:07,040	| IOT091 |	For computer said we as human beings interact with
EDL	00:36:07,040	00:36:09,344	| IOT091 |	New platforms to be created for iotv
EDL	00:36:09,856	00:36:10,880	| IOT091 |	As Wheels
EDL	00:36:10,880	00:36:12,928	| IOT091 |	Some of these tax on services
EDL	00:36:12,928	00:36:13,952	| IOT091 |	Like
EDL	00:36:13,952	00:36:16,256	| IOT091 |	What do you need to do in the cloud to collect Olive
EDL	00:36:16,256	00:36:17,280	| IOT091 |	Sustaita
EDL	00:36:17,280	00:36:19,072	| IOT091 |	How do you deal with security
EDL	00:36:19,072	00:36:19,840	| IOT091 |	So on and so forth
EDL	00:36:20,608	00:36:21,888	| IOT091 |	Of course I will be
EDL	00:36:21,888	00:36:25,728	| IOT091 |	A normal amount of investment as well in the actual sings themselves
EDL	00:36:25,728	00:36:26,752	| IOT091 |	Sambal fish was saying
EDL	00:36:27,264	00:36:28,544	| IOT091 |	Any ideas like drones
EDL	00:36:29,312	00:36:30,080	| IOT091 |	And
EDL	00:36:30,080	00:36:30,848	| IOT091 |	At some point
EDL	00:36:31,616	00:36:33,408	| IOT091 |	They'll be a set of applications
EDL	00:36:34,176	00:36:35,200	| IOT091 |	And message
EDL	00:36:35,200	00:36:40,832	| IOT091 |	For all of the things as well as the applications to talk to each other which will probably be the biggest slice of
EDL	00:36:40,832	00:36:41,600	| IOT091 |	The pie
EDL	00:36:41,600	00:36:44,416	| IOT091 |	A lot of that we cannot imagine today because we don't have massive
EDL	00:36:44,928	00:36:47,488	| IOT091 |	Deployment
EDL	00:36:47,488	00:36:48,256	| IOT091 |	IPhone came out in
EDL	00:36:49,792	00:36:51,328	| IOT091 |	When did we really start
EDL	00:36:51,328	00:36:55,424	| IOT091 |	Saying native mobile applications like uber that wouldn't make sense on the desktop
EDL	00:36:55,936	00:36:57,984	| IOT091 |	Took a few years I mean never there
EDL	00:36:57,984	00:37:02,080	| IOT091 |	But it took a few years before they really started taking off something will happen here
EDL	00:37:02,080	00:37:05,408	| IOT091 |	Stevia proliferation of platforms and creative people
EDL	00:37:05,408	00:37:07,456	| IOT091 |	But applications that really can't
EDL	00:37:07,456	00:37:09,760	| IOT091 |	Take off today but that ultimately will be
EDL	00:37:09,760	00:37:11,552	| IOT091 |	The largest piece of economic pie
EDL	00:37:12,064	00:37:13,088	| IOT091 |	It just so people know
EDL	00:37:13,600	00:37:16,416	| IOT091 |	IPhone came out in 07 in the App Store
EDL	00:37:16,416	00:37:17,440	| IOT091 |	Which was the big
EDL	00:37:17,440	00:37:18,720	| IOT091 |	The Big Kahuna
EDL	00:37:19,232	00:37:19,744	| IOT091 |	Came out in 08
EDL	00:37:21,024	00:37:21,792	| IOT091 |	Yeah thank you
EDL	00:37:23,072	00:37:23,840	| IOT091 |	But I think of
EDL	00:37:24,608	00:37:25,376	| IOT091 |	What to invest
EDL	00:37:25,376	00:37:26,400	| IOT091 |	Austin today
EDL	00:37:26,400	00:37:29,472	| IOT091 |	The concentration of investment is going to be in the actual thing
EDL	00:37:30,240	00:37:32,800	| IOT091 |	But you're going to be presented as vertical applications today
EDL	00:37:33,568	00:37:34,080	| IOT091 |	Or
EDL	00:37:34,592	00:37:35,104	| IOT091 |	Platforms
EDL	00:37:35,872	00:37:37,664	| IOT091 |	Isabella stats form like services
EDL	00:37:38,176	00:37:39,200	| IOT091 |	That's what people are going.
EDL	00:37:40,224	00:37:44,320	| IOT091 |	The notion of what applications run on these things and how do they talk to each other
EDL	00:37:44,320	00:37:46,880	| IOT091 |	Beverly bits and pieces but it's still a little bit toy
EDL	00:37:47,392	00:37:48,416	| IOT091 |	And we're not quite there yet
EDL	00:37:48,928	00:37:50,208	| IOT091 |	A ninja
EDL	00:37:50,208	00:37:52,000	| IOT091 |	Kind of report you actually
EDL	00:37:53,024	00:37:55,328	| IOT091 |	Bless you all for doing this cuz you guys names like
EDL	00:37:55,840	00:37:57,632	| IOT091 |	You found 700 different
EDL	00:37:57,632	00:37:59,168	| IOT091 |	Platforms
EDL	00:37:59,168	00:37:59,680	| IOT091 |	Platform
EDL	00:38:00,448	00:38:02,752	| IOT091 |	And I was like oh I feel you man I
EDL	00:38:03,264	00:38:04,544	| IOT091 |	I feel like I've met at least 300
EDL	00:38:05,312	00:38:06,080	| IOT091 |	So
EDL	00:38:06,080	00:38:10,688	| IOT091 |	What do you think the fate of these platforms is and what is maybe a sustainable
EDL	00:38:11,456	00:38:13,760	| IOT091 |	Look like I don't even know if that's the right way to parse
EDL	00:38:13,760	00:38:16,832	| IOT091 |	It's like a credible number of companies trying to be platforms or what
EDL	00:38:16,832	00:38:18,112	| IOT091 |	I would love to get your
EDL	00:38:19,392	00:38:21,952	| IOT091 |	In industrial applications or anything
EDL	00:38:21,952	00:38:22,976	| IOT091 |	Things like cars
EDL	00:38:23,744	00:38:24,768	| IOT091 |	They look like men
EDL	00:38:24,768	00:38:26,560	| IOT091 |	The closest Sam's today
EDL	00:38:27,072	00:38:29,888	| IOT091 |	And the person that makes a car or make
EDL	00:38:31,168	00:38:32,704	| IOT091 |	X-ray machine
EDL	00:38:33,216	00:38:35,008	| IOT091 |	Whatever you think of those other things as well
EDL	00:38:35,520	00:38:37,824	| IOT091 |	They have this vertical stack where they control August
EDL	00:38:39,104	00:38:40,384	| IOT091 |	The reality is
EDL	00:38:40,384	00:38:41,152	| IOT091 |	Dad
EDL	00:38:41,152	00:38:42,688	| IOT091 |	We're going to get to a word
EDL	00:38:42,688	00:38:43,200	| IOT091 |	Where
EDL	00:38:43,712	00:38:46,528	| IOT091 |	Software that runs in cars or an industrial machine
EDL	00:38:46,528	00:38:48,320	| IOT091 |	In all things in general
EDL	00:38:49,088	00:38:50,112	| IOT091 |	Is going to come
EDL	00:38:50,112	00:38:50,880	| IOT091 |	Partially
EDL	00:38:51,392	00:38:52,672	| IOT091 |	From software developer
EDL	00:38:53,440	00:38:55,744	| IOT091 |	That have nothing to do with that particular car mats
EDL	00:38:55,744	00:38:58,048	| IOT091 |	Exit right in the world of distributed applications and
EDL	00:38:58,816	00:38:59,840	| IOT091 |	The weather please
EDL	00:38:59,840	00:39:00,608	| IOT091 |	Disco Donnie
EDL	00:39:00,608	00:39:01,376	| IOT091 |	Together now
EDL	00:39:01,888	00:39:02,912	| IOT091 |	All of that
EDL	00:39:02,912	00:39:05,984	| IOT091 |	Means that they're going to be some very rich ecosystems
EDL	00:39:06,496	00:39:07,264	| IOT091 |	2
EDL	00:39:07,264	00:39:09,824	| IOT091 |	Develop software in to write applications
EDL	00:39:10,336	00:39:12,384	| IOT091 |	And like most are forms of
EDL	00:39:12,384	00:39:13,920	| IOT091 |	Today my guess is
EDL	00:39:14,432	00:39:14,944	| IOT091 |	Those
EDL	00:39:15,968	00:39:17,504	| IOT091 |	Can attract the most Developers
EDL	00:39:18,272	00:39:21,856	| IOT091 |	Linda hearts and Minds moving what that looks like in the future
EDL	00:39:22,368	00:39:23,904	| IOT091 |	I don't think it's going to be
EDL	00:39:23,904	00:39:28,768	| IOT091 |	Steak mobile platforms which is basically two or three operating systems on the desktop
EDL	00:39:28,768	00:39:29,792	| IOT091 |	Which was similar
EDL	00:39:29,792	00:39:33,120	| IOT091 |	I think I ought to be out of necessity they will be more than one or two
EDL	00:39:33,632	00:39:35,680	| IOT091 |	But I don't think it's going to be 600
EDL	00:39:37,984	00:39:40,544	| IOT091 |	How to put a finger on it but
EDL	00:39:40,544	00:39:43,872	| IOT091 |	Is Ewa Beach some concentrations of ecosystems depending on
EDL	00:39:43,872	00:39:45,408	| IOT091 |	Types of devices.
EDL	00:39:45,920	00:39:50,272	| IOT091 |	Just picked up a really fun thought exercise for iot I think's going to develop
EDL	00:39:50,272	00:39:52,320	| IOT091 |	Vertically or horizontally
EDL	00:39:52,320	00:39:53,856	| IOT091 |	If you're kind of thinking about being a plateau
EDL	00:39:54,880	00:40:00,256	| IOT091 |	So that could be horizontal by Pio
EDL	00:40:00,768	00:40:03,072	| IOT091 |	Verses like I'm going to build something for
EDL	00:40:03,072	00:40:03,584	| IOT091 |	Restaurants
EDL	00:40:04,352	00:40:08,704	| IOT091 |	Beverly some places where they will be vertical development cars that are obvious one
EDL	00:40:08,704	00:40:10,240	| IOT091 |	The stars are going to be
EDL	00:40:10,752	00:40:17,152	| IOT091 |	How's a large part of the it conomy places which have specialized needs you have this 4000 lb
EDL	00:40:17,152	00:40:20,224	| IOT091 |	Vehicle traveling at 80 miles an hour that is suddenly connected in
EDL	00:40:20,736	00:40:21,248	| IOT091 |	Does a
EDL	00:40:21,760	00:40:24,320	| IOT091 |	Lot of implications of stats relative to
EDL	00:40:25,088	00:40:26,368	| IOT091 |	I like boat ride
EDL	00:40:26,368	00:40:27,648	| IOT091 |	Or my telephone
EDL	00:40:28,416	00:40:31,232	| IOT091 |	I suspect that just because of the outside
EDL	00:40:31,744	00:40:35,328	| IOT091 |	Fraction of economy that is occupied by the Auto industry
EDL	00:40:35,328	00:40:36,096	| IOT091 |	And
EDL	00:40:36,096	00:40:39,424	| IOT091 |	Because it is very far along and getting connected
EDL	00:40:39,424	00:40:41,472	| IOT091 |	Cost example of a place that you can imagine
EDL	00:40:43,264	00:40:44,288	| IOT091 |	Will probably be
EDL	00:40:44,800	00:40:46,592	| IOT091 |	List of consumer products
EDL	00:40:46,592	00:40:47,616	| IOT091 |	Where
EDL	00:40:47,616	00:40:49,664	| IOT091 |	Because you want companies will attempt
EDL	00:40:49,664	00:40:52,224	| IOT091 |	I have that song Feeling sexy app on Google
EDL	00:40:52,736	00:40:54,784	| IOT091 |	Have their own horses in the race already
EDL	00:40:55,296	00:40:56,576	| IOT091 |	Hard for me to
EDL	00:40:57,600	00:40:58,880	| IOT091 |	Think about how
EDL	00:40:59,392	00:41:03,488	| IOT091 |	And small independent company can become platform player in consumer products
EDL	00:41:03,488	00:41:05,024	| IOT091 |	That just seems super hot to me
EDL	00:41:05,024	00:41:07,840	| IOT091 |	I didn't get the answer is it's going to be a little bit up
EDL	00:41:08,608	00:41:10,656	| IOT091 |	Let's talk about Enterprise iot
EDL	00:41:11,168	00:41:17,568	| IOT091 |	I'd love to see how you break down of Internet of Things world is it consumer Enterprise Industrial
EDL	00:41:17,568	00:41:22,944	| IOT091 |	Does multiple categories does industrial designer prized as wearables does home
EDL	00:41:23,456	00:41:24,480	| IOT091 |	Des health
EDL	00:41:24,992	00:41:26,016	| IOT091 |	Does Auto
EDL	00:41:26,528	00:41:28,064	| IOT091 |	All of these are probably already
EDL	00:41:28,576	00:41:29,344	| IOT091 |	Looks like by the way
EDL	00:41:29,856	00:41:30,880	| IOT091 |	And I don't know very well
EDL	00:41:32,416	00:41:35,744	| IOT091 |	That could be an overlay across some of these things or
EDL	00:41:35,744	00:41:37,536	| IOT091 |	An independent entity all together
EDL	00:41:38,304	00:41:39,840	| IOT091 |	And then there's also
EDL	00:41:39,840	00:41:41,376	| IOT091 |	Dirt of public places
EDL	00:41:42,144	00:41:47,776	| IOT091 |	Where are you know Stadium train stations coffee shops restaurants on so far to wear
EDL	00:41:48,288	00:41:50,080	| IOT091 |	Romani people occupying buildings
EDL	00:41:50,592	00:41:51,104	| IOT091 |	Where
EDL	00:41:51,616	00:41:52,384	| IOT091 |	For not employed
EDL	00:41:52,895	00:41:56,735	| IOT091 |	Do you guys also I feel like you had a drone category in your research
EDL	00:41:56,735	00:41:57,503	| IOT091 |	Search as well
EDL	00:41:58,527	00:41:59,807	| IOT091 |	Yeah
EDL	00:41:59,807	00:42:00,831	| IOT091 |	I'm sorry I forgot it
EDL	00:42:02,879	00:42:03,903	| IOT091 |	I wanted to see if
EDL	00:42:03,903	00:42:05,439	| IOT091 |	You guys have less you had a sudden like
EDL	00:42:07,743	00:42:11,583	| IOT091 |	Good point I still have
EDL	00:42:12,607	00:42:14,911	| IOT091 |	Difficulty believing
EDL	00:42:14,911	00:42:15,423	| IOT091 |	Dad
EDL	00:42:15,935	00:42:17,471	| IOT091 |	Jason the United States
EDL	00:42:17,471	00:42:19,519	| IOT091 |	CSA score
EDL	00:42:19,519	00:42:21,567	| IOT091 |	Police drones for every purpose
EDL	00:42:21,567	00:42:22,335	| IOT091 |	Possible
EDL	00:42:22,335	00:42:25,663	| IOT091 |	Send you're well aware that they've been fairly conservative so far
EDL	00:42:25,663	00:42:28,479	| IOT091 |	I can imagine that explain drones
EDL	00:42:28,479	00:42:30,271	| IOT091 |	It's already in use today
EDL	00:42:30,271	00:42:32,831	| IOT091 |	Which require airport at all sorts of regulations
EDL	00:42:33,343	00:42:35,647	| IOT091 |	Starting user security
EDL	00:42:35,647	00:42:36,671	| IOT091 |	Surveillance
EDL	00:42:36,671	00:42:38,719	| IOT091 |	Fan agriculture pretty heavily
EDL	00:42:39,231	00:42:40,511	| IOT091 |	Symptoms of
EDL	00:42:40,511	00:42:44,351	| IOT091 |	Piloted Vehicles as well as drones
EDL	00:42:44,863	00:42:47,935	| IOT091 |	But I have a really tough time believing these
EDL	00:42:47,935	00:42:49,215	| IOT091 |	Quadcopter
EDL	00:42:49,727	00:42:51,519	| IOT091 |	Type drones are
EDL	00:42:51,519	00:42:54,079	| IOT091 |	Going to be given free rein by the FAA to do
EDL	00:42:54,847	00:42:56,383	| IOT091 |	What everyone imagines can do
EDL	00:42:58,175	00:43:00,735	| IOT091 |	That's part of the reason we being a little bit more
EDL	00:43:00,735	00:43:02,527	| IOT091 |	Circumspect at least for the US market
EDL	00:43:04,063	00:43:08,159	| IOT091 |	That makes sense and like one of the big things I think about when I'm thinking about iot
EDL	00:43:09,183	00:43:14,303	| IOT091 |	When you're dealing with the internet of things in this concept of data being everywhere and everything being connected
EDL	00:43:14,815	00:43:16,863	| IOT091 |	Scalability really matters
EDL	00:43:16,863	00:43:17,375	| IOT091 |	If you're going to think about
EDL	00:43:18,143	00:43:18,655	| IOT091 |	Platformer
EDL	00:43:20,447	00:43:22,239	| IOT091 |	And from a regulatory perspective
EDL	00:43:23,007	00:43:25,055	| IOT091 |	It doesn't feel like drones are going to be scalable
EDL	00:43:25,567	00:43:26,335	| IOT091 |	Yeah
EDL	00:43:26,335	00:43:32,479	| IOT091 |	Who knows how the FAA will deal with it and maybe technology
EDL	00:43:33,247	00:43:34,527	| IOT091 |	But
EDL	00:43:34,527	00:43:35,295	| IOT091 |	I just
EDL	00:43:35,295	00:43:37,599	| IOT091 |	You know when you hit all the tales about
EDL	00:43:37,599	00:43:43,743	| IOT091 |	Drugs being delivered over the Border by drones Southern South America guns getting delivered to prison spy drones
EDL	00:43:44,511	00:43:46,559	| IOT091 |	I just I have a tough time believing
EDL	00:43:46,559	00:43:48,351	| IOT091 |	Bed in the United States
EDL	00:43:48,351	00:43:49,631	| IOT091 |	Just going to be
EDL	00:43:49,631	00:43:52,703	| IOT091 |	Go to free rein red rose can do whatever they want
EDL	00:43:52,703	00:43:55,519	| IOT091 |	Sure and I can imagine like UCI Pharmacy drone
EDL	00:43:55,519	00:43:56,287	| IOT091 |	Planet
EDL	00:43:56,287	00:43:56,799	| IOT091 |	The sky are like
EDL	00:43:58,079	00:43:59,103	| IOT091 |	Just a
EDL	00:43:59,103	00:43:59,871	| IOT091 |	Maybe this is
EDL	00:43:59,871	00:44:00,383	| IOT091 |	Some good drugs
EDL	00:44:04,991	00:44:05,759	| IOT091 |	Okay
EDL	00:44:05,759	00:44:07,039	| IOT091 |	Let's go
EDL	00:44:07,039	00:44:13,183	| IOT091 |	Touch on some of these categories so wearables actually is really interesting because we've had a couple deals in 2015
EDL	00:44:13,695	00:44:16,767	| IOT091 |	Wearables was super hot even consumers love them
EDL	00:44:17,279	00:44:21,119	| IOT091 |	It feels like we're heading into like a retrenchment on wearables
EDL	00:44:21,631	00:44:22,911	| IOT091 |	And I am curious
EDL	00:44:23,679	00:44:24,703	| IOT091 |	Where you think that my
EDL	00:44:25,471	00:44:27,519	| IOT091 |	Old temperature of reality
EDL	00:44:29,055	00:44:31,103	| IOT091 |	That's the truth of the matter is
EDL	00:44:31,103	00:44:32,895	| IOT091 |	They haven't been doing very much so far
EDL	00:44:33,919	00:44:34,687	| IOT091 |	And
EDL	00:44:34,687	00:44:35,711	| IOT091 |	As they do more
EDL	00:44:36,223	00:44:38,015	| IOT091 |	And if they develop more sensors
EDL	00:44:38,015	00:44:39,551	| IOT091 |	Centos become more useful
EDL	00:44:39,551	00:44:40,831	| IOT091 |	They'll get deployed in
EDL	00:44:40,831	00:44:41,855	| IOT091 |	Various ways
EDL	00:44:41,855	00:44:44,159	| IOT091 |	Sorry I have an Apple Watch I use it all the time
EDL	00:44:44,671	00:44:46,975	| IOT091 |	And frankly what I like more about it
EDL	00:44:46,975	00:44:47,999	| IOT091 |	Funnily enough
EDL	00:44:47,999	00:44:49,023	| IOT091 |	Notifications
EDL	00:44:49,535	00:44:50,303	| IOT091 |	Dan
EDL	00:44:50,303	00:44:51,583	| IOT091 |	If measuring
EDL	00:44:51,583	00:44:53,631	| IOT091 |	You know the number of steps I walked today
EDL	00:44:53,631	00:44:54,911	| IOT091 |	It just tells you that it's
EDL	00:44:54,911	00:44:56,447	| IOT091 |	None of the variables are
EDL	00:44:56,447	00:44:58,495	| IOT091 |	Let me they been doing a little bit but
EDL	00:44:58,495	00:44:59,775	| IOT091 |	It's been fairly restricted
EDL	00:45:00,543	00:45:05,151	| IOT091 |	But one can imagine like I'd like to have a variable that measure my blood sugar all the time I don't know if
EDL	00:45:06,175	00:45:08,991	| IOT091 |	If you could be integrated into my Apple watch
EDL	00:45:08,991	00:45:09,759	| IOT091 |	Boy
EDL	00:45:09,759	00:45:10,527	| IOT091 |	But that be superheroes
EDL	00:45:11,551	00:45:15,135	| IOT091 |	Let's go back to this concept of The Internet of Things
EDL	00:45:15,647	00:45:16,159	| IOT091 |	Because
EDL	00:45:16,671	00:45:21,791	| IOT091 |	I think what is most baby. Most disruptive but I think one of the things that we don't
EDL	00:45:22,559	00:45:24,863	| IOT091 |	Really comprehend yet is the fact that
EDL	00:45:25,375	00:45:28,191	| IOT091 |	Computers used to be built kind of for individuals
EDL	00:45:28,191	00:45:33,055	| IOT091 |	Or to be owned by entertainment One Singular entity.
EDL	00:45:33,055	00:45:34,079	| IOT091 |	Consumer
EDL	00:45:34,079	00:45:38,687	| IOT091 |	Enterprise when we start putting in everything
EDL	00:45:38,687	00:45:40,735	| IOT091 |	It's impossible to have a one-to-one
EDL	00:45:40,735	00:45:41,247	| IOT091 |	Relationship with
EDL	00:45:42,015	00:45:42,783	| IOT091 |	So
EDL	00:45:42,783	00:45:47,135	| IOT091 |	Like that's for me upkeep standpoint
EDL	00:45:47,135	00:45:47,903	| IOT091 |	Stampy
EDL	00:45:47,903	00:45:52,255	| IOT091 |	Even the way we have it now isn't really sustainable where I have to have an app that works with the specific
EDL	00:45:52,255	00:45:53,535	| IOT091 |	Product on my phone for exam
EDL	00:45:54,303	00:45:55,583	| IOT091 |	So how do you think
EDL	00:45:55,583	00:45:57,631	| IOT091 |	That is going to evolve what even needs to have
EDL	00:45:59,167	00:46:01,727	| IOT091 |	Wow I mean that's such an interesting area
EDL	00:46:02,239	00:46:05,311	| IOT091 |	And you start thinking about security you think about
EDL	00:46:05,311	00:46:06,079	| IOT091 |	Policy
EDL	00:46:06,591	00:46:10,687	| IOT091 |	You think about public policy in terms of who has access to what
EDL	00:46:11,199	00:46:13,247	| IOT091 |	But also on an everyday basis
EDL	00:46:13,759	00:46:16,063	| IOT091 |	What types of services are being enabled
EDL	00:46:16,063	00:46:19,135	| IOT091 |	Every LED light in the future has a camera built in
EDL	00:46:19,135	00:46:23,231	| IOT091 |	What does that mean the the Spheres of control
EDL	00:46:23,231	00:46:24,511	| IOT091 |	An access
EDL	00:46:24,511	00:46:26,047	| IOT091 |	Bar a day obviously
EDL	00:46:26,815	00:46:28,095	| IOT091 |	Russell the fact
EDL	00:46:30,143	00:46:31,935	| IOT091 |	Put it very well it is
EDL	00:46:31,935	00:46:33,727	| IOT091 |	They're going to be many
EDL	00:46:33,727	00:46:34,239	| IOT091 |	Science
EDL	00:46:34,751	00:46:36,543	| IOT091 |	Off the information that comes out
EDL	00:46:37,311	00:46:39,103	| IOT091 |	And many people looking to sort
EDL	00:46:39,615	00:46:40,639	| IOT091 |	Vegas Nevada
EDL	00:46:40,639	00:46:41,407	| IOT091 |	Birth control
EDL	00:46:41,407	00:46:43,711	| IOT091 |	In spheres that they are given permission to enter
EDL	00:46:44,735	00:46:45,759	| IOT091 |	So
EDL	00:46:45,759	00:46:47,551	| IOT091 |	Lot of possibilities
EDL	00:46:48,063	00:46:50,623	| IOT091 |	In areas like Administration
EDL	00:46:51,135	00:46:54,207	| IOT091 |	Security computer vision even
EDL	00:46:54,207	00:46:58,303	| IOT091 |	Genesis Next Generation environmental control applications all of that
EDL	00:46:58,815	00:47:00,095	| IOT091 |	Public places
EDL	00:47:00,863	00:47:03,423	| IOT091 |	This is quite possible and and quite interesting
EDL	00:47:03,423	00:47:05,727	| IOT091 |	So what role do you think the government
EDL	00:47:05,727	00:47:06,239	| IOT091 |	Either
EDL	00:47:06,751	00:47:10,335	| IOT091 |	Federal level or even a municipal level if you're starting to deploy these things
EDL	00:47:11,359	00:47:12,895	| IOT091 |	What is their role in the
EDL	00:47:12,895	00:47:14,943	| IOT091 |	And then what is your role is like a citizen
EDL	00:47:20,575	00:47:26,207	| IOT091 |	I just think these things are so far forward that regulation cats always catches up to Innovation right eventually
EDL	00:47:26,719	00:47:30,303	| IOT091 |	Hopefully I don't think people are going to know what it means for a few years
EDL	00:47:31,071	00:47:31,839	| IOT091 |	So
EDL	00:47:31,839	00:47:33,631	| IOT091 |	I agree I just thinking about like some
EDL	00:47:34,143	00:47:37,215	| IOT091 |	I was thinking about things
EDL	00:47:37,215	00:47:37,727	| IOT091 |	Cameras
EDL	00:47:39,007	00:47:42,847	| IOT091 |	Hurry up we have red light cameras in cities kind of can program
EDL	00:47:42,847	00:47:45,919	| IOT091 |	Like the yellow lights to be super short so more people get caught in the red light
EDL	00:47:46,431	00:47:47,199	| IOT091 |	Right
EDL	00:47:47,199	00:47:48,223	| IOT091 |	If you start thinking it
EDL	00:47:48,735	00:47:51,807	| IOT091 |	About that is just one example of a very low-tech
EDL	00:47:51,807	00:47:52,575	| IOT091 |	Thing happening
EDL	00:47:52,575	00:47:54,111	| IOT091 |	When you start thinking about life
EDL	00:47:54,111	00:47:56,159	| IOT091 |	Parking meters that are digitized
EDL	00:47:56,671	00:48:00,767	| IOT091 |	Basically even having access to see all crime in a city and figuring out
EDL	00:48:01,279	00:48:02,303	| IOT091 |	Cuda charge
EDL	00:48:04,351	00:48:09,215	| IOT091 |	It feels like we're going to need like an oversight board that is not accountable to
EDL	00:48:09,215	00:48:09,983	| IOT091 |	That particular
EDL	00:48:10,495	00:48:11,263	| IOT091 |	Municipal government
EDL	00:48:12,031	00:48:15,103	| IOT091 |	So I've been thinking a standard
EDL	00:48:15,103	00:48:17,919	| IOT091 |	Department of weights and measures Department of Agriculture things
EDL	00:48:18,687	00:48:21,503	| IOT091 |	Gasoline dispension that we have today
EDL	00:48:21,503	00:48:22,783	| IOT091 |	How do you bring some model
EDL	00:48:23,551	00:48:24,575	| IOT091 |	The general account
EDL	00:48:24,575	00:48:25,855	| IOT091 |	Accounting Office GAO
EDL	00:48:26,367	00:48:26,879	| IOT091 |	2
EDL	00:48:27,391	00:48:28,671	| IOT091 |	Connected cities I don't know
EDL	00:48:29,439	00:48:30,975	| IOT091 |	An example would be
EDL	00:48:30,975	00:48:33,279	| IOT091 |	If there was a carbon monoxide sensor in a car
EDL	00:48:33,279	00:48:34,047	| IOT091 |	And it goes off
EDL	00:48:34,559	00:48:36,607	| IOT091 |	Do you want the car to call 911
EDL	00:48:36,607	00:48:37,631	| IOT091 |	I'll have the police come in
EDL	00:48:38,143	00:48:40,447	| IOT091 |	You don't help you or is that an invasion of privacy
EDL	00:48:40,447	00:48:44,031	| IOT091 |	Should you roll the windows down and call the ambulance immediately
EDL	00:48:44,031	00:48:45,567	| IOT091 |	Whether or not you requested it
EDL	00:48:45,567	00:48:47,871	| IOT091 |	And you know you can imagine variations of that
EDL	00:48:48,383	00:48:49,407	| IOT091 |	Gesso
EDL	00:48:49,407	00:48:50,687	| IOT091 |	What is the Concorde send
EDL	00:48:50,687	00:48:52,223	| IOT091 |	Said you were in trouble or
EDL	00:48:52,223	00:48:54,015	| IOT091 |	What is the cost of the sense that you're drunk
EDL	00:48:54,015	00:48:55,807	| IOT091 |	From the driving is that a public
EDL	00:48:55,807	00:48:56,575	| IOT091 |	Hollister
EDL	00:48:56,575	00:48:58,623	| IOT091 |	I was going to say that's probably a very
EDL	00:48:58,623	00:48:59,391	| IOT091 |	That's an excellent news
EDL	00:49:00,927	00:49:03,231	| IOT091 |	By the way there's a company that can already do that
EDL	00:49:03,743	00:49:05,791	| IOT091 |	And they're selling the product to commercial Reb
EDL	00:49:06,559	00:49:08,095	| IOT091 |	Operators
EDL	00:49:08,095	00:49:10,399	| IOT091 |	And forever for all these non-british
EDL	00:49:10,399	00:49:12,703	| IOT091 |	English speakers out their lorries are
EDL	00:49:12,703	00:49:13,727	| IOT091 |	Tractor trailers
EDL	00:49:13,727	00:49:15,519	| IOT091 |	Or Siamese depending on where you live in the US
EDL	00:49:16,799	00:49:20,639	| IOT091 |	Yes those are those are exactly the sort of things
EDL	00:49:21,663	00:49:28,063	| IOT091 |	Once you have automation coming into these if you don't come up with policies around automation it's going to be
EDL	00:49:28,063	00:49:28,575	| IOT091 |	Really exciting and
EDL	00:49:30,111	00:49:34,719	| IOT091 |	We could also say that you know if you're drunk instead of calling police your car just doesn't start
EDL	00:49:34,719	00:49:35,743	| IOT091 |	Which is like
EDL	00:49:35,743	00:49:37,535	| IOT091 |	Basically the robots conspiring
EDL	00:49:37,535	00:49:38,303	| IOT091 |	Against you
EDL	00:49:38,303	00:49:38,815	| IOT091 |	Or
EDL	00:49:40,095	00:49:41,631	| IOT091 |	But if they don't have to tell anybody
EDL	00:49:41,631	00:49:45,471	| IOT091 |	So even for that exam
EDL	00:49:45,983	00:49:49,311	| IOT091 |	Where someone sufficiently drunk you don't want them to be out in the road
EDL	00:49:49,823	00:49:51,359	| IOT091 |	As a hazard to other drivers
EDL	00:49:51,871	00:49:56,991	| IOT091 |	Yes but if they're car doesn't start then they wouldn't be just be safe
EDL	00:49:56,991	00:49:58,271	| IOT091 |	Questions radio drama decline
EDL	00:50:00,575	00:50:01,343	| IOT091 |	Okay
EDL	00:50:01,343	00:50:04,415	| IOT091 |	What date is there anything else you want to talk about I should ask
EDL	00:50:04,415	00:50:10,303	| IOT091 |	What are the trends you're looking to invest in you guys just raised a new fund of 250
EDL	00:50:11,071	00:50:13,631	| IOT091 |	And what are you guys looking to invest in
EDL	00:50:13,631	00:50:15,679	| IOT091 |	Iot security and policy that
EDL	00:50:16,191	00:50:22,335	| IOT091 |	State Optical right now and going to be an area that people are thinking about getting into their products over the next
EDL	00:50:24,383	00:50:27,967	| IOT091 |	Another area that was quite interested in his computer vision so this is
EDL	00:50:27,967	00:50:30,271	| IOT091 |	Really chine proliferation of cameras and
EDL	00:50:30,271	00:50:31,295	| IOT091 |	Types of cameras
EDL	00:50:31,807	00:50:33,599	| IOT091 |	Sarah going in everywhere
EDL	00:50:33,599	00:50:35,903	| IOT091 |	And what do you do with that information
EDL	00:50:36,671	00:50:37,183	| IOT091 |	Beyond
EDL	00:50:37,951	00:50:41,023	| IOT091 |	What Google Facebook like to do witches Drive advertising
EDL	00:50:41,023	00:50:41,791	| IOT091 |	This many other interests
EDL	00:50:42,303	00:50:45,375	| IOT091 |	Applications as well as quite interested in the services around connect
EDL	00:50:45,375	00:50:46,143	| IOT091 |	Vehicles
EDL	00:50:46,143	00:50:47,679	| IOT091 |	Going back to the beginning
EDL	00:50:48,191	00:50:49,215	| IOT091 |	All the fixings
EDL	00:50:49,215	00:50:50,495	| IOT091 |	Statin products
EDL	00:50:50,495	00:50:51,519	| IOT091 |	Temp services
EDL	00:50:51,519	00:50:56,127	| IOT091 |	There may be other services that Jack built on things are super interested in those as well
EDL	00:50:56,127	00:50:59,967	| IOT091 |	Pandora hard for me to Define I mean this example we talked about
EDL	00:50:59,967	00:51:00,991	| IOT091 |	With the carbon monoxide
EDL	00:51:01,503	00:51:04,575	| IOT091 |	Is that something the car company provides or is it somebody else
EDL	00:51:04,575	00:51:06,367	| IOT091 |	Adapter for the car
EDL	00:51:06,367	00:51:07,647	| IOT091 |	Has a software service
EDL	00:51:07,647	00:51:08,671	| IOT091 |	Right
EDL	00:51:08,671	00:51:09,951	| IOT091 |	Taking me many others like that
EDL	00:51:10,463	00:51:11,231	| IOT091 |	Auto stores
EDL	00:51:11,743	00:51:13,279	| IOT091 |	Services are enabled
EDL	00:51:13,279	00:51:14,815	| IOT091 |	That particular return policy
EDL	00:51:14,815	00:51:15,839	| IOT091 |	Services or
EDL	00:51:16,351	00:51:19,679	| IOT091 |	Services enabled by the fact that a certain thing. Connected
EDL	00:51:19,679	00:51:21,983	| IOT091 |	All of those are great interest
EDL	00:51:23,263	00:51:25,055	| IOT091 |	I think I think it's worth
EDL	00:51:25,055	00:51:28,127	| IOT091 |	Underline the fact that just because you own the sensor
EDL	00:51:28,127	00:51:31,199	| IOT091 |	Or just because you own the platform like the car for example
EDL	00:51:31,711	00:51:32,735	| IOT091 |	Doesn't mean
EDL	00:51:32,735	00:51:35,807	| IOT091 |	You're going to automatically win when it comes to delivering that service
EDL	00:51:36,319	00:51:38,367	| IOT091 |	And I think that's a really important thing that
EDL	00:51:38,367	00:51:41,951	| IOT091 |	People usually the bigger companies who own the platform 10/2
EDL	00:51:41,951	00:51:42,975	| IOT091 |	Havis Huber surround
EDL	00:51:42,975	00:51:45,279	| IOT091 |	Well we'll do it and will be amazing
EDL	00:51:45,279	00:51:48,351	| IOT091 |	Because we've made washing machines appliances or cars forever
EDL	00:51:49,887	00:51:51,167	| IOT091 |	And then the sensor guys
EDL	00:51:51,167	00:51:55,007	| IOT091 |	They seem to think they're amazing because
EDL	00:51:55,519	00:51:57,311	| IOT091 |	You can get sensors on things pretty easily
EDL	00:51:57,823	00:51:59,103	| IOT091 |	I'm curious like
EDL	00:51:59,103	00:52:00,383	| IOT091 |	Who will win and where
EDL	00:52:01,407	00:52:01,919	| IOT091 |	I don't know if you have
EDL	00:52:02,687	00:52:03,967	| IOT091 |	Stanley speaking you know
EDL	00:52:04,735	00:52:06,015	| IOT091 |	Become things of the past
EDL	00:52:06,015	00:52:07,807	| IOT091 |	Keep going and they have customers but
EDL	00:52:08,319	00:52:10,111	| IOT091 |	Very rarely today
EDL	00:52:10,623	00:52:11,903	| IOT091 |	Change
EDL	00:52:12,415	00:52:15,999	| IOT091 |	Dynamics of the future or become the Giants of
EDL	00:52:15,999	00:52:17,791	| IOT091 |	Dinosaur Next Generation facts
EDL	00:52:17,791	00:52:19,583	| IOT091 |	You see that all the time
EDL	00:52:19,583	00:52:23,423	| IOT091 |	All right will Gaara thank you so much for coming on the show this week I really appreciate
EDL	00:52:24,959	00:52:27,519	| IOT091 |	Yeah I think it was a pleasure
EDL	00:52:27,519	00:52:33,919	| IOT091 |	Well that's it for this week show thank you so much for listening and we'll see you again next week
EDL	00:52:33,919	00:52:40,319	| IOT091 |	On the Internet of Things podcast and if you don't get enough iot news for this show feel free to
