EDL	00:00:50,944	00:00:51,456	| IOT050 |	All right
EDL	00:00:52,736	00:00:54,272	| IOT050 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:00:54,272	00:00:55,552	| IOT050 |	What happened with ness this week
EDL	00:00:57,088	00:01:00,160	| IOT050 |	Last week we talked about the brand new features which we were
EDL	00:01:00,160	00:01:00,672	| IOT050 |	Solid
EDL	00:01:02,464	00:01:02,976	| IOT050 |	We are happy
EDL	00:01:04,512	00:01:05,536	| IOT050 |	Turns out
EDL	00:01:05,536	00:01:08,352	| IOT050 |	When does introduces new features
EDL	00:01:08,352	00:01:14,752	| IOT050 |	Use your smartphone's location to help calibrate your nest so it knew if you are away from your home or not and the other was actually
EDL	00:01:14,752	00:01:17,824	| IOT050 |	So you could share your nest app with other people
EDL	00:01:17,824	00:01:19,360	| IOT050 |	The password
EDL	00:01:20,128	00:01:22,688	| IOT050 |	When they launched those features
EDL	00:01:22,688	00:01:28,064	| IOT050 |	Nest also had to change and update their terms of service and privacy policies to
EDL	00:01:28,064	00:01:30,624	| IOT050 |	Because they're collecting new information and sharing it with me
EDL	00:01:30,624	00:01:31,136	| IOT050 |	New people
EDL	00:01:31,904	00:01:33,952	| IOT050 |	So when they did that though
EDL	00:01:34,464	00:01:35,488	| IOT050 |	They basically put
EDL	00:01:36,000	00:01:37,280	| IOT050 |	A note in the app
EDL	00:01:37,280	00:01:38,560	| IOT050 |	Would you open your app
EDL	00:01:38,560	00:01:40,096	| IOT050 |	But other people open their apps
EDL	00:01:40,096	00:01:41,632	| IOT050 |	Who discovered that they had
EDL	00:01:41,632	00:01:42,144	| IOT050 |	Two choices
EDL	00:01:45,216	00:01:45,728	| IOT050 |	Conditions
EDL	00:01:47,008	00:01:47,520	| IOT050 |	They could not
EDL	00:01:48,032	00:01:52,896	| IOT050 |	Well the second option is they can get more info about the terms of service changes
EDL	00:01:52,896	00:01:54,688	| IOT050 |	But there's no I don't accept
EDL	00:02:00,064	00:02:05,440	| IOT050 |	So I actually just installed the nest app on a brand new phone because I've been using the Wing Cap on it
EDL	00:02:05,952	00:02:08,512	| IOT050 |	How to get exactly what
EDL	00:02:09,280	00:02:15,680	| IOT050 |	What I would say is relatively big issue in that if folks don't want the new family accounts and Houma
EDL	00:02:15,680	00:02:16,192	| IOT050 |	Assist
EDL	00:02:16,960	00:02:20,032	| IOT050 |	Well it's too bad you don't get to use your nest at all
EDL	00:02:20,032	00:02:21,568	| IOT050 |	If you don't want to
EDL	00:02:21,568	00:02:23,104	| IOT050 |	If you don't want these features
EDL	00:02:23,104	00:02:23,872	| IOT050 |	Or
EDL	00:02:23,872	00:02:26,688	| IOT050 |	Rather you don't have the option to say hey I'd rather
EDL	00:02:27,200	00:02:28,992	| IOT050 |	Grandfathered under the old privacy
EDL	00:02:29,504	00:02:31,296	| IOT050 |	And not use those features
EDL	00:02:32,576	00:02:33,088	| IOT050 |	Emissions
EDL	00:02:36,672	00:02:38,976	| IOT050 |	There's an option that's missing
EDL	00:02:39,744	00:02:40,256	| IOT050 |	So
EDL	00:02:41,280	00:02:42,816	| IOT050 |	This brings up kind of
EDL	00:02:42,816	00:02:46,400	| IOT050 |	Twitter a couple people like me and you're holding my Nest hostage
EDL	00:02:46,912	00:02:48,960	| IOT050 |	And I actually thought back to
EDL	00:02:48,960	00:02:51,264	| IOT050 |	Phillips when they implemented error
EDL	00:02:51,264	00:02:52,544	| IOT050 |	Android update
EDL	00:02:52,544	00:02:54,336	| IOT050 |	Android 400 update
EDL	00:02:54,336	00:02:55,104	| IOT050 |	For the shoe
EDL	00:02:57,152	00:02:59,968	| IOT050 |	Messed up a little bit in their implementation
EDL	00:02:59,968	00:03:03,040	| IOT050 |	Emissions
EDL	00:03:03,552	00:03:07,392	| IOT050 |	It's so basically we agree to like share
EDL	00:03:07,392	00:03:09,696	| IOT050 |	They're photostream and share
EDL	00:03:10,720	00:03:12,256	| IOT050 |	Location
EDL	00:03:12,768	00:03:16,352	| IOT050 |	And also just access to media and files on the device
EDL	00:03:16,864	00:03:17,632	| IOT050 |	That's it
EDL	00:03:17,632	00:03:19,680	| IOT050 |	They didn't agree to that
EDL	00:03:19,680	00:03:20,704	| IOT050 |	Just close
EDL	00:03:21,472	00:03:22,240	| IOT050 |	Music
EDL	00:03:24,032	00:03:26,848	| IOT050 |	It wasn't even you could accept to other three
EDL	00:03:27,360	00:03:30,432	| IOT050 |	Keep using your ass
EDL	00:03:31,200	00:03:32,224	| IOT050 |	Add accepted
EDL	00:03:33,760	00:03:36,576	| IOT050 |	Update on March 3rd
EDL	00:03:36,576	00:03:38,880	| IOT050 |	So now they're doing the permissions
EDL	00:03:39,648	00:03:40,416	| IOT050 |	Correctly
EDL	00:03:41,440	00:03:43,232	| IOT050 |	Pick and choose what you want to share and now you
EDL	00:03:43,744	00:03:44,256	| IOT050 |	Use the app
EDL	00:03:46,048	00:03:47,328	| IOT050 |	It's a little different though
EDL	00:03:50,144	00:03:55,008	| IOT050 |	The issue is in this points to an issue that Kevin and I were talking about before the show which is
EDL	00:03:55,520	00:03:58,080	| IOT050 |	My gosh we have these physical devices
EDL	00:03:58,848	00:04:02,432	| IOT050 |	And we have a rubric for an upgrade permissions on software
EDL	00:04:04,736	00:04:06,784	| IOT050 |	Physical devices installed in your
EDL	00:04:07,552	00:04:09,856	| IOT050 |	Your home like on your wall or in your light sockets
EDL	00:04:10,880	00:04:11,904	| IOT050 |	You know how
EDL	00:04:11,904	00:04:13,184	| IOT050 |	Much of an option to take it orally
EDL	00:04:14,208	00:04:14,976	| IOT050 |	But short of
EDL	00:04:14,976	00:04:19,839	| IOT050 |	Ripping out a piece of hardware and replacing it with something that's comfortable Better or Worse whatever you decide
EDL	00:04:20,351	00:04:21,631	| IOT050 |	And that's obviously not ideal
EDL	00:04:22,399	00:04:23,167	| IOT050 |	Exactly so
EDL	00:04:23,679	00:04:25,215	| IOT050 |	What was the mistake one is
EDL	00:04:25,727	00:04:31,615	| IOT050 |	Intentional but it's not intentional and some like we're going to start sucking all of your data out kind of way but
EDL	00:04:32,127	00:04:33,407	| IOT050 |	I guess there's nothing to say that
EDL	00:04:33,919	00:04:34,943	| IOT050 |	They couldn't do that
EDL	00:04:35,455	00:04:37,759	| IOT050 |	I mean I don't know what Nest is going to do here
EDL	00:04:37,759	00:04:38,527	| IOT050 |	If anything's
EDL	00:04:38,527	00:04:39,295	| IOT050 |	But
EDL	00:04:39,295	00:04:41,855	| IOT050 |	If I were them what I would do is
EDL	00:04:42,367	00:04:47,743	| IOT050 |	Keep the old terms of service for any and also Implement app permissions to use these features
EDL	00:04:48,255	00:04:51,839	| IOT050 |	And if people say no I don't want to use these features meeting you know
EDL	00:04:51,839	00:04:54,143	| IOT050 |	Permissions I want to get permission on my location Etc
EDL	00:04:54,911	00:04:58,751	| IOT050 |	Then just let them stay in the old terms of service because they're using
EDL	00:04:58,751	00:05:00,287	| IOT050 |	Nest as it was
EDL	00:05:00,287	00:05:01,311	| IOT050 |	Under that terms of service
EDL	00:05:02,335	00:05:06,175	| IOT050 |	And therefore if you accept the app permissions to use the new features
EDL	00:05:06,175	00:05:09,503	| IOT050 |	Then you have to buy default agree to the new terms of service
EDL	00:05:09,503	00:05:10,271	| IOT050 |	For the future
EDL	00:05:10,271	00:05:13,855	| IOT050 |	There's nothing on the software side in terms of the permissions the app permissions
EDL	00:05:15,135	00:05:16,159	| IOT050 |	Mitigate this right now
EDL	00:05:16,159	00:05:20,511	| IOT050 |	And I should say in most of these companies would say this
EDL	00:05:20,511	00:05:26,399	| IOT050 |	Most connected Hardware companies build their devices so they will still work even if the app is gone or
EDL	00:05:27,167	00:05:29,215	| IOT050 |	So your nest thermostat was still
EDL	00:05:29,727	00:05:33,055	| IOT050 |	You can still control it for the wall we're just talking about
EDL	00:05:33,055	00:05:33,823	| IOT050 |	Recommend
EDL	00:05:34,335	00:05:36,895	| IOT050 |	Replacing the Philips Hue Lights even if you didn't have it on the app
EDL	00:05:36,895	00:05:38,175	| IOT050 |	I can still turn it on and off
EDL	00:05:38,175	00:05:38,687	| IOT050 |	Light switch
EDL	00:05:39,199	00:05:40,735	| IOT050 |	And and I should mention
EDL	00:05:41,247	00:05:45,343	| IOT050 |	And I said I did not have the nest app installed on this new phone I do have the Wink app
EDL	00:05:45,343	00:05:48,159	| IOT050 |	And that still work perfectly fine
EDL	00:05:48,159	00:05:48,927	| IOT050 |	With
EDL	00:05:48,927	00:05:49,695	| IOT050 |	The nest
EDL	00:05:50,207	00:05:53,023	| IOT050 |	I want to use my phone to control the temperature for an apple
EDL	00:05:53,791	00:05:54,815	| IOT050 |	So I guess you couldn't
EDL	00:05:54,815	00:05:57,119	| IOT050 |	There there's a workaround if you don't want to accept a new privacy
EDL	00:05:57,887	00:05:58,911	| IOT050 |	Terms and conditions
EDL	00:05:58,911	00:05:59,423	| IOT050 |	Possibly
EDL	00:05:59,935	00:06:01,983	| IOT050 |	By going through another
EDL	00:06:01,983	00:06:03,519	| IOT050 |	Github another app
EDL	00:06:05,311	00:06:05,823	| IOT050 |	That feels like
EDL	00:06:07,359	00:06:09,151	| IOT050 |	Yeah
EDL	00:06:09,151	00:06:15,551	| IOT050 |	Very possible it's very possible I don't know how long that may or may not last I haven't tried with you Amazon Echo to see if I can still
EDL	00:06:15,551	00:06:16,575	| IOT050 |	Do things as well so
EDL	00:06:17,343	00:06:20,415	| IOT050 |	Really nice nice nice to own and fix this issue addressed this issue
EDL	00:06:20,927	00:06:25,791	| IOT050 |	And I think it's probably relevant for everyone in this industry to start thinking about
EDL	00:06:27,071	00:06:29,119	| IOT050 |	People feel a sense of ownership
EDL	00:06:29,119	00:06:34,239	| IOT050 |	These devices
EDL	00:06:34,239	00:06:36,799	| IOT050 |	Physically attached to their homes for example yeah
EDL	00:06:37,311	00:06:39,359	| IOT050 |	Figuring out a way to gracefully
EDL	00:06:39,871	00:06:41,919	| IOT050 |	It's not even graceful degradation
EDL	00:06:41,919	00:06:43,967	| IOT050 |	Implementation of
EDL	00:06:44,735	00:06:47,807	| IOT050 |	New features and possibly new privacy
EDL	00:06:47,807	00:06:50,367	| IOT050 |	Right conditions is going to be essential
EDL	00:06:50,879	00:06:57,279	| IOT050 |	Imagine imagine what I'm at the home but think of all the other connected devices imagine if your car
EDL	00:06:57,279	00:07:00,863	| IOT050 |	New terms of service because of something maybe new GPS function
EDL	00:07:00,863	00:07:02,399	| IOT050 |	And you didn't want to use this function
EDL	00:07:02,911	00:07:07,007	| IOT050 |	Well you could either use the function and agree to the new terms of service for your car just stops
EDL	00:07:07,007	00:07:07,775	| IOT050 |	Your car doesn't work
EDL	00:07:08,287	00:07:09,823	| IOT050 |	I mean essentially the same thing
EDL	00:07:10,335	00:07:13,151	| IOT050 |	Soda Springs to mind an issue that happened last year
EDL	00:07:13,151	00:07:14,687	| IOT050 |	John Deere
EDL	00:07:14,687	00:07:16,991	| IOT050 |	And actually General Motors and they
EDL	00:07:16,991	00:07:19,551	| IOT050 |	We're basically saying they used copyright law
EDL	00:07:20,063	00:07:21,343	| IOT050 |	To argue that
EDL	00:07:21,855	00:07:25,439	| IOT050 |	Company are people who bought their devices couldn't modify them
EDL	00:07:25,951	00:07:29,791	| IOT050 |	In ways that basically they argued that modifying their vehicles
EDL	00:07:30,303	00:07:31,071	| IOT050 |	Wood
EDL	00:07:31,071	00:07:32,095	| IOT050 |	Break copyright law
EDL	00:07:32,095	00:07:35,167	| IOT050 |	Chrysler software that runs inside the pickles
EDL	00:07:35,679	00:07:36,703	| IOT050 |	Change your tires
EDL	00:07:39,263	00:07:42,335	| IOT050 |	You're not allowed to get a flat tire and go buy a new John Deere
EDL	00:07:42,335	00:07:46,175	| IOT050 |	And people were very upset they said this is like the opposite of ownership
EDL	00:07:46,175	00:07:50,783	| IOT050 |	People no longer on their vehicles in the copyright office back in November
EDL	00:07:50,783	00:07:51,807	| IOT050 |	Timeout
EDL	00:07:51,807	00:07:53,343	| IOT050 |	And said that actually
EDL	00:07:54,111	00:07:59,743	| IOT050 |	Actually you can modify your vehicle but it's only under certain really Limited
EDL	00:07:59,743	00:08:00,511	| IOT050 |	Conditions
EDL	00:08:01,023	00:08:04,095	| IOT050 |	So you can't violate you know Department of Transportation
EDL	00:08:04,607	00:08:05,887	| IOT050 |	Any payroll so
EDL	00:08:07,679	00:08:13,823	| IOT050 |	This is so funny that this is coming up now because just over the weekend and is not the first time I've done this is the second time I've done this
EDL	00:08:14,335	00:08:16,383	| IOT050 |	But just over the weekend I bought a
EDL	00:08:16,383	00:08:19,967	| IOT050 |	Box that I can make it to the engine of my 2016 Golf R W
EDL	00:08:20,479	00:08:21,503	| IOT050 |	Apr Golf R
EDL	00:08:22,015	00:08:26,367	| IOT050 |	And basically Alters how the engine works because it
EDL	00:08:26,367	00:08:29,951	| IOT050 |	Sends different signals to the ECU or engine control unit
EDL	00:08:29,951	00:08:34,815	| IOT050 |	So I'm getting like an extra 45 horsepower an extra couple PSI of boost on the turbo and
EDL	00:08:35,327	00:08:36,863	| IOT050 |	I mean I'm having fun with it
EDL	00:08:36,863	00:08:38,911	| IOT050 |	6 Pawnee Dr. Funner to drive
EDL	00:08:38,911	00:08:39,423	| IOT050 |	That makes sense
EDL	00:08:40,191	00:08:42,495	| IOT050 |	If I break any laws speeding that's you know
EDL	00:08:42,495	00:08:45,055	| IOT050 |	Where are the parks in there or not that's on me
EDL	00:08:45,055	00:08:50,175	| IOT050 |	But you know how violated any copyright laws now because I don't own the software
EDL	00:08:50,175	00:08:51,967	| IOT050 |	In the engine control unit
EDL	00:08:52,479	00:08:56,575	| IOT050 |	Now that's a VW Thing even though I own the car what do we own
EDL	00:08:56,575	00:08:58,879	| IOT050 |	This is really a good question
EDL	00:08:59,391	00:09:02,975	| IOT050 |	Yes so it especially as more features are enabled by software
EDL	00:09:03,487	00:09:04,511	| IOT050 |	So
EDL	00:09:05,023	00:09:05,535	| IOT050 |	That
EDL	00:09:08,351	00:09:10,911	| IOT050 |	We've come so far
EDL	00:09:11,423	00:09:12,191	| IOT050 |	Both
EDL	00:09:12,191	00:09:12,959	| IOT050 |	Like we said
EDL	00:09:13,471	00:09:18,847	| IOT050 |	The companies building these devices are going to have to think about this but then we might also have some
EDL	00:09:18,847	00:09:20,639	| IOT050 |	Some lawsuits to look forward to
EDL	00:09:21,663	00:09:23,199	| IOT050 |	Okay so
EDL	00:09:23,199	00:09:27,039	| IOT050 |	I probably shouldn't mention this on their then because he probably will have lawsuits
EDL	00:09:28,319	00:09:30,623	| IOT050 |	I didn't change my car honest
EDL	00:09:30,623	00:09:31,903	| IOT050 |	Alright Kevin is
EDL	00:09:31,903	00:09:34,463	| IOT050 |	On the straight and narrow
EDL	00:09:37,535	00:09:40,095	| IOT050 |	Hey you know it's my car if and
EDL	00:09:40,095	00:09:46,239	| IOT050 |	I want to change something where the ECU or the radio that's on me I think
EDL	00:09:46,239	00:09:47,007	| IOT050 |	Can
EDL	00:09:47,007	00:09:50,847	| IOT050 |	Yes I'm held accountable for that if I do something illegal with the vehicle
EDL	00:09:50,847	00:09:52,639	| IOT050 |	Whether or not I modified it
EDL	00:09:52,639	00:09:55,199	| IOT050 |	And yes VW can say I'm out of warranty
EDL	00:09:55,711	00:09:58,271	| IOT050 |	But that's a choice that I choose to make
EDL	00:09:58,271	00:10:00,319	| IOT050 |	Here with mass going back to the very original thing
EDL	00:10:00,831	00:10:02,879	| IOT050 |	Right now I was saying people don't have a choice
EDL	00:10:05,183	00:10:08,255	| IOT050 |	So after spending $250 on a nest thermostat
EDL	00:10:08,767	00:10:09,279	| IOT050 |	It might be pretty much
EDL	00:10:10,815	00:10:13,887	| IOT050 |	Speaking of spending money on connected devices
EDL	00:10:14,399	00:10:17,215	| IOT050 |	We have got a whole new option for people
EDL	00:10:17,983	00:10:19,519	| IOT050 |	SQ his
EDL	00:10:19,519	00:10:20,287	| IOT050 |	Announce
EDL	00:10:20,287	00:10:21,055	| IOT050 |	New
EDL	00:10:21,055	00:10:21,567	| IOT050 |	White
EDL	00:10:24,639	00:10:27,711	| IOT050 |	But that doesn't really sound exciting on the surface but it is
EDL	00:10:27,711	00:10:28,479	| IOT050 |	Because
EDL	00:10:28,479	00:10:32,575	| IOT050 |	These are the Philips Hue White Ambiance lights
EDL	00:10:32,575	00:10:34,367	| IOT050 |	Basically as I see it
EDL	00:10:34,367	00:10:36,671	| IOT050 |	These are tunable white lights
EDL	00:10:36,671	00:10:39,487	| IOT050 |	Switch I actually prefer my house because I like to go from
EDL	00:10:39,999	00:10:46,143	| IOT050 |	Different color temperatures from soft white to warm way to Daylight and so on Depending on time of day and
EDL	00:10:47,423	00:10:50,495	| IOT050 |	And these will do that up from the 2200
EDL	00:10:50,495	00:10:52,799	| IOT050 |	Hey toots 6500 case you get
EDL	00:10:52,799	00:10:55,359	| IOT050 |	Hallway down to like warm yellow all x-ray
EDL	00:10:55,359	00:10:55,871	| IOT050 |	Daylight
EDL	00:10:56,383	00:10:59,455	| IOT050 |	With these tunable bulbs I do not know the cost of these yet by the way
EDL	00:11:00,223	00:11:04,063	| IOT050 |	What's also interesting knows they're smart enough to adjust
EDL	00:11:04,063	00:11:07,391	| IOT050 |	The shade of color temperature throughout the day if you would like
EDL	00:11:07,903	00:11:12,255	| IOT050 |	Similar to and CC I don't know if you use any apps like this with similar to something called
EDL	00:11:12,767	00:11:14,303	| IOT050 |	Flux on a Mac
EDL	00:11:14,303	00:11:15,839	| IOT050 |	Or G Luxe and Chrome
EDL	00:11:16,351	00:11:19,167	| IOT050 |	Basically these are software bits that
EDL	00:11:19,167	00:11:23,775	| IOT050 |	Remove the bluish white light from your screen silver with a reddish light
EDL	00:11:23,775	00:11:26,335	| IOT050 |	And the reason being there been studies saying if your
EDL	00:11:26,335	00:11:28,127	| IOT050 |	Looking at blue white screens
EDL	00:11:29,663	00:11:35,551	| IOT050 |	It becomes harder to sleep you could lose up to an hour of sleep because it stimulates the rods and cones in your eyes and so forth
EDL	00:11:35,551	00:11:38,623	| IOT050 |	So that's kind of the object are these Ambiance lights
EDL	00:11:38,623	00:11:39,391	| IOT050 |	It's
EDL	00:11:39,391	00:11:41,439	| IOT050 |	Progressively changing
EDL	00:11:41,439	00:11:45,791	| IOT050 |	White color based on time of day activity and someone you can do that smartly or you can
EDL	00:11:45,791	00:11:46,559	| IOT050 |	Programming
EDL	00:11:47,071	00:11:48,351	| IOT050 |	Okay and
EDL	00:11:48,351	00:11:49,887	| IOT050 |	If you don't want these
EDL	00:11:50,399	00:11:53,215	| IOT050 |	They still make the Hue Lux Witcher 2
EDL	00:11:53,215	00:11:53,727	| IOT050 |	Dimmable
EDL	00:11:54,239	00:11:55,263	| IOT050 |	White lights
EDL	00:11:55,263	00:11:56,031	| IOT050 |	Yes and
EDL	00:11:57,823	00:11:59,103	| IOT050 |	I'm looking for the price
EDL	00:11:59,103	00:12:00,383	| IOT050 |	To see if there is a price here
EDL	00:12:00,383	00:12:01,919	| IOT050 |	I couldn't find one
EDL	00:12:03,199	00:12:07,807	| IOT050 |	They were just announced that I'd say a day ago so information still trickling out
EDL	00:12:07,807	00:12:08,575	| IOT050 |	And I looked at those
EDL	00:12:09,087	00:12:10,879	| IOT050 |	Hue Lux bulbs
EDL	00:12:10,879	00:12:11,647	| IOT050 |	Dimmable but
EDL	00:12:12,159	00:12:15,487	| IOT050 |	I really like tunable that's just a personal preference in the
EDL	00:12:15,487	00:12:19,583	| IOT050 |	They didn't have one up until then so I've been using the Crees and has worms
EDL	00:12:20,095	00:12:24,191	| IOT050 |	And now there is actually just for people who are is obsessed with lighting as I am
EDL	00:12:24,191	00:12:27,775	| IOT050 |	Is the C by GE that also came out so
EDL	00:12:27,775	00:12:30,591	| IOT050 |	You came out this spring as well and you can order them
EDL	00:12:31,103	00:12:33,663	| IOT050 |	These are there going to be the homekit lights
EDL	00:12:34,175	00:12:37,759	| IOT050 |	And they sleep and see life
EDL	00:12:38,271	00:12:39,551	| IOT050 |	So one is designed
EDL	00:12:40,063	00:12:41,855	| IOT050 |	Are there different bulbs in
EDL	00:12:42,367	00:12:45,951	| IOT050 |	For your bedroom you're supposed to use the Seas sleep lights
EDL	00:12:45,951	00:12:48,767	| IOT050 |	They're supposed to dim all the way down kind of at night
EDL	00:12:49,791	00:12:52,863	| IOT050 |	Using the Circadian rhythm from like the super bright blue
EDL	00:12:52,863	00:12:55,423	| IOT050 |	Daylight to EE warm yellow light
EDL	00:12:55,423	00:12:56,703	| IOT050 |	I guess that's where the Sea comes from
EDL	00:12:59,007	00:13:00,799	| IOT050 |	Oh you like the letter c
EDL	00:13:01,311	00:13:01,823	| IOT050 |	Yeah yeah
EDL	00:13:02,847	00:13:05,151	| IOT050 |	C is for cookie that's good enough for me
EDL	00:13:07,455	00:13:10,015	| IOT050 |	Today Show is brought to you by the letter c
EDL	00:13:10,527	00:13:12,063	| IOT050 |	And the number for just because
EDL	00:13:14,111	00:13:14,623	| IOT050 |	I'm sorry
EDL	00:13:15,135	00:13:16,415	| IOT050 |	That is okay
EDL	00:13:16,415	00:13:18,463	| IOT050 |	Okay
EDL	00:13:18,975	00:13:19,743	| IOT050 |	Too late
EDL	00:13:19,743	00:13:22,303	| IOT050 |	I can't I can't talk about these jokes right now
EDL	00:13:23,583	00:13:26,143	| IOT050 |	So the starter pack is $50 in
EDL	00:13:26,655	00:13:27,423	| IOT050 |	That includes
EDL	00:13:29,727	00:13:30,751	| IOT050 |	And I believe a hug
EDL	00:13:31,263	00:13:32,031	| IOT050 |	Two of each
EDL	00:13:34,079	00:13:37,407	| IOT050 |	Deal
EDL	00:13:37,407	00:13:38,431	| IOT050 |	Regular price is set
EDL	00:13:38,431	00:13:39,199	| IOT050 |	$70
EDL	00:13:39,199	00:13:41,503	| IOT050 |	If you want these
EDL	00:13:42,527	00:13:43,039	| IOT050 |	Weather now
EDL	00:13:43,551	00:13:45,599	| IOT050 |	Because it is a good deal that's a good deal for
EDL	00:13:45,599	00:13:46,367	| IOT050 |	Circadian rhythm
EDL	00:13:47,391	00:13:49,951	| IOT050 |	I might do this although I don't think they work with my wink
EDL	00:13:52,767	00:13:53,535	| IOT050 |	I don't know
EDL	00:13:54,047	00:13:56,095	| IOT050 |	See if they work with wink because
EDL	00:13:56,863	00:13:58,399	| IOT050 |	They're going to be homekit compatible
EDL	00:14:00,959	00:14:01,727	| IOT050 |	And
EDL	00:14:02,495	00:14:04,799	| IOT050 |	Android is coming soon they don't you can't even spell the app
EDL	00:14:08,383	00:14:09,663	| IOT050 |	Going to happen
EDL	00:14:10,175	00:14:10,687	| IOT050 |	So
EDL	00:14:12,479	00:14:12,991	| IOT050 |	That's okay
EDL	00:14:14,527	00:14:16,319	| IOT050 |	For other gadgets that you may want
EDL	00:14:16,319	00:14:18,879	| IOT050 |	We got some exciting news for you
EDL	00:14:19,391	00:14:22,975	| IOT050 |	Oh wait to see by GE bulbs are connected via Bluetooth
EDL	00:14:23,487	00:14:23,999	| IOT050 |	Cheetah mobile app
EDL	00:14:24,767	00:14:26,047	| IOT050 |	So it's phone control
EDL	00:14:27,839	00:14:29,631	| IOT050 |	Could using stairs an Android app
EDL	00:14:34,495	00:14:35,007	| IOT050 |	So
EDL	00:14:35,775	00:14:39,359	| IOT050 |	Knowing that we got to two options in the lighting category for you there
EDL	00:14:39,871	00:14:41,407	| IOT050 |	I am testing a
EDL	00:14:45,247	00:14:46,271	| IOT050 |	And these guys
EDL	00:14:46,783	00:14:51,135	| IOT050 |	Are really cool I've been really excited about them and I've been living them for like a week and a half
EDL	00:14:51,903	00:14:54,207	| IOT050 |	I'm part of that time I was out of town so
EDL	00:14:54,207	00:14:55,743	| IOT050 |	My review is a little
EDL	00:14:55,743	00:14:58,303	| IOT050 |	You're going to hear more about them as I live more with him
EDL	00:14:58,303	00:14:59,071	| IOT050 |	Because they also learned
EDL	00:14:59,583	00:15:01,119	| IOT050 |	So these lights
EDL	00:15:01,119	00:15:02,655	| IOT050 |	The cool thing about them is
EDL	00:15:03,679	00:15:06,495	| IOT050 |	They want to be responsive as opposed to program
EDL	00:15:06,495	00:15:09,567	| IOT050 |	So they have motion sensors and ambient light sensors
EDL	00:15:10,847	00:15:11,359	| IOT050 |	And
EDL	00:15:12,383	00:15:13,919	| IOT050 |	The awesome part about them
EDL	00:15:13,919	00:15:14,687	| IOT050 |	Is
EDL	00:15:14,687	00:15:15,967	| IOT050 |	They are very responsive
EDL	00:15:16,479	00:15:18,015	| IOT050 |	Unlike with my
EDL	00:15:18,015	00:15:21,599	| IOT050 |	When I was testing the connected home plugs
EDL	00:15:21,599	00:15:24,159	| IOT050 |	You would walk into the room and it would be like
EDL	00:15:24,671	00:15:28,255	| IOT050 |	I'll let you walk halfway into the room sometimes and the lightstone wouldn't go on
EDL	00:15:32,607	00:15:35,679	| IOT050 |	But here the second you walk under them food the lights turned on
EDL	00:15:36,191	00:15:39,263	| IOT050 |	And I found in the bedroom this is amazing
EDL	00:15:40,543	00:15:41,823	| IOT050 |	So I installed
EDL	00:15:41,823	00:15:43,103	| IOT050 |	Lights in the bedroom
EDL	00:15:43,103	00:15:44,895	| IOT050 |	My bedroom and
EDL	00:15:44,895	00:15:47,455	| IOT050 |	A little Abner caught the potty room I don't know what the graceful way of
EDL	00:15:49,247	00:15:50,783	| IOT050 |	It's like a bathroom
EDL	00:15:51,295	00:15:53,343	| IOT050 |	Just a room with the toilet in her master bathroom
EDL	00:15:53,855	00:15:56,159	| IOT050 |	So I installed one in there and I installed one
EDL	00:15:56,159	00:15:58,207	| IOT050 |	Or I stopped several in the hallway
EDL	00:15:58,975	00:15:59,999	| IOT050 |	Right outside
EDL	00:15:59,999	00:16:00,767	| IOT050 |	In our bedroom
EDL	00:16:01,535	00:16:02,303	| IOT050 |	So
EDL	00:16:02,303	00:16:03,071	| IOT050 |	Nice
EDL	00:16:03,071	00:16:04,095	| IOT050 |	Use cases are
EDL	00:16:04,607	00:16:08,191	| IOT050 |	They automatically have a circadian rhythm setting
EDL	00:16:08,191	00:16:08,703	| IOT050 |	So
EDL	00:16:09,471	00:16:11,775	| IOT050 |	When I walk in in the middle of the day there
EDL	00:16:12,287	00:16:15,359	| IOT050 |	Wherever they are in their circadian rhythm setting and getting that kind of light
EDL	00:16:16,127	00:16:18,687	| IOT050 |	They have a wake-up alarm function so it can
EDL	00:16:18,687	00:16:20,223	| IOT050 |	But gradually brighten the room
EDL	00:16:20,735	00:16:23,039	| IOT050 |	Had to think of what all that they had a lot of really cool things
EDL	00:16:24,063	00:16:25,855	| IOT050 |	What I've discovered though
EDL	00:16:26,879	00:16:27,647	| IOT050 |	Is
EDL	00:16:27,647	00:16:29,951	| IOT050 |	Living with motion sensors
EDL	00:16:29,951	00:16:31,487	| IOT050 |	Is a little bit hard
EDL	00:16:33,279	00:16:35,583	| IOT050 |	It works really well in
EDL	00:16:35,583	00:16:36,863	| IOT050 |	Like the tiny little bathroom
EDL	00:16:38,911	00:16:41,215	| IOT050 |	It doesn't work as well in the hallway because when
EDL	00:16:41,727	00:16:43,263	| IOT050 |	We get near the hallway
EDL	00:16:43,775	00:16:44,543	| IOT050 |	The lights
EDL	00:16:45,567	00:16:46,847	| IOT050 |	Turn on like even at night
EDL	00:16:47,615	00:16:54,015	| IOT050 |	Editor nighttime mode is kind of nice they have a sleep mode where you can put the lights into your belly to be off or you can
EDL	00:16:54,015	00:16:56,063	| IOT050 |	Make them glow it like 5%
EDL	00:16:57,855	00:16:59,903	| IOT050 |	Series have, second ambient light
EDL	00:16:59,903	00:17:00,415	| IOT050 |	Yes
EDL	00:17:00,927	00:17:03,999	| IOT050 |	But in the middle of the night when you trigger the hallway light
EDL	00:17:03,999	00:17:04,767	| IOT050 |	You're like
EDL	00:17:04,767	00:17:05,791	| IOT050 |	It's still comprise
EDL	00:17:06,303	00:17:07,839	| IOT050 |	Send it times out
EDL	00:17:07,839	00:17:11,679	| IOT050 |	So I have mine set out to timeout at like 1 minute because
EDL	00:17:11,679	00:17:12,191	| IOT050 |	That's a lot of light
EDL	00:17:13,727	00:17:14,239	| IOT050 |	And so
EDL	00:17:14,751	00:17:17,055	| IOT050 |	I guess there's a lot there's a learning curve to using
EDL	00:17:17,567	00:17:18,335	| IOT050 |	But
EDL	00:17:18,335	00:17:20,895	| IOT050 |	Did the closest I have so far to Magic
EDL	00:17:20,895	00:17:23,199	| IOT050 |	And I'm pretty sure that was some software tweaks
EDL	00:17:23,199	00:17:23,711	| IOT050 |	Is there going to be
EDL	00:17:24,223	00:17:25,759	| IOT050 |	Almost as intuitive as they want
EDL	00:17:27,807	00:17:28,575	| IOT050 |	Interesting
EDL	00:17:28,575	00:17:34,975	| IOT050 |	And as I'm looking at the at the bulbs on the stack lighting.com site looks like a hub
EDL	00:17:34,975	00:17:36,767	| IOT050 |	Which uses a sick day for
EDL	00:17:37,279	00:17:39,327	| IOT050 |	Mesh networking all the lights together
EDL	00:17:39,327	00:17:41,119	| IOT050 |	We shouldn't have its own hug but
EDL	00:17:41,119	00:17:42,143	| IOT050 |	They look pretty smart
EDL	00:17:43,679	00:17:47,775	| IOT050 |	Super LaRon so to speak Endo programming requires you to
EDL	00:17:47,775	00:17:49,311	| IOT050 |	Yes I do I mean like
EDL	00:17:50,079	00:17:54,943	| IOT050 |	Again there's some things I wish like I wish I could put the whole house to sleep all at once when I hit
EDL	00:17:54,943	00:17:56,735	| IOT050 |	But instead you have to go room by room
EDL	00:17:58,015	00:17:59,807	| IOT050 |	Which is kind of like
EDL	00:18:00,831	00:18:03,647	| IOT050 |	Like when I lock down for the night boom I want it all back down
EDL	00:18:03,647	00:18:04,671	| IOT050 |	So they don't have
EDL	00:18:04,671	00:18:07,231	| IOT050 |	There is an apple right
EDL	00:18:07,231	00:18:09,535	| IOT050 |	But it doesn't have like an all off for
EDL	00:18:09,535	00:18:10,303	| IOT050 |	Yes
EDL	00:18:10,303	00:18:13,119	| IOT050 |	It does not have it does not have that everything's controlled by the
EDL	00:18:13,887	00:18:15,679	| IOT050 |	Legacy like as it gets
EDL	00:18:15,679	00:18:20,799	| IOT050 |	But if I had these throughout my house like I wouldn't want to put the whole house to sleep maybe if my daughter
EDL	00:18:20,799	00:18:22,079	| IOT050 |	Up in her room
EDL	00:18:22,079	00:18:24,639	| IOT050 |	Yeah where somebody wakes up in the middle of the night
EDL	00:18:24,639	00:18:27,967	| IOT050 |	It's sensitive but I'm in all off mode can't turn on now
EDL	00:18:30,271	00:18:31,807	| IOT050 |	I mean there are still things but
EDL	00:18:32,319	00:18:33,087	| IOT050 |	It is
EDL	00:18:33,087	00:18:35,647	| IOT050 |	The most intuitive so far and the
EDL	00:18:36,159	00:18:38,719	| IOT050 |	The promises that these will learn your
EDL	00:18:38,719	00:18:39,487	| IOT050 |	Kind of habits
EDL	00:18:40,511	00:18:43,583	| IOT050 |	I haven't you I feel like I haven't used them long enough to really learn
EDL	00:18:44,351	00:18:45,887	| IOT050 |	The captain start understanding
EDL	00:18:45,887	00:18:46,911	| IOT050 |	Like what I'm doing things
EDL	00:18:47,935	00:18:49,215	| IOT050 |	But I'm eager to see what that
EDL	00:18:50,495	00:18:51,007	| IOT050 |	Now
EDL	00:18:51,775	00:18:53,567	| IOT050 |	These are $60 a bulb
EDL	00:18:53,567	00:18:55,359	| IOT050 |	I do see what the starter pack is
EDL	00:18:55,871	00:18:59,711	| IOT050 |	Believe it's 150 because it includes the Hub into
EDL	00:19:00,223	00:19:01,759	| IOT050 |	2 Bulbs Plus The Hub
EDL	00:19:02,271	00:19:03,039	| IOT050 |	Okay
EDL	00:19:03,039	00:19:04,063	| IOT050 |	Yeah these are not cheap
EDL	00:19:04,575	00:19:05,343	| IOT050 |	Discern
EDL	00:19:05,343	00:19:09,695	| IOT050 |	BR30
EDL	00:19:09,695	00:19:10,463	| IOT050 |	You know I like
EDL	00:19:10,463	00:19:13,535	| IOT050 |	Standard bulbs which they say are coming soon
EDL	00:19:13,535	00:19:16,351	| IOT050 |	They are at CES and
EDL	00:19:16,351	00:19:19,167	| IOT050 |	The cool thing about those is how do you get a motion sensor
EDL	00:19:19,679	00:19:20,959	| IOT050 |	Work through a lamp
EDL	00:19:23,263	00:19:24,287	| IOT050 |	How do you get an ambient light
EDL	00:19:25,055	00:19:27,103	| IOT050 |	And I should say the ambient light sensor is awesome
EDL	00:19:27,871	00:19:29,663	| IOT050 |	Because it does it pulls
EDL	00:19:29,663	00:19:32,735	| IOT050 |	Some of my lights don't turn on would like the the windows are open
EDL	00:19:35,807	00:19:37,087	| IOT050 |	And I walk into my bedroom
EDL	00:19:37,087	00:19:39,903	| IOT050 |	Only like one of the lights that is kind of further away from
EDL	00:19:39,903	00:19:40,927	| IOT050 |	All the light for me
EDL	00:19:40,927	00:19:41,439	| IOT050 |	Windows
EDL	00:19:43,487	00:19:45,023	| IOT050 |	So it's kind of cool you like
EDL	00:19:45,535	00:19:48,607	| IOT050 |	It's my turn on the light that when you already have light in that room that area
EDL	00:19:49,631	00:19:50,399	| IOT050 |	So
EDL	00:19:50,399	00:19:50,911	| IOT050 |	Interesting
EDL	00:19:51,423	00:19:52,447	| IOT050 |	I'm liking these lights
EDL	00:19:52,959	00:19:56,031	| IOT050 |	I feel like I should also say they integrate with nest
EDL	00:19:56,031	00:19:58,079	| IOT050 |	Southern motion sensor can talk to nest
EDL	00:19:58,079	00:19:59,871	| IOT050 |	And be like hey someone still in the house
EDL	00:19:59,871	00:20:01,407	| IOT050 |	Don't turn off the air conditioning
EDL	00:20:01,919	00:20:04,735	| IOT050 |	And then they also integrate with if this then that
EDL	00:20:04,735	00:20:05,247	| IOT050 |	So I
EDL	00:20:05,759	00:20:07,807	| IOT050 |	Trigger them via the Amazon Echo
EDL	00:20:07,807	00:20:08,575	| IOT050 |	So
EDL	00:20:08,575	00:20:09,855	| IOT050 |	All that works seamlessly
EDL	00:20:10,879	00:20:11,647	| IOT050 |	And issue
EDL	00:20:12,415	00:20:13,951	| IOT050 |	Has potential I like it
EDL	00:20:13,951	00:20:14,463	| IOT050 |	It does
EDL	00:20:15,231	00:20:15,743	| IOT050 |	It's got to be good
EDL	00:20:16,255	00:20:18,303	| IOT050 |	So
EDL	00:20:18,303	00:20:20,351	| IOT050 |	If you're a lighting freak
EDL	00:20:20,351	00:20:22,143	| IOT050 |	Like myself
EDL	00:20:22,143	00:20:26,239	| IOT050 |	I would say go and buy some and start playing with him you're going to need probably a lot
EDL	00:20:26,239	00:20:27,519	| IOT050 |	I would just kind of an investment
EDL	00:20:28,031	00:20:29,311	| IOT050 |	If you want to wait
EDL	00:20:29,311	00:20:30,847	| IOT050 |	Like another couple
EDL	00:20:30,847	00:20:33,919	| IOT050 |	Of weeks or a month or so I bet I could tell you like
EDL	00:20:33,919	00:20:35,967	| IOT050 |	Yes they are significantly better
EDL	00:20:37,759	00:20:38,271	| IOT050 |	Stay tuned
EDL	00:20:39,551	00:20:40,063	| IOT050 |	We have money
EDL	00:20:44,415	00:20:45,695	| IOT050 |	Ring
EDL	00:20:45,695	00:20:47,743	| IOT050 |	But connected doorbell maker
EDL	00:20:47,743	00:20:53,119	| IOT050 |	Has raised 61 million dollars is a serious around so that's a third round of funding for them
EDL	00:20:53,631	00:20:55,679	| IOT050 |	And a racer from Kleiner Perkins
EDL	00:20:56,191	00:20:57,471	| IOT050 |	And they also
EDL	00:20:57,471	00:21:00,031	| IOT050 |	Launched a brand new girl
EDL	00:21:00,799	00:21:03,871	| IOT050 |	And this one is a slightly higher and doorbell it's
EDL	00:21:03,871	00:21:06,687	| IOT050 |	Instead of costing $200 this one cost 250
EDL	00:21:06,687	00:21:08,735	| IOT050 |	This is the ring video doorbell Pro
EDL	00:21:09,247	00:21:10,015	| IOT050 |	It has
EDL	00:21:11,807	00:21:15,391	| IOT050 |	PhD as opposed to 7:20 so little higher hi-def
EDL	00:21:16,416	00:21:20,512	| IOT050 |	And it also is all wired so it has a Slimmer profile
EDL	00:21:20,512	00:21:21,792	| IOT050 |	In the old ring
EDL	00:21:22,816	00:21:26,144	| IOT050 |	$200 rate original
EDL	00:21:27,936	00:21:29,728	| IOT050 |	Serena used to be known as doorbot
EDL	00:21:29,728	00:21:33,824	| IOT050 |	That was not a great product
EDL	00:21:34,592	00:21:36,128	| IOT050 |	Currently waste a lot of money
EDL	00:21:36,128	00:21:37,408	| IOT050 |	Prior to the Stingrays.
EDL	00:21:37,920	00:21:38,944	| IOT050 |	20
EDL	00:21:39,456	00:21:43,552	| IOT050 |	I want to say it was $28 round LED by Richard Branson
EDL	00:21:44,064	00:21:44,832	| IOT050 |	The point is
EDL	00:21:45,600	00:21:47,648	| IOT050 |	New doorbell
EDL	00:21:48,160	00:21:49,440	| IOT050 |	I'm kind of excited about it cuz
EDL	00:21:49,440	00:21:50,464	| IOT050 |	Cuz I love my video doorbell
EDL	00:21:51,232	00:21:54,048	| IOT050 |	Yeah it's not as quite as wide as the old one
EDL	00:21:54,816	00:22:01,216	| IOT050 |	You know because the old one would not sit on my door
EDL	00:22:01,216	00:22:02,752	| IOT050 |	Because it doesn't have batteries
EDL	00:22:03,264	00:22:04,288	| IOT050 |	So you have to wire it in
EDL	00:22:06,080	00:22:08,128	| IOT050 |	You take out the battery and then they also use
EDL	00:22:08,128	00:22:14,272	| IOT050 |	Components for mobile phones that supposed to I guess traditional Electronics components so the whole profile is much slimmer
EDL	00:22:14,784	00:22:18,368	| IOT050 |	I can't wait to see it because maybe I can fit it in my door
EDL	00:22:19,136	00:22:23,488	| IOT050 |	Maybe I was going to try to get you out and they also have interchangeable faceplates
EDL	00:22:23,488	00:22:24,768	| IOT050 |	People who care about the color of
EDL	00:22:25,536	00:22:26,304	| IOT050 |	Which actually is me
EDL	00:22:26,816	00:22:28,608	| IOT050 |	You could change it every day of the week very cool
EDL	00:22:30,912	00:22:32,192	| IOT050 |	So that is
EDL	00:22:32,704	00:22:33,984	| IOT050 |	I don't know I think it's I think it's
EDL	00:22:41,152	00:22:42,176	| IOT050 |	Samantha rings
EDL	00:22:42,688	00:22:43,456	| IOT050 |	Good on them
EDL	00:22:43,456	00:22:43,968	| IOT050 |	And
EDL	00:22:44,480	00:22:45,760	| IOT050 |	Connected yard
EDL	00:22:47,552	00:22:50,624	| IOT050 |	Which is not something I ever thought we'd be talking about all that much but
EDL	00:22:52,928	00:22:55,488	| IOT050 |	I don't have any art that people really really really care about
EDL	00:22:56,000	00:22:58,048	| IOT050 |	We get a lot of actually inbound requests
EDL	00:22:58,048	00:22:59,072	| IOT050 |	How to test sprinkler
EDL	00:23:00,352	00:23:01,888	| IOT050 |	I'm still working out house
EDL	00:23:01,888	00:23:03,424	| IOT050 |	We're supposed to do that so
EDL	00:23:03,424	00:23:07,776	| IOT050 |	Stay tuned because I do want to get some of those on the show and be like hey this is better than that one
EDL	00:23:07,776	00:23:08,288	| IOT050 |	But
EDL	00:23:10,848	00:23:11,616	| IOT050 |	Miracle-Gro
EDL	00:23:11,616	00:23:14,688	| IOT050 |	Scott's Scotts Miracle-Gro they have a
EDL	00:23:14,688	00:23:20,576	| IOT050 |	Baby introduced a platform called the connectedyard platform I think it's called grow dro
EDL	00:23:20,576	00:23:22,624	| IOT050 |	It's a platform
EDL	00:23:22,624	00:23:25,184	| IOT050 |	Basically allow lots of different
EDL	00:23:25,184	00:23:31,328	| IOT050 |	I'll sit mostly Smart Water type controller such as those from Blossom rachio green IQ
EDL	00:23:32,096	00:23:33,888	| IOT050 |	Center to parrot
EDL	00:23:33,888	00:23:34,656	| IOT050 |	Quaintly
EDL	00:23:34,656	00:23:36,960	| IOT050 |	So it's basically platform to get all these
EDL	00:23:36,960	00:23:38,752	| IOT050 |	Sensors and devices talking to each other
EDL	00:23:39,264	00:23:42,592	| IOT050 |	Which is Enter Sandman because all these things would be tied together soil
EDL	00:23:42,592	00:23:46,432	| IOT050 |	Moisture for example would be interesting to a sprinkler for example so
EDL	00:23:46,944	00:23:48,480	| IOT050 |	Connecting
EDL	00:23:48,480	00:23:49,248	| IOT050 |	Peace
EDL	00:23:49,248	00:23:50,784	| IOT050 |	Makes sense to me
EDL	00:23:50,784	00:23:53,600	| IOT050 |	Make sense at Scotts Miracle-Gro add B12 company seducao
EDL	00:23:54,368	00:23:55,648	| IOT050 |	Do we have any
EDL	00:23:55,648	00:23:58,208	| IOT050 |	Other information I don't know when
EDL	00:23:58,208	00:24:00,256	| IOT050 |	IPhones actually launching or has it
EDL	00:24:00,768	00:24:03,072	| IOT050 |	Yeah this is this launched
EDL	00:24:03,072	00:24:04,096	| IOT050 |	Well this lunch
EDL	00:24:04,096	00:24:05,376	| IOT050 |	The news of the popcorn line
EDL	00:24:05,888	00:24:06,400	| IOT050 |	In
EDL	00:24:08,960	00:24:09,472	| IOT050 |	Last week
EDL	00:24:09,984	00:24:12,288	| IOT050 |	I think of it like a health kit for
EDL	00:24:12,288	00:24:17,152	| IOT050 |	Yards just going to go in and tie in with weather data so basically
EDL	00:24:17,664	00:24:18,176	| IOT050 |	Hey
EDL	00:24:18,688	00:24:19,456	| IOT050 |	Water main yard
EDL	00:24:19,968	00:24:22,528	| IOT050 |	It's also kind of promising because
EDL	00:24:22,528	00:24:25,344	| IOT050 |	If this will actuate and it sounds like it will
EDL	00:24:26,112	00:24:27,136	| IOT050 |	It will
EDL	00:24:27,136	00:24:28,416	| IOT050 |	Be able to
EDL	00:24:28,416	00:24:32,000	| IOT050 |	Set some of these things off because it's rachio for examples
EDL	00:24:32,000	00:24:34,304	| IOT050 |	Control controls your irrigation so
EDL	00:24:34,304	00:24:35,840	| IOT050 |	Oil sensor says
EDL	00:24:35,840	00:24:37,120	| IOT050 |	Heart
EDL	00:24:37,632	00:24:38,144	| IOT050 |	It could be like
EDL	00:24:38,912	00:24:40,448	| IOT050 |	Oh I will turn on the butter
EDL	00:24:40,960	00:24:42,752	| IOT050 |	And because it integrates local weather data
EDL	00:24:43,264	00:24:44,800	| IOT050 |	It may also be like
EDL	00:24:44,800	00:24:48,384	| IOT050 |	If you can hold out for just a little longer it's going to rain
EDL	00:24:48,384	00:24:54,016	| IOT050 |	I was just really promising for trout areas drought-stricken areas and also takes idea just a
EDL	00:24:54,528	00:24:57,600	| IOT050 |	Iot stop providing information and starts making it
EDL	00:24:57,600	00:24:58,368	| IOT050 |	Again letting it
EDL	00:24:59,648	00:25:00,416	| IOT050 |	Idevices app
EDL	00:25:01,184	00:25:02,464	| IOT050 |	Even do so without
EDL	00:25:03,744	00:25:07,328	| IOT050 |	Amscot says long-haired lawn care services to
EDL	00:25:07,328	00:25:11,168	| IOT050 |	People will come out and so on
EDL	00:25:11,168	00:25:12,704	| IOT050 |	Your lawn and
EDL	00:25:12,704	00:25:17,824	| IOT050 |	Delta recommend certain fertilizers and certain cycles of fertilization and so on
EDL	00:25:17,824	00:25:19,616	| IOT050 |	So in a sense it could even help
EDL	00:25:19,616	00:25:21,152	| IOT050 |	Company itself
EDL	00:25:21,152	00:25:22,176	| IOT050 |	In terms of that
EDL	00:25:22,688	00:25:26,784	| IOT050 |	But instead of just having one person come out one time and evaluate your lawn
EDL	00:25:26,784	00:25:29,088	| IOT050 |	This is like a constant evaluation which kind of need
EDL	00:25:29,856	00:25:31,392	| IOT050 |	Data and
EDL	00:25:31,904	00:25:34,720	| IOT050 |	I'm going to guess that they're going to let you know the
EDL	00:25:34,720	00:25:35,488	| IOT050 |	Rapper X
EDL	00:25:35,488	00:25:36,256	| IOT050 |	Stop light
EDL	00:25:36,256	00:25:37,024	| IOT050 |	Proper squats
EDL	00:25:38,048	00:25:38,816	| IOT050 |	You know
EDL	00:25:38,816	00:25:40,608	| IOT050 |	Fertilizer indoor plant food
EDL	00:25:41,632	00:25:46,240	| IOT050 |	IT shop if they didn't I didn't
EDL	00:25:46,240	00:25:48,800	| IOT050 |	This is possibly a service Revenue play
EDL	00:25:48,800	00:25:53,152	| IOT050 |	Sending our technicians out to you but it could also be a really useful way to gather data
EDL	00:25:53,664	00:25:55,712	| IOT050 |	To help sell more of their product switches
EDL	00:25:56,224	00:25:57,504	| IOT050 |	I want to see a really
EDL	00:25:57,504	00:26:00,064	| IOT050 |	Good way for a big company to be like
EDL	00:26:00,064	00:26:01,856	| IOT050 |	Hey here's how an open platform
EDL	00:26:03,648	00:26:04,416	| IOT050 |	So
EDL	00:26:04,416	00:26:05,440	| IOT050 |	Yay
EDL	00:26:06,720	00:26:07,232	| IOT050 |	Very cool
EDL	00:26:07,744	00:26:08,256	| IOT050 |	Super Bowl
EDL	00:26:08,768	00:26:09,536	| IOT050 |	All right
EDL	00:26:09,536	00:26:11,328	| IOT050 |	And I was at South by Southwest
EDL	00:26:11,840	00:26:14,912	| IOT050 |	And I spent a lot of time talking to
EDL	00:26:15,424	00:26:19,008	| IOT050 |	Companies and I'm just trying to think about the coolest things I saw
EDL	00:26:19,776	00:26:22,336	| IOT050 |	When I give you one in the rest I'll have to think about
EDL	00:26:22,336	00:26:25,920	| IOT050 |	Tell me about next show that I did see a company called Bernoulli
EDL	00:26:26,432	00:26:28,736	| IOT050 |	And if you are interested in cocktails
EDL	00:26:28,736	00:26:29,248	| IOT050 |	Like myself
EDL	00:26:29,760	00:26:32,064	| IOT050 |	This is really a neat idea
EDL	00:26:32,064	00:26:33,600	| IOT050 |	This is going to be launched
EDL	00:26:34,368	00:26:35,648	| IOT050 |	Is lunch now
EDL	00:26:37,184	00:26:38,208	| IOT050 |	What is RR
EDL	00:26:39,232	00:26:40,256	| IOT050 |	Blue toothpaste
EDL	00:26:40,768	00:26:43,584	| IOT050 |	Bottle stoppers for your bar so your
EDL	00:26:43,584	00:26:44,352	| IOT050 |	Your alcohol collection
EDL	00:26:44,864	00:26:48,192	| IOT050 |	Eight of them for $300
EDL	00:26:48,192	00:26:49,728	| IOT050 |	I know it's kind of
EDL	00:26:55,872	00:26:57,152	| IOT050 |	You go to the app and you're like
EDL	00:26:58,176	00:26:58,944	| IOT050 |	I have the follow
EDL	00:26:59,968	00:27:02,016	| IOT050 |	Things in my bar
EDL	00:27:02,016	00:27:03,552	| IOT050 |	Are the drinks you can make with that
EDL	00:27:03,552	00:27:04,832	| IOT050 |	I would like to meet this one
EDL	00:27:05,344	00:27:06,112	| IOT050 |	And then you
EDL	00:27:06,112	00:27:07,392	| IOT050 |	Pour the drink
EDL	00:27:07,392	00:27:09,184	| IOT050 |	When you're pouring the alcohol in
EDL	00:27:09,696	00:27:11,744	| IOT050 |	It's going to actually stop
EDL	00:27:11,744	00:27:12,768	| IOT050 |	The flow of liquid
EDL	00:27:12,768	00:27:13,536	| IOT050 |	Reaches the Impala
EDL	00:27:14,816	00:27:15,840	| IOT050 |	Clever
EDL	00:27:16,864	00:27:18,144	| IOT050 |	I saw it and it works
EDL	00:27:18,144	00:27:19,424	| IOT050 |	I was actually that was like the most
EDL	00:27:19,936	00:27:20,448	| IOT050 |	Magical
EDL	00:27:20,960	00:27:23,264	| IOT050 |	So the top
EDL	00:27:23,264	00:27:23,776	| IOT050 |	Lights up
EDL	00:27:24,288	00:27:25,568	| IOT050 |	It's like oh this is the gym
EDL	00:27:34,272	00:27:35,040	| IOT050 |	All right
EDL	00:27:35,040	00:27:38,624	| IOT050 |	But I get your address
EDL	00:27:38,624	00:27:40,416	| IOT050 |	And they won't catch me
EDL	00:27:40,928	00:27:44,512	| IOT050 |	Go ahead kids make the drink for Daddy
EDL	00:27:44,512	00:27:45,536	| IOT050 |	Chinese martini
EDL	00:27:48,096	00:27:50,656	| IOT050 |	Cuz I played with a lot of robotic bartending
EDL	00:27:53,984	00:27:56,032	| IOT050 |	Because you got a stick
EDL	00:27:58,592	00:27:59,616	| IOT050 |	Professional use
EDL	00:28:02,944	00:28:04,736	| IOT050 |	Similar idea only
EDL	00:28:04,736	00:28:08,320	| IOT050 |	That sucks up all the moisture and then you got to clean all those tubes
EDL	00:28:09,344	00:28:10,624	| IOT050 |	I don't know when you're dealing with like
EDL	00:28:11,648	00:28:12,672	| IOT050 |	Alcohol
EDL	00:28:12,672	00:28:15,232	| IOT050 |	Mixers were talking about you no stickiness
EDL	00:28:15,744	00:28:16,768	| IOT050 |	So I was like
EDL	00:28:17,280	00:28:18,048	| IOT050 |	That seems like a lot of work
EDL	00:28:18,560	00:28:23,424	| IOT050 |	A lot of money this is actually relatively speaking much cheaper and
EDL	00:28:23,936	00:28:26,496	| IOT050 |	It really doesn't change how you
EDL	00:28:26,496	00:28:29,568	| IOT050 |	Make a drink today in essentially other than
EDL	00:28:29,568	00:28:32,640	| IOT050 |	Doing the measuring and the recipe for you so it's not like there's
EDL	00:28:32,640	00:28:34,432	| IOT050 |	A convoluted hurdler involve
EDL	00:28:35,456	00:28:36,992	| IOT050 |	There's there's just about
EDL	00:28:39,040	00:28:40,320	| IOT050 |	No hubs good
EDL	00:28:40,320	00:28:42,112	| IOT050 |	They're not wifi-connected bottle.
EDL	00:28:42,112	00:28:42,624	| IOT050 |	What's good
EDL	00:28:43,392	00:28:44,416	| IOT050 |	Russia how are they connect
EDL	00:28:47,232	00:28:50,304	| IOT050 |	Got it makes sense make sense
EDL	00:28:51,584	00:28:52,608	| IOT050 |	Spider Lily
EDL	00:28:52,608	00:28:53,632	| IOT050 |	Go to my Christmas list
EDL	00:28:54,144	00:28:55,424	| IOT050 |	Dude there you go
EDL	00:28:55,424	00:28:57,984	| IOT050 |	Presumably that's what they say
EDL	00:28:58,752	00:28:59,776	| IOT050 |	Keep an eye on
EDL	00:29:00,288	00:29:01,056	| IOT050 |	All right

EDL	00:29:37,664	00:29:39,968	| IOT050 |	I am super excited about this because I
EDL	00:29:39,968	00:29:40,480	| IOT050 |	Hate
EDL	00:29:40,992	00:29:43,040	| IOT050 |	Grabbing my wallet out and you guys have
EDL	00:29:43,552	00:29:44,320	| IOT050 |	You have this new
EDL	00:29:45,600	00:29:46,624	| IOT050 |	Call the thing
EDL	00:29:46,624	00:29:47,904	| IOT050 |	Coming for lack of a better word
EDL	00:29:48,416	00:29:49,440	| IOT050 |	With the Arnold
EDL	00:29:49,440	00:29:51,232	| IOT050 |	Palmer Invitational golf tournament
EDL	00:29:52,000	00:29:54,048	| IOT050 |	And you guys have put
EDL	00:29:54,048	00:29:58,144	| IOT050 |	You've worked with a partner to embed payment technology into a golf glove
EDL	00:29:58,656	00:29:59,936	| IOT050 |	Which I think is kind of fun
EDL	00:30:00,448	00:30:01,216	| IOT050 |	You can
EDL	00:30:01,216	00:30:04,032	| IOT050 |	Wave your hand to pay for Refreshments on the golf course
EDL	00:30:04,544	00:30:06,336	| IOT050 |	Can you do other things with it
EDL	00:30:06,336	00:30:10,688	| IOT050 |	I think that's probably the you know that the most prominent
EDL	00:30:10,688	00:30:11,968	| IOT050 |	Case for this
EDL	00:30:12,480	00:30:15,552	| IOT050 |	So with the gospel is actually a proof-of-concept
EDL	00:30:16,064	00:30:20,928	| IOT050 |	I'm it's something that were able to enable through a broader program that we have called
EDL	00:30:20,928	00:30:22,208	| IOT050 |	Commerce for every device
EDL	00:30:22,720	00:30:24,768	| IOT050 |	So what that program allows us
EDL	00:30:24,768	00:30:25,792	| IOT050 |	What to do is
EDL	00:30:25,792	00:30:27,840	| IOT050 |	In a really simple easy
EDL	00:30:27,840	00:30:28,352	| IOT050 |	Picture away
EDL	00:30:29,888	00:30:31,424	| IOT050 |	Is it possible for
EDL	00:30:31,936	00:30:36,032	| IOT050 |	All kinds of different devices wearables jewelry clothing
EDL	00:30:36,032	00:30:38,080	| IOT050 |	The manufacturers of those
EDL	00:30:38,080	00:30:39,360	| IOT050 |	You know item
EDL	00:30:39,360	00:30:41,408	| IOT050 |	To connect with our platform
EDL	00:30:41,920	00:30:42,944	| IOT050 |	And Hobbes
EDL	00:30:42,944	00:30:44,992	| IOT050 |	The consumer that using that device
EDL	00:30:44,992	00:30:48,064	| IOT050 |	Or Gadget or clothing or wearable
EDL	00:30:48,064	00:30:48,832	| IOT050 |	Ask
EDL	00:30:48,832	00:30:50,624	| IOT050 |	To have their payment credentials
EDL	00:30:51,136	00:30:52,416	| IOT050 |	Gander MasterCard pay
EDL	00:30:52,416	00:30:52,928	| IOT050 |	Credentials
EDL	00:30:53,440	00:30:56,256	| IOT050 |	Securely put on to that device
EDL	00:30:56,256	00:30:57,792	| IOT050 |	And made available for that device
EDL	00:30:57,792	00:30:59,328	| IOT050 |	To use and so
EDL	00:30:59,328	00:31:02,144	| IOT050 |	Although you know not in production and we did do that
EDL	00:31:03,936	00:31:04,704	| IOT050 |	Special
EDL	00:31:05,216	00:31:09,056	| IOT050 |	Bespoke for the Arnold Palmer
EDL	00:31:09,056	00:31:10,080	| IOT050 |	Invitational
EDL	00:31:10,080	00:31:13,152	| IOT050 |	It is an example of what can be done with our cut
EDL	00:31:13,152	00:31:14,176	| IOT050 |	Sandusky
EDL	00:31:14,176	00:31:15,200	| IOT050 |	Callaway Golf Clubs
EDL	00:31:15,712	00:31:17,760	| IOT050 |	And there's a payment chip
EDL	00:31:17,760	00:31:18,528	| IOT050 |	In the club
EDL	00:31:19,040	00:31:20,832	| IOT050 |	That connects via Bluetooth
EDL	00:31:20,832	00:31:22,112	| IOT050 |	On a phone
EDL	00:31:22,624	00:31:23,648	| IOT050 |	And you can
EDL	00:31:23,648	00:31:25,696	| IOT050 |	Scan your card credentials
EDL	00:31:25,696	00:31:28,512	| IOT050 |	Charlie into the phone
EDL	00:31:28,512	00:31:30,048	| IOT050 |	You know at which point
EDL	00:31:30,048	00:31:31,328	| IOT050 |	The app basically makes
EDL	00:31:31,328	00:31:32,864	| IOT050 |	MasterCard
EDL	00:31:33,376	00:31:37,472	| IOT050 |	We assure know that you want to put your credential on for the device
EDL	00:31:37,472	00:31:39,520	| IOT050 |	Stuart a methodology we have
EDL	00:31:39,520	00:31:41,568	| IOT050 |	We make sure with the issuer that you are you
EDL	00:31:42,080	00:31:45,408	| IOT050 |	And then we make that payment credential available
EDL	00:31:45,408	00:31:49,248	| IOT050 |	In a tokenize way so we don't make the real credential available
EDL	00:31:49,248	00:31:51,296	| IOT050 |	But instead a surrogate
EDL	00:31:51,296	00:31:51,808	| IOT050 |	Credential
EDL	00:31:52,320	00:31:53,344	| IOT050 |	Together with
EDL	00:31:53,344	00:31:54,880	| IOT050 |	Secure cryptographic keys
EDL	00:31:55,392	00:32:01,024	| IOT050 |	That make sure that each transaction is safe and secure and unique that uses the same technology as EMV chip card
EDL	00:32:01,792	00:32:02,560	| IOT050 |	Okay
EDL	00:32:02,560	00:32:03,584	| IOT050 |	So that was that was like
EDL	00:32:03,584	00:32:04,608	| IOT050 |	Everything I need to know
EDL	00:32:06,656	00:32:07,936	| IOT050 |	So this is a prototype
EDL	00:32:07,936	00:32:08,448	| IOT050 |	Close
EDL	00:32:08,960	00:32:09,728	| IOT050 |	Can people actually use it
EDL	00:32:10,240	00:32:14,592	| IOT050 |	Well the people at the API and will be able to use it but I mean
EDL	00:32:14,592	00:32:16,128	| IOT050 |	Don't currently have plans
EDL	00:32:16,640	00:32:18,176	| IOT050 |	Available commercially
EDL	00:32:18,176	00:32:22,016	| IOT050 |	But we'll see when you know what gauge the interest on its Callaway or any other
EDL	00:32:22,016	00:32:23,552	| IOT050 |	Glove manufacturer
EDL	00:32:23,552	00:32:24,576	| IOT050 |	Would like to
EDL	00:32:25,088	00:32:25,856	| IOT050 |	You know it's definitely
EDL	00:32:26,368	00:32:30,976	| IOT050 |	Possible as an example of why it's possible
EDL	00:32:30,976	00:32:31,744	| IOT050 |	Partnerships with
EDL	00:32:32,256	00:32:33,280	| IOT050 |	Many other
EDL	00:32:33,280	00:32:36,352	| IOT050 |	Clothing jewelry device manufacturers and
EDL	00:32:36,352	00:32:39,680	| IOT050 |	Closest to this actually is a designer named Adam Selman
EDL	00:32:39,680	00:32:40,448	| IOT050 |	I'm here
EDL	00:32:40,448	00:32:41,984	| IOT050 |	Is probably most famous for designing
EDL	00:32:42,496	00:32:44,800	| IOT050 |	Dresses for Rihanna he does all the cost
EDL	00:32:44,800	00:32:45,824	| IOT050 |	Inspire her tours
EDL	00:32:47,360	00:32:49,408	| IOT050 |	You're beautiful clothes available
EDL	00:32:49,408	00:32:51,712	| IOT050 |	I'm at high end stores today
EDL	00:32:51,712	00:32:54,528	| IOT050 |	Operation with Nordstrom
EDL	00:32:54,528	00:32:55,552	| IOT050 |	We worked with him
EDL	00:32:56,064	00:33:00,160	| IOT050 |	To again make some prototypes but later this year we will be working with him
EDL	00:33:00,160	00:33:02,208	| IOT050 |	How to make those commercially available
EDL	00:33:02,208	00:33:03,488	| IOT050 |	I'm in the prototypes
EDL	00:33:03,488	00:33:05,536	| IOT050 |	He created included address
EDL	00:33:06,048	00:33:08,096	| IOT050 |	Sunglasses a handbag on
EDL	00:33:09,376	00:33:11,168	| IOT050 |	I'm so they weren't golf clubs they were
EDL	00:33:11,936	00:33:12,448	| IOT050 |	Fashion
EDL	00:33:13,216	00:33:14,496	| IOT050 |	Winter gloves
EDL	00:33:14,496	00:33:16,544	| IOT050 |	That is in the winter you are
EDL	00:33:16,544	00:33:18,592	| IOT050 |	Going out in the morning you know you can
EDL	00:33:18,592	00:33:19,872	| IOT050 |	Citrulline
EDL	00:33:19,872	00:33:21,408	| IOT050 |	Payment credential.
EDL	00:33:21,920	00:33:23,968	| IOT050 |	So that example if you're in London UK
EDL	00:33:23,968	00:33:28,320	| IOT050 |	I can wave your hands over the turnstile at the CFL magically entering
EDL	00:33:29,856	00:33:31,136	| IOT050 |	Be on your way with your eyes
EDL	00:33:32,160	00:33:32,672	| IOT050 |	That magical in
EDL	00:33:33,184	00:33:39,584	| IOT050 |	And you guys have agreement not just with some of these by Ashley this is not allergic
EDL	00:33:39,584	00:33:43,680	| IOT050 |	Company but you have an agreement with one of our favorite devices which is brainly
EDL	00:33:43,680	00:33:50,080	| IOT050 |	Cocktail ring that I currently wear it whenever I'm dressed up and I want to get notifications on my phone or from my
EDL	00:33:50,080	00:33:51,616	| IOT050 |	Looking at my phone
EDL	00:33:51,616	00:33:53,408	| IOT050 |	And soon I'll be able to use it
EDL	00:33:53,920	00:33:54,688	| IOT050 |	Pay for things with my
EDL	00:33:55,712	00:34:00,576	| IOT050 |	That's exactly right so we've been working with ringly
EDL	00:34:00,576	00:34:01,600	| IOT050 |	Such a great company
EDL	00:34:01,600	00:34:05,440	| IOT050 |	And you were very lucky to in the fall when we announced
EDL	00:34:06,464	00:34:08,256	| IOT050 |	Star Commerce for every device program
EDL	00:34:08,768	00:34:10,048	| IOT050 |	The name of this program that were
EDL	00:34:10,560	00:34:12,096	| IOT050 |	Using two
EDL	00:34:12,096	00:34:16,448	| IOT050 |	Easily connect with the device manufacturers and enable payments on the devices
EDL	00:34:16,448	00:34:18,240	| IOT050 |	When we was actually one of our launch partner
EDL	00:34:19,008	00:34:20,288	| IOT050 |	So we worked with Chris
EDL	00:34:20,288	00:34:22,848	| IOT050 |	Go bring Lisa and her team
EDL	00:34:22,848	00:34:23,872	| IOT050 |	To actually put
EDL	00:34:24,384	00:34:28,736	| IOT050 |	Picture painted credentials on to wait that we had at the show and they actually work
EDL	00:34:29,248	00:34:31,808	| IOT050 |	And so for me I mean I'm a working mom
EDL	00:34:32,832	00:34:35,648	| IOT050 |	Simplification of my day today that I
EDL	00:34:36,160	00:34:40,512	| IOT050 |	Do you know I connect my ring any in the morning anyway to my phone
EDL	00:34:40,512	00:34:41,792	| IOT050 |	In the fall or
EDL	00:34:41,792	00:34:42,816	| IOT050 |	Later this year
EDL	00:34:43,840	00:34:44,608	| IOT050 |	Later this year
EDL	00:34:45,376	00:34:48,192	| IOT050 |	Will be able to I will also be able to
EDL	00:34:48,192	00:34:49,216	| IOT050 |	The Charlie
EDL	00:34:49,216	00:34:51,008	| IOT050 |	I'm transfer via
EDL	00:34:51,008	00:34:53,568	| IOT050 |	Bluetooth encrypted Bluetooth technology
EDL	00:34:53,568	00:34:54,592	| IOT050 |	I'll be able to
EDL	00:34:54,592	00:34:58,432	| IOT050 |	Shirley transfer cards you know accounts by provisioned through an app on my phone
EDL	00:34:58,944	00:35:00,224	| IOT050 |	To my ring lyrics
EDL	00:35:00,224	00:35:01,760	| IOT050 |	And then when I'm
EDL	00:35:01,760	00:35:04,064	| IOT050 |	You know off on my day I'll be able to
EDL	00:35:04,832	00:35:06,368	| IOT050 |	You again later this year
EDL	00:35:06,368	00:35:12,256	| IOT050 |	At my ring at Starbucks when I'm getting my coffee I'll be able to tap my ring on a New York City
EDL	00:35:12,256	00:35:13,792	| IOT050 |	Cab near when I'm
EDL	00:35:13,792	00:35:20,192	| IOT050 |	Running between meeting for example
EDL	00:35:20,192	00:35:20,960	| IOT050 |	Functional
EDL	00:35:20,960	00:35:21,728	| IOT050 |	Beautiful
EDL	00:35:21,728	00:35:26,336	| IOT050 |	We're working with ringlets a great example of how we're adding payment functionality to something
EDL	00:35:26,336	00:35:27,360	| IOT050 |	Is already
EDL	00:35:27,360	00:35:29,152	| IOT050 |	Very useful to the
EDL	00:35:29,152	00:35:31,712	| IOT050 |	Until all it needs is to have an NF
EDL	00:35:31,712	00:35:33,760	| IOT050 |	NFC and Bluetooth chip in it
EDL	00:35:33,760	00:35:34,272	| IOT050 |	Route to work
EDL	00:35:35,040	00:35:39,392	| IOT050 |	Pretty much I mean the underlying technology is
EDL	00:35:39,392	00:35:42,976	| IOT050 |	A check that's enabled with NFC and then also
EDL	00:35:42,976	00:35:43,488	| IOT050 |	Bluetooth
EDL	00:35:44,000	00:35:45,536	| IOT050 |	However the
EDL	00:35:45,536	00:35:46,304	| IOT050 |	There's obviously
EDL	00:35:46,304	00:35:47,328	| IOT050 |	An integration that happened
EDL	00:35:47,840	00:35:48,608	| IOT050 |	Between
EDL	00:35:48,608	00:35:52,448	| IOT050 |	Either the device manufacturer or an enabler that they're working with
EDL	00:35:52,960	00:35:56,288	| IOT050 |	And we're working with Darius and ambler's including nxp
EDL	00:35:56,288	00:35:57,056	| IOT050 |	Qualcomm
EDL	00:35:57,056	00:35:59,872	| IOT050 |	And coin there's several others that have not been announced yet
EDL	00:35:59,872	00:36:02,176	| IOT050 |	We're going to be integrating with our
EDL	00:36:02,176	00:36:02,944	| IOT050 |	System
EDL	00:36:02,944	00:36:03,712	| IOT050 |	So that
EDL	00:36:03,712	00:36:05,248	| IOT050 |	The device manufacturer doesn't nest
EDL	00:36:06,272	00:36:07,552	| IOT050 |	Integrate directly with us
EDL	00:36:08,320	00:36:09,088	| IOT050 |	Got it
EDL	00:36:09,088	00:36:09,856	| IOT050 |	Now
EDL	00:36:09,856	00:36:15,488	| IOT050 |	So let's let's take this back as couple steps in as like a normal person who's going about their day
EDL	00:36:15,488	00:36:16,768	| IOT050 |	Ordering a coffee
EDL	00:36:17,280	00:36:19,584	| IOT050 |	What is the process look like I wave it
EDL	00:36:19,584	00:36:21,376	| IOT050 |	I always my hand can I buy like
EDL	00:36:22,144	00:36:24,448	| IOT050 |	I don't know a stereo with this or how does
EDL	00:36:24,960	00:36:27,008	| IOT050 |	What are the limits to my my new-found
EDL	00:36:28,544	00:36:32,128	| IOT050 |	In fact this is actually all of this
EDL	00:36:32,128	00:36:34,432	| IOT050 |	Technology is actually available in Market
EDL	00:36:34,944	00:36:35,712	| IOT050 |	Today
EDL	00:36:35,712	00:36:39,040	| IOT050 |	You know so for many years we've had available
EDL	00:36:39,040	00:36:41,856	| IOT050 |	Not only in the United States but globally
EDL	00:36:41,856	00:36:44,416	| IOT050 |	What's called MasterCard contactless technology
EDL	00:36:44,928	00:36:46,720	| IOT050 |	It's built on NFC
EDL	00:36:46,720	00:36:47,744	| IOT050 |	Technology
EDL	00:36:47,744	00:36:49,792	| IOT050 |	Actually is underpinned by the same
EDL	00:36:49,792	00:36:51,584	| IOT050 |	Technology
EDL	00:36:52,352	00:36:54,144	| IOT050 |	You know it's available at more than
EDL	00:36:54,144	00:36:55,936	| IOT050 |	4 million payment terminals
EDL	00:36:55,936	00:36:56,448	| IOT050 |	Globally
EDL	00:36:57,216	00:36:57,984	| IOT050 |	So
EDL	00:36:58,496	00:37:01,568	| IOT050 |	Each country has its own specific limit
EDL	00:37:02,080	00:37:03,616	| IOT050 |	How much you can
EDL	00:37:03,616	00:37:05,152	| IOT050 |	What the
EDL	00:37:05,152	00:37:06,176	| IOT050 |	Amount of the transaction
EDL	00:37:06,944	00:37:07,712	| IOT050 |	Complete
EDL	00:37:07,712	00:37:10,784	| IOT050 |	Using contactless functionality without having a
EDL	00:37:10,784	00:37:12,320	| IOT050 |	An additional cardholder
EDL	00:37:13,088	00:37:15,392	| IOT050 |	So here's what I mean in the United States
EDL	00:37:15,392	00:37:17,696	| IOT050 |	Does a $50 contactless limit
EDL	00:37:17,696	00:37:19,232	| IOT050 |	That means that up to
EDL	00:37:19,232	00:37:20,000	| IOT050 |	$50
EDL	00:37:20,000	00:37:20,768	| IOT050 |	You can do it
EDL	00:37:23,072	00:37:24,096	| IOT050 |	Without having
EDL	00:37:24,096	00:37:27,168	| IOT050 |	To do an additional thing like provide a signature
EDL	00:37:27,680	00:37:28,448	| IOT050 |	After the fact
EDL	00:37:28,960	00:37:29,728	| IOT050 |	On credit
EDL	00:37:30,240	00:37:31,264	| IOT050 |	Until
EDL	00:37:31,264	00:37:33,568	| IOT050 |	You if you wanted to actually buy
EDL	00:37:33,568	00:37:35,360	| IOT050 |	A stereo or a TV
EDL	00:37:35,360	00:37:36,896	| IOT050 |	Best Buy
EDL	00:37:36,896	00:37:37,664	| IOT050 |	Obviously that's going
EDL	00:37:38,176	00:37:39,456	| IOT050 |	Over $50
EDL	00:37:39,456	00:37:40,480	| IOT050 |	In that case
EDL	00:37:40,480	00:37:42,016	| IOT050 |	You would tap your ring
EDL	00:37:42,528	00:37:44,832	| IOT050 |	And then it was at the merchant
EDL	00:37:44,832	00:37:45,856	| IOT050 |	Terminal
EDL	00:37:45,856	00:37:49,184	| IOT050 |	Thank you for a signature after the fact I do this actually every week with
EDL	00:37:49,952	00:37:52,512	| IOT050 |	Either Apple pay or Samsung pay I use both
EDL	00:37:52,512	00:37:53,280	| IOT050 |	I'm at
EDL	00:37:54,816	00:37:55,328	| IOT050 |	Every weekend
EDL	00:37:55,840	00:38:00,192	| IOT050 |	There you go so let's think about this because I'm very curious about
EDL	00:38:00,192	00:38:04,544	| IOT050 |	The world of the future of payments because right now I can pay with my phone
EDL	00:38:05,056	00:38:05,568	| IOT050 |	So
EDL	00:38:06,336	00:38:09,152	| IOT050 |	Allen tablet down I got my ring Wrigley now
EDL	00:38:09,664	00:38:14,528	| IOT050 |	Baby I got some crazy handbag
EDL	00:38:15,040	00:38:15,552	| IOT050 |	So
EDL	00:38:16,064	00:38:17,344	| IOT050 |	I guess is it
EDL	00:38:17,344	00:38:21,696	| IOT050 |	Oversaturation or how do you view liked the the user going through their day
EDL	00:38:21,696	00:38:25,280	| IOT050 |	In choosing these things thinking about how to
EDL	00:38:25,280	00:38:28,096	| IOT050 |	Make their payments does it just become like whatever I
EDL	00:38:28,096	00:38:28,608	| IOT050 |	It's convenient
EDL	00:38:29,888	00:38:30,400	| IOT050 |	Exactly
EDL	00:38:30,912	00:38:36,288	| IOT050 |	So thank you you hit the nail on the head so we don't think that there's going to be
EDL	00:38:36,288	00:38:37,824	| IOT050 |	A winner here
EDL	00:38:37,824	00:38:41,408	| IOT050 |	You know people have individual taste then we're in a world where
EDL	00:38:43,200	00:38:47,296	| IOT050 |	Customization and personalization and they want to be able to
EDL	00:38:47,296	00:38:48,576	| IOT050 |	Do things like pee
EDL	00:38:49,088	00:38:54,208	| IOT050 |	With whatever is most accessible or convenient or attractive to them just like you know you pick your
EDL	00:38:54,720	00:38:55,744	| IOT050 |	Clothes everyday and you
EDL	00:38:55,744	00:38:56,512	| IOT050 |	Pickyourshoes
EDL	00:38:57,024	00:38:59,328	| IOT050 |	Millions and millions of choices for those things
EDL	00:38:59,840	00:39:02,912	| IOT050 |	There will probably be many many choices for
EDL	00:39:02,912	00:39:03,680	| IOT050 |	What object
EDL	00:39:04,704	00:39:05,728	| IOT050 |	You enable
EDL	00:39:05,728	00:39:08,032	| IOT050 |	Car payment and I think different
EDL	00:39:08,032	00:39:10,848	| IOT050 |	Ways to pay are going to be more prevalent
EDL	00:39:10,848	00:39:13,408	| IOT050 |	Four different use cases right so everything is
EDL	00:39:13,408	00:39:14,432	| IOT050 |	Actually
EDL	00:39:14,432	00:39:15,712	| IOT050 |	Use case appropriate
EDL	00:39:16,224	00:39:18,272	| IOT050 |	You know you won't be using
EDL	00:39:18,272	00:39:19,552	| IOT050 |	A ring
EDL	00:39:19,552	00:39:21,344	| IOT050 |	The tap and pay
EDL	00:39:21,344	00:39:22,368	| IOT050 |	Charlie at
EDL	00:39:22,368	00:39:23,392	| IOT050 |	A restaurant
EDL	00:39:23,904	00:39:26,208	| IOT050 |	Possible but I wouldn't necessarily
EDL	00:39:26,208	00:39:28,256	| IOT050 |	Think that that's the go-to thing for
EDL	00:39:28,256	00:39:32,096	| IOT050 |	Example of a car dealership in your buying a car or
EDL	00:39:32,096	00:39:34,656	| IOT050 |	Or if even you're at a high-end luxury retailer
EDL	00:39:34,656	00:39:35,168	| IOT050 |	Weather
EDL	00:39:36,192	00:39:38,240	| IOT050 |	Sensitive very hands-on experience
EDL	00:39:38,752	00:39:39,776	| IOT050 |	You may not be
EDL	00:39:39,776	00:39:40,800	| IOT050 |	You're not in a rush
EDL	00:39:40,800	00:39:41,568	| IOT050 |	You're not
EDL	00:39:41,568	00:39:46,688	| IOT050 |	It's not giving you that kind of seemed like instant gratification pop and go quick
EDL	00:39:46,688	00:39:48,736	| IOT050 |	Convenience as you might expect
EDL	00:39:48,736	00:39:50,272	| IOT050 |	For transit or four
EDL	00:39:50,272	00:39:53,344	| IOT050 |	Parking are for a quick service restaurant or
EDL	00:39:53,344	00:39:58,464	| IOT050 |	You know that and I think there's going to be many different payment options
EDL	00:39:58,464	00:39:59,488	| IOT050 |	Better all states
EDL	00:39:59,488	00:40:01,280	| IOT050 |	Temperature at work together
EDL	00:40:01,280	00:40:02,048	| IOT050 |	To make payment
EDL	00:40:02,048	00:40:04,864	| IOT050 |	Seamless chart for the consumer
EDL	00:40:05,376	00:40:06,656	| IOT050 |	Got it
EDL	00:40:07,168	00:40:07,680	| IOT050 |	Total sense
EDL	00:40:08,448	00:40:10,752	| IOT050 |	I'm trying to imagine buying a car on
EDL	00:40:10,752	00:40:12,800	| IOT050 |	Credit and I'm like wow I need a bigger credit line
EDL	00:40:15,616	00:40:17,408	| IOT050 |	Or really terrible car I'm not sure
EDL	00:40:19,200	00:40:25,344	| IOT050 |	With the idea of you mention security so so let's talk about the protections that are given to the consumer
EDL	00:40:26,112	00:40:28,416	| IOT050 |	When they do this because I can think of a couple things
EDL	00:40:28,928	00:40:29,952	| IOT050 |	There's obviously like
EDL	00:40:29,952	00:40:35,328	| IOT050 |	Oh my gosh formation is going through the air and we talked about how that's not actually a payment information that's a token
EDL	00:40:35,328	00:40:36,096	| IOT050 |	So yeah
EDL	00:40:36,096	00:40:40,192	| IOT050 |	But then there's also worries about you know NFC sticker RFID sniffing
EDL	00:40:40,704	00:40:43,776	| IOT050 |	There's probably worried about people stealing your ring or
EDL	00:40:43,776	00:40:46,336	| IOT050 |	Gloves I mean I lose my gloves all the time
EDL	00:40:46,336	00:40:48,128	| IOT050 |	So how do you deal with those kind of issues
EDL	00:40:48,896	00:40:51,456	| IOT050 |	So they're each different I'll take them one at a time so
EDL	00:40:51,968	00:40:52,992	| IOT050 |	Whatsapp sniffing
EDL	00:40:54,784	00:40:55,808	| IOT050 |	Alrighty it is
EDL	00:40:55,808	00:40:56,320	| IOT050 |	Tokenize
EDL	00:40:56,832	00:41:00,928	| IOT050 |	So the great thing about a token is that it's not only a surrogate value
EDL	00:41:01,440	00:41:03,232	| IOT050 |	And it doesn't only have
EDL	00:41:03,232	00:41:05,792	| IOT050 |	You know a unique code your cryptographic
EDL	00:41:05,792	00:41:06,560	| IOT050 |	Psychesec
EDL	00:41:06,560	00:41:07,840	| IOT050 |	Create a unique code
EDL	00:41:07,840	00:41:10,656	| IOT050 |	So we also lock it lock that token down
EDL	00:41:10,656	00:41:11,424	| IOT050 |	Buy Channel
EDL	00:41:11,936	00:41:13,472	| IOT050 |	In some cases by merchants
EDL	00:41:14,240	00:41:15,008	| IOT050 |	So here's what I mean
EDL	00:41:15,776	00:41:16,800	| IOT050 |	If I have
EDL	00:41:16,800	00:41:17,568	| IOT050 |	A token
EDL	00:41:17,568	00:41:20,128	| IOT050 |	Available on my Langley ring
EDL	00:41:20,640	00:41:23,968	| IOT050 |	There's some specific domain controllers that are around that
EDL	00:41:24,480	00:41:26,272	| IOT050 |	Cytokines only going to be able to
EDL	00:41:26,272	00:41:26,784	| IOT050 |	To be used
EDL	00:41:27,552	00:41:29,600	| IOT050 |	Ancient Oculus location
EDL	00:41:30,112	00:41:31,648	| IOT050 |	Coming son the device
EDL	00:41:32,416	00:41:36,000	| IOT050 |	So if someone were to sniff it and put it on white plastic for example
EDL	00:41:36,512	00:41:38,304	| IOT050 |	And swipe it at the point of sale
EDL	00:41:38,304	00:41:40,352	| IOT050 |	MasterCard with no in the back end
EDL	00:41:40,864	00:41:41,888	| IOT050 |	But that transaction
EDL	00:41:41,888	00:41:42,656	| IOT050 |	You know that.
EDL	00:41:42,656	00:41:44,192	| IOT050 |	Credential mother had been compromised
EDL	00:41:44,704	00:41:46,240	| IOT050 |	And we would not allow that turn back
EDL	00:41:47,776	00:41:50,080	| IOT050 |	So because of these domain controllers it becomes
EDL	00:41:50,848	00:41:53,663	| IOT050 |	Much more secure because even if a token is
EDL	00:41:54,175	00:41:57,503	| IOT050 |	Stolen and we do assume that the hackers are going to hack
EDL	00:41:57,503	00:41:59,551	| IOT050 |	And that it will be data compromises
EDL	00:42:00,063	00:42:01,343	| IOT050 |	Throw the whole purpose
EDL	00:42:01,343	00:42:02,367	| IOT050 |	Tokenization
EDL	00:42:02,367	00:42:04,159	| IOT050 |	Was to make sure that the data
EDL	00:42:04,159	00:42:06,719	| IOT050 |	If it was comp if it were to be compromised
EDL	00:42:06,719	00:42:07,231	| IOT050 |	But useless
EDL	00:42:07,999	00:42:10,559	| IOT050 |	And that's what we've accomplished with it
EDL	00:42:10,559	00:42:11,327	| IOT050 |	Innovation technology
EDL	00:42:12,607	00:42:13,119	| IOT050 |	Okay awesome
EDL	00:42:14,143	00:42:14,655	| IOT050 |	And then
EDL	00:42:15,167	00:42:15,935	| IOT050 |	About
EDL	00:42:15,935	00:42:17,471	| IOT050 |	Like someone just grabbing my
EDL	00:42:17,471	00:42:18,239	| IOT050 |	Mike loves her
EDL	00:42:18,751	00:42:20,031	| IOT050 |	Less likely my ring
EDL	00:42:21,311	00:42:24,639	| IOT050 |	I think it's going to be different depending on the device
EDL	00:42:24,639	00:42:26,687	| IOT050 |	So this is like a multi-layered answer but
EDL	00:42:27,199	00:42:28,223	| IOT050 |	I'll try to make it simple
EDL	00:42:29,247	00:42:30,015	| IOT050 |	Some
EDL	00:42:30,015	00:42:31,807	| IOT050 |	Wearables are jewelry or
EDL	00:42:32,831	00:42:34,367	| IOT050 |	Some devices that
EDL	00:42:34,367	00:42:35,647	| IOT050 |	You know we're talking about right now
EDL	00:42:36,159	00:42:38,719	| IOT050 |	Will only work if they're Tethered to your phone
EDL	00:42:39,231	00:42:43,583	| IOT050 |	This may be because for example with ringly the whole point of a ringly ring
EDL	00:42:44,095	00:42:45,631	| IOT050 |	That is only active
EDL	00:42:45,631	00:42:47,423	| IOT050 |	If it's connected to your phone
EDL	00:42:47,423	00:42:49,215	| IOT050 |	Because its purpose main purpose
EDL	00:42:49,215	00:42:49,983	| IOT050 |	Did she give you notice
EDL	00:42:49,983	00:42:51,775	| IOT050 |	Applications of things that are happening
EDL	00:42:51,775	00:42:52,543	| IOT050 |	On your device
EDL	00:42:53,567	00:42:55,615	| IOT050 |	And so with the wiggly rangaiah
EDL	00:42:55,615	00:42:56,895	| IOT050 |	Expect the payment
EDL	00:42:56,895	00:42:58,687	| IOT050 |	Nationality will only be enabled
EDL	00:42:58,687	00:43:01,759	| IOT050 |	If there is that tether if you're in close proximity to your phone
EDL	00:43:02,271	00:43:03,807	| IOT050 |	Someone grabs your ringing
EDL	00:43:03,807	00:43:05,855	| IOT050 |	When you know a mile away and then
EDL	00:43:07,647	00:43:08,415	| IOT050 |	Another local
EDL	00:43:08,415	00:43:09,183	| IOT050 |	Whatever
EDL	00:43:09,183	00:43:10,975	| IOT050 |	Store that had a contactless terminal
EDL	00:43:10,975	00:43:12,255	| IOT050 |	It wouldn't work
EDL	00:43:12,255	00:43:15,583	| IOT050 |	There's other examples like Fitness bands that may
EDL	00:43:16,351	00:43:17,631	| IOT050 |	Had built in
EDL	00:43:17,631	00:43:21,215	| IOT050 |	Persistent authentication Technologies
EDL	00:43:21,727	00:43:23,263	| IOT050 |	You authenticate one
EDL	00:43:23,263	00:43:25,567	| IOT050 |	In the morning you put your mini band on
EDL	00:43:26,079	00:43:30,943	| IOT050 |	You know that you're able to use it for access to get into your workplace or into your computer at things like that
EDL	00:43:31,711	00:43:32,479	| IOT050 |	Like
EDL	00:43:32,479	00:43:35,295	| IOT050 |	Is there something in that device called
EDL	00:43:35,295	00:43:39,391	| IOT050 |	Persistent authentication and if it's attached to your skin
EDL	00:43:39,903	00:43:40,927	| IOT050 |	You know your biometric
EDL	00:43:40,927	00:43:42,207	| IOT050 |	Check signal
EDL	00:43:42,207	00:43:43,999	| IOT050 |	That is still on your hand in that
EDL	00:43:43,999	00:43:47,327	| IOT050 |	That's your hand it knows that that's the magic of the minivan
EDL	00:43:47,327	00:43:50,399	| IOT050 |	It will know the only enable payment functionality
EDL	00:43:50,399	00:43:51,679	| IOT050 |	When not persistent
EDL	00:43:52,703	00:43:53,983	| IOT050 |	It won't work otherwise
EDL	00:43:54,751	00:43:56,799	| IOT050 |	So again I'm giving different examples
EDL	00:43:57,311	00:43:59,871	| IOT050 |	Each of these wearables employee kind of a difference
EDL	00:44:00,383	00:44:01,919	| IOT050 |	Methodology for
EDL	00:44:01,919	00:44:02,943	| IOT050 |	Securing the payment
EDL	00:44:02,943	00:44:05,503	| IOT050 |	There are some examples though where there won't be
EDL	00:44:06,015	00:44:08,319	| IOT050 |	Authentication and it won't require a tether
EDL	00:44:08,831	00:44:11,647	| IOT050 |	Ian in that instance we're relying on the fact that it is
EDL	00:44:12,671	00:44:13,695	| IOT050 |	Tokenized
EDL	00:44:14,207	00:44:15,487	| IOT050 |	That there are
EDL	00:44:15,487	00:44:18,303	| IOT050 |	What you can do without additional cardholders
EDL	00:44:18,303	00:44:20,351	| IOT050 |	Application of course with MasterCard
EDL	00:44:20,351	00:44:21,887	| IOT050 |	There's always be reliability
EDL	00:44:23,679	00:44:27,263	| IOT050 |	You know it's something that we have is a benefit for cardholders globally
EDL	00:44:27,775	00:44:31,871	| IOT050 |	And today for example if your physical card is lost or stolen which
EDL	00:44:31,871	00:44:32,639	| IOT050 |	Very well
EDL	00:44:32,639	00:44:33,919	| IOT050 |	Adidas happens all the time
EDL	00:44:34,431	00:44:36,735	| IOT050 |	You as a cardholder are not responsible for
EDL	00:44:36,735	00:44:38,271	| IOT050 |	Any transaction that happened
EDL	00:44:38,783	00:44:40,319	| IOT050 |	You know after it's lost
EDL	00:44:40,319	00:44:42,879	| IOT050 |	So long as you were reported in a reasonable.
EDL	00:44:43,391	00:44:45,439	| IOT050 |	So there are going to still be those
EDL	00:44:45,439	00:44:48,511	| IOT050 |	Use cases and again I think they'll be less and less
EDL	00:44:48,511	00:44:51,327	| IOT050 |	Gets better and better and we are encouraging
EDL	00:44:52,351	00:44:54,911	| IOT050 |	Enjoy that are manufacturers to build in
EDL	00:44:55,423	00:44:57,727	| IOT050 |	Some kind of additional security protection
EDL	00:44:58,495	00:45:01,567	| IOT050 |	But with tokenization is zero liability protection
EDL	00:45:01,567	00:45:03,615	| IOT050 |	George
EDL	00:45:04,639	00:45:08,223	| IOT050 |	Awesome yes my credit card does get stolen like at least once a year
EDL	00:45:08,991	00:45:11,039	| IOT050 |	I don't blame you and I appreciate that
EDL	00:45:11,551	00:45:12,575	| IOT050 |	MasterCard
EDL	00:45:12,575	00:45:14,367	| IOT050 |	And also Visa very quick to let me know
EDL	00:45:16,927	00:45:17,695	| IOT050 |	So
EDL	00:45:17,695	00:45:19,487	| IOT050 |	Can I pay with this
EDL	00:45:19,487	00:45:21,535	| IOT050 |	With these types of devices
EDL	00:45:21,535	00:45:23,327	| IOT050 |	At any contactless payment
EDL	00:45:23,839	00:45:25,631	| IOT050 |	Place or do I have to okay
EDL	00:45:25,631	00:45:28,703	| IOT050 |	It kind of sounded like there were side deals that had to happen
EDL	00:45:28,703	00:45:30,495	| IOT050 |	And it's not at all
EDL	00:45:31,519	00:45:35,871	| IOT050 |	Not at all she has to do is actually turn on
EDL	00:45:35,871	00:45:36,639	| IOT050 |	Kentucky Kentucky
EDL	00:45:36,639	00:45:37,407	| IOT050 |	Functionality
EDL	00:45:37,919	00:45:40,479	| IOT050 |	So the large majority so
EDL	00:45:40,479	00:45:44,319	| IOT050 |	North of 90% I don't know the exact number but more than 90%
EDL	00:45:45,343	00:45:47,391	| IOT050 |	New terminals that are shipping today
