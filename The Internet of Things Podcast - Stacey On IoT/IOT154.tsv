EDL	00:02:16,704	00:02:19,008	| IOT154 |	It's getting worse that's why
EDL	00:02:20,032	00:02:21,312	| IOT154 |	Oh
EDL	00:02:21,312	00:02:23,360	| IOT154 |	I thought we patched things up
EDL	00:02:25,408	00:02:25,920	| IOT154 |	You are right
EDL	00:02:26,432	00:02:27,712	| IOT154 |	It is getting worse
EDL	00:02:28,736	00:02:29,504	| IOT154 |	Kerfuffle
EDL	00:02:29,504	00:02:30,528	| IOT154 |	If you like it movie on
EDL	00:02:31,040	00:02:31,808	| IOT154 |	So Ava
EDL	00:02:32,320	00:02:33,344	| IOT154 |	Initially
EDL	00:02:33,344	00:02:35,904	| IOT154 |	Paid attention to this because Amazon and Google
EDL	00:02:37,184	00:02:39,232	| IOT154 |	Tennyson the kerfuffled and
EDL	00:02:39,232	00:02:42,048	| IOT154 |	You no longer plays YouTube videos on your Amazon
EDL	00:02:42,816	00:02:43,584	| IOT154 |	Shell
EDL	00:02:43,584	00:02:46,144	| IOT154 |	Order Fire TV
EDL	00:02:48,704	00:02:49,728	| IOT154 |	My daughter being one of them
EDL	00:02:50,240	00:02:50,752	| IOT154 |	Yes my.
EDL	00:02:52,800	00:02:53,312	| IOT154 |	Now
EDL	00:02:53,824	00:02:55,104	| IOT154 |	Amazon has taken
EDL	00:02:55,104	00:02:55,616	| IOT154 |	Nest
EDL	00:02:56,128	00:02:57,152	| IOT154 |	Off of it
EDL	00:02:57,152	00:02:59,968	| IOT154 |	Website well they're still there for the moment
EDL	00:03:00,736	00:03:07,136	| IOT154 |	Only remaining inventory that Amazon has on Nest products I'm looking at it right now the Amazon site and they still show the nest
EDL	00:03:07,136	00:03:08,672	| IOT154 |	Thermostat and security camera
EDL	00:03:08,672	00:03:10,720	| IOT154 |	Anything they've been selling
EDL	00:03:10,720	00:03:13,024	| IOT154 |	It's still there but when they're sold out
EDL	00:03:13,024	00:03:15,328	| IOT154 |	Apparently they will not be replaced
EDL	00:03:15,328	00:03:16,864	| IOT154 |	And no new
EDL	00:03:16,864	00:03:17,888	| IOT154 |	Nest products
EDL	00:03:17,888	00:03:24,288	| IOT154 |	Will be put on Amazon and this all came about on a conference call between Amazon and Google apparently and people
EDL	00:03:24,288	00:03:29,664	| IOT154 |	That were reportedly on the cauley-stein The Nest side feel that it came right from the top of Amazon
EDL	00:03:29,664	00:03:31,456	| IOT154 |	Jeff Bezos and
EDL	00:03:31,968	00:03:33,504	| IOT154 |	This is just getting ugly
EDL	00:03:34,528	00:03:35,808	| IOT154 |	I mean
EDL	00:03:35,808	00:03:36,576	| IOT154 |	I think I bought
EDL	00:03:36,576	00:03:37,856	| IOT154 |	I mean you bought a nest cam
EDL	00:03:37,856	00:03:38,624	| IOT154 |	Continued
EDL	00:03:39,648	00:03:40,672	| IOT154 |	I bought mine
EDL	00:03:41,696	00:03:46,560	| IOT154 |	Yes I did I know that you can go out to like various stores retail stores
EDL	00:03:46,560	00:03:47,072	| IOT154 |	If they are
EDL	00:03:47,584	00:03:49,888	| IOT154 |	With so many people do shop
EDL	00:03:49,888	00:03:51,424	| IOT154 |	On Amazon either for
EDL	00:03:51,424	00:03:54,240	| IOT154 |	A better price the free shipping whatever else you know
EDL	00:03:54,240	00:03:59,872	| IOT154 |	I think personally Google should be trying to work with Amazon to figure this out because I think that's going to hurt
EDL	00:03:59,872	00:04:01,408	| IOT154 |	Google more than hurts Amazon
EDL	00:04:01,920	00:04:05,248	| IOT154 |	Guess I never blame it when a product isn't available on Amazon I don't blame you
EDL	00:04:06,016	00:04:06,528	| IOT154 |	Although
EDL	00:04:07,552	00:04:09,856	| IOT154 |	In this case I definitely do
EDL	00:04:09,856	00:04:12,160	| IOT154 |	I would not be surprised I want to say I do
EDL	00:04:12,160	00:04:15,232	| IOT154 |	Believe it's Amazon's pulling the plug here so to speak
EDL	00:04:15,232	00:04:18,559	| IOT154 |	But you know when you Google pulled the plug on YouTube from
EDL	00:04:18,559	00:04:21,119	| IOT154 |	The Fire TV products and the echoes
EDL	00:04:21,119	00:04:24,447	| IOT154 |	You know Amazon probably was not very happy cuz that hurt the customer
EDL	00:04:24,447	00:04:27,007	| IOT154 |	Experiencing what we have to do is with install the silk browser
EDL	00:04:27,519	00:04:30,335	| IOT154 |	On the Fire TV and then go to YouTube on the web and
EDL	00:04:30,335	00:04:31,103	| IOT154 |	It's a pain in the neck
EDL	00:04:31,615	00:04:33,919	| IOT154 |	And Amazon surely didn't like that so this
EDL	00:04:33,919	00:04:35,711	| IOT154 |	Appears to me to be retaliation
EDL	00:04:36,735	00:04:38,527	| IOT154 |	Well let's see how far this goes
EDL	00:04:39,295	00:04:40,831	| IOT154 |	Right now my nest
EDL	00:04:40,831	00:04:42,367	| IOT154 |	Secure still works with Madam a
EDL	00:04:43,647	00:04:44,159	| IOT154 |	Do you think that could be
EDL	00:04:44,927	00:04:47,487	| IOT154 |	If they want to continue this fat
EDL	00:04:47,487	00:04:49,279	| IOT154 |	What is next I would think that would be
EDL	00:04:51,583	00:04:52,863	| IOT154 |	Yeah we don't want that
EDL	00:04:52,863	00:04:56,191	| IOT154 |	And this actually speaks little problem of bino the silos that
EDL	00:04:56,191	00:05:01,823	| IOT154 |	Can be built in iot instead of the interoperability which I know what to talk about with him or the different products it's kind of worrisome
EDL	00:05:02,847	00:05:03,359	| IOT154 |	Incredibly worried
EDL	00:05:06,687	00:05:09,247	| IOT154 |	Potentially worrisome things
EDL	00:05:10,015	00:05:12,319	| IOT154 |	Interpolated ecobee the maker of
EDL	00:05:12,319	00:05:13,599	| IOT154 |	What used to be my favorite song
EDL	00:05:13,599	00:05:14,367	| IOT154 |	Smart thermostat
EDL	00:05:14,367	00:05:15,391	| IOT154 |	And is still
EDL	00:05:15,391	00:05:16,415	| IOT154 |	Turn sign
EDL	00:05:16,415	00:05:16,927	| IOT154 |	Smart thermostat
EDL	00:05:18,463	00:05:20,255	| IOT154 |	They've raised 61 million dollars
EDL	00:05:20,255	00:05:20,767	| IOT154 |	And part of that
EDL	00:05:22,303	00:05:23,071	| IOT154 |	Meditation
EDL	00:05:23,583	00:05:24,607	| IOT154 |	I was going to say it.
EDL	00:05:26,655	00:05:29,215	| IOT154 |	So this is really interesting timing
EDL	00:05:29,215	00:05:31,263	| IOT154 |	Because the press release that they sent out
EDL	00:05:31,263	00:05:34,335	| IOT154 |	Really focused hard on the fact that Amazon just bought
EDL	00:05:34,335	00:05:34,847	| IOT154 |	Rickford
EDL	00:05:35,359	00:05:35,871	| IOT154 |	A billion plus
EDL	00:05:36,895	00:05:40,735	| IOT154 |	And we talked about this last week that fell to us kind of like a weird anomaly
EDL	00:05:40,735	00:05:43,039	| IOT154 |	I'm kind of the end of the consumer iot
EDL	00:05:45,599	00:05:46,367	| IOT154 |	Play it on
EDL	00:05:46,367	00:05:49,439	| IOT154 |	I can see if Amazon wants to take this all the way to the
EDL	00:05:51,231	00:05:52,767	| IOT154 |	Peru
EDL	00:05:53,279	00:05:54,559	| IOT154 |	Buying a thermos
EDL	00:05:54,559	00:05:55,839	| IOT154 |	Thermostat company
EDL	00:05:55,839	00:05:57,375	| IOT154 |	Could get you
EDL	00:05:57,375	00:05:59,167	| IOT154 |	Like more of the complete package
EDL	00:05:59,679	00:06:00,447	| IOT154 |	Distend
EDL	00:06:00,447	00:06:03,007	| IOT154 |	Really what they would need is an indoor camera
EDL	00:06:03,007	00:06:03,775	| IOT154 |	I guess
EDL	00:06:03,775	00:06:05,567	| IOT154 |	Maybe locks maybe not you know
EDL	00:06:05,567	00:06:06,079	| IOT154 |	Google doesn't have a lock
EDL	00:06:07,615	00:06:08,383	| IOT154 |	I don't know what do you think
EDL	00:06:08,895	00:06:10,175	| IOT154 |	Yeah I mean
EDL	00:06:10,175	00:06:12,991	| IOT154 |	Two things pop out at me ecobee
EDL	00:06:12,991	00:06:14,271	| IOT154 |	Already obviously works
EDL	00:06:14,271	00:06:16,575	| IOT154 |	Anatomy voice services on the newest model
EDL	00:06:17,087	00:06:19,391	| IOT154 |	So there's obviously a relationship there
EDL	00:06:19,391	00:06:20,927	| IOT154 |	Okay so their newest model
EDL	00:06:20,927	00:06:22,207	| IOT154 |	Doubles as
EDL	00:06:22,207	00:06:22,975	| IOT154 |	Anatomy
EDL	00:06:22,975	00:06:24,511	| IOT154 |	But their old stuff also
EDL	00:06:24,511	00:06:25,023	| IOT154 |	Works with
EDL	00:06:25,791	00:06:27,583	| IOT154 |	Describe your other stuff
EDL	00:06:28,351	00:06:29,375	| IOT154 |	Iveco beef
EDL	00:06:29,375	00:06:30,655	| IOT154 |	3 Sol
EDL	00:06:30,655	00:06:31,679	| IOT154 |	I'm not
EDL	00:06:31,679	00:06:33,983	| IOT154 |	Surprised that they have some backing here
EDL	00:06:34,495	00:06:38,079	| IOT154 |	What does it mean in a long-term because we talked about this a week or two ago about
EDL	00:06:38,079	00:06:39,103	| IOT154 |	Companies that get
EDL	00:06:39,103	00:06:45,503	| IOT154 |	Backing from the matinee phone and all the sudden a competing product is out and buy Amazon leaving the original
EDL	00:06:45,503	00:06:47,295	| IOT154 |	Company wondering what the heck just happened
EDL	00:06:47,295	00:06:49,343	| IOT154 |	I don't think that's going to happen here
EDL	00:06:53,695	00:06:54,975	| IOT154 |	It's entrenched yeah
EDL	00:06:54,975	00:06:55,743	| IOT154 |	And I think building a
EDL	00:06:58,559	00:06:59,071	| IOT154 |	Right
EDL	00:06:59,583	00:07:02,143	| IOT154 |	The other thing Amazon could get out of this
EDL	00:07:02,143	00:07:06,495	| IOT154 |	Ecobee does support motion sensors and even remote motion
EDL	00:07:06,495	00:07:07,263	| IOT154 |	Sensors
EDL	00:07:07,263	00:07:13,663	| IOT154 |	So I don't know what Amazon would do with that date or they want that data but it's a proper they could get it where is none of their other
EDL	00:07:13,663	00:07:14,431	| IOT154 |	Let's do that
EDL	00:07:14,431	00:07:17,503	| IOT154 |	Right so this is actually interesting cuz it could do occupancy
EDL	00:07:18,271	00:07:20,831	| IOT154 |	Sensors do occupancy and they also
EDL	00:07:22,111	00:07:23,903	| IOT154 |	So this gives
EDL	00:07:23,903	00:07:27,999	| IOT154 |	Again we always talk about this context so Amazon could do something with that
EDL	00:07:27,999	00:07:28,511	| IOT154 |	Context if
EDL	00:07:30,047	00:07:31,839	| IOT154 |	Could be something as simple as
EDL	00:07:31,839	00:07:33,887	| IOT154 |	Maybe you don't have to have it. And ever
EDL	00:07:33,887	00:07:36,959	| IOT154 |	Maybe you could just be like turn on the lights and they don't know what we
EDL	00:07:36,959	00:07:43,359	| IOT154 |	Beer in Hog Wild and you know watch a movie where they're on a frozen planet on your TV and it turns you
EDL	00:07:43,359	00:07:44,895	| IOT154 |	Your air conditioning on to make it really cold
EDL	00:07:45,663	00:07:46,943	| IOT154 |	I'd say that the same but
EDL	00:07:46,943	00:07:47,711	| IOT154 |	The hue light bulbs
EDL	00:07:47,711	00:07:48,223	| IOT154 |	Already work with
EDL	00:07:51,295	00:07:52,063	| IOT154 |	I know I love that for you
EDL	00:07:52,575	00:07:53,855	| IOT154 |	Here I am an ice Planet Hoth
EDL	00:07:54,367	00:07:57,951	| IOT154 |	That's exactly what I had in mind but I didn't know if
EDL	00:07:57,951	00:07:58,719	| IOT154 |	Reference
EDL	00:07:59,487	00:08:01,791	| IOT154 |	I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure most
EDL	00:08:02,815	00:08:03,583	| IOT154 |	This is true
EDL	00:08:04,351	00:08:05,887	| IOT154 |	Okay so that is
EDL	00:08:06,399	00:08:08,703	| IOT154 |	And other thing that might be worth
EDL	00:08:09,471	00:08:12,799	| IOT154 |	About is ecobee because it has a link into
EDL	00:08:12,799	00:08:13,311	| IOT154 |	Power
EDL	00:08:13,823	00:08:15,359	| IOT154 |	And utilities
EDL	00:08:15,359	00:08:18,431	| IOT154 |	Theater smart thermostat and kind of demand response programs
EDL	00:08:18,431	00:08:21,759	| IOT154 |	Is Amazon you know this week they were talking about a let's get into banking
EDL	00:08:21,759	00:08:23,295	| IOT154 |	This could give Amazon
EDL	00:08:24,063	00:08:26,879	| IOT154 |	Yet another bill that you pay and
EDL	00:08:26,879	00:08:28,159	| IOT154 |	Another facet of
EDL	00:08:28,159	00:08:30,975	| IOT154 |	Transactions since they want to be a part of every
EDL	00:08:30,975	00:08:31,743	| IOT154 |	Free transaction
EDL	00:08:31,743	00:08:33,535	| IOT154 |	That feels a little out there but
EDL	00:08:33,535	00:08:34,303	| IOT154 |	Never Say Never
EDL	00:08:35,583	00:08:36,607	| IOT154 |	All right
EDL	00:08:37,119	00:08:42,495	| IOT154 |	Moving onto excited by this

EDL	00:08:44,543	00:08:46,591	| IOT154 |	Because Delta we talked about this
EDL	00:08:46,591	00:08:50,175	| IOT154 |	@cs because one of my favorite devices from CES was the Delta faucet
EDL	00:08:50,687	00:08:51,199	| IOT154 |	Madam
EDL	00:08:51,711	00:08:52,223	| IOT154 |	Installed

EDL	00:08:54,527	00:08:56,575	| IOT154 |	And basically
EDL	00:08:56,575	00:08:58,111	| IOT154 |	I have these Delta touch faucet
EDL	00:08:58,879	00:09:00,159	| IOT154 |	And now they're offering

EDL	00:09:16,799	00:09:18,591	| IOT154 |	That's the faucet included
EDL	00:09:18,591	00:09:21,407	| IOT154 |	It is a lot of money but is there a retrofit package
EDL	00:09:23,455	00:09:28,319	| IOT154 |	All we talked to them and say yes about a nice ago you know they were thinking about it
EDL	00:09:28,319	00:09:30,367	| IOT154 |	So I don't see a retrofit package cuz
EDL	00:09:30,367	00:09:32,671	| IOT154 |	And my touch faucet was about $300
EDL	00:09:33,183	00:09:34,207	| IOT154 |	Just to give you a reference
EDL	00:09:34,719	00:09:35,999	| IOT154 |	It is a nice faucet
EDL	00:09:35,999	00:09:38,047	| IOT154 |	Capacitive touch on your faucet

EDL	00:09:40,607	00:09:42,399	| IOT154 |	Yeah but now
EDL	00:09:42,399	00:09:44,447	| IOT154 |	So break this out what how much is it
EDL	00:09:44,447	00:09:47,519	| IOT154 |	When is the additional expense now for the smarts
EDL	00:09:48,031	00:09:49,055	| IOT154 |	$50
EDL	00:09:49,055	00:09:50,079	| IOT154 |	80%
EDL	00:09:51,871	00:09:54,431	| IOT154 |	That's why I went back and looked at it
EDL	00:09:54,431	00:09:54,943	| IOT154 |	Sofia
EDL	00:09:55,967	00:09:59,039	| IOT154 |	What so it's it's a lot of money
EDL	00:09:59,039	00:10:01,599	| IOT154 |	And you know they get the benefit of all of your
EDL	00:10:01,599	00:10:02,111	| IOT154 |	Exciting
EDL	00:10:02,623	00:10:04,671	| IOT154 |	And this is almost I think this is exact
EDL	00:10:06,463	00:10:07,743	| IOT154 |	Deceitful touch2o
EDL	00:10:07,743	00:10:09,023	| IOT154 |	Essa touch2o
EDL	00:10:09,023	00:10:11,071	| IOT154 |	The only one you can buy as a
EDL	00:10:11,071	00:10:13,119	| IOT154 |	An Arctic stainless finish and it's
EDL	00:10:13,119	00:10:14,143	| IOT154 |	Only this one pro
EDL	00:10:14,143	00:10:14,911	| IOT154 |	Particular one
EDL	00:10:14,911	00:10:16,447	| IOT154 |	This one particular model
EDL	00:10:16,447	00:10:17,471	| IOT154 |	But this is my exact
EDL	00:10:18,239	00:10:22,591	| IOT154 |	Yeah one thing that could be contributing to the cost here I had forgot about this feature
EDL	00:10:22,591	00:10:23,615	| IOT154 |	They did tell us a
EDL	00:10:23,615	00:10:26,943	| IOT154 |	That's it yes and I just noticed it on the on the website for the faucet
EDL	00:10:26,943	00:10:29,503	| IOT154 |	You can ask matinee to warm up the water
EDL	00:10:30,015	00:10:31,039	| IOT154 |	And that's
EDL	00:10:31,039	00:10:36,671	| IOT154 |	That is an additional piece of Hardware that's got to heat up a certain amount of water so that way it's instantly hot
EDL	00:10:37,439	00:10:39,231	| IOT154 |	I will say is
EDL	00:10:39,231	00:10:40,511	| IOT154 |	These faucets
EDL	00:10:40,511	00:10:45,631	| IOT154 |	I don't know if Delta is going to do the same thing for this one but one of ours ours had like some sort of
EDL	00:10:45,631	00:10:47,679	| IOT154 |	Leaky gasket or something happened
EDL	00:10:47,679	00:10:48,703	| IOT154 |	And they just sent us a hole
EDL	00:10:49,727	00:10:50,495	| IOT154 |	Which
EDL	00:10:50,495	00:10:51,263	| IOT154 |	Yeah I was like
EDL	00:10:53,567	00:10:54,591	| IOT154 |	Is this expensive
EDL	00:10:56,895	00:10:57,407	| IOT154 |	Remodeling my house
EDL	00:10:58,943	00:10:59,455	| IOT154 |	Yes

EDL	00:11:19,935	00:11:21,727	| IOT154 |	Video demonstration for
EDL	00:11:21,727	00:11:22,495	| IOT154 |	The folks on the site
EDL	00:11:23,007	00:11:23,775	| IOT154 |	Yes

EDL	00:11:46,815	00:11:50,399	| IOT154 |	Not sure if this is it Kevin and I debated putting this on the show this
EDL	00:11:50,399	00:11:53,471	| IOT154 |	It's such a quirky story we felt like we had to but
EDL	00:11:53,983	00:11:58,847	| IOT154 |	I also want to note that the stories that we found in this topic are based on either a Reddit thread
EDL	00:11:58,847	00:11:59,615	| IOT154 |	Or tweets for me
EDL	00:12:00,127	00:12:02,431	| IOT154 |	And nobody's actually gotten Amazon
EDL	00:12:02,431	00:12:04,735	| IOT154 |	How to talk about what this is nor could I replicate
EDL	00:12:05,247	00:12:05,759	| IOT154 |	Campus
EDL	00:12:06,271	00:12:08,575	| IOT154 |	Just happen spontaneously
EDL	00:12:09,087	00:12:09,599	| IOT154 |	Yes
EDL	00:12:11,391	00:12:14,207	| IOT154 |	Apparently people's madhumeh devices
EDL	00:12:14,719	00:12:16,767	| IOT154 |	Just random times middle of the night
EDL	00:12:16,767	00:12:17,279	| IOT154 |	Whenever
EDL	00:12:17,791	00:12:20,095	| IOT154 |	Just start laughing like an evil laugh
EDL	00:12:20,607	00:12:22,399	| IOT154 |	Well that's what these people have said
EDL	00:12:22,399	00:12:24,447	| IOT154 |	And I have seen even a video of it
EDL	00:12:24,447	00:12:25,727	| IOT154 |	The person didn't say
EDL	00:12:25,727	00:12:26,495	| IOT154 |	Madam a laugh
EDL	00:12:27,519	00:12:28,287	| IOT154 |	Started laughing
EDL	00:12:28,287	00:12:28,799	| IOT154 |	And it's like
EDL	00:12:29,311	00:12:30,847	| IOT154 |	Why is this happening
EDL	00:12:30,847	00:12:37,247	| IOT154 |	Cuz it shouldn't be happening unless she's running around skills now we're going to see if
EDL	00:12:37,247	00:12:38,783	| IOT154 |	If you can hear this video
EDL	00:12:45,183	00:12:45,695	| IOT154 |	Yeah that is
EDL	00:12:46,719	00:12:50,047	| IOT154 |	Yeah I don't get it I just don't know what would cause that
EDL	00:12:50,559	00:12:52,863	| IOT154 |	Amazon hasn't spoken to anybody who is
EDL	00:12:52,863	00:12:53,375	| IOT154 |	Is reported on this
EDL	00:12:53,887	00:12:54,911	| IOT154 |	So we don't know
EDL	00:12:54,911	00:12:56,959	| IOT154 |	I was thinking I am sitting here going
EDL	00:12:56,959	00:13:01,823	| IOT154 |	Man is someone hacking like a certain skill maybe all these people have a certain skill involved
EDL	00:13:02,335	00:13:03,359	| IOT154 |	And this is Kai
EDL	00:13:03,359	00:13:04,895	| IOT154 |	Benefit Big prank on them slash
EDL	00:13:05,407	00:13:08,991	| IOT154 |	It's funny you mention the hacking aspect because
EDL	00:13:08,991	00:13:10,271	| IOT154 |	Obscene
EDL	00:13:10,271	00:13:13,343	| IOT154 |	Numerous reports over the past year of people
EDL	00:13:13,343	00:13:14,367	| IOT154 |	Seeing
EDL	00:13:14,367	00:13:17,695	| IOT154 |	Phones and other connected devices connecting via Bluetooth
EDL	00:13:17,695	00:13:19,231	| IOT154 |	To their Echo devices
EDL	00:13:19,231	00:13:22,303	| IOT154 |	Even though the Bluetooth pairing wasn't on and
EDL	00:13:22,303	00:13:23,839	| IOT154 |	That seemed to be a bug
EDL	00:13:23,839	00:13:27,423	| IOT154 |	I don't know if it was addressed or whatnot so you know maybe this is
EDL	00:13:27,423	00:13:29,215	| IOT154 |	Some kind of hockey thing
EDL	00:13:29,215	00:13:30,239	| IOT154 |	See that's
EDL	00:13:30,239	00:13:31,519	| IOT154 |	That is my
EDL	00:13:31,519	00:13:33,311	| IOT154 |	Hopefully
EDL	00:13:33,311	00:13:34,847	| IOT154 |	Hopefully we'll get more information
EDL	00:13:34,847	00:13:37,919	| IOT154 |	Oh my gosh this is the kind of story that captures the imagination
EDL	00:13:39,967	00:13:40,479	| IOT154 |	Negative
EDL	00:13:40,991	00:13:42,271	| IOT154 |	Maybe Google phones
EDL	00:13:43,039	00:13:44,319	| IOT154 |	Hahaha
EDL	00:13:44,319	00:13:45,599	| IOT154 |	The feud
EDL	00:13:46,879	00:13:49,695	| IOT154 |	Alright let's see what else do we have that doesn't
EDL	00:13:51,743	00:13:52,511	| IOT154 |	Webcams
EDL	00:13:52,511	00:13:53,279	| IOT154 |	Should we talk about
EDL	00:13:53,791	00:13:54,815	| IOT154 |	A crazy new plan from
EDL	00:13:55,327	00:13:55,839	| IOT154 |	DSLR
EDL	00:13:56,863	00:14:01,471	| IOT154 |	Yea nice webcams the network of intelligent camera ecosystem
EDL	00:14:01,471	00:14:04,543	| IOT154 |	It's a new alliance and if I sound skeptical
EDL	00:14:04,543	00:14:05,311	| IOT154 |	It's because I am
EDL	00:14:05,823	00:14:10,175	| IOT154 |	There's a startup called cinarra that is that put this Alliance together
EDL	00:14:10,175	00:14:11,711	| IOT154 |	Nikon is involved
EDL	00:14:11,711	00:14:15,039	| IOT154 |	Sony is involved and some of the folks that actually make
EDL	00:14:15,039	00:14:16,575	| IOT154 |	Devices over in China for
EDL	00:14:16,575	00:14:19,903	| IOT154 |	Just about everybody wished Ron and Foxconn for example are part of this Alliance
EDL	00:14:20,415	00:14:21,695	| IOT154 |	That is trying to start up
EDL	00:14:21,695	00:14:24,767	| IOT154 |	And I looked through the Sonora home site
EDL	00:14:24,767	00:14:27,327	| IOT154 |	And seems like they're trying to create a
EDL	00:14:27,327	00:14:29,631	| IOT154 |	A video of interoperability
EDL	00:14:29,631	00:14:32,703	| IOT154 |	Platform for webcams and include AI
EDL	00:14:32,703	00:14:39,103	| IOT154 |	So that way people who make devices don't have to worry about what the webcams are seeing the platform itself will have skin
EDL	00:14:39,103	00:14:45,503	| IOT154 |	Standardized ways to determine what's important in the video and so on so forth and I just sit here and shake my head because he's
EDL	00:14:45,503	00:14:48,319	| IOT154 |	He's kind of alliances don't often Works number one
EDL	00:14:48,319	00:14:53,951	| IOT154 |	The number to it sounds like they're trying to out a i the AI companies and I don't think that's going to happen
EDL	00:14:53,951	00:14:54,975	| IOT154 |	I'm with you on that
EDL	00:14:54,975	00:14:57,791	| IOT154 |	It reminded me and I cannot for the life of me I start googling in a
EDL	00:14:58,815	00:15:03,167	| IOT154 |	Back in the day when did Apple App Store came out probably here later
EDL	00:15:03,167	00:15:04,447	| IOT154 |	And the Google
EDL	00:15:04,447	00:15:07,007	| IOT154 |	Android play store started happening
EDL	00:15:07,007	00:15:08,031	| IOT154 |	Cell phone carriers would like
EDL	00:15:08,543	00:15:12,639	| IOT154 |	Hey there at stores actually work what's happened let's all create our own app store
EDL	00:15:13,151	00:15:14,943	| IOT154 |	And they got together to do this big
EDL	00:15:14,943	00:15:16,479	| IOT154 |	Multi carrier App Store f
EDL	00:15:17,759	00:15:20,575	| IOT154 |	I can't even remember the name of it so clearly that did not go
EDL	00:15:20,575	00:15:22,879	| IOT154 |	Nominate to the carriage of had their own like
EDL	00:15:22,879	00:15:25,951	| IOT154 |	Verizon had vcast for example here in the US
EDL	00:15:25,951	00:15:27,999	| IOT154 |	I don't remember what the
EDL	00:15:27,999	00:15:28,767	| IOT154 |	Croup
EDL	00:15:28,767	00:15:32,351	| IOT154 |	The terrorists tried to adapt stores they also try to do it mobile payments
EDL	00:15:32,351	00:15:32,863	| IOT154 |	I remember Melville
EDL	00:15:35,423	00:15:36,191	| IOT154 |	Isis yes
EDL	00:15:36,959	00:15:38,495	| IOT154 |	Yeah not smart there
EDL	00:15:38,495	00:15:39,263	| IOT154 |	12
EDL	00:15:39,775	00:15:40,543	| IOT154 |	Surly they didn't realize
EDL	00:15:42,847	00:15:44,127	| IOT154 |	So anyways this is
EDL	00:15:44,127	00:15:46,175	| IOT154 |	Keep this in your mind if it happens
EDL	00:15:46,175	00:15:49,247	| IOT154 |	Kevin did mention that this the guy who's behind this though
EDL	00:15:49,247	00:15:49,759	| IOT154 |	Who actually has some
EDL	00:15:50,527	00:15:56,671	| IOT154 |	He does he push forward the HDMI video standard which pretty much is an acceptable standard so
EDL	00:15:57,439	00:15:58,463	| IOT154 |	He's been able to
EDL	00:15:58,463	00:15:59,999	| IOT154 |	Get different players to
EDL	00:15:59,999	00:16:03,071	| IOT154 |	Come together on a single standard that we do use today
EDL	00:16:03,583	00:16:04,607	| IOT154 |	Possible that
EDL	00:16:04,607	00:16:07,423	| IOT154 |	Nice works out but I again I'm a little skeptical
EDL	00:16:09,983	00:16:10,495	| IOT154 |	Yes
EDL	00:16:11,519	00:16:12,799	| IOT154 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:16:12,799	00:16:14,335	| IOT154 |	This isn't cameras but it's
EDL	00:16:14,335	00:16:14,847	| IOT154 |	Kind of like
EDL	00:16:15,359	00:16:16,639	| IOT154 |	This is part of my
EDL	00:16:16,639	00:16:19,199	| IOT154 |	I did a story last week on why your Wi-Fi sucks
EDL	00:16:19,199	00:16:19,711	| IOT154 |	In the house
EDL	00:16:20,479	00:16:22,271	| IOT154 |	Why your wifi isn't fixed yet
EDL	00:16:22,271	00:16:23,807	| IOT154 |	And if you want a link to that so you can
EDL	00:16:23,807	00:16:24,831	| IOT154 |	Go see it
EDL	00:16:24,831	00:16:27,135	| IOT154 |	Talked about all kinds of crazy things about
EDL	00:16:27,135	00:16:31,231	| IOT154 |	Basically your router's are getting smarter and your clients are going to need to get Dumber
EDL	00:16:31,231	00:16:33,023	| IOT154 |	Fish can't have two SmartThings fighting it out
EDL	00:16:33,023	00:16:35,071	| IOT154 |	Is part of that reporting
EDL	00:16:35,071	00:16:36,351	| IOT154 |	In talking to Qualcomm
EDL	00:16:36,863	00:16:39,167	| IOT154 |	About kind of the future Wi-Fi
EDL	00:16:39,167	00:16:42,239	| IOT154 |	They also mentioned that there really are working with
EDL	00:16:42,239	00:16:45,567	| IOT154 |	Five different companies to bring presence detection
EDL	00:16:46,591	00:16:47,615	| IOT154 |	Motion detection
EDL	00:16:48,127	00:16:48,895	| IOT154 |	2
EDL	00:16:48,895	00:16:50,175	| IOT154 |	The home theater
EDL	00:16:50,175	00:16:50,943	| IOT154 |	Wi-Fi
EDL	00:16:50,943	00:16:55,295	| IOT154 |	And as an example of this I've got to deal with a company called cognitive systems
EDL	00:16:55,295	00:16:56,831	| IOT154 |	And that company makes
EDL	00:16:56,831	00:16:59,135	| IOT154 |	ARA the ARA Wi-Fi security
EDL	00:16:59,647	00:17:00,159	| IOT154 |	And
EDL	00:17:00,671	00:17:01,695	| IOT154 |	That basically says
EDL	00:17:02,207	00:17:04,511	| IOT154 |	The whole technology is built on this idea that
EDL	00:17:04,511	00:17:07,583	| IOT154 |	People walking around disrupt the radio waves of the
EDL	00:17:07,583	00:17:08,863	| IOT154 |	House and
EDL	00:17:08,863	00:17:09,631	| IOT154 |	Now.
EDL	00:17:09,631	00:17:10,655	| IOT154 |	The chips can
EDL	00:17:10,655	00:17:12,191	| IOT154 |	Tell they can paint a picture
EDL	00:17:12,703	00:17:14,239	| IOT154 |	So based on that disruption they
EDL	00:17:15,519	00:17:16,287	| IOT154 |	See
EDL	00:17:16,287	00:17:18,591	| IOT154 |	What's kind like radar in a sentence
EDL	00:17:23,711	00:17:24,223	| IOT154 |	What cabin
EDL	00:17:25,759	00:17:26,527	| IOT154 |	Traffic
EDL	00:17:26,527	00:17:27,295	| IOT154 |	Welcome
EDL	00:17:27,295	00:17:28,319	| IOT154 |	Which provides the chips
EDL	00:17:29,343	00:17:29,855	| IOT154 |	Almost every
EDL	00:17:31,391	00:17:32,415	| IOT154 |	The really
EDL	00:17:32,415	00:17:33,439	| IOT154 |	Dublin
EDL	00:17:33,439	00:17:39,583	| IOT154 |	Technology they're actually working with five companies to bring that into the home that actually gives me a lot of Hope
EDL	00:17:39,583	00:17:41,119	| IOT154 |	Ferg presents
EDL	00:17:41,119	00:17:42,655	| IOT154 |	And maybe even like
EDL	00:17:42,655	00:17:45,215	| IOT154 |	Better security inside the house what do you think
EDL	00:17:45,215	00:17:49,311	| IOT154 |	Yeah I would agree I mean when you have a call, then we just like you said the Behemoth of the
EDL	00:17:49,311	00:17:50,335	| IOT154 |	Mobile one
EDL	00:17:50,335	00:17:50,847	| IOT154 |	Atheros
EDL	00:17:56,479	00:18:01,087	| IOT154 |	They are huge so that's a good sign for this technology but then again
EDL	00:18:01,599	00:18:04,159	| IOT154 |	Had a chair failures as well they had their
EDL	00:18:04,159	00:18:05,183	| IOT154 |	Displays
EDL	00:18:05,183	00:18:09,023	| IOT154 |	I forget what the name of it was but they kind of replicated The Butterfly Wings
EDL	00:18:09,023	00:18:09,535	| IOT154 |	The miracle
EDL	00:18:10,815	00:18:12,095	| IOT154 |	Mirror something is
EDL	00:18:12,607	00:18:14,911	| IOT154 |	Yeah they try a lot of different things I give them
EDL	00:18:14,911	00:18:17,215	| IOT154 |	Credit for that answer but they don't all work out but
EDL	00:18:17,215	00:18:17,983	| IOT154 |	I like
EDL	00:18:20,031	00:18:20,799	| IOT154 |	I like that
EDL	00:18:20,799	00:18:22,591	| IOT154 |	Potential is a tense because of what you
EDL	00:18:22,591	00:18:26,943	| IOT154 |	You last said improve security and the reason I say that is
EDL	00:18:26,943	00:18:30,527	| IOT154 |	Unless you put a camera in every room of your house you can't
EDL	00:18:30,527	00:18:36,415	| IOT154 |	I see in every room of your house so with this you could sort of quote unquote see in certain rooms because of the
EDL	00:18:36,415	00:18:37,439	| IOT154 |	Disrupted Wi-Fi
EDL	00:18:37,951	00:18:39,231	| IOT154 |	Media weather
EDL	00:18:39,231	00:18:40,767	| IOT154 |	You know emanating from the router and
EDL	00:18:41,279	00:18:42,047	| IOT154 |	Flooding
EDL	00:18:42,047	00:18:43,327	| IOT154 |	Every room of your house
EDL	00:18:43,327	00:18:44,863	| IOT154 |	So you are getting
EDL	00:18:44,863	00:18:48,703	| IOT154 |	Information from rooms don't have a camera so I see a lot of potential are
EDL	00:18:48,703	00:18:50,239	| IOT154 |	I am curious though
EDL	00:18:50,239	00:18:52,543	| IOT154 |	So there's a couple things it's not a camera
EDL	00:18:52,543	00:18:54,591	| IOT154 |	So you can walk around naked and
EDL	00:18:54,591	00:18:57,663	| IOT154 |	While it may notice that there is slight differentiations
EDL	00:18:57,663	00:18:58,431	| IOT154 |	It probably
EDL	00:18:58,943	00:18:59,711	| IOT154 |	Don't care
EDL	00:18:59,711	00:19:02,015	| IOT154 |	And it's not like a human can see that does that make it better
EDL	00:19:02,527	00:19:05,087	| IOT154 |	Like it will still be able to see what you're doing
EDL	00:19:05,087	00:19:06,367	| IOT154 |	In the sense that
EDL	00:19:06,367	00:19:07,391	| IOT154 |	If they run the right algorithm
EDL	00:19:08,671	00:19:09,183	| IOT154 |	Right now
EDL	00:19:09,951	00:19:11,231	| IOT154 |	This person is
EDL	00:19:12,255	00:19:14,047	| IOT154 |	Beating a child picking their nose
EDL	00:19:14,047	00:19:14,815	| IOT154 |	Whatever
EDL	00:19:14,815	00:19:16,863	| IOT154 |	Yeah I mean it you so you're not going to get the
EDL	00:19:16,863	00:19:17,631	| IOT154 |	Detailer of a
EDL	00:19:18,143	00:19:19,679	| IOT154 |	I've seen something on a camera
EDL	00:19:20,703	00:19:21,983	| IOT154 |	Maven
EDL	00:19:21,983	00:19:22,751	| IOT154 |	They're working on that day
EDL	00:19:23,263	00:19:29,663	| IOT154 |	You're not going to see the detail you would see in a video camera sound like if somebody walked into your house in a room that doesn't have a camera this wi-fi think-tech
EDL	00:19:29,663	00:19:33,247	| IOT154 |	Text them your alarm goes off you wouldn't have a picture of that person right so you couldn't
EDL	00:19:34,271	00:19:34,783	| IOT154 |	Picture of the Nala
EDL	00:19:36,063	00:19:37,087	| IOT154 |	Yeah
EDL	00:19:37,087	00:19:39,135	| IOT154 |	The knowledge is important it's basically
EDL	00:19:39,135	00:19:40,415	| IOT154 |	It is just presents
EDL	00:19:40,415	00:19:41,439	| IOT154 |	It's not identification
EDL	00:19:41,951	00:19:44,511	| IOT154 |	But presence may be good enough obviously we will use
EDL	00:19:45,023	00:19:48,863	| IOT154 |	Sensors on our doors and windows and things like that for detection
EDL	00:19:49,375	00:19:50,911	| IOT154 |	You know presence detection
EDL	00:19:51,423	00:19:53,471	| IOT154 |	And that's good enough to tell you
EDL	00:19:53,471	00:19:54,751	| IOT154 |	For allergic something's not right
EDL	00:19:55,263	00:19:57,823	| IOT154 |	I just bring this up because it's kind of
EDL	00:19:57,823	00:20:00,383	| IOT154 |	It's part of that ever-present privacy surveillance
EDL	00:20:00,383	00:20:00,895	| IOT154 |	It's kind of a spec
EDL	00:20:01,663	00:20:02,431	| IOT154 |	What do you want
EDL	00:20:03,199	00:20:05,759	| IOT154 |	Yeah exactly it's a choice it's a personal choice absolutely
EDL	00:20:06,783	00:20:07,551	| IOT154 |	Okay
EDL	00:20:07,551	00:20:09,599	| IOT154 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:20:09,599	00:20:10,367	| IOT154 |	Here comes a little news
EDL	00:20:12,415	00:20:13,695	| IOT154 |	Yes
EDL	00:20:13,695	00:20:15,487	| IOT154 |	Across the pond or folks
EDL	00:20:15,487	00:20:18,559	| IOT154 |	Saracens will be happy in the UK because
EDL	00:20:18,559	00:20:22,911	| IOT154 |	Google home calling is now live so you can do hands-free calls
EDL	00:20:22,911	00:20:24,191	| IOT154 |	It will
EDL	00:20:24,191	00:20:27,263	| IOT154 |	Make a call from your Google home but use your phone number
EDL	00:20:27,263	00:20:31,103	| IOT154 |	So that is really cool that's added to the US and Canada which already have the
EDL	00:20:31,103	00:20:31,871	| IOT154 |	This feature
EDL	00:20:31,871	00:20:34,687	| IOT154 |	Even though I have it I never use it but hey
EDL	00:20:35,199	00:20:36,479	| IOT154 |	It is a very isolated
EDL	00:20:37,503	00:20:40,319	| IOT154 |	So here's the use case that actually has worked for us
EDL	00:20:41,087	00:20:41,855	| IOT154 |	Is
EDL	00:20:41,855	00:20:43,391	| IOT154 |	We tell our daughter
EDL	00:20:43,391	00:20:45,439	| IOT154 |	Because she doesn't really have a cell phone
EDL	00:20:45,439	00:20:47,231	| IOT154 |	Where's the house cell phone but it's never
EDL	00:20:47,231	00:20:47,999	| IOT154 |	Procharged
EDL	00:20:47,999	00:20:48,767	| IOT154 |	So
EDL	00:20:48,767	00:20:50,303	| IOT154 |	We tell her just to give us a call
EDL	00:20:50,815	00:20:52,607	| IOT154 |	When she's home by herself and she need some
EDL	00:20:53,119	00:20:55,423	| IOT154 |	So it becomes kind of kind of
EDL	00:20:56,191	00:20:56,703	| IOT154 |	Yeah
EDL	00:20:59,263	00:21:00,287	| IOT154 |	There's a used
EDL	00:21:00,287	00:21:01,055	| IOT154 |	Case it's more
EDL	00:21:03,615	00:21:04,383	| IOT154 |	It works
EDL	00:21:04,383	00:21:06,687	| IOT154 |	IBM has a new service called pears
EDL	00:21:06,687	00:21:07,199	| IOT154 |	Geoscope
EDL	00:21:07,711	00:21:08,735	| IOT154 |	It is a
EDL	00:21:08,735	00:21:11,039	| IOT154 |	Cloud-based service that they've launched
EDL	00:21:11,039	00:21:12,831	| IOT154 |	Basically you put in
EDL	00:21:12,831	00:21:15,391	| IOT154 |	Any sort of data with geospatial data
EDL	00:21:15,391	00:21:17,440	| IOT154 |	And it pulls the geospatial data act
EDL	00:21:17,952	00:21:18,464	| IOT154 |	How to create a map
EDL	00:21:18,976	00:21:20,256	| IOT154 |	And it's apparently super easy
EDL	00:21:20,768	00:21:21,792	| IOT154 |	I bring this up
EDL	00:21:21,792	00:21:24,352	| IOT154 |	Because I am super excited about environmental law
EDL	00:21:24,352	00:21:28,448	| IOT154 |	Monitoring so I love the idea of being able to pull data from Lake
EDL	00:21:28,448	00:21:31,520	| IOT154 |	Maybe it's weather stations you can and see around you
EDL	00:21:31,520	00:21:34,592	| IOT154 |	And get like air quality data or weather data on a map
EDL	00:21:34,592	00:21:36,384	| IOT154 |	It just seems kind of like a fun
EDL	00:21:36,384	00:21:36,896	| IOT154 |	Easy project
EDL	00:21:37,664	00:21:38,176	| IOT154 |	And
EDL	00:21:38,688	00:21:39,968	| IOT154 |	It says it can even
EDL	00:21:39,968	00:21:41,504	| IOT154 |	It can take anything from
EDL	00:21:41,504	00:21:43,296	| IOT154 |	Geotagged
EDL	00:21:43,296	00:21:46,112	| IOT154 |	Weather data Census Data aerial imagery
EDL	00:21:46,112	00:21:46,880	| IOT154 |	Tweets or news data
EDL	00:21:48,160	00:21:48,928	| IOT154 |	Nickelback g.
EDL	00:21:50,208	00:21:56,608	| IOT154 |	So I don't know how many of you want to make maps but I just thought it was cool cuz a lot of my iot things and like it would be headed
EDL	00:21:56,608	00:21:57,120	| IOT154 |	Need to have a map
EDL	00:21:57,632	00:21:58,400	| IOT154 |	Function for this
EDL	00:22:00,192	00:22:01,728	| IOT154 |	And what am I
EDL	00:22:01,728	00:22:06,848	| IOT154 |	My favorite college is ASU go Sun Devils they're getting smart dorms in the engineering
EDL	00:22:07,360	00:22:08,640	| IOT154 |	Ar40 engineering students
EDL	00:22:09,152	00:22:12,480	| IOT154 |	Kind of sets AC off before the show engineering students
EDL	00:22:12,480	00:22:13,760	| IOT154 |	Requested
EDL	00:22:13,760	00:22:14,272	| IOT154 |	Some students should have
EDL	00:22:15,040	00:22:16,832	| IOT154 |	I hear you but they got that Cronkite
EDL	00:22:16,832	00:22:17,856	| IOT154 |	School journals on there I know
EDL	00:22:18,368	00:22:19,648	| IOT154 |	I love I love you
EDL	00:22:19,648	00:22:22,208	| IOT154 |	But the engineering students are getting some
EDL	00:22:22,208	00:22:24,768	| IOT154 |	Fancy new rooms in one particular dorm
EDL	00:22:24,768	00:22:31,168	| IOT154 |	Some of the things were just smart usage of furniture and things like that not connected Furniture 9 that but I did
EDL	00:22:31,168	00:22:33,472	| IOT154 |	Didn't notice and there's a video that we can link to
EDL	00:22:33,472	00:22:34,496	| IOT154 |	If you want to see me
EDL	00:22:34,496	00:22:38,336	| IOT154 |	Every room gets an echo Dot and the students
EDL	00:22:38,336	00:22:44,736	| IOT154 |	I have four different custom wake word so that way each individual student can speak to the. Not confuse who is speaking
EDL	00:22:44,736	00:22:47,552	| IOT154 |	They can control their Smart TV with it as well
EDL	00:22:47,552	00:22:50,112	| IOT154 |	And what I thought was a really cool only because I
EDL	00:22:50,880	00:22:52,160	| IOT154 |	Doing laundry at college
EDL	00:22:52,160	00:22:53,952	| IOT154 |	She's like one of the things of my existence
EDL	00:22:54,464	00:23:00,864	| IOT154 |	They made it so much easier for people to ASU in this particular dorm because the laundry machines are connected they sent me a
EDL	00:23:00,864	00:23:02,400	| IOT154 |	Bluetooth which I found kind of odd
EDL	00:23:02,400	00:23:04,448	| IOT154 |	Because you're not going to be within range of
EDL	00:23:04,448	00:23:06,496	| IOT154 |	Laundry machine for the future but
EDL	00:23:06,496	00:23:07,264	| IOT154 |	You can
EDL	00:23:07,264	00:23:10,080	| IOT154 |	Use your phone to see which machines are open
EDL	00:23:10,080	00:23:16,224	| IOT154 |	And determine if your wash is ready or still in progress which I thought was awesome you don't need to sit there like Wii U
EDL	00:23:16,736	00:23:17,504	| IOT154 |	I have to do with
EDL	00:23:17,504	00:23:19,296	| IOT154 |	Rolls of quarters because
EDL	00:23:19,296	00:23:22,368	| IOT154 |	All the laundry is included for free don't have to pay for it
EDL	00:23:22,368	00:23:25,696	| IOT154 |	And then wait and see when she becomes open they can do that right from their room
EDL	00:23:25,696	00:23:26,976	| IOT154 |	Yes I loved
EDL	00:23:27,488	00:23:30,560	| IOT154 |	And I was with your Bluetooth cuz it they showed him like going downstairs
EDL	00:23:31,072	00:23:31,584	| IOT154 |	Yeah
EDL	00:23:33,888	00:23:34,400	| IOT154 |	The Hub
EDL	00:23:37,728	00:23:39,264	| IOT154 |	So that weird but
EDL	00:23:39,264	00:23:40,032	| IOT154 |	I mean
EDL	00:23:40,032	00:23:40,544	| IOT154 |	Apartment
EDL	00:23:41,312	00:23:42,592	| IOT154 |	Should offer this as well
EDL	00:23:42,592	00:23:43,616	| IOT154 |	I feel like
EDL	00:23:43,616	00:23:46,176	| IOT154 |	Any apartment complex that I would live in now
EDL	00:23:46,176	00:23:47,200	| IOT154 |	I would expect
EDL	00:23:47,200	00:23:47,968	| IOT154 |	Set the sort of feature
EDL	00:23:48,736	00:23:49,504	| IOT154 |	Because my goodness
EDL	00:23:50,016	00:23:51,296	| IOT154 |	Actually I would expect
EDL	00:23:51,808	00:23:52,320	| IOT154 |	Washer dryer
EDL	00:23:53,856	00:23:58,976	| IOT154 |	Along with my June oven in my Delta faucet
EDL	00:24:02,304	00:24:03,072	| IOT154 |	Yes
EDL	00:24:03,072	00:24:09,472	| IOT154 |	So I like this I'd like to the other thing is in the Echo.
EDL	00:24:09,472	00:24:11,264	| IOT154 |	Rent it and I don't know if they'll swear
EDL	00:24:11,264	00:24:16,896	| IOT154 |	Custom butt from Amazon or if they just made those with their 3D printers that also happened to be in the engineering dorm
EDL	00:24:18,944	00:24:20,480	| IOT154 |	They look really nice
EDL	00:24:20,480	00:24:25,344	| IOT154 |	Give me the name of the doorman everything in multi like a geographic design on it look really funky
EDL	00:24:25,856	00:24:26,624	| IOT154 |	Kevin
EDL	00:24:26,624	00:24:27,392	| IOT154 |	You try that again
EDL	00:24:28,416	00:24:28,928	| IOT154 |	Yes
EDL	00:24:29,440	00:24:35,840	| IOT154 |	So I tried out the Raven I'm going to call this a preview because the device actually doesn't become available for shipping and
EDL	00:24:35,840	00:24:40,448	| IOT154 |	Tomei to a lot of the features unfortunately we're not working
EDL	00:24:40,448	00:24:41,216	| IOT154 |	For me to
EDL	00:24:41,216	00:24:44,288	| IOT154 |	Test yet the company is working on adding those features
EDL	00:24:44,288	00:24:47,616	| IOT154 |	The basically with the Raven is it almost looks like the old
EDL	00:24:47,616	00:24:49,408	| IOT154 |	Microsoft Xbox Kinect
EDL	00:24:49,920	00:24:54,016	| IOT154 |	And what it is is it say connected dash cam for your vehicle
EDL	00:24:54,016	00:25:00,416	| IOT154 |	Either place on your windshield or on your dashboard I put mine on the windshield and it's got a front camera so you can
EDL	00:25:00,416	00:25:02,464	| IOT154 |	Do your drive and so on so forth
EDL	00:25:02,464	00:25:05,024	| IOT154 |	If there's an accident or something you recapture that information
EDL	00:25:05,024	00:25:09,632	| IOT154 |	It also has a rear-facing camera so it's looking inside the car itself
EDL	00:25:09,632	00:25:14,496	| IOT154 |	Which and even capture sound in there so I was singing to The Beatles While I was driving and luckily
EDL	00:25:14,496	00:25:17,056	| IOT154 |	The microphone doesn't work well yet they're working on fixing that
EDL	00:25:17,056	00:25:19,104	| IOT154 |	So you can't hear me sing in the video which is very good
EDL	00:25:19,616	00:25:26,016	| IOT154 |	What's unique about this I mean that you had to connect to dash cameras at GPS it's got LTE it's got to display
EDL	00:25:26,016	00:25:28,832	| IOT154 |	Blaze on if you can see real-time turn-by-turn that occasion
EDL	00:25:29,344	00:25:34,464	| IOT154 |	You can see your Telemetry from your car because it plugs into your onboard diagnostic port
EDL	00:25:34,464	00:25:37,792	| IOT154 |	In your vehicle as well get his power as well as information from the car
EDL	00:25:38,304	00:25:41,888	| IOT154 |	Seated speed and fuel information and so on it was that'll work fine
EDL	00:25:42,400	00:25:48,800	| IOT154 |	But the really interesting thing about this is there's a security aspect to it because there's an accelerometer in a processor
EDL	00:25:48,800	00:25:49,568	| IOT154 |	In the device
EDL	00:25:49,568	00:25:50,848	| IOT154 |	When your car is
EDL	00:25:50,848	00:25:52,384	| IOT154 |	Park but gets bumped
EDL	00:25:52,384	00:25:55,200	| IOT154 |	Or your car here is glass breaking
EDL	00:25:55,200	00:25:57,248	| IOT154 |	Or somebody tries to open the door
EDL	00:25:57,248	00:25:58,272	| IOT154 |	You can actually
EDL	00:25:58,272	00:26:00,064	| IOT154 |	Get that captured on camera
EDL	00:26:00,064	00:26:03,648	| IOT154 |	Again I could not test that because those alerts are not working
EDL	00:26:03,648	00:26:04,416	| IOT154 |	And I also
EDL	00:26:04,416	00:26:07,232	| IOT154 |	Question how well it will work with the video
EDL	00:26:07,232	00:26:08,000	| IOT154 |	Camera
EDL	00:26:08,000	00:26:14,400	| IOT154 |	Is the first thing I'm going to do when I get that alert is I'm going to go look live right in my car what you can do because there's an LTE
EDL	00:26:14,400	00:26:15,424	| IOT154 |	Connection in this
EDL	00:26:15,424	00:26:16,192	| IOT154 |	The thing is
EDL	00:26:16,192	00:26:17,984	| IOT154 |	If somebody bangs my car
EDL	00:26:18,496	00:26:19,264	| IOT154 |	As you're looking for the
EDL	00:26:19,776	00:26:23,104	| IOT154 |	Cabin of the vehicle yeah you can see a pretty wide angle but
EDL	00:26:23,104	00:26:28,224	| IOT154 |	The vision is kind of limited because of you know things in your car and the pillars between the
EDL	00:26:28,224	00:26:34,368	| IOT154 |	Doors in the roof so I don't know if you like be able to get a license plate or not like that so
EDL	00:26:34,368	00:26:36,160	| IOT154 |	What it does today it does well
EDL	00:26:36,672	00:26:37,952	| IOT154 |	What it will do
EDL	00:26:37,952	00:26:39,744	| IOT154 |	I don't know if it will do well
EDL	00:26:39,744	00:26:41,024	| IOT154 |	Because again
EDL	00:26:41,024	00:26:46,144	| IOT154 |	Those pictures aren't there just yet this is $299 you can pre-order early and save 30 bucks
EDL	00:26:46,144	00:26:49,472	| IOT154 |	And then of course there is a service plan because it's got LTE and
EDL	00:26:49,472	00:26:54,080	| IOT154 |	Real-time connection to your phone so you can check in live at any time in your vehicle
EDL	00:26:54,080	00:26:56,640	| IOT154 |	Those range from 8 to $30 a month and the
EDL	00:26:56,640	00:26:58,176	| IOT154 |	The main difference between
EDL	00:26:58,176	00:26:59,968	| IOT154 |	How many times can you
EDL	00:26:59,968	00:27:02,272	| IOT154 |	Look at your vehicle or look out through the front
EDL	00:27:02,272	00:27:05,600	| IOT154 |	Camera it also captures everything on video and you can pull those down
EDL	00:27:05,600	00:27:07,648	| IOT154 |	I'm sure those which I've done it in my review so
EDL	00:27:08,928	00:27:09,696	| IOT154 |	Kind of price
EDL	00:27:09,696	00:27:12,768	| IOT154 |	Missy and I should also mention that there's actually another device
EDL	00:27:12,768	00:27:15,328	| IOT154 |	Very similar to this on the market is called the owl car cam
EDL	00:27:15,840	00:27:20,192	| IOT154 |	And it is available for $349 it is going to be available
EDL	00:27:20,192	00:27:22,496	| IOT154 |	Call the end of March the estimated delivery is ma
EDL	00:27:22,496	00:27:23,776	| IOT154 |	March 31st will see if
EDL	00:27:23,776	00:27:25,056	| IOT154 |	This actually
EDL	00:27:25,056	00:27:31,456	| IOT154 |	Comes with a Year's worth of LTE service so you get the 60 Minutes of live 24/7 video or 6
EDL	00:27:31,456	00:27:33,248	| IOT154 |	Tags which I guess is
EDL	00:27:33,248	00:27:33,760	| IOT154 |	Checking in on things
EDL	00:27:34,272	00:27:35,296	| IOT154 |	Threatening
EDL	00:27:35,808	00:27:37,088	| IOT154 |	You can buy more data
EDL	00:27:37,088	00:27:38,368	| IOT154 |	For ten bucks for
EDL	00:27:38,368	00:27:39,392	| IOT154 |	What they call 66
EDL	00:27:40,672	00:27:41,440	| IOT154 |	62
EDL	00:27:41,440	00:27:42,208	| IOT154 |	I suppose
EDL	00:27:42,208	00:27:43,488	| IOT154 |	So that's just
EDL	00:27:43,488	00:27:45,024	| IOT154 |	There's apparently a big Market
EDL	00:27:45,024	00:27:45,536	| IOT154 |	Here for the
EDL	00:27:46,304	00:27:47,072	| IOT154 |	Dash cam
EDL	00:27:47,072	00:27:47,840	| IOT154 |	Damn baby
EDL	00:27:47,840	00:27:49,632	| IOT154 |	Popularized by all those Russian dash cam
EDL	00:27:49,632	00:27:50,144	| IOT154 |	Videos
EDL	00:27:50,912	00:27:52,704	| IOT154 |	Maybe I see the thing is
EDL	00:27:52,704	00:27:56,032	| IOT154 |	Even if these products do what they say I'm not in the market
EDL	00:27:56,032	00:27:57,568	| IOT154 |	Before it gets first of all
EDL	00:27:57,568	00:27:58,848	| IOT154 |	My car already has LTE
EDL	00:27:59,360	00:28:03,712	| IOT154 |	I mean I can use it as a Wi-Fi hotspot so the only thing I can't do right now is the camera stuff
EDL	00:28:03,712	00:28:04,480	| IOT154 |	You know
EDL	00:28:04,480	00:28:07,040	| IOT154 |	I can remotely close the doors on my
EDL	00:28:07,040	00:28:09,088	| IOT154 |	Car I can get telemetry
EDL	00:28:09,600	00:28:15,232	| IOT154 |	Find out how much gas is in there or how much battery charge I have so it's a toughie because
EDL	00:28:15,232	00:28:18,304	| IOT154 |	These only work with cars at least the Raven only works at
EDL	00:28:18,304	00:28:21,632	| IOT154 |	2008 and up and a lot of newer cars come with
EDL	00:28:21,632	00:28:23,168	| IOT154 |	Too much all these features except for the camera
EDL	00:28:23,936	00:28:27,776	| IOT154 |	So I don't either be market for this I don't know me either
EDL	00:28:27,776	00:28:28,544	| IOT154 |	I
EDL	00:28:28,544	00:28:29,312	| IOT154 |	Just bought a new
EDL	00:28:29,312	00:28:29,824	| IOT154 |	New car we just want to
EDL	00:28:31,360	00:28:32,384	| IOT154 |	We did not do it then do
EDL	00:28:33,920	00:28:36,224	| IOT154 |	And really the only feature that we were like
EDL	00:28:36,224	00:28:36,992	| IOT154 |	Play dead set on
EDL	00:28:36,992	00:28:37,760	| IOT154 |	Was having a backup
EDL	00:28:38,528	00:28:41,600	| IOT154 |	Which car is actually a starting this year all cars are going
EDL	00:28:42,624	00:28:43,904	| IOT154 |	Anyway
EDL	00:28:43,904	00:28:45,184	| IOT154 |	So I don't know

EDL	00:29:15,648	00:29:16,928	| IOT154 |	Discussed on the
EDL	00:29:16,928	00:29:18,720	| IOT154 |	Radio any of the podcast
EDL	00:29:19,232	00:29:20,512	| IOT154 |	Is if I set up my

EDL	00:29:22,304	00:29:24,096	| IOT154 |	Activated using Google home
EDL	00:29:24,608	00:29:26,656	| IOT154 |	Should I never touch the manual lights
EDL	00:29:26,656	00:29:28,448	| IOT154 |	This again as at my
EDL	00:29:28,448	00:29:29,472	| IOT154 |	The sequence

EDL	00:29:30,752	00:29:32,800	| IOT154 |	That would be a big problem normally
EDL	00:29:33,312	00:29:34,592	| IOT154 |	S I can't always
EDL	00:29:34,592	00:29:35,616	| IOT154 |	Talk to Google home
EDL	00:29:36,128	00:29:36,640	| IOT154 |	Turn lights on
EDL	00:29:37,408	00:29:38,944	| IOT154 |	So hopefully you can please address
EDL	00:29:39,456	00:29:42,272	| IOT154 |	Question which I never hear anybody talk about
EDL	00:29:42,272	00:29:43,040	| IOT154 |	Thank you
EDL	00:29:43,040	00:29:43,552	| IOT154 |	Lobster Pot
EDL	00:29:44,320	00:29:45,088	| IOT154 |	Oh
EDL	00:29:45,088	00:29:45,856	| IOT154 |	Men
EDL	00:29:45,856	00:29:47,648	| IOT154 |	Ed this is a great question
EDL	00:29:47,648	00:29:53,536	| IOT154 |	An end probably obvious to any of us
EDL	00:29:54,304	00:29:55,072	| IOT154 |	I need to know
EDL	00:29:55,072	00:29:55,840	| IOT154 |	So
EDL	00:29:55,840	00:29:57,632	| IOT154 |	Good good on you for bringing this up
EDL	00:29:57,632	00:29:59,168	| IOT154 |	So the answer is
EDL	00:29:59,168	00:29:59,680	| IOT154 |	It depends
EDL	00:30:01,216	00:30:04,288	| IOT154 |	Definitive answer it.
EDL	00:30:05,568	00:30:07,104	| IOT154 |	If you're working with a smart bulb
EDL	00:30:07,616	00:30:08,640	| IOT154 |	Then if someone
EDL	00:30:09,408	00:30:11,200	| IOT154 |	So if Google is controlling a smart bulb
EDL	00:30:11,712	00:30:15,808	| IOT154 |	And someone turns off the light switch that controls that lamp or those bulbs
EDL	00:30:15,808	00:30:17,088	| IOT154 |	Then yes it will stop work
EDL	00:30:17,856	00:30:19,392	| IOT154 |	Correct because you have basically turn
EDL	00:30:20,416	00:30:23,744	| IOT154 |	And this is why I've told everybody in my family don't touch the light switches in the house
EDL	00:30:24,512	00:30:27,328	| IOT154 |	And now people actually make fancy light switch covers that you can
EDL	00:30:27,328	00:30:28,352	| IOT154 |	You can stick over them
EDL	00:30:28,352	00:30:30,912	| IOT154 |	Billy hack off your family cuz then they can't ever turn the lights off
EDL	00:30:31,424	00:30:31,936	| IOT154 |	Switch
EDL	00:30:32,448	00:30:33,472	| IOT154 |	I'm not going to die
EDL	00:30:33,984	00:30:35,008	| IOT154 |	Instaff
EDL	00:30:35,776	00:30:40,128	| IOT154 |	Tape or you can install a Smart Switch if you have a Smart Switch
EDL	00:30:40,128	00:30:42,688	| IOT154 |	Google is smart enough to understand the state of that song
EDL	00:30:42,688	00:30:43,712	| IOT154 |	Twitch and so
EDL	00:30:43,712	00:30:45,248	| IOT154 |	It doesn't matter if someone
EDL	00:30:45,248	00:30:45,760	| IOT154 |	Turn something off
EDL	00:30:46,784	00:30:49,344	| IOT154 |	Right and by using a switch you can actually use
EDL	00:30:49,344	00:30:55,232	| IOT154 |	Old original be the point of contact for
EDL	00:30:55,232	00:30:56,000	| IOT154 |	Control
EDL	00:30:56,000	00:30:57,024	| IOT154 |	And
EDL	00:30:57,024	00:30:58,048	| IOT154 |	Tissues old pubs
EDL	00:30:58,048	00:30:59,584	| IOT154 |	And there are some
EDL	00:30:59,584	00:31:01,376	| IOT154 |	Parameters that you want to make sure you
EDL	00:31:01,376	00:31:02,912	| IOT154 |	Handle like they have to be capable of dimming
EDL	00:31:03,424	00:31:04,704	| IOT154 |	If you have a dimming switch
EDL	00:31:04,704	00:31:09,056	| IOT154 |	That's actually most of my house is wired up to Smart Life
EDL	00:31:09,568	00:31:10,336	| IOT154 |	Switches
EDL	00:31:10,336	00:31:12,128	| IOT154 |	The only place I have
EDL	00:31:12,128	00:31:13,664	| IOT154 |	Smart bulbs is where I want
EDL	00:31:13,664	00:31:14,432	| IOT154 |	Eye color change
EDL	00:31:14,432	00:31:15,200	| IOT154 |	Bulbs
EDL	00:31:15,200	00:31:15,712	| IOT154 |	And so
EDL	00:31:16,224	00:31:16,736	| IOT154 |	And those
EDL	00:31:17,248	00:31:18,784	| IOT154 |	Price of a terms of office which they don't
EDL	00:31:19,296	00:31:22,624	| IOT154 |	So that actually works
EDL	00:31:22,624	00:31:24,160	| IOT154 |	Nodejs Google Assistant
EDL	00:31:24,160	00:31:30,560	| IOT154 |	It also works for any smart home hubs that you might have so if you're like any automation
EDL	00:31:30,560	00:31:32,352	| IOT154 |	That you have those bulbs
EDL	00:31:32,352	00:31:32,864	| IOT154 |	Part of that group
EDL	00:31:33,376	00:31:34,656	| IOT154 |	So it's pretty much just
EDL	00:31:35,168	00:31:35,936	| IOT154 |	It's the same prayer
EDL	00:31:35,936	00:31:36,704	| IOT154 |	All things
EDL	00:31:36,704	00:31:39,008	| IOT154 |	If this is one of the benefits of going with smart switches
EDL	00:31:39,520	00:31:44,128	| IOT154 |	And I have not done that I'm completely opposite of what you have Stacey I have dumb switches
EDL	00:31:44,128	00:31:50,528	| IOT154 |	And all smart bulbs so that's why I told my family don't touch the switches.
EDL	00:31:50,528	00:31:51,808	| IOT154 |	Recommend to Lutron
EDL	00:31:52,320	00:31:53,088	| IOT154 |	Because they're made
EDL	00:31:53,088	00:31:54,112	| IOT154 |	Favorite of all time
EDL	00:31:54,112	00:31:56,928	| IOT154 |	Fees which is work like they're intuitive so you don't need
EDL	00:31:56,928	00:31:58,720	| IOT154 |	Educate your family
EDL	00:31:59,744	00:32:00,512	| IOT154 |	Which is nice
EDL	00:32:00,512	00:32:02,560	| IOT154 |	And the downside is they do require
EDL	00:32:03,328	00:32:06,400	| IOT154 |	The plus side is that how it works with Madam
EDL	00:32:06,400	00:32:07,424	| IOT154 |	Text with Google and it works with
EDL	00:32:08,192	00:32:10,240	| IOT154 |	So I feel like they're pretty future-proof
EDL	00:32:10,240	00:32:12,032	| IOT154 |	They work really well they're nice
EDL	00:32:12,032	00:32:15,104	| IOT154 |	If you don't want to do something like that Leviton makes a
EDL	00:32:15,616	00:32:17,664	| IOT154 |	Decora Smart Switch that
EDL	00:32:17,664	00:32:18,432	| IOT154 |	Is
EDL	00:32:18,432	00:32:19,712	| IOT154 |	Amazon Echo and
EDL	00:32:19,712	00:32:20,992	| IOT154 |	I believe Google Assistant
EDL	00:32:20,992	00:32:22,784	| IOT154 |	Enable do not get
EDL	00:32:22,784	00:32:23,808	| IOT154 |	WeMo
EDL	00:32:24,576	00:32:26,368	| IOT154 |	Smart dimmer switch because
EDL	00:32:26,368	00:32:27,136	| IOT154 |	It glows in the dark
EDL	00:32:27,136	00:32:27,648	| IOT154 |	And its related
EDL	00:32:28,416	00:32:29,184	| IOT154 |	That's my thought
EDL	00:32:29,184	00:32:30,208	| IOT154 |	Okay so
EDL	00:32:30,208	00:32:31,232	| IOT154 |	There's your question
EDL	00:32:31,232	00:32:32,000	| IOT154 |	Good question
EDL	00:32:32,000	00:32:34,304	| IOT154 |	And remember if you have a question and want to ask

EDL	00:33:21,920	00:33:22,688	| IOT154 |	What those are
EDL	00:33:22,688	00:33:23,712	| IOT154 |	Absolutely
EDL	00:33:23,712	00:33:26,016	| IOT154 |	Does Samsung has really focus on
EDL	00:33:26,016	00:33:29,088	| IOT154 |	Security in the last 6 months 9 months and really
EDL	00:33:29,088	00:33:31,648	| IOT154 |	Invested heavily in both features in the cloud
EDL	00:33:31,648	00:33:33,440	| IOT154 |	And on the hardware modules
EDL	00:33:33,440	00:33:34,976	| IOT154 |	We have Unified
EDL	00:33:34,976	00:33:35,488	| IOT154 |	ICloud

EDL	00:33:40,096	00:33:41,888	| IOT154 |	Previous article cloud services
EDL	00:33:42,400	00:33:45,472	| IOT154 |	And we've introduced our line of s modules
EDL	00:33:45,984	00:33:47,008	| IOT154 |	Gosh asthma
EDL	00:33:47,776	00:33:48,544	| IOT154 |	Tell me more about those
EDL	00:33:49,312	00:33:51,104	| IOT154 |	First of all the s stands for

EDL	00:34:19,264	00:34:20,032	| IOT154 |	Leaves as mulch
EDL	00:34:20,032	00:34:21,056	| IOT154 |	Those will be included
EDL	00:34:21,056	00:34:23,104	| IOT154 |	In all Samsung Smart refrigerator
EDL	00:34:23,872	00:34:27,200	| IOT154 |	What are the benefits of using the S module over something else
EDL	00:34:27,968	00:34:32,832	| IOT154 |	One of the primary benefits is rapid time-to-market we also eliminate the risk
EDL	00:34:32,832	00:34:33,600	| IOT154 |	Rolling out
EDL	00:34:33,600	00:34:36,928	| IOT154 |	Security including things like secure boot encrypt
EDL	00:34:36,928	00:34:37,696	| IOT154 |	Data
EDL	00:34:37,696	00:34:39,488	| IOT154 |	And you thought education out of the box
EDL	00:34:40,000	00:34:41,024	| IOT154 |	As part of this
EDL	00:34:41,024	00:34:43,072	| IOT154 |	It's critical that you design products
EDL	00:34:43,072	00:34:44,608	| IOT154 |	Security at mine which means
EDL	00:34:44,608	00:34:46,400	| IOT154 |	That you need to think about
EDL	00:34:46,400	00:34:47,936	| IOT154 |	At least 10 things
EDL	00:34:47,936	00:34:51,264	| IOT154 |	That are serious and important with respect to the pioneers
EDL	00:34:51,264	00:34:53,056	| IOT154 |	We create a list of these 10 things
EDL	00:34:53,568	00:34:55,360	| IOT154 |	So it's critical that Developers

EDL	00:35:01,504	00:35:03,552	| IOT154 |	That we think are absolutely essential
EDL	00:35:03,552	00:35:04,576	| IOT154 |	Develop

EDL	00:35:44,512	00:35:46,816	| IOT154 |	The newly-announced allegion ventures
EDL	00:35:46,816	00:35:47,584	| IOT154 |	Hi Rob
EDL	00:35:47,584	00:35:53,472	| IOT154 |	Hi Stacy thanks for having me today I am super excited and for our listeners you probably noticed that
EDL	00:35:53,472	00:35:54,752	| IOT154 |	Rob through his
EDL	00:35:54,752	00:35:56,288	| IOT154 |	Parent company Allegiant
EDL	00:35:56,288	00:35:57,824	| IOT154 |	They actually sponsor
EDL	00:35:57,824	00:35:58,848	| IOT154 |	The Internet of Things
EDL	00:35:59,872	00:36:00,640	| IOT154 |	Hotline
EDL	00:36:00,640	00:36:02,432	| IOT154 |	But we are here to talk about
EDL	00:36:02,432	00:36:04,736	| IOT154 |	A new Venture fund that
EDL	00:36:04,736	00:36:09,600	| IOT154 |	Is set up by Allegiant is called Allegiant dentures and it has 50 million dollars to invest
EDL	00:36:09,600	00:36:10,368	| IOT154 |	And Rob
EDL	00:36:10,368	00:36:11,904	| IOT154 |	Why don't you quickly tell us
EDL	00:36:11,904	00:36:13,952	| IOT154 |	Why Allegiant started this fund
EDL	00:36:13,952	00:36:17,024	| IOT154 |	Sure Stacy we started the fun
EDL	00:36:17,024	00:36:18,560	| IOT154 |	Because we felt like there all these
EDL	00:36:18,560	00:36:20,864	| IOT154 |	Fantastic ideas and
EDL	00:36:20,864	00:36:22,400	| IOT154 |	Technologies out there
EDL	00:36:22,400	00:36:24,192	| IOT154 |	That are yet to be discovered that could
EDL	00:36:24,192	00:36:25,728	| IOT154 |	Contribute directly to the
EDL	00:36:25,728	00:36:27,264	| IOT154 |	Security and safety space
EDL	00:36:27,264	00:36:33,664	| IOT154 |	We believe if we can connect with the right Founders and the right companies with the right business models we can help
EDL	00:36:33,664	00:36:34,688	| IOT154 |	Help accelerate them
EDL	00:36:34,688	00:36:38,272	| IOT154 |	Market not just in the traditional consumer iot space
EDL	00:36:38,272	00:36:39,808	| IOT154 |	But in a variety of space
EDL	00:36:40,320	00:36:42,368	| IOT154 |	You know whether that be multi-family or
EDL	00:36:42,368	00:36:44,416	| IOT154 |	Commercial institutional spaces
EDL	00:36:44,416	00:36:46,976	| IOT154 |	That they might not even be some other what's yet
EDL	00:36:46,976	00:36:50,816	| IOT154 |	Okay so you guys have 50 million dollars this is a corporate venture
EDL	00:36:50,816	00:36:57,216	| IOT154 |	Petrified which actually historically has gotten a terrible rap but with the internet of things that's actually where a lot of the doll
EDL	00:36:57,216	00:36:57,984	| IOT154 |	Others are coming from
EDL	00:36:58,496	00:37:01,056	| IOT154 |	So what is your goal is it to make money
EDL	00:37:01,056	00:37:01,568	| IOT154 |	Is it to
EDL	00:37:02,080	00:37:03,872	| IOT154 |	Find cool things that mixture of both
EDL	00:37:04,384	00:37:09,760	| IOT154 |	I think any Venture fund obviously you ultimately would love to make money but our focus is
EDL	00:37:09,760	00:37:14,880	| IOT154 |	I'm much more long-term view we think things take time to percolate so
EDL	00:37:14,880	00:37:17,696	| IOT154 |	It's much more about finding what's the next
EDL	00:37:17,696	00:37:21,280	| IOT154 |	Technology that is going to contribute to a breakthrough
EDL	00:37:21,280	00:37:23,072	| IOT154 |	In terms of the consumerist
EDL	00:37:23,072	00:37:23,840	| IOT154 |	Experience
EDL	00:37:23,840	00:37:25,120	| IOT154 |	Or a
EDL	00:37:25,120	00:37:25,888	| IOT154 |	Frictionless
EDL	00:37:25,888	00:37:30,496	| IOT154 |	Experience for people when they interact with Safety and Security devices
EDL	00:37:30,496	00:37:31,520	| IOT154 |	Hopefully
EDL	00:37:31,520	00:37:34,592	| IOT154 |	Udo long-term organ contribute to a safer environment overall
EDL	00:37:35,104	00:37:36,640	| IOT154 |	And you guys illusion
EDL	00:37:36,640	00:37:38,176	| IOT154 |	Has both residential
EDL	00:37:38,176	00:37:40,224	| IOT154 |	Sounds like we all know the Schlage Locks but
EDL	00:37:40,224	00:37:42,272	| IOT154 |	You guys also have a very large business
EDL	00:37:42,784	00:37:43,552	| IOT154 |	Set is
EDL	00:37:44,064	00:37:44,832	| IOT154 |	Commercial
EDL	00:37:44,832	00:37:46,880	| IOT154 |	Correct that's correct so
EDL	00:37:46,880	00:37:49,952	| IOT154 |	Allegiant is actually a 2.4 billion dollar company
EDL	00:37:50,464	00:37:54,304	| IOT154 |	We have 10000 people across 130 countries around the world
EDL	00:37:54,816	00:37:56,864	| IOT154 |	So most people know us
EDL	00:37:56,864	00:37:58,912	| IOT154 |	In North America by the Schlage name
EDL	00:37:58,912	00:38:01,728	| IOT154 |	But in Europe you might be slower with cheese
EDL	00:38:01,728	00:38:03,520	| IOT154 |	And we have a number of other brands
EDL	00:38:03,520	00:38:09,920	| IOT154 |	Example portable security like Kryptonite that people might be familiar with but actually the Lion's Share of our business is not
EDL	00:38:09,920	00:38:13,760	| IOT154 |	Not in the residential site it's actually on the commercial and institutional side
EDL	00:38:13,760	00:38:15,552	| IOT154 |	K through 12 schools
EDL	00:38:15,552	00:38:18,880	| IOT154 |	Higher education medical applications in the light
EDL	00:38:19,392	00:38:21,440	| IOT154 |	Okay so you guys are looking to invest
EDL	00:38:21,952	00:38:23,232	| IOT154 |	Cross that whole Broad
EDL	00:38:23,232	00:38:23,744	| IOT154 |	Portfolio of
EDL	00:38:25,280	00:38:25,792	| IOT154 |	Absolutely
EDL	00:38:26,304	00:38:27,584	| IOT154 |	We just see that
EDL	00:38:27,584	00:38:29,632	| IOT154 |	A lot of great disruption
EDL	00:38:29,632	00:38:30,400	| IOT154 |	Comes out of the
EDL	00:38:30,400	00:38:32,960	| IOT154 |	Consumer iot space you see a lot of
EDL	00:38:32,960	00:38:35,264	| IOT154 |	Unique design unique development
EDL	00:38:35,264	00:38:37,056	| IOT154 |	Very focused effort
EDL	00:38:37,568	00:38:41,664	| IOT154 |	That sometimes draw out interesting and new approaches
EDL	00:38:41,664	00:38:43,712	| IOT154 |	We also think the type of
EDL	00:38:43,712	00:38:45,248	| IOT154 |	People that are bringing those for
EDL	00:38:45,760	00:38:47,808	| IOT154 |	With our assistance with our
EDL	00:38:47,808	00:38:49,600	| IOT154 |	You know expertise within the space
EDL	00:38:50,112	00:38:53,696	| IOT154 |	We may be able to help to accelerate bringing their products to Market
EDL	00:38:53,696	00:38:55,744	| IOT154 |	But maybe even more importantly
EDL	00:38:55,744	00:39:01,376	| IOT154 |	Bring them to some new markets that they might not even be familiar with were manufacturer so we know how to build stuff
EDL	00:39:01,376	00:39:06,240	| IOT154 |	We've been building stuff for over a hundred years so when companies struggle to
EDL	00:39:06,240	00:39:07,008	| IOT154 |	To figure out
EDL	00:39:07,008	00:39:07,776	| IOT154 |	Even
EDL	00:39:07,776	00:39:11,872	| IOT154 |	You know very basic things not only are we security and safety experts
EDL	00:39:11,872	00:39:14,944	| IOT154 |	But we also know how to Source things we know where to go
EDL	00:39:14,944	00:39:17,504	| IOT154 |	Where lean Six Sigma experts
EDL	00:39:17,504	00:39:18,784	| IOT154 |	We have all kinds of
EDL	00:39:18,784	00:39:21,856	| IOT154 |	Unusual skills and expertise that people might not know
EDL	00:39:22,368	00:39:25,952	| IOT154 |	Okay so that gets into the let's take some Nitty Gritty fun questions first
EDL	00:39:26,720	00:39:28,768	| IOT154 |	So are you guys looking for
EDL	00:39:28,768	00:39:31,328	| IOT154 |	A particular series like series a seed
EDL	00:39:31,840	00:39:32,864	| IOT154 |	Maybe later
EDL	00:39:32,864	00:39:36,448	| IOT154 |	Shirt we're looking for early-stage companies that have good growth
EDL	00:39:36,448	00:39:37,216	| IOT154 |	Potential
EDL	00:39:37,216	00:39:38,752	| IOT154 |	We do look at seed
EDL	00:39:38,752	00:39:40,800	| IOT154 |	Series A&B to a degree
EDL	00:39:41,312	00:39:43,360	| IOT154 |	There's really no limit we could
EDL	00:39:43,360	00:39:48,736	| IOT154 |	Go to see but we're typically looking in that series a series B area to start
EDL	00:39:49,504	00:39:50,272	| IOT154 |	Okay in
EDL	00:39:50,272	00:39:53,600	| IOT154 |	Most corporate Ventures don't have a lifetime of their fun
EDL	00:39:53,600	00:39:57,696	| IOT154 |	Do you have a sense of how long you want your investment how many investment you'd like to make
EDL	00:39:57,696	00:39:58,464	| IOT154 |	Per year
EDL	00:39:58,464	00:39:59,232	| IOT154 |	And how long you play
EDL	00:40:00,000	00:40:00,512	| IOT154 |	What does investment
EDL	00:40:01,024	00:40:03,072	| IOT154 |	We really don't know but I would
EDL	00:40:03,072	00:40:05,120	| IOT154 |	Tell you from our thesis
EDL	00:40:05,120	00:40:07,168	| IOT154 |	We think it takes probably
EDL	00:40:07,168	00:40:08,448	| IOT154 |	Between somewhere
EDL	00:40:08,448	00:40:09,216	| IOT154 |	In 05.
EDL	00:40:09,216	00:40:11,776	| IOT154 |	7 years for something to really mature
EDL	00:40:11,776	00:40:13,056	| IOT154 |	Into the space
EDL	00:40:13,056	00:40:17,152	| IOT154 |	Sometimes brownouts or failures take up to three years for that to happen
EDL	00:40:17,152	00:40:19,456	| IOT154 |	And so we're taking a very long term review
EDL	00:40:19,456	00:40:22,016	| IOT154 |	We think in order to be successful
EDL	00:40:22,016	00:40:24,832	| IOT154 |	We need to really work and help Foster
EDL	00:40:25,344	00:40:28,928	| IOT154 |	Are these entrepreneurs and Founders so that's not an overnight
EDL	00:40:28,928	00:40:29,440	| IOT154 |	Activity
EDL	00:40:30,208	00:40:30,976	| IOT154 |	In any sense
EDL	00:40:30,976	00:40:31,488	| IOT154 |	Sofi investment
EDL	00:40:33,024	00:40:35,328	| IOT154 |	We don't actually have a set
EDL	00:40:35,328	00:40:38,400	| IOT154 |	Target we wanted do it in the most organic
EDL	00:40:38,400	00:40:41,472	| IOT154 |	And intuitive way we feel like if we were to set
EDL	00:40:41,472	00:40:43,776	| IOT154 |	Specific targets at somewhat arbitrary
EDL	00:40:43,776	00:40:49,408	| IOT154 |	And what we want to do is we want to reward the best ideas the best technology the best business models
EDL	00:40:49,408	00:40:50,688	| IOT154 |	All right and who are you
EDL	00:40:51,456	00:40:52,992	| IOT154 |	For this site there is yourself
EDL	00:40:55,040	00:40:59,136	| IOT154 |	Sure there are three of us you can find us an Allegiant ventures.com
EDL	00:40:59,136	00:41:05,280	| IOT154 |	Wade sheet who is our managing principal he also happens to be the deputy general counsel for our business
EDL	00:41:05,792	00:41:08,608	| IOT154 |	And then our chief marketing officer OSHA Stewart
EDL	00:41:08,608	00:41:09,376	| IOT154 |	Yellow Bass
EDL	00:41:09,376	00:41:10,144	| IOT154 |	Carmel Indiana
EDL	00:41:10,656	00:41:11,424	| IOT154 |	We are
EDL	00:41:11,424	00:41:11,936	| IOT154 |	Okay
EDL	00:41:12,448	00:41:12,960	| IOT154 |	Best part about
EDL	00:41:13,728	00:41:14,240	| IOT154 |	Is there startups
EDL	00:41:14,752	00:41:16,288	| IOT154 |	Let's talk about your thesis
EDL	00:41:17,056	00:41:20,640	| IOT154 |	So Stacy the thesis of the find is based
EDL	00:41:20,640	00:41:23,200	| IOT154 |	To a large degree in two things
EDL	00:41:23,200	00:41:26,528	| IOT154 |	We obviously want to Foster and develop new technology
EDL	00:41:27,296	00:41:28,832	| IOT154 |	By investing in tech companies
EDL	00:41:29,344	00:41:33,184	| IOT154 |	And we also want to partner with these Founders to make the world
EDL	00:41:33,184	00:41:34,464	| IOT154 |	A safer place
EDL	00:41:34,464	00:41:36,768	| IOT154 |	So that is quite Broad
EDL	00:41:36,768	00:41:39,072	| IOT154 |	But I can give you a tangible example
EDL	00:41:39,072	00:41:40,608	| IOT154 |	Which is a company like you know me
EDL	00:41:41,120	00:41:41,888	| IOT154 |	So
EDL	00:41:41,888	00:41:45,472	| IOT154 |	You didn't know me is an Austin in Boulder based startup
EDL	00:41:45,472	00:41:50,336	| IOT154 |	That many of the listeners may be familiar with from a consumer iot standpoint
EDL	00:41:50,848	00:41:52,384	| IOT154 |	They've a very popular application
EDL	00:41:52,895	00:41:54,175	| IOT154 |	That aggregates
EDL	00:41:54,687	00:41:55,967	| IOT154 |	In automate
EDL	00:41:55,967	00:41:57,247	| IOT154 |	Lots of
EDL	00:41:57,247	00:41:58,271	| IOT154 |	Routines
EDL	00:41:58,271	00:41:59,807	| IOT154 |	From your favorite
EDL	00:41:59,807	00:42:00,831	| IOT154 |	Iot devices
EDL	00:42:01,343	00:42:03,391	| IOT154 |	But what you might not know
EDL	00:42:03,391	00:42:04,415	| IOT154 |	About you know me
EDL	00:42:04,415	00:42:07,743	| IOT154 |	Is they also have two other enterprise-class products
EDL	00:42:07,743	00:42:09,791	| IOT154 |	One called that you know me spin cloud
EDL	00:42:09,791	00:42:12,351	| IOT154 |	That actually provide a very cost
EDL	00:42:12,351	00:42:14,399	| IOT154 |	Effective solution for
EDL	00:42:14,399	00:42:16,703	| IOT154 |	Large companies to get their products
EDL	00:42:16,703	00:42:17,727	| IOT154 |	Online
EDL	00:42:17,727	00:42:19,007	| IOT154 |	And to manage their
EDL	00:42:19,007	00:42:20,799	| IOT154 |	Messaging and
EDL	00:42:20,799	00:42:21,823	| IOT154 |	Conductivity
EDL	00:42:21,823	00:42:22,591	| IOT154 |	Infrastructure
EDL	00:42:23,103	00:42:25,407	| IOT154 |	And then another one called the anomie one
EDL	00:42:25,407	00:42:29,503	| IOT154 |	Which is essentially the ability to embed a software development
EDL	00:42:29,503	00:42:31,039	| IOT154 |	On a edge device
EDL	00:42:31,039	00:42:33,599	| IOT154 |	Very interesting company
EDL	00:42:33,599	00:42:36,927	| IOT154 |	That has a whole variety of different ways
EDL	00:42:36,927	00:42:37,695	| IOT154 |	Is 2
EDL	00:42:37,695	00:42:38,719	| IOT154 |	Interact with
EDL	00:42:38,719	00:42:41,279	| IOT154 |	Security devices in other things
EDL	00:42:41,279	00:42:42,815	| IOT154 |	But also has the ability
EDL	00:42:42,815	00:42:43,583	| IOT154 |	To manage
EDL	00:42:43,583	00:42:44,351	| IOT154 |	Flow
EDL	00:42:44,351	00:42:45,119	| IOT154 |	So
EDL	00:42:45,119	00:42:46,143	| IOT154 |	People flow
EDL	00:42:46,143	00:42:46,911	| IOT154 |	Through the house
EDL	00:42:46,911	00:42:53,055	| IOT154 |	It's the routine that you go through it does it in a very simple and automated weigh that is very appealing
EDL	00:42:53,567	00:42:54,335	| IOT154 |	2
EDL	00:42:54,335	00:42:57,919	| IOT154 |	A residential consumer that same level of benefit
EDL	00:42:57,919	00:43:00,223	| IOT154 |	Can potentially be brought across
EDL	00:43:00,223	00:43:04,063	| IOT154 |	To an Institutional or more commercial
EDL	00:43:04,063	00:43:09,183	| IOT154 |	And user and also that technology itself has great productivity benefits
EDL	00:43:09,183	00:43:10,719	| IOT154 |	For large companies like
EDL	00:43:10,719	00:43:12,255	| IOT154 |	Allegiant engine tax
EDL	00:43:12,255	00:43:15,071	| IOT154 |	Got it and by the way I should mention that you know me
EDL	00:43:15,071	00:43:16,607	| IOT154 |	Is actually also an advertised
EDL	00:43:17,375	00:43:21,471	| IOT154 |	On the show okay so that is a good example so it's a very wide swath
EDL	00:43:21,471	00:43:21,983	| IOT154 |	You guys are
EDL	00:43:23,007	00:43:23,775	| IOT154 |	Absolutely
EDL	00:43:23,775	00:43:24,543	| IOT154 |	What you know
EDL	00:43:24,543	00:43:27,615	| IOT154 |	In one of the other podcast I think you and Kevin talked about
EDL	00:43:27,615	00:43:28,127	| IOT154 |	The fact that
EDL	00:43:28,639	00:43:32,991	| IOT154 |	Security and safety security in particular is kind of the gateway drug for the
EDL	00:43:32,991	00:43:34,271	| IOT154 |	Consumer iot
EDL	00:43:34,271	00:43:35,807	| IOT154 |	It really is because if
EDL	00:43:35,807	00:43:36,575	| IOT154 |	If you think about it
EDL	00:43:37,087	00:43:38,111	| IOT154 |	The door
EDL	00:43:38,111	00:43:41,183	| IOT154 |	In the areas that Allegiant typically plays in which is
EDL	00:43:41,183	00:43:44,255	| IOT154 |	Play around the door is the launching off
EDL	00:43:44,767	00:43:49,119	| IOT154 |	For many many recipes routines robots what-have-you
EDL	00:43:49,119	00:43:50,143	| IOT154 |	And so
EDL	00:43:50,143	00:43:54,239	| IOT154 |	We're in a very fortuitous position to launch all kinds of other activities
EDL	00:43:54,239	00:43:55,263	| IOT154 |	Let's start with
EDL	00:43:55,775	00:43:56,799	| IOT154 |	Where you think
EDL	00:43:56,799	00:43:58,335	| IOT154 |	Investments might lie
EDL	00:43:59,103	00:44:01,919	| IOT154 |	I know that we have had guests on the show and I'm
EDL	00:44:01,919	00:44:03,967	| IOT154 |	I'm feeling like we are at the end of the
EDL	00:44:03,967	00:44:04,735	| IOT154 |	Consumer iot
EDL	00:44:05,247	00:44:06,783	| IOT154 |	So I'm curious
EDL	00:44:06,783	00:44:08,063	| IOT154 |	How you view that space
EDL	00:44:08,831	00:44:10,111	| IOT154 |	Sure so
EDL	00:44:10,111	00:44:10,879	| IOT154 |	I think
EDL	00:44:10,879	00:44:13,183	| IOT154 |	I align very closely with
EDL	00:44:13,183	00:44:15,743	| IOT154 |	Some of the comments made on the show of late around
EDL	00:44:16,255	00:44:19,327	| IOT154 |	The consumer iot in a little bit of its demise
EDL	00:44:19,839	00:44:21,631	| IOT154 |	We're obviously very bullish
EDL	00:44:21,631	00:44:23,679	| IOT154 |	But I think you need to have a balance
EDL	00:44:24,191	00:44:25,471	| IOT154 |	Portfolio in
EDL	00:44:25,471	00:44:29,055	| IOT154 |	Perspective when it comes to the consumer iot
EDL	00:44:29,055	00:44:31,871	| IOT154 |	Allegiant is very fortunate from the standpoint of
EDL	00:44:31,871	00:44:35,199	| IOT154 |	We've been in business for well over a hundred years
EDL	00:44:35,711	00:44:36,735	| IOT154 |	And we have
EDL	00:44:36,735	00:44:38,271	| IOT154 |	Both mechanical products
EDL	00:44:38,271	00:44:39,551	| IOT154 |	Ian connected products
EDL	00:44:40,063	00:44:42,879	| IOT154 |	So when we enter new markets with
EDL	00:44:42,879	00:44:46,207	| IOT154 |	Electromechanical and now fully digital product set
EDL	00:44:46,719	00:44:48,255	| IOT154 |	We're able to
EDL	00:44:48,255	00:44:50,303	| IOT154 |	Balance some of those elements out
EDL	00:44:50,303	00:44:52,095	| IOT154 |	Without having to
EDL	00:44:52,095	00:44:58,495	| IOT154 |	Bet the farm for lack of a better term on one or another it allows us to experiment a little bit it allows us
EDL	00:44:58,495	00:45:00,543	| IOT154 |	To plan and
EDL	00:45:00,543	00:45:01,823	| IOT154 |	Cover some cost
EDL	00:45:01,823	00:45:02,591	| IOT154 |	Where
EDL	00:45:02,591	00:45:03,615	| IOT154 |	Within an iot
EDL	00:45:03,615	00:45:05,407	| IOT154 |	The framework the ongoing
EDL	00:45:05,407	00:45:08,991	| IOT154 |	Maintenance cost of some of those things are something that a startup
EDL	00:45:08,991	00:45:09,759	| IOT154 |	Might not
EDL	00:45:09,759	00:45:12,575	| IOT154 |	Be able to absorb so for us we have
EDL	00:45:12,575	00:45:13,343	| IOT154 |	Some advantages there
EDL	00:45:13,855	00:45:15,647	| IOT154 |	When we look at that to my
EDL	00:45:15,647	00:45:19,487	| IOT154 |	Adventure fun standpoint we see some fantastic technology
EDL	00:45:19,999	00:45:21,023	| IOT154 |	And
EDL	00:45:21,023	00:45:25,375	| IOT154 |	In some cases it may be introduced within a consumer iot
EDL	00:45:25,375	00:45:27,935	| IOT154 |	Frame but we believe it's the founders
EDL	00:45:27,935	00:45:28,703	| IOT154 |	Had the Opera
EDL	00:45:28,703	00:45:30,751	| IOT154 |	Trinity or the exposure to some
EDL	00:45:30,751	00:45:32,543	| IOT154 |	Perhaps institutional
EDL	00:45:32,543	00:45:34,335	| IOT154 |	Or commercial application
EDL	00:45:34,847	00:45:36,127	| IOT154 |	They may find that
EDL	00:45:36,127	00:45:40,735	| IOT154 |	To be far more appealing from a financial standpoint which doesn't ultimately lock them out from
EDL	00:45:40,735	00:45:41,503	| IOT154 |	Working on
EDL	00:45:41,503	00:45:45,087	| IOT154 |	Consumer side but they might want to address that later as
EDL	00:45:45,087	00:45:47,135	| IOT154 |	Making money as a startup is a good thing
EDL	00:45:47,647	00:45:48,671	| IOT154 |	So let me ask
EDL	00:45:49,439	00:45:50,463	| IOT154 |	As a consumer
EDL	00:45:50,975	00:45:51,743	| IOT154 |	I feel like
EDL	00:45:51,743	00:45:53,791	| IOT154 |	We had amazing strides
EDL	00:45:53,791	00:45:55,839	| IOT154 |	It's in the last few years some very cool products
EDL	00:45:56,863	00:45:58,143	| IOT154 |	Some very terrible products
EDL	00:45:58,655	00:46:00,703	| IOT154 |	Even some good products that were been discontinued
EDL	00:46:00,703	00:46:01,215	| IOT154 |	Have also come up
EDL	00:46:01,983	00:46:05,823	| IOT154 |	But do you think that there's going to be a wholesale abandonment of
EDL	00:46:05,823	00:46:08,895	| IOT154 |	Of the space especially as we're seeing consolidation
EDL	00:46:09,663	00:46:16,063	| IOT154 |	Chinese I don't think they'll be a wholesale abandonment of the space I do think / 2018 + 29
EDL	00:46:16,063	00:46:18,879	| IOT154 |	19 we're going to see a lot more Brown House
EDL	00:46:18,879	00:46:21,183	| IOT154 |	In a lot more fire sales
EDL	00:46:21,183	00:46:22,975	| IOT154 |	And we have seen in the past
EDL	00:46:22,975	00:46:25,279	| IOT154 |	However I look at it like a wave.
EDL	00:46:25,279	00:46:25,791	| IOT154 |	Saint Stacy
EDL	00:46:26,303	00:46:27,839	| IOT154 |	You know the wave tank
EDL	00:46:27,839	00:46:29,631	| IOT154 |	For the last couple years has been
EDL	00:46:30,143	00:46:31,167	| IOT154 |	Great disruption
EDL	00:46:31,679	00:46:33,215	| IOT154 |	Fantastic ideas
EDL	00:46:33,215	00:46:35,007	| IOT154 |	Tons of energy from this
EDL	00:46:35,007	00:46:38,079	| IOT154 |	Consumer electronics almost gadgety side
EDL	00:46:38,079	00:46:39,103	| IOT154 |	Flowing across
EDL	00:46:39,103	00:46:41,919	| IOT154 |	Into multi-family and then ultimately
EDL	00:46:41,919	00:46:45,503	| IOT154 |	Beginning to impact institutional and Commercial markets
EDL	00:46:45,503	00:46:47,295	| IOT154 |	Well I think it's hit the back
EDL	00:46:48,575	00:46:50,623	| IOT154 |	And I think the way the starting come back
EDL	00:46:50,623	00:46:52,159	| IOT154 |	And I think you will see
EDL	00:46:52,159	00:46:53,183	| IOT154 |	Some mature
EDL	00:46:53,695	00:46:55,743	| IOT154 |	Casted maybe not as
EDL	00:46:55,743	00:47:01,887	| IOT154 |	Cool or maybe not as sexy to use that work Solutions but very practical applications of iot
EDL	00:47:01,887	00:47:03,679	| IOT154 |	But I think we'll bounce back
EDL	00:47:03,679	00:47:05,215	| IOT154 |	Can rebound back and you'll start
EDL	00:47:05,215	00:47:05,727	| IOT154 |	To see them
EDL	00:47:06,239	00:47:12,639	| IOT154 |	Coming the other direction back in so I don't think it'll be completely abandoned but I do think we're going to see some
EDL	00:47:12,639	00:47:13,663	| IOT154 |	Some consolidation in the
EDL	00:47:13,663	00:47:15,967	| IOT154 |	Space in I think it's necessary
EDL	00:47:15,967	00:47:17,503	| IOT154 |	I think when we
EDL	00:47:17,503	00:47:19,551	| IOT154 |	Get to a level where
EDL	00:47:19,551	00:47:23,135	| IOT154 |	You know skepticism is high enough when people make claims
EDL	00:47:23,135	00:47:23,903	| IOT154 |	Skin
EDL	00:47:23,903	00:47:30,303	| IOT154 |	People aren't able to deliver on those to the degree that we seen it gets a little sketchy and consumer start to scratch their head
EDL	00:47:30,303	00:47:31,583	| IOT154 |	How to make loose face
EDL	00:47:31,583	00:47:32,863	| IOT154 |	I think the
EDL	00:47:32,863	00:47:34,655	| IOT154 |	Inclusion of the Meg attack
EDL	00:47:35,423	00:47:37,471	| IOT154 |	More and more into the iot
EDL	00:47:37,471	00:47:41,055	| IOT154 |	Will contribute to some resilience there though as they expect
EDL	00:47:41,567	00:47:47,967	| IOT154 |	For these larger businesses you know whether it's an Amazon a Google and apple whoever it might be
EDL	00:47:47,967	00:47:49,503	| IOT154 |	Making these Investments
EDL	00:47:49,503	00:47:50,527	| IOT154 |	You know what you expect
EDL	00:47:50,527	00:47:53,343	| IOT154 |	You know those things to work and to do
EDL	00:47:53,343	00:47:55,903	| IOT154 |	What day are advertised and designed to do
EDL	00:47:56,415	00:47:59,999	| IOT154 |	Does Allegiant or Schlage look at the big consumer
EDL	00:47:59,999	00:48:01,791	| IOT154 |	Companies getting into the hardware space
EDL	00:48:01,791	00:48:05,631	| IOT154 |	Like Amazon's deal to buy ring I am think about Google
EDL	00:48:05,631	00:48:06,911	| IOT154 |	Bring nest in house
EDL	00:48:07,423	00:48:10,751	| IOT154 |	Looking at those deals do you guys worried that you're going to have to
EDL	00:48:10,751	00:48:12,287	| IOT154 |	Compete directly with those guys one day
EDL	00:48:13,055	00:48:15,871	| IOT154 |	Stacy I think the megatex are going to deliver
EDL	00:48:15,871	00:48:17,919	| IOT154 |	Amateur product offering
EDL	00:48:18,431	00:48:20,223	| IOT154 |	That is in line
EDL	00:48:20,223	00:48:20,991	| IOT154 |	With
EDL	00:48:20,991	00:48:23,039	| IOT154 |	Not only consumer electronic
EDL	00:48:23,039	00:48:24,575	| IOT154 |	Expectations
EDL	00:48:24,575	00:48:26,623	| IOT154 |	But also with
EDL	00:48:26,623	00:48:27,647	| IOT154 |	The basics
EDL	00:48:27,647	00:48:28,927	| IOT154 |	Security and safety elements
EDL	00:48:29,439	00:48:30,719	| IOT154 |	That people need to have
EDL	00:48:31,231	00:48:32,511	| IOT154 |	So that is comforting
EDL	00:48:32,511	00:48:33,279	| IOT154 |	Intuos
EDL	00:48:33,279	00:48:35,583	| IOT154 |	We partner with them very closely
EDL	00:48:35,583	00:48:37,119	| IOT154 |	So we do
EDL	00:48:37,119	00:48:38,143	| IOT154 |	Spend time with
EDL	00:48:38,655	00:48:39,935	| IOT154 |	You know Amazon
EDL	00:48:40,447	00:48:41,215	| IOT154 |	Apple
EDL	00:48:41,215	00:48:43,007	| IOT154 |	Andina the other Mega tax
EDL	00:48:43,519	00:48:44,799	| IOT154 |	To ensure that
EDL	00:48:44,799	00:48:46,079	| IOT154 |	You know our products
EDL	00:48:46,079	00:48:47,359	| IOT154 |	And how they're used within their
EDL	00:48:47,359	00:48:50,431	| IOT154 |	Ecosystems are done properly so we're actually
EDL	00:48:50,431	00:48:51,455	| IOT154 |	Excited about the
EDL	00:48:51,455	00:48:54,783	| IOT154 |	Participation it's an accelerant for us rather than a detriment
EDL	00:48:55,295	00:49:00,671	| IOT154 |	And then on the industrial and institutional side what are some technology holes that
EDL	00:49:00,671	00:49:01,439	| IOT154 |	Could be felt
EDL	00:49:01,439	00:49:01,951	| IOT154 |	That you might be
EDL	00:49:02,975	00:49:05,279	| IOT154 |	I think the number one hole
EDL	00:49:05,279	00:49:06,047	| IOT154 |	Sounds
EDL	00:49:06,047	00:49:07,583	| IOT154 |	Pretty basic across
EDL	00:49:07,583	00:49:09,631	| IOT154 |	You know both consumer
EDL	00:49:09,631	00:49:11,679	| IOT154 |	Multi-family in commercial which is
EDL	00:49:12,191	00:49:13,983	| IOT154 |	People don't want to carry anything
EDL	00:49:14,495	00:49:17,311	| IOT154 |	Wisdom to get in the door they want the door
EDL	00:49:17,311	00:49:19,103	| IOT154 |	Or the product
EDL	00:49:19,103	00:49:21,919	| IOT154 |	You know the portable security device to recognize down
EDL	00:49:22,431	00:49:23,967	| IOT154 |	So how do we do that
EDL	00:49:24,479	00:49:26,015	| IOT154 |	You know today everyone carries
EDL	00:49:26,015	00:49:27,039	| IOT154 |	The phone with them
EDL	00:49:27,039	00:49:28,319	| IOT154 |	They may have a wearable
EDL	00:49:28,831	00:49:30,623	| IOT154 |	What if you don't have those things
EDL	00:49:30,623	00:49:31,647	| IOT154 |	Yet you still want
EDL	00:49:32,159	00:49:32,927	| IOT154 |	Secure
EDL	00:49:32,927	00:49:33,439	| IOT154 |	And say
EDL	00:49:33,951	00:49:34,719	| IOT154 |	Solution
EDL	00:49:34,719	00:49:36,255	| IOT154 |	To give you access to
EDL	00:49:36,255	00:49:37,023	| IOT154 |	To your bike
EDL	00:49:37,023	00:49:39,071	| IOT154 |	Or to your home to your office
EDL	00:49:39,583	00:49:41,631	| IOT154 |	It's a weird looking for
EDL	00:49:41,631	00:49:44,703	| IOT154 |	Technologies that can bring a more frictionless experience
EDL	00:49:45,215	00:49:47,007	| IOT154 |	Into all of those areas
EDL	00:49:47,519	00:49:49,567	| IOT154 |	While at the same time still
EDL	00:49:49,567	00:49:50,847	| IOT154 |	Addressing
EDL	00:49:50,847	00:49:52,383	| IOT154 |	The real legitimate
EDL	00:49:52,383	00:49:53,407	| IOT154 |	It concerns
EDL	00:49:53,407	00:49:54,431	| IOT154 |	That people have
EDL	00:49:54,431	00:49:55,711	| IOT154 |	You know we experience
EDL	00:49:55,711	00:49:57,503	| IOT154 |	This terrible tragedy in park
EDL	00:49:57,503	00:49:58,527	| IOT154 |	And
EDL	00:49:58,527	00:49:59,551	| IOT154 |	We
EDL	00:49:59,551	00:50:00,575	| IOT154 |	Have a lot of product
EDL	00:50:01,087	00:50:03,903	| IOT154 |	In k through 12 schools and higher education
EDL	00:50:03,903	00:50:06,719	| IOT154 |	How can we secure in Hardin
EDL	00:50:06,719	00:50:07,487	| IOT154 |	Those
EDL	00:50:07,487	00:50:08,255	| IOT154 |	Schools
EDL	00:50:08,255	00:50:09,023	| IOT154 |	Wallet
EDL	00:50:09,023	00:50:10,047	| IOT154 |	The same time
EDL	00:50:10,047	00:50:12,863	| IOT154 |	Not make our students and teachers feel like there
EDL	00:50:13,375	00:50:15,423	| IOT154 |	You know behind a TSA security line
EDL	00:50:15,935	00:50:19,519	| IOT154 |	How can we do that those are the types of technologies that were looking
EDL	00:50:19,519	00:50:23,359	| IOT154 |	To bring in so that we can really give the Peace of Mind
EDL	00:50:23,359	00:50:25,407	| IOT154 |	But don't have people feel like they're swimming in
EDL	00:50:26,175	00:50:27,967	| IOT154 |	That's a tall order I can't wait to see the investor
EDL	00:50:29,759	00:50:31,551	| IOT154 |	Thanks for coming on the show this week
