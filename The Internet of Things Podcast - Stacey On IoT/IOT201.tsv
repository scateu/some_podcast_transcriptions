EDL	00:01:44,960	00:01:46,496	| IOT201 |	That's database
EDL	00:01:47,008	00:01:47,520	| IOT201 |	Possible
EDL	00:01:48,032	00:01:48,800	| IOT201 |	Dot-com
EDL	00:01:49,824	00:01:50,592	| IOT201 |	Okay
EDL	00:01:50,592	00:01:51,360	| IOT201 |	Hey
EDL	00:01:51,360	00:01:52,128	| IOT201 |	Kevin
EDL	00:01:52,128	00:01:53,152	| IOT201 |	We won't go.
EDL	00:01:53,152	00:01:56,480	| IOT201 |	Too much into the Bluetooth news because we've got a deep dive
EDL	00:01:56,480	00:01:57,248	| IOT201 |	Some can holder upcoming
EDL	00:01:57,760	00:01:58,528	| IOT201 |	But
EDL	00:01:58,528	00:01:59,296	| IOT201 |	We should tell p
EDL	00:01:59,296	00:01:59,808	| IOT201 |	WhatsApp
EDL	00:02:00,320	00:02:02,624	| IOT201 |	So on Monday the 6th
EDL	00:02:02,624	00:02:03,648	| IOT201 |	I said that
EDL	00:02:03,648	00:02:06,976	| IOT201 |	They are announcing new location based services for Bluetooth
EDL	00:02:06,976	00:02:08,768	| IOT201 |	Basically this means that
EDL	00:02:08,768	00:02:10,816	| IOT201 |	Your Bluetooth low-energy radios
EDL	00:02:10,816	00:02:12,352	| IOT201 |	They will now be able
EDL	00:02:12,352	00:02:13,888	| IOT201 |	How to tell where they are
EDL	00:02:14,400	00:02:15,680	| IOT201 |	Within about a few cents
EDL	00:02:16,448	00:02:17,216	| IOT201 |	Which is pretty cool
EDL	00:02:17,216	00:02:23,104	| IOT201 |	It is and I'm glad Candice here because I wrote a post this week about what I think we could use this technology
EDL	00:02:23,104	00:02:29,248	| IOT201 |	Before some Curious to hear what he has to say about the new feature in general the features called direction finder
EDL	00:02:29,760	00:02:33,088	| IOT201 |	So with current Bluetooth Solutions like you may have like a Bluetooth
EDL	00:02:33,088	00:02:36,672	| IOT201 |	Tracking device like a tile or a Tracker or whatever you might have
EDL	00:02:36,672	00:02:40,256	| IOT201 |	And you can use the mobile app and it will track the signal of that
EDL	00:02:40,256	00:02:41,280	| IOT201 |	Tracking device
EDL	00:02:41,280	00:02:42,048	| IOT201 |	And kind of
EDL	00:02:42,048	00:02:46,400	| IOT201 |	Tell you how far away you are from an as you get closer you may find lost keys where's my bus
EDL	00:02:46,400	00:02:48,448	| IOT201 |	What I use a Bluetooth tracker for my house
EDL	00:02:48,448	00:02:50,240	| IOT201 |	Direction finding feature
EDL	00:02:50,240	00:02:52,032	| IOT201 |	Takes it to a whole nother level
EDL	00:02:52,032	00:02:54,080	| IOT201 |	And was going to rain
EDL	00:02:54,080	00:02:59,968	| IOT201 |	Potential possibilities such as indoor positioning asset tracking again like you said down to the centimeter
EDL	00:02:59,968	00:03:02,016	| IOT201 |	Level my thought isn't
EDL	00:03:02,016	00:03:03,808	| IOT201 |	Maybe I'm thinking too hard on this
EDL	00:03:03,808	00:03:06,112	| IOT201 |	This could be huge for the Smart Home
EDL	00:03:06,112	00:03:09,696	| IOT201 |	And I don't think it's more I'm going to see it right away I think it's going to be more than like acid
EDL	00:03:09,696	00:03:12,000	| IOT201 |	Tracking inventory type Solutions at first
EDL	00:03:12,000	00:03:14,816	| IOT201 |	But if it comes to the smart home think about this
EDL	00:03:14,816	00:03:17,120	| IOT201 |	You could have actual person alive
EDL	00:03:17,120	00:03:23,520	| IOT201 |	Presence detection with this to the centimeter level meaning if I have a phone with this technology or maybe
EDL	00:03:23,520	00:03:25,056	| IOT201 |	Maybe a device like a
EDL	00:03:25,056	00:03:30,176	| IOT201 |	Clip-on to myself or I put in my pocket for example my smart home
EDL	00:03:30,176	00:03:31,200	| IOT201 |	Actually tell
EDL	00:03:31,200	00:03:35,296	| IOT201 |	Where I am exactly Mouse and who I am because I would register that device
EDL	00:03:35,296	00:03:40,928	| IOT201 |	So now instead of like using a camera or motion sensor that says there's somebody in that room
EDL	00:03:40,928	00:03:43,488	| IOT201 |	You can say Hey Kevin is in his office
EDL	00:03:43,488	00:03:49,888	| IOT201 |	In this spot and when he's in the spot he likes this music playing in this light on this temperature and so on this could
EDL	00:03:49,888	00:03:51,424	| IOT201 |	Could bring a lot more context
EDL	00:03:51,424	00:03:53,728	| IOT201 |	To the smart home is at least that's what I'm hoping
EDL	00:03:54,240	00:03:56,288	| IOT201 |	You are right to help for that
EDL	00:03:56,288	00:03:56,800	| IOT201 |	It will
EDL	00:03:57,312	00:03:58,592	| IOT201 |	A little while now
EDL	00:03:58,592	00:03:59,616	| IOT201 |	The way youth
EDL	00:03:59,616	00:04:00,640	| IOT201 |	Suggested it could work
EDL	00:04:01,152	00:04:02,944	| IOT201 |	So one of the challenges with the
EDL	00:04:02,944	00:04:03,712	| IOT201 |	This new feature
EDL	00:04:03,712	00:04:05,760	| IOT201 |	Is that handset makers are going to have
EDL	00:04:06,272	00:04:06,784	| IOT201 |	Adapter
EDL	00:04:07,552	00:04:10,624	| IOT201 |	But the sense when the consumer side you're not going to see it on handsets
EDL	00:04:10,624	00:04:11,904	| IOT201 |	Until people get new Bluetooth
EDL	00:04:11,904	00:04:12,672	| IOT201 |	Tooth chips in there
EDL	00:04:12,672	00:04:13,440	| IOT201 |	Which means new handset
EDL	00:04:13,952	00:04:14,976	| IOT201 |	So that's a little ways
EDL	00:04:15,744	00:04:17,791	| IOT201 |	On the industrial side they're actually
EDL	00:04:17,791	00:04:18,815	| IOT201 |	Companies Rd
EDL	00:04:18,815	00:04:19,583	| IOT201 |	Using
EDL	00:04:19,583	00:04:20,095	| IOT201 |	Precursors
EDL	00:04:21,119	00:04:22,911	| IOT201 |	So that's happening already
EDL	00:04:22,911	00:04:23,423	| IOT201 |	Asset tracker
EDL	00:04:23,935	00:04:25,983	| IOT201 |	With your idea what you would have
EDL	00:04:25,983	00:04:27,775	| IOT201 |	Have to do is basically by
EDL	00:04:27,775	00:04:28,287	| IOT201 |	A whole.new
EDL	00:04:29,567	00:04:31,615	| IOT201 |	So you would have your dedicated thing
EDL	00:04:32,383	00:04:34,943	| IOT201 |	Your clip-on belt loop whatever thing
EDL	00:04:34,943	00:04:36,223	| IOT201 |	And then you would have to have
EDL	00:04:36,223	00:04:40,319	| IOT201 |	Some sort of Beacon infrastructure that's new around your home with the appropriate
EDL	00:04:40,319	00:04:41,599	| IOT201 |	Antennas
EDL	00:04:41,599	00:04:42,111	| IOT201 |	That could happen
EDL	00:04:42,623	00:04:43,391	| IOT201 |	And so
EDL	00:04:43,391	00:04:44,415	| IOT201 |	Will look for that
EDL	00:04:44,415	00:04:45,695	| IOT201 |	We'll see and
EDL	00:04:45,695	00:04:47,231	| IOT201 |	That was supposed to happen
EDL	00:04:47,231	00:04:49,791	| IOT201 |	Check with pekin
EDL	00:04:49,791	00:04:50,559	| IOT201 |	Again
EDL	00:04:50,559	00:04:51,583	| IOT201 |	You guys will enjoy the interview
EDL	00:04:52,095	00:04:54,399	| IOT201 |	Hugo's fairly deep on all of this stuff
EDL	00:04:54,399	00:04:56,447	| IOT201 |	Explains what happens with pekin
EDL	00:04:57,215	00:04:57,983	| IOT201 |	Hey
EDL	00:04:57,983	00:04:59,007	| IOT201 |	Speaking of beacons
EDL	00:04:59,519	00:05:00,799	| IOT201 |	Is a weird yusuke's but
EDL	00:05:01,567	00:05:02,079	| IOT201 |	I think it's weird
EDL	00:05:02,591	00:05:03,103	| IOT201 |	It doesn't feel like
EDL	00:05:03,871	00:05:07,199	| IOT201 |	What ways is using Bluetooth beacons in New York
EDL	00:05:07,199	00:05:08,479	| IOT201 |	Cities tunnels
EDL	00:05:08,479	00:05:09,503	| IOT201 |	And bridges
EDL	00:05:09,503	00:05:10,783	| IOT201 |	Where you might lose your
EDL	00:05:10,783	00:05:11,551	| IOT201 |	GPS signal
EDL	00:05:11,551	00:05:13,087	| IOT201 |	They're putting beacons
EDL	00:05:13,087	00:05:14,623	| IOT201 |	Every 40 meters
EDL	00:05:14,623	00:05:15,391	| IOT201 |	Roughly
EDL	00:05:15,391	00:05:17,695	| IOT201 |	So that's what 42 m per mile
EDL	00:05:17,695	00:05:19,743	| IOT201 |	That's 42 beacons for my Lotus
EDL	00:05:19,743	00:05:21,791	| IOT201 |	And at a cost of $28 and change
EDL	00:05:22,303	00:05:24,351	| IOT201 |	It's about $8,000 a mile to
EDL	00:05:24,351	00:05:24,863	| IOT201 |	Implement
EDL	00:05:25,375	00:05:26,911	| IOT201 |	And ideas you could be able
EDL	00:05:26,911	00:05:29,215	| IOT201 |	How to say hey when you're driving through there's a
EDL	00:05:29,215	00:05:31,263	| IOT201 |	Pekin inside a car driven
EDL	00:05:31,263	00:05:32,031	| IOT201 |	By subway
EDL	00:05:33,567	00:05:34,335	| IOT201 |	And
EDL	00:05:34,335	00:05:35,103	| IOT201 |	That would actually
EDL	00:05:35,103	00:05:35,871	| IOT201 |	To tell you how long it take
EDL	00:05:36,383	00:05:37,151	| IOT201 |	To Traverse that
EDL	00:05:37,151	00:05:38,175	| IOT201 |	Particular Bridge or tunnel
EDL	00:05:38,687	00:05:39,711	| IOT201 |	I get it
EDL	00:05:39,711	00:05:41,759	| IOT201 |	I just don't think this is the best
EDL	00:05:41,759	00:05:42,271	| IOT201 |	Radio
EDL	00:05:42,783	00:05:44,319	| IOT201 |	Stalogy for that but
EDL	00:05:46,111	00:05:49,439	| IOT201 |	Well it means there are few alternatives to good GPS
EDL	00:05:49,439	00:05:53,791	| IOT201 |	Signal and when you think about the tunnels that they have in New York City as well as the
EDL	00:05:53,791	00:05:56,095	| IOT201 |	Gwb the George Washington Bridge has
EDL	00:05:56,095	00:06:00,703	| IOT201 |	2 levels of fear on the underneath level you might lose GPS because you've got no
EDL	00:06:00,703	00:06:03,263	| IOT201 |	Stephen Stephen cars in top of Yuan
EDL	00:06:03,263	00:06:04,031	| IOT201 |	Top-level
EDL	00:06:04,031	00:06:07,871	| IOT201 |	I'm not sure what the alternative is other than say well just no signal I mean
EDL	00:06:07,871	00:06:09,407	| IOT201 |	You don't need it for directions
EDL	00:06:09,407	00:06:13,247	| IOT201 |	Companies probably want it for data such as the traffic
EDL	00:06:13,247	00:06:17,599	| IOT201 |	Information you how long is it taking to get across the gwb today at work through the Lincoln Tunnel
EDL	00:06:18,111	00:06:19,135	| IOT201 |	That's true and we don't have
EDL	00:06:19,903	00:06:22,463	| IOT201 |	Great vehicle to vehicle or vehicle-to-infrastructure coming
EDL	00:06:22,975	00:06:23,999	| IOT201 |	And so
EDL	00:06:23,999	00:06:27,583	| IOT201 |	We've been talking about for a few years with Wi-Fi and other
EDL	00:06:27,583	00:06:28,863	| IOT201 |	Things with the word 5gf
EDL	00:06:28,863	00:06:29,631	| IOT201 |	Fix it
EDL	00:06:29,631	00:06:30,399	| IOT201 |	Yeah it's magic
EDL	00:06:30,399	00:06:31,935	| IOT201 |	Oh yeah
EDL	00:06:31,935	00:06:33,215	| IOT201 |	Jionet
EDL	00:06:33,727	00:06:34,239	| IOT201 |	All right
EDL	00:06:35,263	00:06:36,287	| IOT201 |	That was sarcasm
EDL	00:06:36,287	00:06:37,311	| IOT201 |	For everyone who was not aware
EDL	00:06:37,823	00:06:38,591	| IOT201 |	Alright let's
EDL	00:06:38,591	00:06:39,359	| IOT201 |	Suck it up lighting
EDL	00:06:39,871	00:06:41,919	| IOT201 |	Because there's two crazy lighting Products
EDL	00:06:42,687	00:06:43,711	| IOT201 |	When is actually not cry
EDL	00:06:43,711	00:06:44,479	| IOT201 |	Crazy one is
EDL	00:06:44,479	00:06:45,247	| IOT201 |	A big surprise egg
EDL	00:06:45,759	00:06:47,039	| IOT201 |	Woke up with a surprise first
EDL	00:06:47,039	00:06:48,831	| IOT201 |	Casper the maker of
EDL	00:06:48,831	00:06:49,343	| IOT201 |	Beds
EDL	00:06:49,855	00:06:55,487	| IOT201 |	Yeah I order online and get the mattress sent to your house in a box and expand isn't and I fat
EDL	00:06:55,487	00:06:56,767	| IOT201 |	Yeah I mean I have a
EDL	00:06:56,767	00:06:57,791	| IOT201 |	Leesa mattress in our house
EDL	00:06:57,791	00:06:58,559	| IOT201 |	House so it's
EDL	00:06:58,559	00:06:59,327	| IOT201 |	It's not a Casper but
EDL	00:07:00,863	00:07:01,375	| IOT201 |	For Pioneer this
EDL	00:07:02,143	00:07:05,983	| IOT201 |	They're getting into the smart home space with a lamp
EDL	00:07:05,983	00:07:07,775	| IOT201 |	Is called the Casper glow
EDL	00:07:07,775	00:07:09,567	| IOT201 |	Is actually a pretty cool device
EDL	00:07:10,079	00:07:11,103	| IOT201 |	You know how I always help you
EDL	00:07:11,103	00:07:11,615	| IOT201 |	People I need the
EDL	00:07:12,127	00:07:13,919	| IOT201 |	Be smart this is actually pretty smart
EDL	00:07:13,919	00:07:15,967	| IOT201 |	It is designed to dim
EDL	00:07:15,967	00:07:16,991	| IOT201 |	In Brighton based
EDL	00:07:16,991	00:07:17,759	| IOT201 |	Saint
EDL	00:07:17,759	00:07:18,271	| IOT201 |	Your circadian
EDL	00:07:19,039	00:07:20,831	| IOT201 |	So different type of light in the morning verse
EDL	00:07:21,855	00:07:22,623	| IOT201 |	It is
EDL	00:07:23,135	00:07:24,927	| IOT201 |	Designer gradually dim at bedtime
EDL	00:07:24,927	00:07:25,695	| IOT201 |	I've actually had
EDL	00:07:26,719	00:07:27,487	| IOT201 |	It's that have been designed
EDL	00:07:28,255	00:07:29,279	| IOT201 |	So this is not
EDL	00:07:29,279	00:07:29,791	| IOT201 |	Tortellini
EDL	00:07:30,303	00:07:32,351	| IOT201 |	But it is kind of a pretty
EDL	00:07:32,351	00:07:34,399	| IOT201 |	In a neat form factor and it does not work
EDL	00:07:35,679	00:07:38,239	| IOT201 |	So it also has this ambient light sensor
EDL	00:07:38,751	00:07:39,775	| IOT201 |	Gives that
EDL	00:07:39,775	00:07:41,311	| IOT201 |	Apparently modifies the light
EDL	00:07:41,311	00:07:42,591	| IOT201 |	For the environment you're in
EDL	00:07:44,383	00:07:46,175	| IOT201 |	Yeah kind of gets rid of the blue light
EDL	00:07:46,175	00:07:48,479	| IOT201 |	Didn't miss a warm Hue based on the
EDL	00:07:48,479	00:07:49,503	| IOT201 |	Ambient light
EDL	00:07:49,503	00:07:51,295	| IOT201 |	So that way it's not messing with your sleep patterns
EDL	00:07:51,807	00:07:52,575	| IOT201 |	And the cool thing is
EDL	00:07:53,343	00:07:54,367	| IOT201 |	You turn it off by flipping it over
EDL	00:07:54,879	00:07:55,647	| IOT201 |	Which iPhone
EDL	00:07:55,647	00:07:57,695	| IOT201 |	That's a clever implementation because
EDL	00:07:57,695	00:07:59,231	| IOT201 |	Essenza behave like
EDL	00:07:59,231	00:08:00,511	| IOT201 |	Power charging
EDL	00:08:00,511	00:08:05,375	| IOT201 |	So yeah you just flip it over it still stays on Rico's off and it's not losing power that way
EDL	00:08:05,887	00:08:07,679	| IOT201 |	Yeah and then there's a bunch of other stuff now
EDL	00:08:08,191	00:08:09,215	| IOT201 |	The other cool thing is
EDL	00:08:10,239	00:08:11,775	| IOT201 |	Portable so you can bring it
EDL	00:08:11,775	00:08:13,311	| IOT201 |	Places obviously you have
EDL	00:08:13,311	00:08:14,079	| IOT201 |	Have to charge it
EDL	00:08:14,079	00:08:16,895	| IOT201 |	Normal use most of the time
EDL	00:08:16,895	00:08:18,431	| IOT201 |	You can bring the glow with you
EDL	00:08:18,431	00:08:19,967	| IOT201 |	You so they talk about you know
EDL	00:08:19,967	00:08:20,991	| IOT201 |	Going to bathroom
EDL	00:08:20,991	00:08:23,807	| IOT201 |	Getting a drink of water you can bring the lamp in Italy
EDL	00:08:23,807	00:08:25,087	| IOT201 |	Glow softly for you
EDL	00:08:25,087	00:08:26,111	| IOT201 |	Feels like summer
EDL	00:08:27,135	00:08:27,647	| IOT201 |	Need to see to believe
EDL	00:08:28,671	00:08:30,719	| IOT201 |	I have solar powered LED lamps
EDL	00:08:30,719	00:08:32,767	| IOT201 |	My house for the zombie apocalypse
EDL	00:08:32,767	00:08:34,559	| IOT201 |	So I keep one by the band KISS you have on YouTube
EDL	00:08:35,071	00:08:36,095	| IOT201 |	Stuff around the house
EDL	00:08:36,095	00:08:38,911	| IOT201 |	I can literally just looked it up on the basement lights up
EDL	00:08:38,911	00:08:40,447	| IOT201 |	It's not smart but it works
EDL	00:08:40,447	00:08:42,751	| IOT201 |	I doubt it last as long as Piccolo because you can
EDL	00:08:42,751	00:08:43,519	| IOT201 |	Havis
EDL	00:08:43,519	00:08:45,567	| IOT201 |	Beyond continuously for up to seven hours on battery
EDL	00:08:46,079	00:08:47,359	| IOT201 |	These clothes will not come
EDL	00:08:48,127	00:08:50,687	| IOT201 |	The single glow will cost $89 and
EDL	00:08:50,687	00:08:52,735	| IOT201 |	How to pack that sticks together will cost
EDL	00:08:53,247	00:08:53,759	| IOT201 |	100 +
EDL	00:08:54,271	00:08:55,039	| IOT201 |	$69
EDL	00:08:55,551	00:08:56,575	| IOT201 |	So Kevin are you in
EDL	00:08:57,087	00:08:58,367	| IOT201 |	I
EDL	00:08:58,367	00:09:04,511	| IOT201 |	Think not I can only sleep for 45 hours at a time anyway so I'll just stick with my connected bulbs in my bedroom
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:05,279	| IOT201 |	Okay
EDL	00:09:05,279	00:09:06,047	| IOT201 |	So
EDL	00:09:06,047	00:09:09,887	| IOT201 |	Sticking with lights and circadian rhythms a new startup
EDL	00:09:09,887	00:09:10,655	| IOT201 |	Has come out
EDL	00:09:10,655	00:09:11,423	| IOT201 |	Called Oro
EDL	00:09:11,935	00:09:12,959	| IOT201 |	And Oro is
EDL	00:09:13,471	00:09:14,239	| IOT201 |	Connected lights
EDL	00:09:15,007	00:09:15,519	| IOT201 |	That
EDL	00:09:16,287	00:09:17,055	| IOT201 |	There are so many
EDL	00:09:17,567	00:09:18,335	| IOT201 |	But
EDL	00:09:18,335	00:09:19,871	| IOT201 |	This one is a little bit unique
EDL	00:09:19,871	00:09:21,407	| IOT201 |	It actually reminds me of
EDL	00:09:21,407	00:09:22,431	| IOT201 |	FB stock
EDL	00:09:22,431	00:09:23,711	| IOT201 |	Lighting but those were bulbs
EDL	00:09:24,479	00:09:25,503	| IOT201 |	Years ago
EDL	00:09:25,503	00:09:26,271	| IOT201 |	Kind of had
EDL	00:09:26,271	00:09:27,807	| IOT201 |	Both AI motion
EDL	00:09:27,807	00:09:28,831	| IOT201 |	Sensors presents
EDL	00:09:28,831	00:09:30,111	| IOT201 |	Detection in the light bulb
EDL	00:09:30,111	00:09:32,415	| IOT201 |	And they would learn based on your habits
EDL	00:09:32,415	00:09:33,183	| IOT201 |	In the balls with dammit
EDL	00:09:33,695	00:09:34,719	| IOT201 |	Figure things out
EDL	00:09:35,231	00:09:35,999	| IOT201 |	It was magic
EDL	00:09:35,999	00:09:37,279	| IOT201 |	I tried them out they were
EDL	00:09:37,279	00:09:39,583	| IOT201 |	Pretty good they weren't as magic as I thought they'd be
EDL	00:09:39,583	00:09:40,863	| IOT201 |	They do get better over time
EDL	00:09:41,375	00:09:42,911	| IOT201 |	The Oro does all of this
EDL	00:09:42,911	00:09:43,679	| IOT201 |	In a light
EDL	00:09:44,959	00:09:45,727	| IOT201 |	So the switch
EDL	00:09:46,495	00:09:48,031	| IOT201 |	You replace it requires a neutral wire
EDL	00:09:48,543	00:09:49,311	| IOT201 |	It
EDL	00:09:49,311	00:09:50,079	| IOT201 |	It's on your wall that can
EDL	00:09:50,591	00:09:52,895	| IOT201 |	Check when someone's in the room that learns your habits over
EDL	00:09:52,895	00:09:53,663	| IOT201 |	Time in it
EDL	00:09:53,663	00:09:55,455	| IOT201 |	Basically Tunes the lighting
EDL	00:09:55,455	00:09:59,039	| IOT201 |	Two again your circadian rhythm so cooler light in the morning
EDL	00:09:59,551	00:10:00,575	| IOT201 |	While doing stuff
EDL	00:10:00,575	00:10:02,879	| IOT201 |	And then dimming and turning orange year
EDL	00:10:02,879	00:10:03,647	| IOT201 |	Or at night
EDL	00:10:03,647	00:10:09,791	| IOT201 |	Yeah what I like about this is the number of sensors in here because they're like switches with this motion detection
EDL	00:10:09,791	00:10:11,071	| IOT201 |	They're not whatever cost
EDL	00:10:11,071	00:10:14,143	| IOT201 |	Smart they just replace one type of switch with another
EDL	00:10:14,143	00:10:15,423	| IOT201 |	Logitech motion switch goes on
EDL	00:10:15,935	00:10:16,959	| IOT201 |	These have I can
EDL	00:10:16,959	00:10:23,103	| IOT201 |	For sensors in them so it detects motion but also sound proximity and the ambient light
EDL	00:10:23,103	00:10:25,151	| IOT201 |	To understand when somebody's in the room
EDL	00:10:25,151	00:10:27,967	| IOT201 |	So aside from the Smart Learning aspect of it
EDL	00:10:27,967	00:10:31,807	| IOT201 |	I think these would be better more effective than just a traditional motion sensor switch
EDL	00:10:32,831	00:10:33,343	| IOT201 |	Now
EDL	00:10:34,111	00:10:34,879	| IOT201 |	These are persons
EDL	00:10:34,879	00:10:37,439	| IOT201 |	I was going to say All Those sensors in this market, the price
EDL	00:10:38,207	00:10:39,487	| IOT201 |	They're 199
EDL	00:10:39,487	00:10:39,999	| IOT201 |	Persuade
EDL	00:10:40,511	00:10:43,071	| IOT201 |	And that is a single game
EDL	00:10:44,351	00:10:45,375	| IOT201 |	Ouch
EDL	00:10:45,375	00:10:46,399	| IOT201 |	It's expensive
EDL	00:10:46,399	00:10:51,519	| IOT201 |	So this is probably actually it's not that much more expensive than outfit in your house with something
EDL	00:10:51,519	00:10:52,031	| IOT201 |	Like the noon switch
EDL	00:10:52,799	00:10:54,335	| IOT201 |	And those if you guys were
EDL	00:10:54,335	00:10:55,615	| IOT201 |	Recall our switches that
EDL	00:10:55,615	00:10:56,895	| IOT201 |	Have pre-programmed lighting recipe
EDL	00:10:57,407	00:10:58,175	| IOT201 |	Already in them
EDL	00:10:58,687	00:10:59,455	| IOT201 |	Basically
EDL	00:10:59,967	00:11:01,503	| IOT201 |	Figure out what lights you have in you
EDL	00:11:01,503	00:11:02,271	| IOT201 |	Your house
EDL	00:11:02,271	00:11:03,039	| IOT201 |	And then cry
EDL	00:11:03,039	00:11:03,551	| IOT201 |	Create the recipe
EDL	00:11:04,063	00:11:04,831	| IOT201 |	Is based on that
EDL	00:11:05,343	00:11:05,855	| IOT201 |	Automatically
EDL	00:11:06,367	00:11:08,415	| IOT201 |	So again what we're seeing is more automation
EDL	00:11:08,927	00:11:09,951	| IOT201 |	More AI
EDL	00:11:10,463	00:11:11,487	| IOT201 |	That's what I'm
EDL	00:11:11,487	00:11:12,511	| IOT201 |	Curious about is it
EDL	00:11:12,511	00:11:13,279	| IOT201 |	When do you live with
EDL	00:11:14,303	00:11:15,071	| IOT201 |	How
EDL	00:11:15,071	00:11:16,095	| IOT201 |	The AI meets up
EDL	00:11:17,375	00:11:18,399	| IOT201 |	Because that's always the
EDL	00:11:18,399	00:11:19,167	| IOT201 |	The question will be
EDL	00:11:19,167	00:11:19,679	| IOT201 |	Start automating
EDL	00:11:20,959	00:11:22,239	| IOT201 |	Right it's one thing to say it
EDL	00:11:22,239	00:11:24,031	| IOT201 |	Can learn but how well does it learn
EDL	00:11:25,823	00:11:27,359	| IOT201 |	Because remember when everyone
EDL	00:11:27,359	00:11:28,383	| IOT201 |	You don't remember when this
EDL	00:11:28,383	00:11:28,895	| IOT201 |	Just came out never
EDL	00:11:31,711	00:11:33,759	| IOT201 |	And people still have issues
EDL	00:11:34,271	00:11:35,807	| IOT201 |	I mean mine have mostly
EDL	00:11:35,807	00:11:38,367	| IOT201 |	Subsided but part of that was just a learning curve
EDL	00:11:38,367	00:11:39,391	| IOT201 |	+
EDL	00:11:39,391	00:11:41,439	| IOT201 |	Yeah we'll see how that works with something is integral
EDL	00:11:42,463	00:11:43,999	| IOT201 |	That's something you notice right away when I
EDL	00:11:45,279	00:11:46,047	| IOT201 |	Yep
EDL	00:11:46,047	00:11:48,095	| IOT201 |	Okay in the creepy factor for the
EDL	00:11:50,399	00:11:52,703	| IOT201 |	We have Panasonic launching a
EDL	00:11:53,215	00:11:54,751	| IOT201 |	The home security camera that's
EDL	00:11:54,751	00:11:55,775	| IOT201 |	Part of a
EDL	00:11:55,775	00:11:56,287	| IOT201 |	Floor lamp
EDL	00:11:57,055	00:11:57,567	| IOT201 |	Be home Hawk
EDL	00:11:58,079	00:11:58,847	| IOT201 |	Floor lamp
EDL	00:11:58,847	00:12:01,407	| IOT201 |	This isn't Kickstarter so this is
EDL	00:12:01,407	00:12:04,223	| IOT201 |	You know maybe if no one will find it but basically this is a
EDL	00:12:04,223	00:12:05,503	| IOT201 |	The lamp with a hidden
EDL	00:12:06,015	00:12:06,527	| IOT201 |	High definition
EDL	00:12:07,039	00:12:08,319	| IOT201 |	Security camera built-in
EDL	00:12:08,319	00:12:09,087	| IOT201 |	And
EDL	00:12:09,087	00:12:11,647	| IOT201 |	I don't love cameras in the home you guys already know this but
EDL	00:12:12,159	00:12:13,951	| IOT201 |	I think the Verge put a story out about this
EDL	00:12:13,951	00:12:15,999	| IOT201 |	This is an Airbnb nightmare
EDL	00:12:15,999	00:12:18,303	| IOT201 |	As someone who stayed in airbnb's in
EDL	00:12:18,303	00:12:19,839	| IOT201 |	And found cameras I'm like
EDL	00:12:19,839	00:12:20,351	| IOT201 |	Yeah
EDL	00:12:20,863	00:12:21,631	| IOT201 |	Now I'm going to
EDL	00:12:21,631	00:12:23,423	| IOT201 |	I have to have like CIA level bugged
EDL	00:12:23,423	00:12:24,191	| IOT201 |	Detection happen
EDL	00:12:24,191	00:12:26,751	| IOT201 |	Anyone I've dealt with today and I Airbnb you
EDL	00:12:26,751	00:12:30,847	| IOT201 |	Yeah but I mean it is integrated the cameras integrated into the lamp
EDL	00:12:30,847	00:12:31,615	| IOT201 |	It's not
EDL	00:12:31,615	00:12:33,407	| IOT201 |	Truly camouflage lyrics
EDL	00:12:33,407	00:12:35,967	| IOT201 |	Take a look at it you can see the camera sensor
EDL	00:12:35,967	00:12:36,735	| IOT201 |	Toronto
EDL	00:12:36,735	00:12:38,783	| IOT201 |	Major looking for it you'll see it
EDL	00:12:38,783	00:12:42,367	| IOT201 |	If you're not paying attention maybe somebody has it in their house and you're in the house
EDL	00:12:42,367	00:12:45,439	| IOT201 |	You might not notice sediment I wouldn't walk around and check her even Lambs
EDL	00:12:46,463	00:12:48,255	| IOT201 |	Decided to stay in that house but
EDL	00:12:48,255	00:12:49,279	| IOT201 |	It's not like
EDL	00:12:49,279	00:12:49,791	| IOT201 |	Totally
EDL	00:12:51,583	00:12:54,399	| IOT201 |	Yeah but it's not for me that's for sure either
EDL	00:12:54,399	00:12:57,215	| IOT201 |	And I should clarify it is on Indiegogo it is
EDL	00:12:57,215	00:12:57,983	| IOT201 |	Not
EDL	00:12:57,983	00:12:59,007	| IOT201 |	Kickstarter my badge
EDL	00:12:59,775	00:13:00,543	| IOT201 |	Sew in
EDL	00:13:01,823	00:13:03,359	| IOT201 |	I don't like this I don't like
EDL	00:13:03,871	00:13:04,383	| IOT201 |	You know
EDL	00:13:05,663	00:13:06,431	| IOT201 |	Yeah
EDL	00:13:06,431	00:13:11,295	| IOT201 |	One nice thing I will say it obviously plugged into a wall with making a traditional lamp and you don't
EDL	00:13:11,807	00:13:17,951	| IOT201 |	Need a smart bulb in there any like that but if the power goes out this can all run up there up to 90 minutes on 8 double a batteries
EDL	00:13:18,463	00:13:21,535	| IOT201 |	Sienna backup power source for your camouflage camera
EDL	00:13:24,863	00:13:25,887	| IOT201 |	You're never going to make me like this
EDL	00:13:26,399	00:13:30,239	| IOT201 |	Okay go to making a speaker you can talk to somebody from far away right from the lamp
EDL	00:13:30,751	00:13:31,519	| IOT201 |	Stop reading
EDL	00:13:32,287	00:13:33,311	| IOT201 |	Get your feet off my couch
EDL	00:13:35,871	00:13:38,943	| IOT201 |	I could see why homeowners want to do this but I'm also kind of like
EDL	00:13:39,455	00:13:42,527	| IOT201 |	Is the trade-off for the sharing economy is
EDL	00:13:43,039	00:13:43,807	| IOT201 |	Surveillance
EDL	00:13:43,807	00:13:44,575	| IOT201 |	Constantly
EDL	00:13:44,575	00:13:45,343	| IOT201 |	That's not
EDL	00:13:45,343	00:13:46,111	| IOT201 |	What were signed up for
EDL	00:13:46,111	00:13:48,671	| IOT201 |	Are there other countries to move to if you want that
EDL	00:13:49,695	00:13:51,743	| IOT201 |	Anyway alright so let's talk about
EDL	00:13:52,511	00:13:53,279	| IOT201 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:13:53,279	00:13:55,071	| IOT201 |	Google in Amazon
EDL	00:13:55,071	00:13:56,351	| IOT201 |	Getting into
EDL	00:13:56,351	00:13:57,375	| IOT201 |	Electricity
EDL	00:13:57,375	00:13:59,935	| IOT201 |	4 Google this will actually be the second time around
EDL	00:13:59,935	00:14:03,007	| IOT201 |	They actually had a Smart Energy program so it Microsoft
EDL	00:14:03,007	00:14:03,775	| IOT201 |	Way back into
EDL	00:14:03,775	00:14:04,543	| IOT201 |	Mm
EDL	00:14:04,543	00:14:05,567	| IOT201 |	11 in mm
EDL	00:14:05,567	00:14:06,335	| IOT201 |	12
EDL	00:14:06,335	00:14:08,639	| IOT201 |	But this is a story from the Wall Street Journal.
EDL	00:14:08,639	00:14:09,407	| IOT201 |	Talking about
EDL	00:14:09,407	00:14:12,223	| IOT201 |	How the big players are looking at home automation
EDL	00:14:12,223	00:14:13,247	| IOT201 |	And all the data that's being
EDL	00:14:14,015	00:14:15,039	| IOT201 |	Sterilizing
EDL	00:14:15,039	00:14:16,063	| IOT201 |	Hey
EDL	00:14:16,575	00:14:17,343	| IOT201 |	We could be better energy
EDL	00:14:18,367	00:14:19,135	| IOT201 |	Better utilities
EDL	00:14:19,647	00:14:23,231	| IOT201 |	It's Marta me where was wonder what are companies doing with all of this
EDL	00:14:23,231	00:14:24,255	| IOT201 |	Smart home data
EDL	00:14:24,255	00:14:30,143	| IOT201 |	It's probably not good what song is this
EDL	00:14:30,143	00:14:34,239	| IOT201 |	During a solar eclipse in 2017 obviously every red solar panel
EDL	00:14:34,239	00:14:36,543	| IOT201 |	Wasn't generating any electricity which
EDL	00:14:36,543	00:14:38,847	| IOT201 |	Could affect the grid as well because
EDL	00:14:38,847	00:14:39,871	| IOT201 |	A lot of solar panels
EDL	00:14:39,871	00:14:41,663	| IOT201 |	Search to bring tide today
EDL	00:14:41,663	00:14:45,503	| IOT201 |	Feed energy in Lynnhaven overabundance of it and
EDL	00:14:45,503	00:14:49,599	| IOT201 |	Google apparently encouraged Nest owners to opt into a program that
EDL	00:14:49,599	00:14:50,879	| IOT201 |	Cool off devices
EDL	00:14:50,879	00:14:52,927	| IOT201 |	Second step in the summer time during the eclipse
EDL	00:14:52,927	00:14:55,231	| IOT201 |	Cluster homes around there before the power supply
EDL	00:14:55,231	00:14:56,767	| IOT201 |	Spell because we eclipse
EDL	00:14:56,767	00:14:58,559	| IOT201 |	And then during the eclipse
EDL	00:14:58,559	00:15:04,959	| IOT201 |	Set the thermostat to turn the temp up a few degrees so that the air conditioning is not running and apparently they had three
EDL	00:15:04,959	00:15:10,335	| IOT201 |	The million customers participating and they reduce the energy consumption by 700 megawatts which is
EDL	00:15:10,335	00:15:12,127	| IOT201 |	No small bit of power
EDL	00:15:12,127	00:15:13,407	| IOT201 |	Oh yeah and this makes sense
EDL	00:15:13,919	00:15:17,759	| IOT201 |	A demand response has been around for a while utilities have participated in base
EDL	00:15:18,271	00:15:19,295	| IOT201 |	Controlling people
EDL	00:15:19,295	00:15:20,063	| IOT201 |	You sign up
EDL	00:15:20,063	00:15:20,831	| IOT201 |	You control someone
EDL	00:15:20,831	00:15:21,599	| IOT201 |	Nest thermostat in UK
EDL	00:15:22,111	00:15:23,135	| IOT201 |	Saola
EDL	00:15:23,135	00:15:24,671	| IOT201 |	We got a lot of Demand right now let's
EDL	00:15:24,671	00:15:26,719	| IOT201 |	Turn everybody's thermostats up by a little
EDL	00:15:27,231	00:15:27,999	| IOT201 |	People can opt out
EDL	00:15:29,023	00:15:29,791	| IOT201 |	But
EDL	00:15:29,791	00:15:31,583	| IOT201 |	When you start having more
EDL	00:15:31,583	00:15:32,863	| IOT201 |	Connected devices
EDL	00:15:32,863	00:15:34,655	| IOT201 |	You can actually start making an impact
EDL	00:15:35,423	00:15:36,447	| IOT201 |	Weider squat
EDL	00:15:36,447	00:15:42,335	| IOT201 |	In there still going any the biggest energy consumption devices in the home are hbac so HVAC
EDL	00:15:42,847	00:15:43,871	| IOT201 |	Air conditioning inside
EDL	00:15:43,871	00:15:44,895	| IOT201 |	And water heater
EDL	00:15:45,663	00:15:46,943	| IOT201 |	And they're already
EDL	00:15:46,943	00:15:49,247	| IOT201 |	Utilities that are looking at Connected water heat
EDL	00:15:50,271	00:15:51,039	| IOT201 |	Insane
EDL	00:15:51,039	00:15:51,551	| IOT201 |	Hey
EDL	00:15:52,063	00:15:53,343	| IOT201 |	Maybe we can control that
EDL	00:15:53,343	00:15:54,879	| IOT201 |	After that we get into
EDL	00:15:55,391	00:15:56,415	| IOT201 |	Washers and dryers are
EDL	00:15:57,439	00:15:57,951	| IOT201 |	Ovens
EDL	00:15:58,463	00:15:59,999	| IOT201 |	Whirlpool I know his talked
EDL	00:15:59,999	00:16:01,279	| IOT201 |	Do utilities about this
EDL	00:16:01,279	00:16:01,791	| IOT201 |	But
EDL	00:16:02,303	00:16:03,583	| IOT201 |	It would be much easier
EDL	00:16:04,095	00:16:04,607	| IOT201 |	4
EDL	00:16:05,119	00:16:06,143	| IOT201 |	1 monolithic
EDL	00:16:06,143	00:16:06,911	| IOT201 |	Company who has X
EDL	00:16:07,679	00:16:08,447	| IOT201 |	Statistician
EDL	00:16:08,447	00:16:09,983	| IOT201 |	Do these types of things
EDL	00:16:10,495	00:16:13,055	| IOT201 |	As opposed to it like a Whirlpool making deals with
EDL	00:16:14,335	00:16:16,127	| IOT201 |	Utility providers there are across the US
EDL	00:16:16,127	00:16:16,895	| IOT201 |	But there's more than just
EDL	00:16:17,663	00:16:21,759	| IOT201 |	And there's a consumer benefit true this is almost time for giving up there to get you
EDL	00:16:21,759	00:16:23,039	| IOT201 |	Something back in return
EDL	00:16:23,039	00:16:23,807	| IOT201 |	A lot of
EDL	00:16:23,807	00:16:24,831	| IOT201 |	Regions have
EDL	00:16:24,831	00:16:26,367	| IOT201 |	Variable energy rates
EDL	00:16:26,367	00:16:27,391	| IOT201 |	Panthers
EDL	00:16:27,391	00:16:33,023	| IOT201 |	No I'm very high demand rates can Skyrocket so if you pre-cooled your hombres happel
EDL	00:16:33,023	00:16:35,071	| IOT201 |	You might be able to do so at the lower rate
EDL	00:16:35,071	00:16:40,191	| IOT201 |	And just kind of weather the storm where demand is high and therefore prices Ric mashup Payless
EDL	00:16:40,191	00:16:42,495	| IOT201 |	And still feel relatively the same Comfort level
EDL	00:16:43,263	00:16:43,775	| IOT201 |	That is the
EDL	00:16:44,543	00:16:47,103	| IOT201 |	Doesn't always happen as someone who has dealt with
EDL	00:16:47,103	00:16:49,151	| IOT201 |	Demand response but that is the goal
EDL	00:16:49,151	00:16:49,663	| IOT201 |	Okay
EDL	00:16:50,175	00:16:52,735	| IOT201 |	Speaking of energy use on a
EDL	00:16:52,735	00:16:53,759	| IOT201 |	Smaller-scale
EDL	00:16:53,759	00:16:55,807	| IOT201 |	A team of researchers out of MIT
EDL	00:16:56,319	00:16:58,111	| IOT201 |	Has developed a material that
EDL	00:16:58,111	00:16:59,135	| IOT201 |	Could lead to a break
EDL	00:16:59,135	00:17:00,671	| IOT201 |	Through in energy harvesting
EDL	00:17:00,671	00:17:01,183	| IOT201 |	And that is
EDL	00:17:01,695	00:17:04,511	| IOT201 |	Grabbing small bits of energy to power sensors or
EDL	00:17:04,511	00:17:05,279	| IOT201 |	Tiny
EDL	00:17:05,279	00:17:06,303	| IOT201 |	Battery powered device
EDL	00:17:06,303	00:17:07,071	| IOT201 |	Isis today
EDL	00:17:07,071	00:17:08,863	| IOT201 |	This is really important you guys
EDL	00:17:08,863	00:17:10,143	| IOT201 |	Why is the Internet of Things
EDL	00:17:10,143	00:17:11,167	| IOT201 |	We cannot be changed
EDL	00:17:11,167	00:17:12,959	| IOT201 |	Can batteries if we're going to have 50 billion
EDL	00:17:13,983	00:17:15,519	| IOT201 |	We have to have things that
EDL	00:17:16,031	00:17:17,055	| IOT201 |	Have energy harvesting
EDL	00:17:18,335	00:17:19,103	| IOT201 |	So
EDL	00:17:19,103	00:17:20,639	| IOT201 |	This particular research
EDL	00:17:20,639	00:17:23,711	| IOT201 |	Has basically created a two-dimensional material that
EDL	00:17:23,711	00:17:24,223	| IOT201 |	Striatum
EDL	00:17:25,247	00:17:27,295	| IOT201 |	That can convert radio signals from
EDL	00:17:27,807	00:17:28,831	| IOT201 |	Any sort of radio
EDL	00:17:28,831	00:17:29,855	| IOT201 |	Yosoo WiFi selfie
EDL	00:17:29,855	00:17:30,623	| IOT201 |	Phone or whatever
EDL	00:17:30,623	00:17:31,391	| IOT201 |	Into
EDL	00:17:31,391	00:17:31,903	| IOT201 |	Our
EDL	00:17:32,415	00:17:33,183	| IOT201 |	It's pretty cool cat
EDL	00:17:33,695	00:17:37,023	| IOT201 |	Yeah it's really cool I mean they call or two dimensional material
EDL	00:17:37,023	00:17:37,791	| IOT201 |	Because it's
EDL	00:17:37,791	00:17:44,191	| IOT201 |	Small 3 atoms tickets made of the film made of molybdenum disulfide
EDL	00:17:44,191	00:17:46,751	| IOT201 |	Pronounce that wrong but I can act as an antenna
EDL	00:17:46,751	00:17:51,871	| IOT201 |	But additionally it can Harvest energy from the ready ways that antenna is gathering as well so
EDL	00:17:51,871	00:17:58,015	| IOT201 |	You're not going to generate tons of electricity this way but for small devices small low-power devices may be aware of
EDL	00:17:58,015	00:17:59,551	| IOT201 |	Probably pushing but maybe
EDL	00:17:59,551	00:18:02,367	| IOT201 |	You could essentially maybe have no battery in it
EDL	00:18:02,367	00:18:04,415	| IOT201 |	And these are the effort to get
EDL	00:18:04,415	00:18:05,695	| IOT201 |	Power out of
EDL	00:18:05,695	00:18:06,719	| IOT201 |	RF signal
EDL	00:18:06,719	00:18:07,487	| IOT201 |	Is not new
EDL	00:18:07,999	00:18:09,279	| IOT201 |	This is actually something that's
EDL	00:18:09,279	00:18:12,607	| IOT201 |	Been happening for a long time you could actually even think of things like
EDL	00:18:12,607	00:18:13,631	| IOT201 |	Hey Wireless power is
EDL	00:18:14,143	00:18:14,911	| IOT201 |	Basically that
EDL	00:18:15,423	00:18:16,703	| IOT201 |	These sorts of
EDL	00:18:16,703	00:18:17,983	| IOT201 |	Things are being
EDL	00:18:17,983	00:18:18,751	| IOT201 |	Researched in
EDL	00:18:18,751	00:18:19,263	| IOT201 |	Lots of
EDL	00:18:20,287	00:18:22,847	| IOT201 |	Right now what's interesting is
EDL	00:18:22,847	00:18:24,127	| IOT201 |	Today we only have a
EDL	00:18:24,127	00:18:24,639	| IOT201 |	Couple energy
EDL	00:18:25,407	00:18:26,431	| IOT201 |	Pek energy harvesting
EDL	00:18:26,431	00:18:27,199	| IOT201 |	Technologies
EDL	00:18:27,199	00:18:27,967	| IOT201 |	They are
EDL	00:18:27,967	00:18:29,247	| IOT201 |	Pythiosis movement-based
EDL	00:18:30,015	00:18:31,039	| IOT201 |	Clicking
EDL	00:18:31,039	00:18:32,319	| IOT201 |	Changing things anything kinetic
EDL	00:18:32,831	00:18:35,391	| IOT201 |	Temperature differences can also generate power
EDL	00:18:35,391	00:18:36,671	| IOT201 |	And then solar
EDL	00:18:36,671	00:18:37,439	| IOT201 |	So like
EDL	00:18:37,439	00:18:39,487	| IOT201 |	Those are all probably more efficient
EDL	00:18:39,487	00:18:44,607	| IOT201 |	At this moment and they're not very efficient especially at small rages I mean solders pretty efficient but
EDL	00:18:45,375	00:18:46,143	| IOT201 |	You got a small device
EDL	00:18:46,655	00:18:48,191	| IOT201 |	You have a small solar panel on top of it
EDL	00:18:48,703	00:18:49,471	| IOT201 |	It will generate as much
EDL	00:18:49,983	00:18:50,751	| IOT201 |	But
EDL	00:18:50,751	00:18:52,287	| IOT201 |	We've got to get better
EDL	00:18:52,287	00:18:53,055	| IOT201 |	We got to do more
EDL	00:18:53,055	00:18:54,335	| IOT201 |	So it's really important to have the
EDL	00:18:55,871	00:18:59,711	| IOT201 |	Right and then she said this has been around for awhile in practice because
EDL	00:18:59,711	00:19:03,039	| IOT201 |	Anybody sees an RFID Card safe to enter a building for example
EDL	00:19:03,039	00:19:04,319	| IOT201 |	That has
EDL	00:19:04,319	00:19:06,367	| IOT201 |	An antenna in it
EDL	00:19:06,367	00:19:08,159	| IOT201 |	It has no power than a battery
EDL	00:19:08,159	00:19:09,695	| IOT201 |	But when it received a signal
EDL	00:19:09,695	00:19:11,999	| IOT201 |	It can get a little bit of juice just enough to
EDL	00:19:11,999	00:19:13,279	| IOT201 |	Basically say hey
EDL	00:19:13,279	00:19:16,863	| IOT201 |	Send a signal back or read the signal and and therefore unlock a door
EDL	00:19:16,863	00:19:17,631	| IOT201 |	For example so
EDL	00:19:17,631	00:19:21,215	| IOT201 |	We have a second ology but we're not using it in ways that we need to fry.
EDL	00:19:22,495	00:19:23,007	| IOT201 |	So
EDL	00:19:23,519	00:19:24,031	| IOT201 |	Let's go friend
EDL	00:19:24,543	00:19:25,311	| IOT201 |	Cool energy Harvest
EDL	00:19:25,823	00:19:26,847	| IOT201 |	Let's keep that up y'all
EDL	00:19:26,847	00:19:27,871	| IOT201 |	All the way to
EDL	00:19:28,383	00:19:28,895	| IOT201 |	Japan
EDL	00:19:29,407	00:19:30,175	| IOT201 |	Kevin
EDL	00:19:30,175	00:19:31,455	| IOT201 |	What are the Japanese do
EDL	00:19:31,967	00:19:33,503	| IOT201 |	What the Japanese
EDL	00:19:33,503	00:19:37,087	| IOT201 |	Government is going to hack into millions
EDL	00:19:37,087	00:19:39,647	| IOT201 |	Japanese citizens connected devices
EDL	00:19:39,647	00:19:40,927	| IOT201 |	But it's not a bad thing
EDL	00:19:40,927	00:19:47,327	| IOT201 |	It's actually being done to improve cyber-security so what they're doing and by that I mean Japan's National Institute of information
EDL	00:19:47,327	00:19:48,607	| IOT201 |	Animation and Communications
EDL	00:19:48,607	00:19:49,375	| IOT201 |	Technology Group
EDL	00:19:49,375	00:19:55,007	| IOT201 |	Is going to basically use default passwords and password dictionaries of basic passwords
EDL	00:19:55,007	00:19:57,567	| IOT201 |	A break until about 200 million devices
EDL	00:19:58,079	00:20:01,407	| IOT201 |	Liquor store with webcams and router so I don't have to actually
EDL	00:20:01,407	00:20:04,479	| IOT201 |	Move beyond that at the phones and other things but regardless
EDL	00:20:04,479	00:20:08,319	| IOT201 |	When they do that if they're successfully gaining access to a device
EDL	00:20:08,319	00:20:14,719	| IOT201 |	They're going to contact the owner of that device to advise them hey you might want to change your password
EDL	00:20:14,719	00:20:18,047	| IOT201 |	The finding out who owns what
EDL	00:20:18,047	00:20:20,607	| IOT201 |	Found them but I think this is a great program
EDL	00:20:20,607	00:20:21,375	| IOT201 |	Because
EDL	00:20:21,375	00:20:27,775	| IOT201 |	Too many people have the weak link is that password or maybe it's the router in the home and so on so this is a thing from
EDL	00:20:27,775	00:20:29,823	| IOT201 |	Good not for evil so this is one hack that I like
EDL	00:20:31,103	00:20:31,871	| IOT201 |	Okay and
EDL	00:20:32,383	00:20:36,223	| IOT201 |	Finally let's talk about Amazon making it easier to build
EDL	00:20:36,223	00:20:37,503	| IOT201 |	Skills for metal
EDL	00:20:38,015	00:20:41,343	| IOT201 |	Yep if your developer and making Amazon
EDL	00:20:41,343	00:20:42,623	| IOT201 |	Echo skills
EDL	00:20:42,623	00:20:49,023	| IOT201 |	You may be doing two things one building a scale but to worrying about all the backend stuff on the server to host
EDL	00:20:49,023	00:20:51,071	| IOT201 |	Stair and do processing and so on and so forth
EDL	00:20:51,071	00:20:53,887	| IOT201 |	Amazon actually has a beta program
EDL	00:20:53,887	00:20:55,935	| IOT201 |	Madame a hosted skills
EDL	00:20:56,447	00:20:59,775	| IOT201 |	And that is now available to all developers that was very limited
EDL	00:20:59,775	00:21:03,871	| IOT201 |	Can a private preview but it's open to everybody now and what this does is instead of
EDL	00:21:03,871	00:21:07,711	| IOT201 |	Worrying about the hosting for your AWS Lambda bits and all
EDL	00:21:07,711	00:21:12,831	| IOT201 |	Amazon washable just hosted for you and they have a free tier with access to AWS Lambda
EDL	00:21:12,831	00:21:16,159	| IOT201 |	5 gigs of storage and 15 gig of monthly data transfer
EDL	00:21:16,672	00:21:17,952	| IOT201 |	So you don't have to worry about
EDL	00:21:17,952	00:21:22,560	| IOT201 |	Setting up a server or setting up some instant somewhere else on the cloud that's not Amazon
EDL	00:21:23,072	00:21:26,656	| IOT201 |	Take all that away and that way you can just focus on
EDL	00:21:26,656	00:21:27,168	| IOT201 |	Skillet
EDL	00:21:28,704	00:21:30,240	| IOT201 |	And I have an update from last
EDL	00:21:30,752	00:21:32,544	| IOT201 |	So last week we talked about smart
EDL	00:21:32,544	00:21:33,056	| IOT201 |	Apartments
EDL	00:21:33,568	00:21:34,336	| IOT201 |	I assume you guys
EDL	00:21:34,848	00:21:36,384	| IOT201 |	We talked about a
EDL	00:21:36,384	00:21:37,920	| IOT201 |	Particular woman who was
EDL	00:21:39,456	00:21:42,272	| IOT201 |	She as a security researcher was not come
EDL	00:21:42,272	00:21:43,296	| IOT201 |	Pitbull with her partner
EDL	00:21:43,296	00:21:44,064	| IOT201 |	Ain't going
EDL	00:21:44,064	00:21:46,880	| IOT201 |	With automated door locks mostly but just an overall automate
EDL	00:21:47,648	00:21:49,184	| IOT201 |	We talked about why we thought
EDL	00:21:49,184	00:21:52,000	| IOT201 |	Hey this may not be the best implementation of this
EDL	00:21:52,000	00:21:53,280	| IOT201 |	Cuz she wasn't given a choice
EDL	00:21:53,280	00:21:54,560	| IOT201 |	Lesley Carhart
EDL	00:21:54,560	00:21:55,840	| IOT201 |	Who is the White House
EDL	00:21:55,840	00:21:56,608	| IOT201 |	Packer who did this
EDL	00:21:57,120	00:21:57,888	| IOT201 |	She actually wrote
EDL	00:21:58,656	00:21:59,936	| IOT201 |	Blog post about it
EDL	00:21:59,936	00:22:02,240	| IOT201 |	Talk about security things to consider when you're
EDL	00:22:02,240	00:22:02,752	| IOT201 |	Apartment goes
EDL	00:22:03,264	00:22:04,544	| IOT201 |	Smart and
EDL	00:22:04,544	00:22:05,056	| IOT201 |	She talks
EDL	00:22:05,568	00:22:06,336	| IOT201 |	Bit about
EDL	00:22:06,848	00:22:07,616	| IOT201 |	The situation
EDL	00:22:07,616	00:22:10,176	| IOT201 |	But she also brings up some really good points
EDL	00:22:10,176	00:22:10,688	| IOT201 |	I think or were
EDL	00:22:11,200	00:22:11,712	| IOT201 |	Sharing with
EDL	00:22:12,480	00:22:15,552	| IOT201 |	So she talks about when assessing the sort of thing
EDL	00:22:16,064	00:22:17,088	| IOT201 |	What is your threat mod
EDL	00:22:17,600	00:22:18,880	| IOT201 |	And for her
EDL	00:22:18,880	00:22:19,648	| IOT201 |	It's pretty high be
EDL	00:22:19,648	00:22:20,928	| IOT201 |	Because she is a professional hair
EDL	00:22:20,928	00:22:22,464	| IOT201 |	Packer of nation states and other
EDL	00:22:22,464	00:22:23,232	| IOT201 |	People end
EDL	00:22:23,232	00:22:24,512	| IOT201 |	If those kind of people
EDL	00:22:25,536	00:22:26,816	| IOT201 |	They might often becomes hard
EDL	00:22:27,328	00:22:29,376	| IOT201 |	So bad for her it's a big deal
EDL	00:22:29,888	00:22:30,912	| IOT201 |	For maybe
EDL	00:22:31,424	00:22:32,704	| IOT201 |	Kevin or I am I
EDL	00:22:32,704	00:22:35,008	| IOT201 |	Not be a big deal especially because we live in a single-family home
EDL	00:22:35,520	00:22:39,616	| IOT201 |	If someone were going to go to the trouble to want to break into our house we are door locks
EDL	00:22:39,616	00:22:41,152	| IOT201 |	It'd probably be better off just using
EDL	00:22:41,152	00:22:41,920	| IOT201 |	A screwdriver
EDL	00:22:41,920	00:22:42,432	| IOT201 |	Crowbar
EDL	00:22:43,968	00:22:45,504	| IOT201 |	Now in an apartment building
EDL	00:22:45,504	00:22:46,528	| IOT201 |	Because there's
EDL	00:22:46,528	00:22:48,832	| IOT201 |	The potential for someone to be able to open
EDL	00:22:48,832	00:22:49,600	| IOT201 |	A bunch of doors
EDL	00:22:49,600	00:22:51,392	| IOT201 |	Once that does change the threat
EDL	00:22:51,392	00:22:52,160	| IOT201 |	Model there even if your
EDL	00:22:52,928	00:22:54,720	| IOT201 |	So that was one point I thought
EDL	00:22:55,488	00:22:58,816	| IOT201 |	And then she also did a really deep dive I'm linked to this
EDL	00:22:58,816	00:22:59,584	| IOT201 |	Listen to
EDL	00:22:59,584	00:23:00,608	| IOT201 |	How you define
EDL	00:23:00,608	00:23:02,144	| IOT201 |	Smart Lock and how
EDL	00:23:02,144	00:23:03,168	| IOT201 |	Basically
EDL	00:23:03,168	00:23:05,216	| IOT201 |	Key box or taking care of Howell
EDL	00:23:05,216	00:23:06,496	| IOT201 |	PIN codes work
EDL	00:23:07,008	00:23:07,776	| IOT201 |	Etcetera
EDL	00:23:07,776	00:23:09,824	| IOT201 |	And it's actually a really good look
EDL	00:23:09,824	00:23:11,360	| IOT201 |	About how the locks work
EDL	00:23:11,360	00:23:14,176	| IOT201 |	Indifferent exploitation methods that have been used to break them in the
EDL	00:23:14,944	00:23:16,992	| IOT201 |	So did she say she's moving
EDL	00:23:16,992	00:23:18,016	| IOT201 |	She did not say that she
EDL	00:23:18,784	00:23:22,112	| IOT201 |	Okay and then she went into the issues associated with the Hub
EDL	00:23:22,112	00:23:23,648	| IOT201 |	We talked actually about
EDL	00:23:23,648	00:23:24,160	| IOT201 |	A lot of fees
EDL	00:23:24,928	00:23:27,232	| IOT201 |	To her credit she actually talks
EDL	00:23:27,232	00:23:28,768	| IOT201 |	About why a landlord might
EDL	00:23:28,768	00:23:29,280	| IOT201 |	Want some
EDL	00:23:29,792	00:23:31,840	| IOT201 |	And I do think that there are benefits
EDL	00:23:31,840	00:23:32,608	| IOT201 |	To Orlando
EDL	00:23:32,608	00:23:33,632	| IOT201 |	Lord and if done correctly
EDL	00:23:34,144	00:23:34,912	| IOT201 |	Everybody wins
EDL	00:23:34,912	00:23:36,960	| IOT201 |	That's the thing I don't think any
EDL	00:23:36,960	00:23:40,032	| IOT201 |	Either you me or her have an issue
EDL	00:23:40,032	00:23:44,384	| IOT201 |	With smart of finding an apartment it's the implementation that's being done in this
EDL	00:23:44,384	00:23:44,896	| IOT201 |	Particular case
EDL	00:23:45,920	00:23:46,688	| IOT201 |	So
EDL	00:23:46,688	00:23:49,248	| IOT201 |	I love this story I love the death and what she goes
EDL	00:23:49,248	00:23:50,784	| IOT201 |	You should probably check it out
EDL	00:23:50,784	00:23:52,064	| IOT201 |	And maybe a sass
EDL	00:23:52,576	00:23:54,368	| IOT201 |	How you feel about your old smartphone
EDL	00:23:54,368	00:23:55,392	| IOT201 |	Insecurities in the way
EDL	00:23:56,160	00:23:57,184	| IOT201 |	All right
EDL	00:23:57,696	00:23:58,464	| IOT201 |	Let's
EDL	00:23:58,464	00:23:58,976	| IOT201 |	I know that's
EDL	00:24:00,000	00:24:00,768	| IOT201 |	For someone like me
EDL	00:24:00,768	00:24:03,328	| IOT201 |	All kinds of craziness in my house
EDL	00:24:03,328	00:24:04,864	| IOT201 |	But I actually do
EDL	00:24:04,864	00:24:07,168	| IOT201 |	Consider every device I bring in and I talked
EDL	00:24:07,168	00:24:07,936	| IOT201 |	People about the security
EDL	00:24:09,472	00:24:10,496	| IOT201 |	So not this
EDL	00:24:10,496	00:24:11,776	| IOT201 |	Crazy pell-mell
EDL	00:24:11,776	00:24:13,312	| IOT201 |	Adoption of technology that makes sound
EDL	00:24:14,336	00:24:14,848	| IOT201 |	The shower
EDL	00:24:18,176	00:24:18,944	| IOT201 |	Okay
EDL	00:24:18,944	00:24:20,480	| IOT201 |	Now it is time
EDL	00:24:20,480	00:24:23,296	| IOT201 |	For our iot podcast hotline
EDL	00:24:23,808	00:24:24,320	| IOT201 |	Voicemail
EDL	00:24:24,832	00:24:27,136	| IOT201 |	So this week we have a new sponsor
EDL	00:24:27,136	00:24:28,160	| IOT201 |	For the hotline
EDL	00:24:28,160	00:24:28,928	| IOT201 |	Except
EDL	00:24:28,928	00:24:32,000	| IOT201 |	It's an existing sponsor that you guys are probably really familiar with
EDL	00:24:32,512	00:24:35,328	| IOT201 |	A pharaoh has taken over this month sponsorship of
EDL	00:24:35,328	00:24:36,608	| IOT201 |	The iot podcast
EDL	00:24:37,376	00:24:41,216	| IOT201 |	Ferromex platform that helps companies get their devices on the internet

EDL	00:24:43,264	00:24:44,544	| IOT201 |	Have both used a pharaoh
EDL	00:24:44,544	00:24:48,640	| IOT201 |	And as part of that they have experienced as much as an 80% reduction in time to Market
EDL	00:24:49,152	00:24:50,432	| IOT201 |	99%
EDL	00:24:50,432	00:24:51,200	| IOT201 |	Your support calls

EDL	00:25:07,584	00:25:08,608	| IOT201 |	Okay
EDL	00:25:08,608	00:25:09,888	| IOT201 |	This week's color is
EDL	00:25:10,400	00:25:12,448	| IOT201 |	Monte who wants to find
EDL	00:25:12,448	00:25:13,216	| IOT201 |	Appropriate
EDL	00:25:13,216	00:25:13,984	| IOT201 |	Z-Wave hub
EDL	00:25:14,496	00:25:15,264	| IOT201 |	Let's hear from him
EDL	00:25:16,544	00:25:18,080	| IOT201 |	Kevin and Noah
EDL	00:25:18,080	00:25:18,848	| IOT201 |	If you're listening
EDL	00:25:18,848	00:25:19,616	| IOT201 |	This is Monty
EDL	00:25:20,128	00:25:20,896	| IOT201 |	Salt Lake
EDL	00:25:20,896	00:25:22,432	| IOT201 |	Just starting to do some smart
EDL	00:25:24,224	00:25:25,760	| IOT201 |	Trying to find a Best
EDL	00:25:25,760	00:25:27,296	| IOT201 |	Z-Wave
EDL	00:25:27,296	00:25:28,320	| IOT201 |	What's a github
EDL	00:25:29,600	00:25:30,112	| IOT201 |	Thank you
EDL	00:25:30,624	00:25:31,648	| IOT201 |	Okay mighty
EDL	00:25:32,160	00:25:34,464	| IOT201 |	I'm actually going to steer you away from a hub
EDL	00:25:34,464	00:25:35,744	| IOT201 |	If you are just beginning
EDL	00:25:35,744	00:25:37,280	| IOT201 |	I don't know if I would recommend
EDL	00:25:37,280	00:25:38,048	| IOT201 |	Bringing
EDL	00:25:38,048	00:25:39,072	| IOT201 |	Z-Wave into your house
EDL	00:25:39,584	00:25:43,680	| IOT201 |	And I think there are plenty of other options even in the sensor depart
EDL	00:25:43,680	00:25:44,704	| IOT201 |	I thought you could get away with
EDL	00:25:45,216	00:25:46,496	| IOT201 |	Just using Bluetooth
EDL	00:25:46,496	00:25:47,264	| IOT201 |	And Wi-Fi
EDL	00:25:47,776	00:25:50,080	| IOT201 |	And probably something like a Google home or a madam
EDL	00:25:51,360	00:25:52,128	| IOT201 |	Hate that idea
EDL	00:25:52,896	00:25:54,432	| IOT201 |	Kevin has some excellent Z-Wave Wrecking
EDL	00:25:55,712	00:26:00,832	| IOT201 |	Yep since Monty says he's kind of just getting started out I would say was keep it simple
EDL	00:26:00,832	00:26:03,648	| IOT201 |	And go with either a Samsung SmartThings Hub
EDL	00:26:03,648	00:26:06,208	| IOT201 |	Or a wink Hub because both of those would have
EDL	00:26:06,208	00:26:07,232	| IOT201 |	Bluetooth Wi-Fi
EDL	00:26:07,232	00:26:08,256	| IOT201 |	NZ wave
EDL	00:26:08,256	00:26:11,328	| IOT201 |	Do not too expensive the relatively easy to set up
EDL	00:26:11,328	00:26:13,888	| IOT201 |	If you want to get into a little more
EDL	00:26:13,888	00:26:15,168	| IOT201 |	Technical
EDL	00:26:15,168	00:26:16,192	| IOT201 |	Solution
EDL	00:26:16,192	00:26:16,960	| IOT201 |	Habitat woodwork
EDL	00:26:17,472	00:26:23,616	| IOT201 |	For you but again it's not for somebody just starting out and actually in the process of finishing up my review of The Hobbit
EDL	00:26:24,128	00:26:25,920	| IOT201 |	And even if somebody is
EDL	00:26:25,920	00:26:27,456	| IOT201 |	It's been playing with these things
EDL	00:26:27,456	00:26:29,248	| IOT201 |	For the better part of eight years
EDL	00:26:29,248	00:26:30,528	| IOT201 |	It's a bit of a
EDL	00:26:30,528	00:26:32,832	| IOT201 |	Learning curve on setting up and automating things
EDL	00:26:32,832	00:26:34,880	| IOT201 |	I should have come up with two other options
EDL	00:26:34,880	00:26:37,440	| IOT201 |	Tremonte if my teacher looking for
EDL	00:26:37,440	00:26:40,256	| IOT201 |	A Z-Wave Hub and you're also in the market
EDL	00:26:40,256	00:26:41,280	| IOT201 |	To add
EDL	00:26:41,280	00:26:43,072	| IOT201 |	Some smarts to a television set
EDL	00:26:43,072	00:26:45,632	| IOT201 |	You might want to think about the Nvidia
EDL	00:26:45,632	00:26:51,776	| IOT201 |	Shield TV box which is an Android TV box so you can stream all kinds of online things services
EDL	00:26:51,776	00:26:56,896	| IOT201 |	Pretty much anything and everything other than iTunes right now and what you can do is they sell a
EDL	00:26:56,896	00:26:57,920	| IOT201 |	SmartThings
EDL	00:26:57,920	00:27:02,016	| IOT201 |	USB dongle which turns it into a SmartThings Hub as well
EDL	00:27:02,016	00:27:08,416	| IOT201 |	It's two-for-one you're going to pay more obviously you're looking at probably about $170 for the Nvidia Shield TV
EDL	00:27:08,416	00:27:14,816	| IOT201 |	And then another 30 or 40 for the jungle but I just want to put that out there so last week if all you want is a Z-Wave
EDL	00:27:14,816	00:27:17,632	| IOT201 |	Play pop and I don't think that's what you want but just in case
EDL	00:27:17,632	00:27:23,776	| IOT201 |	Sbarro actually they make the Home Center to it doesn't have Wi-Fi it doesn't have Bluetooth but it does have Z-Wave so
EDL	00:27:23,776	00:27:25,568	| IOT201 |	It's a nice use case
EDL	00:27:25,568	00:27:26,848	| IOT201 |	It doesn't give you
EDL	00:27:26,848	00:27:32,480	| IOT201 |	Probably what you want in the future but it's something that considers well ideally that's just me
EDL	00:27:32,992	00:27:35,040	| IOT201 |	Relatively the easiest one to use
EDL	00:27:35,040	00:27:36,320	| IOT201 |	Has been Rock Solid for me
EDL	00:27:36,832	00:27:38,112	| IOT201 |	I will endorse
EDL	00:27:38,624	00:27:39,136	| IOT201 |	Wink
EDL	00:27:39,648	00:27:42,208	| IOT201 |	And SmartThings as a distant second
EDL	00:27:42,208	00:27:42,976	| IOT201 |	If you are
EDL	00:27:42,976	00:27:43,744	| IOT201 |	Willing to get into
EDL	00:27:44,256	00:27:45,024	| IOT201 |	Some kind of flake
EDL	00:27:45,024	00:27:46,560	| IOT201 |	You're really into DIYs
EDL	00:27:46,560	00:27:47,072	| IOT201 |	My things is the way
EDL	00:27:47,584	00:27:51,936	| IOT201 |	Again I would encourage you to look for Bluetooth and Wi-Fi so
EDL	00:27:51,936	00:27:56,288	| IOT201 |	Solutions you actually don't have to go Z-Wave anymore there are even Bluetooth
EDL	00:27:56,288	00:27:57,824	| IOT201 |	WiFi locks out there
EDL	00:27:57,824	00:27:59,616	| IOT201 |	There are plenty of light switches
EDL	00:28:00,640	00:28:03,968	| IOT201 |	Yeah it depends money on what you're trying to make smart
EDL	00:28:04,480	00:28:08,320	| IOT201 |	Take a look and see what options that device or devices have
EDL	00:28:08,320	00:28:14,208	| IOT201 |	If they're just Z-Wave okay you need your Z-Wave Hub but if there are options for Bluetooth or Wi-Fi for the same product
EDL	00:28:14,208	00:28:17,536	| IOT201 |	I consider those we talked about this quite a bit in the last few months
EDL	00:28:17,536	00:28:20,096	| IOT201 |	It seems like the industry is just simplifying and going with
EDL	00:28:20,608	00:28:22,912	| IOT201 |	Consolidated WiFi and Bluetooth
EDL	00:28:22,912	00:28:24,448	| IOT201 |	Solution in the smartphone these days
EDL	00:28:25,216	00:28:27,264	| IOT201 |	And if you decide that
EDL	00:28:27,264	00:28:29,568	| IOT201 |	I don't need Z-Wave but I really want to be
EDL	00:28:29,568	00:28:31,360	| IOT201 |	You could get the Amazon Echo Plus
EDL	00:28:31,872	00:28:32,896	| IOT201 |	Is a slightly easier
EDL	00:28:32,896	00:28:33,664	| IOT201 |	User experience
EDL	00:28:33,664	00:28:35,712	| IOT201 |	But that will work with every single zigbee
EDL	00:28:36,736	00:28:37,504	| IOT201 |	Their self
EDL	00:28:37,504	00:28:40,064	| IOT201 |	Just bare all that in mind
EDL	00:28:42,624	00:28:43,392	| IOT201 |	All right
EDL	00:28:43,392	00:28:44,928	| IOT201 |	If you guys have a question
EDL	00:28:44,928	00:28:45,696	| IOT201 |	And that you would like us
EDL	00:28:45,696	00:28:46,464	| IOT201 |	To answer

EDL	00:29:48,672	00:29:55,072	| IOT201 |	Hey everyone we are taking a quick break from The Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor this week sponsor
EDL	00:29:55,072	00:29:57,120	| IOT201 |	Where is database provider Farrakhan
EDL	00:29:57,120	00:29:59,168	| IOT201 |	And we have Aldo
EDL	00:29:59,168	00:30:03,264	| IOT201 |	Who is here to talk to us about fear comes New sitri Edge
EDL	00:30:03,264	00:30:04,032	| IOT201 |	Database
EDL	00:30:04,032	00:30:06,080	| IOT201 |	Has developed
EDL	00:30:06,848	00:30:09,920	| IOT201 |	What about the cloud what role does it have fridge
EDL	00:30:09,920	00:30:11,456	| IOT201 |	Computing and how can a database
EDL	00:30:11,968	00:30:16,832	| IOT201 |	Are they called is absolutely critical for IRT looking for a complication there's no question about it
EDL	00:30:17,344	00:30:19,392	| IOT201 |	Especially because of the incredible amount of
EDL	00:30:19,392	00:30:20,416	| IOT201 |	Rasta pasta
EDL	00:30:20,416	00:30:22,976	| IOT201 |	See you in a little sister to eat at the club brings to the table
EDL	00:30:22,976	00:30:24,512	| IOT201 |	However some of the limitations
EDL	00:30:25,024	00:30:26,816	| IOT201 |	The cloud has they might be a problem price
EDL	00:30:28,864	00:30:33,216	| IOT201 |	Typical Cloud latency like hundreds of milliseconds are way too high if you're trying to
EDL	00:30:33,216	00:30:36,288	| IOT201 |	Control somehow they destroy multi million dollar equipment
EDL	00:30:36,288	00:30:42,432	| IOT201 |	Imagine that some critical sensors has been triggered and indicate an obstruction that made damage your machine that you have about 10
EDL	00:30:42,432	00:30:43,456	| IOT201 |	20 milliseconds
EDL	00:30:43,456	00:30:47,296	| IOT201 |	Stop the machine is going to be done with the cloud as part of the critical path
EDL	00:30:47,296	00:30:51,904	| IOT201 |	Has a much better alternative is to make sure you have all this data readily available on the edge
EDL	00:30:51,904	00:30:52,672	| IOT201 |	Write beside them
EDL	00:30:52,672	00:30:53,696	| IOT201 |	Machines or tricycle
EDL	00:30:54,208	00:30:55,744	| IOT201 |	So that's what I database really makes a difference
EDL	00:30:56,256	00:30:59,072	| IOT201 |	And how does that help in Edge application developer
EDL	00:30:59,584	00:31:03,680	| IOT201 |	Application your add application needs to be able to read the state as fact
EDL	00:31:03,680	00:31:07,008	| IOT201 |	Responsible with minimum layers in between application of the date itself
EDL	00:31:07,008	00:31:09,312	| IOT201 |	Making sure you guarantee that the state is also
EDL	00:31:09,312	00:31:11,872	| IOT201 |	Properly persisted is critical for a later on
EDL	00:31:12,640	00:31:14,176	| IOT201 |	Trinity mitigate root causes
EDL	00:31:15,712	00:31:16,736	| IOT201 |	And last but not least
EDL	00:31:17,248	00:31:20,320	| IOT201 |	Keeping the sequence of events like a typical transactional system
EDL	00:31:20,320	00:31:22,880	| IOT201 |	Will help you to understand the events that triggered
EDL	00:31:22,880	00:31:25,696	| IOT201 |	This place is all features of what
EDL	00:31:26,208	00:31:28,000	| IOT201 |	Provide and they're all covered by
EDL	00:31:28,000	00:31:30,560	| IOT201 |	Excellent so can you explain house
EDL	00:31:30,560	00:31:31,584	| IOT201 |	Sitri Edge helps
EDL	00:31:31,584	00:31:33,632	| IOT201 |	Customers to address all of these concerns
EDL	00:31:34,144	00:31:39,008	| IOT201 |	Sure design with this requirements in mind let's talk about throughput

EDL	00:32:19,456	00:32:22,016	| IOT201 |	Automatically to remote location like the cloud
EDL	00:32:22,016	00:32:26,880	| IOT201 |	It's not important feature that you can provide and do it for you without the need to develop
EDL	00:32:26,880	00:32:27,904	| IOT201 |	Application that does that
EDL	00:32:27,904	00:32:29,696	| IOT201 |	About last week
EDL	00:32:29,696	00:32:33,024	| IOT201 |	Situations highly secured with 256 AES encryption
EDL	00:32:33,024	00:32:33,792	| IOT201 |	Finally

EDL	00:33:27,296	00:33:29,088	| IOT201 |	We are glad to have you
EDL	00:33:29,088	00:33:30,880	| IOT201 |	Because Bluetooth is
EDL	00:33:30,880	00:33:31,904	| IOT201 |	I'm going to go with
EDL	00:33:31,904	00:33:32,672	| IOT201 |	Pretty important
EDL	00:33:32,672	00:33:33,952	| IOT201 |	For The Internet of Things
EDL	00:33:33,952	00:33:34,720	| IOT201 |	And
EDL	00:33:34,720	00:33:38,304	| IOT201 |	There's a lot going on with Bluetooth about a year-and-a-half ago you launched
EDL	00:33:38,304	00:33:39,072	| IOT201 |	Bluetooth mesh
EDL	00:33:39,584	00:33:42,912	| IOT201 |	Which will cover I'm sure but this week you actually just launched
EDL	00:33:42,912	00:33:45,984	| IOT201 |	A new capability which is better location
EDL	00:33:47,008	00:33:48,800	| IOT201 |	Can you tell us a little bit about that
EDL	00:33:49,312	00:33:54,944	| IOT201 |	Yell the last couple years that you mentioned we've been introducing than the community really is the one who does all the work here
EDL	00:33:54,944	00:33:55,968	| IOT201 |	Adding up
EDL	00:33:55,968	00:33:57,248	| IOT201 |	Capabilities Bluetooth
EDL	00:33:57,248	00:33:58,272	| IOT201 |	To help out in
EDL	00:33:58,272	00:34:02,624	| IOT201 |	Either opening up new opportunities or trying to do a better job and some of the
EDL	00:34:02,624	00:34:03,392	| IOT201 |	Aries
EDL	00:34:03,392	00:34:05,440	| IOT201 |	She's already plays
EDL	00:34:05,440	00:34:08,000	| IOT201 |	Five longer range connection
EDL	00:34:08,512	00:34:09,536	| IOT201 |	Kaspersky connection
EDL	00:34:09,536	00:34:14,912	| IOT201 |	And so now the community actually just this next week is going to be adding a new capability called
EDL	00:34:14,912	00:34:15,680	| IOT201 |	Directions
EDL	00:34:15,680	00:34:16,704	| IOT201 |	What's fractions
EDL	00:34:16,704	00:34:19,776	| IOT201 |	At a very high level this is a new feature
EDL	00:34:19,776	00:34:22,848	| IOT201 |	That will enable one Bluetooth device to determine the direction
EDL	00:34:22,848	00:34:23,872	| IOT201 |	Another Bluetooth
EDL	00:34:23,872	00:34:24,640	| IOT201 |	Device
EDL	00:34:24,640	00:34:26,432	| IOT201 |	Aura lightning
EDL	00:34:26,432	00:34:27,712	| IOT201 |	I only belay
EDL	00:34:27,712	00:34:32,832	| IOT201 |	Bluetooth receiver to be able to determine the direction of a signal is coming from
EDL	00:34:32,832	00:34:36,672	| IOT201 |	So very simple concept
EDL	00:34:36,672	00:34:38,208	| IOT201 |	Direction of a Bluetooth
EDL	00:34:38,720	00:34:39,744	| IOT201 |	The reason
EDL	00:34:39,744	00:34:42,816	| IOT201 |	This is so important than Kathy applications of this is
EDL	00:34:42,816	00:34:46,144	| IOT201 |	The members really added this capability to help out in this hole
EDL	00:34:46,144	00:34:47,168	| IOT201 |	Location
EDL	00:34:47,168	00:34:51,008	| IOT201 |	Services
EDL	00:34:51,008	00:34:52,032	| IOT201 |	3-4 years
EDL	00:34:53,056	00:34:55,872	| IOT201 |	What's going on here is it today
EDL	00:34:56,384	00:34:58,944	| IOT201 |	Bluetooth location services everything from
EDL	00:34:58,944	00:35:02,016	| IOT201 |	He's going to consumer-level item finding products like those
EDL	00:35:02,016	00:35:04,832	| IOT201 |	Tiles and trackers is little personal asset tags
EDL	00:35:06,112	00:35:11,488	| IOT201 |	Your wallet or things like that so either those kind of more Simple consumer-level Solutions
EDL	00:35:11,488	00:35:15,840	| IOT201 |	Sophisticated enterprise-level real-time locating systems that are used
EDL	00:35:15,840	00:35:19,936	| IOT201 |	People looking kind of locations like hospitals
EDL	00:35:19,936	00:35:23,008	| IOT201 |	All of them
EDL	00:35:23,008	00:35:23,776	| IOT201 |	Simple
EDL	00:35:23,776	00:35:26,080	| IOT201 |	Building block with Bluetooth
EDL	00:35:26,080	00:35:26,848	| IOT201 |	2
EDL	00:35:26,848	00:35:27,872	| IOT201 |	Bluetooth devices
EDL	00:35:27,872	00:35:33,760	| IOT201 |	Really understand when they're in range of each other and then to use signal strength measurement
EDL	00:35:34,272	00:35:37,344	| IOT201 |	Between them so that little basic capabilities
EDL	00:35:37,344	00:35:38,112	| IOT201 |	Powering
EDL	00:35:38,112	00:35:41,440	| IOT201 |	This whole location services Market which is expected to go to
EDL	00:35:41,440	00:35:42,976	| IOT201 |	400 million
EDL	00:35:42,976	00:35:43,744	| IOT201 |	Unity
EDL	00:35:44,256	00:35:44,768	| IOT201 |	Couple of years
EDL	00:35:45,280	00:35:51,680	| IOT201 |	So basically this is the equivalent of standing in a crowded room and shouting here I am here I am and someone else
EDL	00:35:51,680	00:35:52,960	| IOT201 |	Beijing how far you are
EDL	00:35:52,960	00:35:53,472	| IOT201 |	I'm basically
EDL	00:35:54,496	00:35:55,520	| IOT201 |	Sounds like she's about
EDL	00:35:55,520	00:35:56,544	| IOT201 |	20 feet away
EDL	00:35:56,544	00:36:02,688	| IOT201 |	That's right so it's we use and Bluetooth using signal strength you how loud do I hear you two then estimate
EDL	00:36:03,200	00:36:04,736	| IOT201 |	How far away you are
EDL	00:36:05,248	00:36:09,600	| IOT201 |	But now imagine if my smartphone can only use
EDL	00:36:09,600	00:36:10,368	| IOT201 |	Signal
EDL	00:36:10,368	00:36:15,232	| IOT201 |	Francs to determine the distance to another device
EDL	00:36:15,232	00:36:19,584	| IOT201 |	So now that I have my smartphone couldn't tell me how far away it is
EDL	00:36:19,584	00:36:20,864	| IOT201 |	Point me in the right direction
EDL	00:36:23,936	00:36:28,800	| IOT201 |	Agreed so when were talking about Direction this means like I'm going north or south
EDL	00:36:28,800	00:36:30,336	| IOT201 |	The writer left her how does that work
EDL	00:36:31,872	00:36:38,016	| IOT201 |	The directions to go back to that analogy you yelling and be trying to hear you not only could I kind of
EDL	00:36:38,016	00:36:40,064	| IOT201 |	Justify how loud I hear
EDL	00:36:40,064	00:36:42,368	| IOT201 |	Or you can get to me how far away
EDL	00:36:42,368	00:36:45,440	| IOT201 |	Now I can actually determine which direction you are in
EDL	00:36:47,488	00:36:51,072	| IOT201 |	It's not north south east kind of direction or coordinate they can just
EDL	00:36:51,072	00:36:52,096	| IOT201 |	Understand
EDL	00:36:52,096	00:36:53,376	| IOT201 |	Where that signal is coming from
EDL	00:36:54,400	00:36:55,680	| IOT201 |	The boys out of your mouth
EDL	00:36:55,680	00:36:57,728	| IOT201 |	Understand where it is Miss Kay's Bluetooth
EDL	00:36:58,240	00:37:00,032	| IOT201 |	A Bluetooth receiver
EDL	00:37:00,032	00:37:01,056	| IOT201 |	Can understand
EDL	00:37:01,056	00:37:02,080	| IOT201 |	In which direction
EDL	00:37:02,080	00:37:04,128	| IOT201 |	A Bluetooth transmitter happens to be
EDL	00:37:04,128	00:37:07,968	| IOT201 |	360° around you wherever it might happen to be a
EDL	00:37:08,736	00:37:12,064	| IOT201 |	Okay and so if I'm a developer and I'm building an application
EDL	00:37:12,064	00:37:12,832	| IOT201 |	And I wants to take
EDL	00:37:12,832	00:37:13,344	| IOT201 |	Take advantage of this
EDL	00:37:13,856	00:37:16,416	| IOT201 |	How would I Implement that for the end
EDL	00:37:16,416	00:37:17,952	| IOT201 |	Consumer what does that mean
EDL	00:37:17,952	00:37:20,512	| IOT201 |	Oliver's building and then people who are with their building
EDL	00:37:24,352	00:37:25,888	| IOT201 |	But in this one
EDL	00:37:25,888	00:37:27,424	| IOT201 |	Is more consumer anyone
EDL	00:37:27,424	00:37:29,984	| IOT201 |	This one requires a handset guys
EDL	00:37:29,984	00:37:31,520	| IOT201 |	To add this capability
EDL	00:37:33,824	00:37:36,640	| IOT201 |	Things I need to do including
EDL	00:37:36,640	00:37:38,944	| IOT201 |	The addition of an antenna array inside the devices
EDL	00:37:39,712	00:37:45,088	| IOT201 |	So that may take some time but once that's done I would presume that the hazard vendor in
EDL	00:37:45,088	00:37:46,624	| IOT201 |	Coordination with their
EDL	00:37:46,624	00:37:47,648	| IOT201 |	Other suppliers
EDL	00:37:47,648	00:37:54,048	| IOT201 |	Within surface apis to the developer community that would be able to then yes the information
EDL	00:37:54,048	00:37:55,328	| IOT201 |	From the Bluetooth radios
EDL	00:37:55,328	00:37:57,632	| IOT201 |	In order to estimate determine signal Direction
EDL	00:37:57,632	00:37:59,680	| IOT201 |	And then that could be built into berries
EDL	00:37:59,680	00:38:01,728	| IOT201 |	Stations like this item finding one we talked about
EDL	00:38:02,240	00:38:07,104	| IOT201 |	So this is the application you expect to develop first or is this the other more
EDL	00:38:07,104	00:38:08,384	| IOT201 |	Consumer-friendly
EDL	00:38:08,384	00:38:08,896	| IOT201 |	A different one
EDL	00:38:10,688	00:38:14,272	| IOT201 |	Yeah anytime a new capability and it
EDL	00:38:14,272	00:38:16,576	| IOT201 |	Necessary for the handset vendors include
EDL	00:38:16,576	00:38:17,600	| IOT201 |	Yeah that takes time
EDL	00:38:17,600	00:38:19,392	| IOT201 |	Cycles that are involved
EDL	00:38:20,416	00:38:21,696	| IOT201 |	There is another
EDL	00:38:21,696	00:38:26,304	| IOT201 |	Kia Rio location services where I think we might start seeing Direction finding included
EDL	00:38:26,304	00:38:30,400	| IOT201 |	Sooner and that's in those more sophisticated Solutions I mentioned earlier those
EDL	00:38:30,400	00:38:36,800	| IOT201 |	Enterprise level real-time locating systems like asset tracking and things like that
EDL	00:38:36,800	00:38:43,200	| IOT201 |	They use that same basic building block we talked about earlier with two devices understanding range and signal strength measurements
EDL	00:38:43,200	00:38:45,248	| IOT201 |	Distance between
EDL	00:38:45,248	00:38:46,272	| IOT201 |	There are number of
EDL	00:38:46,272	00:38:49,088	| IOT201 |	Bluetooth locator devices that are deployed
EDL	00:38:49,088	00:38:50,624	| IOT201 |	Young six locations throughout
EDL	00:38:50,624	00:38:52,672	| IOT201 |	Building in those locators are
EDL	00:38:52,672	00:38:54,720	| IOT201 |	Constantly listening for
EDL	00:38:54,720	00:38:55,488	| IOT201 |	Your Bluetooth
EDL	00:38:55,488	00:38:57,024	| IOT201 |	Tags or tabs
EDL	00:38:57,024	00:38:58,304	| IOT201 |	Mobile
EDL	00:38:58,304	00:38:59,840	| IOT201 |	Are people with him
EDL	00:38:59,840	00:39:01,632	| IOT201 |	In a system is tracking allegations of
EDL	00:39:03,424	00:39:05,984	| IOT201 |	Ethos locators is also
EDL	00:39:05,984	00:39:08,544	| IOT201 |	Reporting back to a central server all the time
EDL	00:39:09,056	00:39:10,592	| IOT201 |	As well as
EDL	00:39:10,592	00:39:11,872	| IOT201 |	Signal strength
EDL	00:39:13,152	00:39:15,712	| IOT201 |	Distance from the locator to each of the tags attic
EDL	00:39:16,736	00:39:18,784	| IOT201 |	And using that data from all the locators
EDL	00:39:20,064	00:39:20,832	| IOT201 |	Calculator
EDL	00:39:20,832	00:39:23,904	| IOT201 |	Exactly the physical location of any tags
EDL	00:39:24,416	00:39:25,440	| IOT201 |	Three or more locators
EDL	00:39:25,440	00:39:28,768	| IOT201 |	And today using that kind of technique
EDL	00:39:28,768	00:39:30,048	| IOT201 |	We just talked about
EDL	00:39:30,048	00:39:32,096	| IOT201 |	These systems are able to
EDL	00:39:32,096	00:39:35,424	| IOT201 |	Determine the location of something with so-called meter level a
EDL	00:39:35,936	00:39:38,496	| IOT201 |	They can figure it out right here within kind of
EDL	00:39:38,496	00:39:40,288	| IOT201 |	12102 penny
EDL	00:39:43,360	00:39:45,920	| IOT201 |	Now he's locators can Donnelly report back
EDL	00:39:45,920	00:39:49,760	| IOT201 |	After the server the signal strength coming from the tags that also the directions
EDL	00:39:49,760	00:39:54,368	| IOT201 |	So not only do I hear it at a certain level
EDL	00:39:54,368	00:39:55,648	| IOT201 |	And by
EDL	00:39:55,648	00:40:00,512	| IOT201 |	Reporting back all that additional information to server can out romantically improve his
EDL	00:40:00,512	00:40:01,792	| IOT201 |	Accuracy of determining
EDL	00:40:01,792	00:40:03,328	| IOT201 |	Where something is going from
EDL	00:40:03,328	00:40:05,120	| IOT201 |	Meter level of Acura
EDL	00:40:07,936	00:40:09,216	| IOT201 |	Required for the deployment
EDL	00:40:09,216	00:40:10,496	| IOT201 |	Saudi systems
EDL	00:40:10,496	00:40:11,520	| IOT201 |	Where the hands is not
EDL	00:40:11,520	00:40:12,800	| IOT201 |	Necessarily
EDL	00:40:12,800	00:40:13,824	| IOT201 |	It just locators
EDL	00:40:15,104	00:40:19,200	| IOT201 |	Things like that that's what I think you'll start to see this direction finding feature
EDL	00:40:19,200	00:40:22,784	| IOT201 |	Brats first and that's there's actually you commercial
EDL	00:40:22,784	00:40:23,552	| IOT201 |	Bluetooth Bass
EDL	00:40:24,064	00:40:28,160	| IOT201 |	Systems today that are doing it they're just doing it with a free-standing implementation.
EDL	00:40:28,160	00:40:30,208	| IOT201 |	Direction finding capability
EDL	00:40:30,208	00:40:32,256	| IOT201 |	That's why I think you'll be coming
EDL	00:40:32,768	00:40:37,120	| IOT201 |	I think some of those folks maybe you upgrading their existing systems to now.
EDL	00:40:37,120	00:40:38,144	| IOT201 |	True standard
EDL	00:40:38,912	00:40:41,728	| IOT201 |	Got it so you said within centimeter accuracy
EDL	00:40:42,240	00:40:47,872	| IOT201 |	Pretty impressive and then also does have a sense of up-and-down so if I'm in a multi-story building
EDL	00:40:47,872	00:40:48,896	| IOT201 |	Can I find things
EDL	00:40:48,896	00:40:49,664	| IOT201 |	That way
EDL	00:40:49,664	00:40:50,688	| IOT201 |	Right now
EDL	00:40:50,688	00:40:55,808	| IOT201 |	If it's required and there are vendors out there they're doing
EDL	00:40:55,808	00:40:58,112	| IOT201 |	Deposition something in real time
EDL	00:40:58,112	00:40:59,904	| IOT201 |	Within 10 to 20 cm
EDL	00:41:00,416	00:41:01,184	| IOT201 |	So
EDL	00:41:01,184	00:41:01,952	| IOT201 |	The really really
EDL	00:41:09,632	00:41:13,728	| IOT201 |	And yeah the nice thing about this
EDL	00:41:13,728	00:41:20,128	| IOT201 |	Multiple locators all getting a signal
EDL	00:41:20,128	00:41:20,896	| IOT201 |	Elevation as well
EDL	00:41:21,408	00:41:22,176	| IOT201 |	Okay
EDL	00:41:22,176	00:41:23,968	| IOT201 |	So when should we start seeing it
EDL	00:41:23,968	00:41:24,992	| IOT201 |	You say soon
EDL	00:41:24,992	00:41:29,088	| IOT201 |	Now that the standard is out there when will we start seeing this an Enterprise application
EDL	00:41:29,600	00:41:31,904	| IOT201 |	And then when will we see it maybe in consumer
EDL	00:41:31,904	00:41:33,952	| IOT201 |	And yes the handset Cycles will matter
EDL	00:41:33,952	00:41:37,024	| IOT201 |	That's right
EDL	00:41:37,024	00:41:38,816	| IOT201 |	Certainly this year I think we'd expect
EDL	00:41:38,816	00:41:39,840	| IOT201 |	See some of those
EDL	00:41:39,840	00:41:41,888	| IOT201 |	Existing systems upgrade
EDL	00:41:41,888	00:41:45,984	| IOT201 |	Standard and potentially some of the others are in the space adding this capability
EDL	00:41:45,984	00:41:48,800	| IOT201 |	Consumer level applications that require
EDL	00:41:50,080	00:41:54,943	| IOT201 |	Yachts always hard for us to give guidance there that really is up to us a few players out there and we
EDL	00:41:57,503	00:41:58,783	| IOT201 |	These capabilities
EDL	00:41:58,783	00:42:00,319	| IOT201 |	Maybe this time next year
EDL	00:42:00,319	00:42:01,855	| IOT201 |	Sing some stuff come to Market
EDL	00:42:01,855	00:42:04,415	| IOT201 |	It looks talk about some of the news you guys
EDL	00:42:04,415	00:42:05,951	| IOT201 |	Disgust at CES
EDL	00:42:05,951	00:42:07,231	| IOT201 |	Which was profile
EDL	00:42:07,231	00:42:10,303	| IOT201 |	And you know if I can take folks back down memory lane
EDL	00:42:11,071	00:42:11,839	| IOT201 |	Bluetooth
EDL	00:42:11,839	00:42:12,863	| IOT201 |	Has been around for a long time
EDL	00:42:13,375	00:42:16,959	| IOT201 |	But historically it's been I say historically cuz I'm old
EDL	00:42:16,959	00:42:19,519	| IOT201 |	It was focused on audio and
EDL	00:42:20,287	00:42:22,079	| IOT201 |	Being able to transmit yunnan
EDL	00:42:22,079	00:42:22,847	| IOT201 |	Audio to EUR
EDL	00:42:23,359	00:42:24,383	| IOT201 |	Speaker to Bluetooth
EDL	00:42:24,383	00:42:26,175	| IOT201 |	Speaker audio to your headphones
EDL	00:42:26,175	00:42:28,223	| IOT201 |	And now we're really
EDL	00:42:28,223	00:42:29,503	| IOT201 |	Taking something
EDL	00:42:29,503	00:42:30,527	| IOT201 |	Deped
EDL	00:42:30,527	00:42:31,807	| IOT201 |	Pretty narrow focus in
EDL	00:42:31,807	00:42:32,831	| IOT201 |	And turning it into something that is
EDL	00:42:33,343	00:42:34,367	| IOT201 |	Really applicable
EDL	00:42:34,367	00:42:35,647	| IOT201 |	For everything from you.
EDL	00:42:35,647	00:42:36,927	| IOT201 |	Sensor readings
EDL	00:42:36,927	00:42:38,719	| IOT201 |	All the way up to location
EDL	00:42:39,231	00:42:40,767	| IOT201 |	Even things like old light bulbs
EDL	00:42:40,767	00:42:41,535	| IOT201 |	So
EDL	00:42:41,535	00:42:42,559	| IOT201 |	Talk to me about
EDL	00:42:42,559	00:42:44,863	| IOT201 |	Come to the journey that Bluetooth has made
EDL	00:42:44,863	00:42:45,887	| IOT201 |	In the concession
EDL	00:42:45,887	00:42:46,655	| IOT201 |	The shake is trying to
EDL	00:42:47,423	00:42:48,447	| IOT201 |	Tries to
EDL	00:42:48,447	00:42:49,983	| IOT201 |	Build out these use cases
EDL	00:42:49,983	00:42:50,751	| IOT201 |	Which is better
EDL	00:42:50,751	00:42:51,519	| IOT201 |	Usually buried
EDL	00:42:52,031	00:42:53,055	| IOT201 |	That's riding
EDL	00:42:53,055	00:42:55,871	| IOT201 |	And I mentioned earlier that you that's one thing it's always
EDL	00:42:55,871	00:42:56,383	| IOT201 |	Impress me about
EDL	00:42:57,407	00:43:01,503	| IOT201 |	Community as it doesn't stand still it's the community's continually adding
EDL	00:43:01,503	00:43:03,295	| IOT201 |	Can you keep abilities to address
EDL	00:43:03,295	00:43:04,063	| IOT201 |	Demarcus
EDL	00:43:04,063	00:43:06,111	| IOT201 |	Multiple levels I mean
EDL	00:43:06,111	00:43:07,391	| IOT201 |	If you go back far enough
EDL	00:43:07,391	00:43:08,927	| IOT201 |	Bluetooth
EDL	00:43:08,927	00:43:09,439	| IOT201 |	Classic Radio
EDL	00:43:11,231	00:43:13,023	| IOT201 |	Community added a whole new radio
EDL	00:43:15,839	00:43:18,655	| IOT201 |	And that wonderful opportunities and another cell
EDL	00:43:18,655	00:43:24,031	| IOT201 |	But not only the rails layer but even now that he look at more of the ways that the cookies enabled devices to
EDL	00:43:24,799	00:43:27,359	| IOT201 |	Tanisha you mentioned it was all about
EDL	00:43:27,359	00:43:31,199	| IOT201 |	A simple point-to-point connections of streaming audio between my handset and speaker
EDL	00:43:33,503	00:43:34,527	| IOT201 |	Expanded to broadcast
EDL	00:43:35,551	00:43:37,599	| IOT201 |	So allowing one device
EDL	00:43:37,599	00:43:39,903	| IOT201 |	Many around it that's what's power the whole
EDL	00:43:39,903	00:43:40,927	| IOT201 |	Bluetooth speaker
EDL	00:43:41,695	00:43:44,767	| IOT201 |	Talk about it many many use cases for using Bluetooth broadcast
EDL	00:43:46,303	00:43:46,815	| IOT201 |	And then
EDL	00:43:49,375	00:43:51,679	| IOT201 |	The community added yet another way with mesh Network
EDL	00:43:52,191	00:43:53,215	| IOT201 |	So allowing
EDL	00:43:53,215	00:43:55,519	| IOT201 |	Tens hundreds thousands
EDL	00:43:55,519	00:43:59,103	| IOT201 |	To all be able to communicate to each other in a many-to-many kind of
EDL	00:43:59,103	00:44:00,639	| IOT201 |	Apologies
EDL	00:44:00,639	00:44:05,503	| IOT201 |	Shirley reliably and with high performance be able to exchange messages
EDL	00:44:07,551	00:44:11,135	| IOT201 |	Get to really be a catalyst or an enabler for a lot of
EDL	00:44:11,135	00:44:13,439	| IOT201 |	Emerging-markets lifesmart almonds
EDL	00:44:13,439	00:44:14,207	| IOT201 |	Building
EDL	00:44:14,207	00:44:15,743	| IOT201 |	Will you have that need for
EDL	00:44:15,743	00:44:16,767	| IOT201 |	Many many devices
EDL	00:44:16,767	00:44:17,535	| IOT201 |	To be able to
EDL	00:44:17,535	00:44:18,559	| IOT201 |	Securely and reliably able
EDL	00:44:19,839	00:44:21,119	| IOT201 |	Eachother one another
EDL	00:44:21,119	00:44:25,215	| IOT201 |	One of the markets at this Mesh networking technology was targeted at is
EDL	00:44:26,495	00:44:28,031	| IOT201 |	And a lot of progress
EDL	00:44:28,799	00:44:30,847	| IOT201 |	That market has evolved a lot over the last
EDL	00:44:31,359	00:44:32,127	| IOT201 |	Gears
EDL	00:44:32,127	00:44:33,407	| IOT201 |	If I take a little bit
EDL	00:44:33,407	00:44:35,711	| IOT201 |	The back put into different
EDL	00:44:37,247	00:44:38,783	| IOT201 |	Connected home and then
EDL	00:44:38,783	00:44:39,551	| IOT201 |	Animation
EDL	00:44:40,063	00:44:41,343	| IOT201 |	The connected home is where
EDL	00:44:41,343	00:44:44,159	| IOT201 |	Lucas is being used to disconnect lots of things in the home
EDL	00:44:44,159	00:44:46,975	| IOT201 |	It's kind of stuff you looted to earlier TVs are connected
EDL	00:44:46,975	00:44:47,999	| IOT201 |	Soundbars gamebox
EDL	00:44:48,767	00:44:50,559	| IOT201 |	Controllers my smartphone is connect
EDL	00:44:50,559	00:44:51,839	| IOT201 |	How to test tools
EDL	00:44:51,839	00:44:55,167	| IOT201 |	Poise toothbrushes lots of things in the home and there's probably
EDL	00:44:55,167	00:44:56,447	| IOT201 |	Half a billion
EDL	00:44:56,447	00:44:57,983	| IOT201 |	Just as last year alone in
EDL	00:44:57,983	00:44:59,775	| IOT201 |	Marcus and then there's a more
EDL	00:44:59,775	00:45:01,567	| IOT201 |	The kind of full home automation
EDL	00:45:01,567	00:45:02,591	| IOT201 |	Areaware
EDL	00:45:02,591	00:45:05,919	| IOT201 |	Sophisticated Solutions being deployed
EDL	00:45:05,919	00:45:07,967	| IOT201 |	Control and automation

EDL	00:45:11,551	00:45:15,903	| IOT201 |	And things like that and that's the one that is
EDL	00:45:15,903	00:45:19,231	| IOT201 |	Almost a hundred billion units is last year in that area
EDL	00:45:19,231	00:45:21,023	| IOT201 |	But it's one that I decided to see a lot of Prague
EDL	00:45:21,535	00:45:23,327	| IOT201 |	We made
EDL	00:45:23,327	00:45:25,119	| IOT201 |	Couple of years we've seen
EDL	00:45:25,119	00:45:28,191	| IOT201 |	You lie for me it's been good to see the big Tech players
EDL	00:45:28,191	00:45:29,471	| IOT201 |	You're stepping in hearing
EDL	00:45:29,471	00:45:32,543	| IOT201 |	Providing tubs next order to some of the chaos
EDL	00:45:32,543	00:45:34,335	| IOT201 |	In this market for a while
EDL	00:45:34,335	00:45:36,639	| IOT201 |	The Google and Amazon domestically
EDL	00:45:36,639	00:45:38,175	| IOT201 |	Alibaba and xiaomi friends
EDL	00:45:38,943	00:45:39,711	| IOT201 |	China
EDL	00:45:39,711	00:45:43,295	| IOT201 |	Chinese companies are really coming in and then they have the wherewithal to really
EDL	00:45:43,295	00:45:46,879	| IOT201 |	Hold things together to create large enough ecosystems to attract
EDL	00:45:46,879	00:45:49,439	| IOT201 |	The developer community and to deliver truly
EDL	00:45:49,439	00:45:50,975	| IOT201 |	Italian experiences
EDL	00:45:50,975	00:45:52,255	| IOT201 |	And things like that
EDL	00:45:52,255	00:45:53,791	| IOT201 |	And we've been excited that
EDL	00:45:53,791	00:45:59,935	| IOT201 |	About that happening cuz I think it's going to represent the next Crow and we've had several these big ecosystems now make
EDL	00:46:00,959	00:46:01,983	| IOT201 |	Strategic
EDL	00:46:01,983	00:46:03,007	| IOT201 |	Decision to
EDL	00:46:03,007	00:46:05,567	| IOT201 |	Select Bluetooth and specifically Bluetooth match
EDL	00:46:05,567	00:46:08,383	| IOT201 |	Protocol for their overall
EDL	00:46:08,383	00:46:09,151	| IOT201 |	Smart Home
EDL	00:46:09,151	00:46:09,663	| IOT201 |	Strategy
EDL	00:46:13,247	00:46:14,783	| IOT201 |	The number of products
EDL	00:46:14,783	00:46:18,111	| IOT201 |	Little booties matter
EDL	00:46:18,111	00:46:18,623	| IOT201 |	6 months
EDL	00:46:19,903	00:46:21,183	| IOT201 |	If 6 month since we lost
EDL	00:46:21,183	00:46:23,231	| IOT201 |	Spectre re30 qualify products
EDL	00:46:23,743	00:46:24,767	| IOT201 |	After 12 months it was up to
EDL	00:46:24,767	00:46:25,535	| IOT201 |	60
EDL	00:46:25,535	00:46:26,815	| IOT201 |	After 18 months
EDL	00:46:26,815	00:46:29,119	| IOT201 |	It was just about a month ago there were over a hundred
EDL	00:46:29,119	00:46:29,887	| IOT201 |	20
EDL	00:46:29,887	00:46:32,447	| IOT201 |	Does growing really rapidly on this
EDL	00:46:32,447	00:46:35,775	| IOT201 |	Doubling up after every 6 months and based on everything I've seen
EDL	00:46:35,775	00:46:36,543	| IOT201 |	I think we should expect that
EDL	00:46:37,055	00:46:37,823	| IOT201 |	Continue for a while
EDL	00:46:38,847	00:46:41,663	| IOT201 |	Alright let's talk about the Enterprise and
EDL	00:46:41,663	00:46:42,431	| IOT201 |	Industrial use
EDL	00:46:43,199	00:46:45,247	| IOT201 |	I know that there are a variety of
EDL	00:46:45,247	00:46:47,039	| IOT201 |	Hub makers and companies from
EDL	00:46:47,039	00:46:48,063	| IOT201 |	Khasiyat
EDL	00:46:48,063	00:46:49,599	| IOT201 |	We're trying to
EDL	00:46:49,599	00:46:50,623	| IOT201 |	Help bring
EDL	00:46:50,623	00:46:51,647	| IOT201 |	Make Bluetooth
EDL	00:46:51,647	00:46:52,671	| IOT201 |	Is a little bit more
EDL	00:46:52,671	00:46:54,207	| IOT201 |	Accessible for Enterprises
EDL	00:46:54,719	00:46:58,559	| IOT201 |	How is that going and what are five of the things that those use case
EDL	00:46:58,559	00:46:59,071	| IOT201 |	Need that
EDL	00:47:00,863	00:47:03,423	| IOT201 |	Yeah it is just a couple of
EDL	00:47:03,423	00:47:04,959	| IOT201 |	Emerging markets for Bluetooth
EDL	00:47:05,983	00:47:07,263	| IOT201 |	Really big growth Opera
EDL	00:47:07,263	00:47:12,383	| IOT201 |	Enterprise or we just generally referred to as the smart building Market is absolutely
EDL	00:47:12,383	00:47:12,895	| IOT201 |	You're one of those
EDL	00:47:13,407	00:47:16,223	| IOT201 |	You're right now we're seeing really strong growth on a couple of fronts
EDL	00:47:16,223	00:47:20,575	| IOT201 |	Relates to the one we were talking about earlier in this whole area location
EDL	00:47:20,575	00:47:21,599	| IOT201 |	And services which has been
EDL	00:47:22,111	00:47:23,135	| IOT201 |	Your building very well for
EDL	00:47:24,671	00:47:25,439	| IOT201 |	Also Bluetooth
EDL	00:47:28,255	00:47:29,023	| IOT201 |	So
EDL	00:47:29,023	00:47:31,071	| IOT201 |	Large facilities in Enterprises
EDL	00:47:31,071	00:47:32,607	| IOT201 |	English shopping malls
EDL	00:47:32,607	00:47:34,143	| IOT201 |	Plano systems to
EDL	00:47:34,143	00:47:37,215	| IOT201 |	Facilitate visitors navigations routed Airport
EDL	00:47:37,215	00:47:39,007	| IOT201 |	Do the same so visitors
EDL	00:47:39,007	00:47:41,311	| IOT201 |	Find a way to Gabe's in the manatees routed
EDL	00:47:41,311	00:47:45,919	| IOT201 |	Location services
EDL	00:47:46,431	00:47:48,479	| IOT201 |	You're the other newer area and smart
EDL	00:47:48,479	00:47:51,295	| IOT201 |	Billy has really started with this whole laundromats networking
EDL	00:47:52,319	00:47:57,951	| IOT201 |	Want to go in the big bright spot
EDL	00:47:57,951	00:47:58,719	| IOT201 |	And
EDL	00:47:58,719	00:48:00,767	| IOT201 |	You know what we've been seeing is that
EDL	00:48:00,767	00:48:03,071	| IOT201 |	Humana commercial buildings
EDL	00:48:03,071	00:48:04,863	| IOT201 |	And I'm making this rapid shift from
EDL	00:48:04,863	00:48:07,423	| IOT201 |	Compact fluorescent lighting to LED lighting
EDL	00:48:07,423	00:48:11,263	| IOT201 |	At the same time they're doing that they're looking to move to wireless lighting feature
EDL	00:48:11,775	00:48:14,079	| IOT201 |	It provides lower-cost
EDL	00:48:14,079	00:48:14,847	| IOT201 |	Ability
EDL	00:48:14,847	00:48:16,639	| IOT201 |	Next level of sophistication to me
EDL	00:48:17,151	00:48:19,455	| IOT201 |	Regulatory requirements things like that
EDL	00:48:19,455	00:48:20,991	| IOT201 |	And that has been building
EDL	00:48:20,991	00:48:27,391	| IOT201 |	You're very well so you can seen a lot of lighting vendors
EDL	00:48:27,391	00:48:28,415	| IOT201 |	Especially over this last
EDL	00:48:28,415	00:48:29,183	| IOT201 |	80 months
EDL	00:48:29,183	00:48:31,999	| IOT201 |	That whole shift to Car Smart connected lighting
EDL	00:48:31,999	00:48:34,815	| IOT201 |	Seems to be a really really good growth area for us right now
EDL	00:48:34,815	00:48:36,095	| IOT201 |	Make Bluetooth with matches
EDL	00:48:36,095	00:48:37,119	| IOT201 |	Very well positioned
EDL	00:48:37,887	00:48:40,959	| IOT201 |	And as Bluetooth evolves I'd love to talk to you
EDL	00:48:40,959	00:48:41,983	| IOT201 |	About Beacon
EDL	00:48:42,495	00:48:43,519	| IOT201 |	Because they felt
EDL	00:48:43,519	00:48:44,799	| IOT201 |	So promising
EDL	00:48:44,799	00:48:46,079	| IOT201 |	And then they ended up being
EDL	00:48:46,591	00:48:47,871	| IOT201 |	So not from
EDL	00:48:47,871	00:48:49,919	| IOT201 |	Sing and yet a lot of the technology
EDL	00:48:49,919	00:48:50,687	| IOT201 |	These were talking about
EDL	00:48:50,687	00:48:53,247	| IOT201 |	In this conversation are things that we thought we'd do with pica
EDL	00:48:54,015	00:48:56,831	| IOT201 |	And now we're basically going to do it
EDL	00:48:56,831	00:48:58,623	| IOT201 |	With gateways and other devices
EDL	00:48:58,623	00:49:00,415	| IOT201 |	So can you kind of talk to me about
EDL	00:49:00,415	00:49:01,695	| IOT201 |	I guess what happened with beak
EDL	00:49:02,463	00:49:03,999	| IOT201 |	Then how that concept has adapt
EDL	00:49:04,767	00:49:05,535	| IOT201 |	2 maybe what we hope
EDL	00:49:06,559	00:49:07,839	| IOT201 |	Yeah sure I think the
EDL	00:49:07,839	00:49:10,143	| IOT201 |	If you take it back far enough this goes back to
EDL	00:49:10,143	00:49:11,423	| IOT201 |	What happens with many technology
EDL	00:49:15,519	00:49:20,895	| IOT201 |	This community added Bluetooth low energy again one of the things that got introduced with that was the ability to
EDL	00:49:20,895	00:49:21,919	| IOT201 |	Broadcast
EDL	00:49:22,687	00:49:24,735	| IOT201 |	We talked about the Bluetooth device canal
EDL	00:49:24,735	00:49:25,759	| IOT201 |	Broadcast
EDL	00:49:25,759	00:49:29,087	| IOT201 |	Messaging messages and any device around you can hear those
EDL	00:49:29,087	00:49:34,207	| IOT201 |	And you're the community's been very creative with ways to use and that's what led
EDL	00:49:34,207	00:49:39,327	| IOT201 |	If you go with your member a little bit of the progression apples and one that introduced the ivy can protocol
EDL	00:49:39,327	00:49:40,095	| IOT201 |	As a means
EDL	00:49:40,095	00:49:41,119	| IOT201 |	The kind of figure out how to
EDL	00:49:41,119	00:49:42,655	| IOT201 |	Let's use that capability to
EDL	00:49:42,655	00:49:43,423	| IOT201 |	Support
EDL	00:49:43,423	00:49:45,471	| IOT201 |	Point of Interest information Deacons
EDL	00:49:45,471	00:49:47,519	| IOT201 |	Are using broadcast apology to serve
EDL	00:49:47,519	00:49:48,799	| IOT201 |	Variety different
EDL	00:49:48,799	00:49:49,311	| IOT201 |	Opportunities
EDL	00:49:50,335	00:49:54,175	| IOT201 |	A lot of interesting ways to use Bluetooth broadcast one is as a
EDL	00:49:54,175	00:49:56,735	| IOT201 |	June support these Point address information
EDL	00:49:56,735	00:49:59,039	| IOT201 |	A lot of
EDL	00:49:59,039	00:50:01,855	| IOT201 |	Museums putting these deacons on exhibit
EDL	00:50:01,855	00:50:04,159	| IOT201 |	Allow visitors to get more information
EDL	00:50:04,159	00:50:05,695	| IOT201 |	Retail environments
EDL	00:50:05,695	00:50:10,047	| IOT201 |	Deplane Deacon's on various products and end aisle displays and so4 2
EDL	00:50:10,047	00:50:11,327	| IOT201 |	Facilitator
EDL	00:50:11,327	00:50:12,351	| IOT201 |	Experience
EDL	00:50:12,351	00:50:17,471	| IOT201 |	Bluetooth broadcast capability Servicing
EDL	00:50:17,471	00:50:21,567	| IOT201 |	But that broadcast capability Bluetooth for many many different
EDL	00:50:21,567	00:50:24,895	| IOT201 |	Thanks so it's actually the fundamental technology behind
EDL	00:50:24,895	00:50:27,967	| IOT201 |	So the network are actually using
EDL	00:50:27,967	00:50:28,735	| IOT201 |	Broadcast
EDL	00:50:28,735	00:50:31,551	| IOT201 |	Telecommunications is a way for them to communicate to each other
EDL	00:50:31,551	00:50:34,623	| IOT201 |	Oh I just answering your question yes it is
EDL	00:50:34,623	00:50:38,719	| IOT201 |	And this is partly I mean this is as you point out this is technology adapting
EDL	00:50:39,487	00:50:40,511	| IOT201 |	This is basically like
EDL	00:50:40,511	00:50:42,303	| IOT201 |	Where can I put a capability out there
EDL	00:50:42,303	00:50:44,095	| IOT201 |	See how people react to it
EDL	00:50:44,095	00:50:44,863	| IOT201 |	What they do with it
EDL	00:50:44,863	00:50:45,631	| IOT201 |	So this
EDL	00:50:45,631	00:50:46,143	| IOT201 |	This makes sense
EDL	00:50:46,911	00:50:48,959	| IOT201 |	Add onto that
EDL	00:50:48,959	00:50:50,751	| IOT201 |	You're in another area code so friends
EDL	00:50:53,567	00:50:59,967	| IOT201 |	Solutions that use Bluetooth they can choose any different way to communicate
EDL	00:50:59,967	00:51:00,735	| IOT201 |	Gateway
EDL	00:51:00,735	00:51:02,527	| IOT201 |	They can use a broadcast
EDL	00:51:02,527	00:51:06,111	| IOT201 |	Communication is kind of Beacon communication to communicate information
EDL	00:51:06,111	00:51:07,135	| IOT201 |	Go back to a gateway
EDL	00:51:08,671	00:51:11,999	| IOT201 |	So that's one of the things this developers really like about Bluetooth is this
EDL	00:51:11,999	00:51:13,023	| IOT201 |	Flexibility
EDL	00:51:13,023	00:51:14,815	| IOT201 |	Not just one way to communicate
EDL	00:51:14,815	00:51:15,583	| IOT201 |	Communicate
EDL	00:51:15,583	00:51:19,423	| IOT201 |	What connection I can do Dover broadcast connection
EDL	00:51:19,423	00:51:23,263	| IOT201 |	Flexible platform
EDL	00:51:24,287	00:51:25,823	| IOT201 |	Is the right approach for them
EDL	00:51:25,823	00:51:28,127	| IOT201 |	Alright thank you so much again for coming on the show this week
EDL	00:51:28,895	00:51:29,919	| IOT201 |	Of course thank you for having me
