EDL	00:01:24,480	00:01:26,272	| IOT179 |	To learn more visit a pharaoh
EDL	00:01:26,272	00:01:27,296	| IOT179 |	Dot IO
EDL	00:01:27,296	00:01:29,856	| IOT179 |	That's a fair o a f e r o
EDL	00:01:29,856	00:01:30,880	| IOT179 |	Dot IO
EDL	00:01:32,160	00:01:33,440	| IOT179 |	Okay
EDL	00:01:33,440	00:01:33,952	| IOT179 |	Heaven
EDL	00:01:34,464	00:01:35,744	| IOT179 |	I know it's Eva
EDL	00:01:35,744	00:01:36,768	| IOT179 |	But first
EDL	00:01:36,768	00:01:38,048	| IOT179 |	Actually let's just talk about Eva
EDL	00:01:38,560	00:01:40,608	| IOT179 |	Let's just get started this is a giant
EDL	00:01:40,608	00:01:41,888	| IOT179 |	Home Appliance
EDL	00:01:41,888	00:01:43,424	| IOT179 |	And houseware show in
EDL	00:01:43,424	00:01:44,192	| IOT179 |	In Germany
EDL	00:01:44,192	00:01:46,496	| IOT179 |	And up until a few years ago
EDL	00:01:46,496	00:01:48,544	| IOT179 |	It was not even on my radar
EDL	00:01:48,544	00:01:49,312	| IOT179 |	But
EDL	00:01:49,312	00:01:50,592	| IOT179 |	With the era of
EDL	00:01:50,592	00:01:54,176	| IOT179 |	The connected Home Smart appliances and even things like
EDL	00:01:54,176	00:01:55,712	| IOT179 |	The Amazon Echo
EDL	00:01:55,712	00:01:56,992	| IOT179 |	If I had become a
EDL	00:01:56,992	00:01:58,272	| IOT179 |	Huge trade show for us
EDL	00:01:58,784	00:01:59,808	| IOT179 |	I would have gone but
EDL	00:02:00,320	00:02:01,856	| IOT179 |	I'm actually going on vacation
EDL	00:02:01,856	00:02:02,368	| IOT179 |	Tomorrow so I'd
EDL	00:02:03,392	00:02:04,416	| IOT179 |	Yeah it's
EDL	00:02:04,416	00:02:08,000	| IOT179 |	I've actually follow it for a long time because it reminds me of like the
EDL	00:02:08,000	00:02:09,280	| IOT179 |	International version of
EDL	00:02:09,280	00:02:15,680	| IOT179 |	CSN degrees held in Berlin every year and aside from the stuff we talked about on this show there are laptops in
EDL	00:02:15,680	00:02:16,448	| IOT179 |	Mobile devices
EDL	00:02:16,448	00:02:17,472	| IOT179 |	And so on so forth
EDL	00:02:17,472	00:02:21,568	| IOT179 |	Things that I cover elsewhere so there's a ton of stuff I made when I get out there
EDL	00:02:23,104	00:02:23,872	| IOT179 |	But no
EDL	00:02:23,872	00:02:28,992	| IOT179 |	I know now we're still going to hear if I just started so we're still going to be hearing news
EDL	00:02:28,992	00:02:30,016	| IOT179 |	Will cover probably neck
EDL	00:02:30,528	00:02:31,296	| IOT179 |	Score in the newsletter
EDL	00:02:31,296	00:02:32,576	| IOT179 |	But for now
EDL	00:02:32,576	00:02:34,112	| IOT179 |	With some smart speaker news
EDL	00:02:34,112	00:02:35,136	| IOT179 |	Harman Kardon
EDL	00:02:35,136	00:02:39,232	| IOT179 |	Which is now owned by Samsung actually announced a $600 Google Assistant
EDL	00:02:39,744	00:02:41,536	| IOT179 |	Speaker at feels like a lot of money
EDL	00:02:42,560	00:02:43,584	| IOT179 |	Yeah but
EDL	00:02:44,096	00:02:44,864	| IOT179 |	I mean it
EDL	00:02:44,864	00:02:48,448	| IOT179 |	You're buying is for sound quality the Google assistant is kind of like
EDL	00:02:48,448	00:02:51,776	| IOT179 |	Well I guess it's becoming table States these days for speaker in a sentence
EDL	00:02:51,776	00:02:55,616	| IOT179 |	You know when you can get a Google home Max for $200 less this has
EDL	00:02:55,616	00:02:57,664	| IOT179 |	200 watt stereo speakers
EDL	00:02:57,664	00:03:01,248	| IOT179 |	Support high definition audio streaming has an LCD
EDL	00:03:01,248	00:03:04,064	| IOT179 |	Touch panel at the top so this is definitely a high end
EDL	00:03:04,064	00:03:08,416	| IOT179 |	Device I assume it sounds good haven't heard it obviously but it is strange to me that
EDL	00:03:08,416	00:03:13,792	| IOT179 |	Harman Kardon is making a Google Assistant speaker when they are owned by Samsung
EDL	00:03:13,792	00:03:17,120	| IOT179 |	I guess they in a good way they're keeping that line still
EDL	00:03:17,120	00:03:17,888	| IOT179 |	Semi agnostic
EDL	00:03:18,400	00:03:20,448	| IOT179 |	Yes although I would say this is
EDL	00:03:20,448	00:03:23,776	| IOT179 |	I'm a little concerned because remember when Sonos was talkin
EDL	00:03:23,776	00:03:26,592	| IOT179 |	The information actually did a story several months back about
EDL	00:03:27,104	00:03:31,968	| IOT179 |	Sonos being able to do both madhumeh which is what we call the Amazon Echo as a
EDL	00:03:31,968	00:03:33,504	| IOT179 |	Assistant to avoid setting off
EDL	00:03:33,504	00:03:37,344	| IOT179 |	Assistant everywhere so they wanted to add madhumeh and the Google
EDL	00:03:38,112	00:03:40,928	| IOT179 |	And to do that they shared a bludgeon Google with
EDL	00:03:40,928	00:03:41,440	| IOT179 |	Patents
EDL	00:03:41,952	00:03:42,720	| IOT179 |	And
EDL	00:03:42,720	00:03:43,488	| IOT179 |	What I'm
EDL	00:03:43,488	00:03:47,072	| IOT179 |	Certain about is you might have several speakers but you're not going to have
EDL	00:03:47,072	00:03:48,096	| IOT179 |	Voice assistant
EDL	00:03:48,096	00:03:49,376	| IOT179 |	On that one
EDL	00:03:49,376	00:03:51,424	| IOT179 |	Speaker even though technically it is very doable
EDL	00:03:51,936	00:03:58,080	| IOT179 |	What it is very doable and it becomes I think a political battle between the companies that provide the voice services and
EDL	00:03:58,592	00:04:04,992	| IOT179 |	Have they said his son has said that they're not doing the Google Assistant know cuz they did say by the end of the year so I'm kind of holding out
EDL	00:04:04,992	00:04:05,760	| IOT179 |	You know they are
EDL	00:04:05,760	00:04:07,040	| IOT179 |	They are still doing it but
EDL	00:04:07,040	00:04:13,184	| IOT179 |	To get get the ability to make a madame a speaker and a Google Assistant speaker they actually asserted their patent
EDL	00:04:14,208	00:04:15,488	| IOT179 |	Smart speaker technology
EDL	00:04:15,488	00:04:17,791	| IOT179 |	The series The kooples using it in the Google Max
EDL	00:04:18,303	00:04:19,071	| IOT179 |	I don't
EDL	00:04:19,071	00:04:21,119	| IOT179 |	Those are deep inside or negotiations
EDL	00:04:21,119	00:04:22,399	| IOT179 |	So I don't know how that exactly
EDL	00:04:22,911	00:04:24,191	| IOT179 |	It does make em like
EDL	00:04:24,191	00:04:25,471	| IOT179 |	You know I don't want to have to
EDL	00:04:25,471	00:04:26,239	| IOT179 |	To pick and choose
EDL	00:04:26,239	00:04:28,287	| IOT179 |	If I really want awesome sound
EDL	00:04:28,287	00:04:30,079	| IOT179 |	You know that's expensive
EDL	00:04:30,079	00:04:32,639	| IOT179 |	To have a matinee version and a
EDL	00:04:32,639	00:04:33,663	| IOT179 |	Google Assistant version
EDL	00:04:34,175	00:04:35,199	| IOT179 |	Absolutely
EDL	00:04:35,199	00:04:36,735	| IOT179 |	No I don't either but
EDL	00:04:36,735	00:04:41,343	| IOT179 |	Hey if you want to spend even more money you can because did you see the Bang & Olufsen
EDL	00:04:41,343	00:04:43,647	| IOT179 |	Speakers with the Google Assistant built in
EDL	00:04:43,647	00:04:44,415	| IOT179 |	Yes
EDL	00:04:44,415	00:04:44,927	| IOT179 |	That was
EDL	00:04:45,439	00:04:46,207	| IOT179 |	Neat looking
EDL	00:04:46,207	00:04:47,487	| IOT179 |	Like all of bang it all
EDL	00:04:48,511	00:04:52,607	| IOT179 |	Did it look like it was worth $1,750
EDL	00:04:54,911	00:04:58,239	| IOT179 |	No no didn't know this only get you
EDL	00:04:58,239	00:04:59,263	| IOT179 |	Google right
EDL	00:04:59,263	00:05:00,031	| IOT179 |	That is correct
EDL	00:05:00,799	00:05:01,311	| IOT179 |	Yeah
EDL	00:05:01,823	00:05:02,591	| IOT179 |	That is correct
EDL	00:05:03,103	00:05:03,871	| IOT179 |	Sono
EDL	00:05:03,871	00:05:04,895	| IOT179 |	I'm going with them knowing
EDL	00:05:06,175	00:05:07,455	| IOT179 |	We say no
EDL	00:05:08,991	00:05:09,759	| IOT179 |	All right but
EDL	00:05:10,271	00:05:11,551	| IOT179 |	There is another option
EDL	00:05:11,551	00:05:12,831	| IOT179 |	There's booze
EDL	00:05:12,831	00:05:15,903	| IOT179 |	Which also introduced a new smart speaker and Sound Bars
EDL	00:05:15,903	00:05:17,951	| IOT179 |	And I really don't know
EDL	00:05:19,743	00:05:20,767	| IOT179 |	Like
EDL	00:05:20,767	00:05:23,071	| IOT179 |	This what does Amazon
EDL	00:05:23,071	00:05:24,095	| IOT179 |	Matinee
EDL	00:05:24,095	00:05:24,863	| IOT179 |	And
EDL	00:05:24,863	00:05:26,143	| IOT179 |	Leader voice assist
EDL	00:05:26,143	00:05:27,167	| IOT179 |	Since we'll follow
EDL	00:05:27,167	00:05:27,935	| IOT179 |	And
EDL	00:05:27,935	00:05:30,495	| IOT179 |	Also AirPlay 2 for simple streaming from
EDL	00:05:30,495	00:05:31,519	| IOT179 |	Apple devices
EDL	00:05:31,519	00:05:32,287	| IOT179 |	That's going to happen next
EDL	00:05:32,799	00:05:36,639	| IOT179 |	As well write the interesting thing are there voice assistants to follow
EDL	00:05:36,639	00:05:37,919	| IOT179 |	Now the question is
EDL	00:05:37,919	00:05:41,247	| IOT179 |	Will it be Google would it be Bixby would it be Cortana
EDL	00:05:43,807	00:05:45,855	| IOT179 |	Yeah I don't know
EDL	00:05:45,855	00:05:46,879	| IOT179 |	And I look
EDL	00:05:46,879	00:05:47,903	| IOT179 |	Looking for prices on these
EDL	00:05:47,903	00:05:48,415	| IOT179 |	And I don't
EDL	00:05:49,695	00:05:50,975	| IOT179 |	$100
EDL	00:05:50,975	00:05:51,743	| IOT179 |	400
EDL	00:05:51,743	00:05:52,511	| IOT179 |	Dollars okay
EDL	00:05:52,511	00:05:53,791	| IOT179 |	So this is our mid-range
EDL	00:05:53,791	00:05:55,327	| IOT179 |	No that's her low-end actually right now
EDL	00:05:56,095	00:05:57,375	| IOT179 |	Speaker for a large speaker area
EDL	00:05:58,143	00:06:00,447	| IOT179 |	So large speaker in The Sound Bars there's a
EDL	00:06:00,447	00:06:01,471	| IOT179 |	The small one and big one
EDL	00:06:01,471	00:06:04,031	| IOT179 |	Retailing for roughly 550 + 8
EDL	00:06:06,335	00:06:07,615	| IOT179 |	Yay
EDL	00:06:07,615	00:06:09,151	| IOT179 |	All right we're not a speaker show

EDL	00:06:18,111	00:06:18,879	| IOT179 |	Devices
EDL	00:06:18,879	00:06:21,695	| IOT179 |	They actually launched a homekit air quality Mount
EDL	00:06:22,463	00:06:23,487	| IOT179 |	A t v that
EDL	00:06:24,255	00:06:26,559	| IOT179 |	Measures temperature humidity
EDL	00:06:26,559	00:06:29,119	| IOT179 |	Air quality it's actually really tiny like
EDL	00:06:29,119	00:06:31,167	| IOT179 |	Lot of their Eve sensors it's about
EDL	00:06:31,167	00:06:32,959	| IOT179 |	I don't know half the size of a cell phone
EDL	00:06:32,959	00:06:35,007	| IOT179 |	And this is their room to
EDL	00:06:35,007	00:06:36,031	| IOT179 |	And it's going to cost
EDL	00:06:36,031	00:06:37,055	| IOT179 |	$100
EDL	00:06:37,567	00:06:38,335	| IOT179 |	So
EDL	00:06:38,335	00:06:38,847	| IOT179 |	Kind of
EDL	00:06:39,359	00:06:41,919	| IOT179 |	Actually that's exactly how much I paid for my oh where
EDL	00:06:41,919	00:06:43,199	| IOT179 |	Glow that measures all of these
EDL	00:06:43,967	00:06:46,527	| IOT179 |	What I like about this is that it's a small
EDL	00:06:46,527	00:06:48,063	| IOT179 |	Units and
EDL	00:06:48,063	00:06:48,831	| IOT179 |	Doesn't run on
EDL	00:06:49,343	00:06:50,111	| IOT179 |	Power cord
EDL	00:06:50,111	00:06:52,159	| IOT179 |	And some people might say well that kind of sucks
EDL	00:06:52,159	00:06:52,927	| IOT179 |	Because
EDL	00:06:52,927	00:06:55,999	| IOT179 |	Charge it or change batteries yes you do that's correct but
EDL	00:06:55,999	00:06:59,071	| IOT179 |	You can move it from room to room much easier I think that anywhere
EDL	00:06:59,071	00:06:59,839	| IOT179 |	And
EDL	00:06:59,839	00:07:01,119	| IOT179 |	That makes it very handy
EDL	00:07:01,631	00:07:03,167	| IOT179 |	Yes and worth noting
EDL	00:07:03,167	00:07:04,959	| IOT179 |	That this is the
EDL	00:07:04,959	00:07:07,263	| IOT179 |	First thing launched since Eve actually
EDL	00:07:07,775	00:07:08,287	| IOT179 |	Split
EDL	00:07:08,799	00:07:11,359	| IOT179 |	Gaming Division and ditched it Salgado
EDL	00:07:11,871	00:07:13,407	| IOT179 |	Saudis used to be Elgato Eve
EDL	00:07:13,919	00:07:15,199	| IOT179 |	Interstate in June
EDL	00:07:15,199	00:07:16,223	| IOT179 |	Banda June
EDL	00:07:16,223	00:07:19,039	| IOT179 |	They actually created Eve systems
EDL	00:07:19,039	00:07:19,807	| IOT179 |	Only focus on the
EDL	00:07:20,831	00:07:23,903	| IOT179 |	Worth noting so this is the first one everything else is old
EDL	00:07:25,183	00:07:27,231	| IOT179 |	And moving right along to
EDL	00:07:27,231	00:07:27,999	| IOT179 |	You crazy
EDL	00:07:27,999	00:07:29,279	| IOT179 |	Stuff from
EDL	00:07:29,279	00:07:29,791	| IOT179 |	Bosch
EDL	00:07:30,303	00:07:32,095	| IOT179 |	Holy moly
EDL	00:07:32,863	00:07:33,631	| IOT179 |	Okay
EDL	00:07:33,631	00:07:34,399	| IOT179 |	I got so excited by
EDL	00:07:35,423	00:07:38,495	| IOT179 |	Weird Ibiza so we turned into Rai
EDL	00:07:38,495	00:07:39,263	| IOT179 |	Oh I never know
EDL	00:07:39,263	00:07:42,847	| IOT179 |	It's Chris Christ he is a scene at home reporter he's a lovely fellow
EDL	00:07:42,847	00:07:44,127	| IOT179 |	We read about the time he's been on the show
EDL	00:07:44,639	00:07:45,919	| IOT179 |	So he actually
EDL	00:07:46,431	00:07:47,199	| IOT179 |	Tweeted
EDL	00:07:47,199	00:07:48,479	| IOT179 |	Cannabis presser
EDL	00:07:48,479	00:07:49,247	| IOT179 |	A bunch of stuff
EDL	00:07:49,759	00:07:50,527	| IOT179 |	Including
EDL	00:07:50,527	00:07:53,087	| IOT179 |	Induction cooktops with intelligence
EDL	00:07:53,087	00:07:55,391	| IOT179 |	So you could understand if you're
EDL	00:07:55,391	00:07:56,415	| IOT179 |	Burning stuff
EDL	00:07:56,415	00:07:57,695	| IOT179 |	For cooking stuffed
EDL	00:07:57,695	00:07:58,463	| IOT179 |	Too hot which
EDL	00:07:58,463	00:07:59,231	| IOT179 |	I thought was really
EDL	00:07:59,999	00:08:01,535	| IOT179 |	And he also showed off
EDL	00:08:02,303	00:08:03,071	| IOT179 |	Schecter
EDL	00:08:03,071	00:08:05,887	| IOT179 |	And it's basically a projector that projects
EDL	00:08:05,887	00:08:08,447	| IOT179 |	An image that you can interact with on your countertop
EDL	00:08:08,959	00:08:09,727	| IOT179 |	Okay
EDL	00:08:09,727	00:08:10,495	| IOT179 |	I thought I sent
EDL	00:08:10,495	00:08:11,263	| IOT179 |	So excited
EDL	00:08:11,263	00:08:12,287	| IOT179 |	Because I actually saw the
EDL	00:08:12,287	00:08:14,847	| IOT179 |	The semiconductor that made this possible in the Bosch booth
EDL	00:08:15,359	00:08:16,127	| IOT179 |	Yes
EDL	00:08:16,127	00:08:17,919	| IOT179 |	I did a whole story on it
EDL	00:08:18,431	00:08:19,455	| IOT179 |	Super stoked because
EDL	00:08:19,967	00:08:21,247	| IOT179 |	This thing was amazing UK
EDL	00:08:21,759	00:08:22,527	| IOT179 |	You
EDL	00:08:22,527	00:08:23,551	| IOT179 |	If you put this
EDL	00:08:23,551	00:08:29,951	| IOT179 |	Since they're showing is a standalone unit but if you put this you've put this on like an Amazon Echo or something like that it actually could show you
EDL	00:08:29,951	00:08:30,719	| IOT179 |	You video
EDL	00:08:30,719	00:08:32,511	| IOT179 |	You can show you video on any surface
EDL	00:08:32,511	00:08:36,095	| IOT179 |	You could move your hand up and down and the resolution changed
EDL	00:08:36,095	00:08:38,143	| IOT179 |	Seamlessly and then you could interact with
EDL	00:08:38,655	00:08:41,983	| IOT179 |	So imagine if you could say if your doorbell rang in
EDL	00:08:41,983	00:08:43,775	| IOT179 |	You could turn and put your nest
EDL	00:08:43,775	00:08:45,311	| IOT179 |	Doorbell camera
EDL	00:08:45,311	00:08:46,335	| IOT179 |	Image into this
EDL	00:08:46,335	00:08:47,615	| IOT179 |	It could just show it to you on your counter
EDL	00:08:48,127	00:08:48,895	| IOT179 |	So that's cool
EDL	00:08:48,895	00:08:50,687	| IOT179 |	Write absolute
EDL	00:08:50,687	00:08:55,039	| IOT179 |	What school is you could actually all the controls right now like we're very excited about the
EDL	00:08:55,039	00:08:56,831	| IOT179 |	Controls on the Lenovo
EDL	00:08:56,831	00:08:58,623	| IOT179 |	Smart display for things like lights
EDL	00:08:58,623	00:08:59,391	| IOT179 |	Because you can take
EDL	00:08:59,391	00:09:00,671	| IOT179 |	Haji
EDL	00:09:00,671	00:09:01,951	| IOT179 |	Turn on the lights
EDL	00:09:01,951	00:09:03,487	| IOT179 |	And then it'll show you
EDL	00:09:03,487	00:09:04,511	| IOT179 |	A control
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:06,303	| IOT179 |	4like color tuning or thinks
EDL	00:09:06,303	00:09:10,399	| IOT179 |	Like that to me if you imagine that popping up on your counter via this type of
EDL	00:09:10,399	00:09:11,423	| IOT179 |	Splayed then you just
EDL	00:09:11,423	00:09:12,959	| IOT179 |	Like to it right there on the counter
EDL	00:09:13,471	00:09:15,519	| IOT179 |	Yeah this is it's interesting
EDL	00:09:15,519	00:09:21,919	| IOT179 |	Because there's a whole Suite of apps that you can have it it really looks to me like they've taken the open-source version of Android and crew
EDL	00:09:21,919	00:09:24,991	| IOT179 |	Created their own little interface with it but I mean you could even use
EDL	00:09:24,991	00:09:27,295	| IOT179 |	I mean they're showing a video not a video picture of
EDL	00:09:27,295	00:09:29,343	| IOT179 |	Yeah the Chrome browser in Pinterest and all that
EDL	00:09:30,111	00:09:34,975	| IOT179 |	Do all that without a display because the Earth countertop is the display and I presume there's some kind of
EDL	00:09:34,975	00:09:40,607	| IOT179 |	And what kind of sensors they would have in the projection part itself but to allow you the interaction refit interact
EDL	00:09:40,607	00:09:43,679	| IOT179 |	With these apps and so on for recipes or
EDL	00:09:44,191	00:09:47,263	| IOT179 |	Who knows what I meant I like the idea of it I don't know that I would just
EDL	00:09:47,263	00:09:51,615	| IOT179 |	Put this on my countertop but I could see it as a future thing especially as they
EDL	00:09:51,615	00:09:53,151	| IOT179 |	Tweet this idea and implementation
EDL	00:09:53,151	00:09:58,783	| IOT179 |	If I get reminds me of the very last CS that Bill Gates was that he showed the quote-unquote home of the future
EDL	00:09:59,807	00:10:02,111	| IOT179 |	And they had projection balls so you can
EDL	00:10:02,111	00:10:05,439	| IOT179 |	Change the look and feel of you know what your view is like
EDL	00:10:05,439	00:10:06,463	| IOT179 |	Pretend you're in the middle of the ocean
EDL	00:10:06,975	00:10:12,863	| IOT179 |	What is all interactive and they had a projection on the countertop that you could you know through recipes and so on
EDL	00:10:12,863	00:10:15,423	| IOT179 |	Okay so don't just think about recipe
EDL	00:10:15,935	00:10:19,263	| IOT179 |	Is think about something like an interactive cooking demonstration
EDL	00:10:19,263	00:10:20,543	| IOT179 |	That if you
EDL	00:10:20,543	00:10:22,079	| IOT179 |	Put something underneath it
EDL	00:10:22,079	00:10:23,103	| IOT179 |	It could tell you like
EDL	00:10:23,103	00:10:23,871	| IOT179 |	Hey
EDL	00:10:23,871	00:10:25,663	| IOT179 |	Here's how to cut the chicken and it
EDL	00:10:25,663	00:10:27,199	| IOT179 |	Show like lions where you
EDL	00:10:27,199	00:10:27,967	| IOT179 |	Chop your chick
EDL	00:10:27,967	00:10:29,503	| IOT179 |	So imagine kind of like an
EDL	00:10:29,503	00:10:30,527	| IOT179 |	AR on
EDL	00:10:30,527	00:10:31,295	| IOT179 |	On top of
EDL	00:10:31,295	00:10:31,807	| IOT179 |	Your actual
EDL	00:10:32,319	00:10:38,207	| IOT179 |	And that's along the lines of what he showed it was kind of like you put a certain amount of food in a spot and a projector wood
EDL	00:10:38,207	00:10:43,583	| IOT179 |	Visualize it the density and someone say you need a little bit more that's too much of this recipe
EDL	00:10:43,583	00:10:45,375	| IOT179 |	You're right when you start melding
EDL	00:10:45,375	00:10:46,143	| IOT179 |	AI
EDL	00:10:46,143	00:10:47,423	| IOT179 |	And sensors and
EDL	00:10:47,423	00:10:50,495	| IOT179 |	Get rid of the screens have projection there something you can do
EDL	00:10:51,007	00:10:52,543	| IOT179 |	Yeah I'm super high on projector
EDL	00:10:52,543	00:10:53,055	| IOT179 |	I have been
EDL	00:10:54,079	00:10:55,359	| IOT179 |	So I love this guy
EDL	00:10:55,871	00:10:57,919	| IOT179 |	If it's like a r without the glasses
EDL	00:10:57,919	00:10:58,943	| IOT179 |	Yeah basically
EDL	00:10:58,943	00:10:59,711	| IOT179 |	Although in a limit
EDL	00:11:00,223	00:11:00,735	| IOT179 |	Like this
EDL	00:11:03,039	00:11:07,903	| IOT179 |	You'll have your induction charging spot and then you'll have your projection spot and then you'll have your I don't know what's
EDL	00:11:08,415	00:11:11,999	| IOT179 |	Bosch also shut off a washer and dryer that basically you just
EDL	00:11:11,999	00:11:16,607	| IOT179 |	Throw stuff in it it senses what it is and it says this is the type of wash you should do this
EDL	00:11:16,607	00:11:17,631	| IOT179 |	This is how much soap I need
EDL	00:11:17,631	00:11:19,167	| IOT179 |	Dispense this feels like something I have to
EDL	00:11:19,679	00:11:21,471	| IOT179 |	Maybe tahini laundry is not
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:23,519	| IOT179 |	This could be like a revelation
EDL	00:11:23,519	00:11:27,871	| IOT179 |	Remember the June and when I got this I was like even might toast taste better you guys
EDL	00:11:27,871	00:11:30,175	| IOT179 |	And that was a function of like really opt
EDL	00:11:30,175	00:11:30,943	| IOT179 |	Optimizing for that part
EDL	00:11:31,455	00:11:32,735	| IOT179 |	Everything with
EDL	00:11:32,735	00:11:33,503	| IOT179 |	Washing
EDL	00:11:33,503	00:11:38,623	| IOT179 |	Baby there is better washing and I just don't do it no notice it overtime that my clothes are cleaner and maybe they're less
EDL	00:11:39,391	00:11:40,671	| IOT179 |	What's the word I'm looking for
EDL	00:11:40,671	00:11:42,207	| IOT179 |	Born by washing
EDL	00:11:42,207	00:11:43,231	| IOT179 |	But it feels like
EDL	00:11:43,231	00:11:44,511	| IOT179 |	I don't know that I know
EDL	00:11:44,511	00:11:45,279	| IOT179 |	What I need
EDL	00:11:45,279	00:11:45,791	| IOT179 |	Jhene Aiko
EDL	00:11:47,071	00:11:48,863	| IOT179 |	Right and this is a big part of
EDL	00:11:48,863	00:11:52,703	| IOT179 |	The IRT conundrum we don't know what we don't know yet it's almost like
EDL	00:11:52,703	00:11:54,239	| IOT179 |	Until you implement something
EDL	00:11:54,239	00:11:58,591	| IOT179 |	You want don't know that it's better or maybe it's not it will save it that's a big Challenger
EDL	00:11:59,103	00:12:00,895	| IOT179 |	Self-hating wouldn't Bosch
EDL	00:12:00,895	00:12:02,431	| IOT179 |	I want to test this out
EDL	00:12:02,431	00:12:02,943	| IOT179 |	See if it acts
EDL	00:12:03,711	00:12:04,735	| IOT179 |	What color
EDL	00:12:04,735	00:12:10,111	| IOT179 |	That was the fridge any of the fridges come in different colors that are replaceable doors as well
EDL	00:12:10,111	00:12:13,439	| IOT179 |	Cuz it's not really technically iot but Bosch also did show off these
EDL	00:12:13,439	00:12:16,255	| IOT179 |	Refrigerator doors that you can swap out in their different colors
EDL	00:12:16,767	00:12:18,815	| IOT179 |	I love color so I was really a
EDL	00:12:18,815	00:12:19,583	| IOT179 |	Excited by this
EDL	00:12:19,583	00:12:20,351	| IOT179 |	But again there's no spark
EDL	00:12:21,119	00:12:21,631	| IOT179 |	Associated with this
EDL	00:12:22,143	00:12:24,447	| IOT179 |	I know I brought it up just cuz you were so excited about
EDL	00:12:24,959	00:12:25,727	| IOT179 |	Not as excited
EDL	00:12:27,007	00:12:27,775	| IOT179 |	But that's okay
EDL	00:12:27,775	00:12:28,543	| IOT179 |	All right
EDL	00:12:28,543	00:12:31,871	| IOT179 |	So let's move from FIFA those are the big things we've seen so far that
EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:36,735	| IOT179 |	Exciting let's talk about a 50 billion dollar funding for a company called pulse
EDL	00:12:36,735	00:12:37,503	| IOT179 |	Technologies
EDL	00:12:38,015	00:12:39,039	| IOT179 |	Pulse
EDL	00:12:39,551	00:12:42,111	| IOT179 |	These guys basically come in and
EDL	00:12:42,111	00:12:42,879	| IOT179 |	Hang your television
EDL	00:12:43,391	00:12:45,439	| IOT179 |	They even program your smart lights
EDL	00:12:45,439	00:12:47,743	| IOT179 |	Send apparently this is a bang-up business first
EDL	00:12:48,511	00:12:51,839	| IOT179 |	Yeah they got about 2500 vetted professionals
EDL	00:12:51,839	00:12:55,679	| IOT179 |	In 50 Metro areas to get them kind of like the Best Buy Geek Squad what they are
EDL	00:12:55,679	00:12:57,983	| IOT179 |	Train to do pretty much anything here
EDL	00:12:57,983	00:12:59,007	| IOT179 |	A smart home
EDL	00:12:59,007	00:13:00,287	| IOT179 |	Service is
EDL	00:13:00,287	00:13:05,663	| IOT179 |	Part of the deal so they can set things up for you probably help you with routines assistance Etc
EDL	00:13:05,663	00:13:07,199	| IOT179 |	Send some people leave that enough
EDL	00:13:07,199	00:13:08,223	| IOT179 |	You don't even know where
EDL	00:13:08,223	00:13:12,319	| IOT179 |	Still more oven DIY kind of thing with these devices available you know if
EDL	00:13:12,319	00:13:13,855	| IOT179 |	She's at Walmart Target and everywhere else
EDL	00:13:14,367	00:13:15,647	| IOT179 |	Some people still look like
EDL	00:13:15,647	00:13:16,927	| IOT179 |	I don't even know how to set it up
EDL	00:13:16,927	00:13:19,487	| IOT179 |	So you got to think about like
EDL	00:13:19,487	00:13:24,607	| IOT179 |	What was it we had Charlie Kendall who was the head of the Amazon Echo smart home platform
EDL	00:13:24,607	00:13:28,191	| IOT179 |	For a long time go over to control for which is very much a professional answer
EDL	00:13:29,471	00:13:31,263	| IOT179 |	So you know I can see how
EDL	00:13:31,775	00:13:33,311	| IOT179 |	There's a limited layer of us
EDL	00:13:33,311	00:13:34,335	| IOT179 |	That are willing to go to
EDL	00:13:35,871	00:13:40,479	| IOT179 |	Later and there's probably a lot of us who if you can make it affordable would totally be like you
EDL	00:13:40,479	00:13:41,247	| IOT179 |	Please come in
EDL	00:13:41,247	00:13:46,879	| IOT179 |	I'll give you you know maybe I don't know if the prices like closer to like $2,000 to outfit my home and make it
EDL	00:13:46,879	00:13:48,671	| IOT179 |	Get smart you think that's a reasonable price
EDL	00:13:48,671	00:13:53,279	| IOT179 |	Maybe it depends on the home how many devices what you want the waypost as it is that this is
EDL	00:13:53,279	00:13:55,839	| IOT179 |	Flat fee for the service depending on the type of job
EDL	00:13:55,839	00:13:58,655	| IOT179 |	They must be doing okay though because apparently their text
EDL	00:13:58,655	00:14:00,447	| IOT179 |	Between 70 and 80000 a year
EDL	00:14:00,447	00:14:01,983	| IOT179 |	That's Not Unusual I mean
EDL	00:14:01,983	00:14:03,775	| IOT179 |	You're messing around with lots of stuff
EDL	00:14:04,543	00:14:07,615	| IOT179 |	So I'm on their website and it looks like
EDL	00:14:07,615	00:14:08,895	| IOT179 |	The way they do it is
EDL	00:14:08,895	00:14:12,735	| IOT179 |	If I want to do a smart home thing I basically pick a zip code so we can get the
EDL	00:14:12,735	00:14:15,551	| IOT179 |	Pricing I'm assuming that New York cost more than Austin
EDL	00:14:15,551	00:14:17,087	| IOT179 |	And it's like hey
EDL	00:14:17,087	00:14:18,111	| IOT179 |	Do you have a thermostat
EDL	00:14:18,111	00:14:18,879	| IOT179 |	And I'm like
EDL	00:14:18,879	00:14:20,415	| IOT179 |	Yes I want install that
EDL	00:14:20,415	00:14:21,439	| IOT179 |	Do you have Smart Home devices
EDL	00:14:21,951	00:14:22,975	| IOT179 |	What kind
EDL	00:14:22,975	00:14:25,023	| IOT179 |	It looks like they don't have
EDL	00:14:25,023	00:14:25,791	| IOT179 |	Electricians
EDL	00:14:26,303	00:14:28,607	| IOT179 |	Because they don't do any
EDL	00:14:28,607	00:14:29,375	| IOT179 |	Lighting
EDL	00:14:29,375	00:14:30,911	| IOT179 |	Aunt that is like a light switches
EDL	00:14:30,911	00:14:32,959	| IOT179 |	Which is kind of a pain cuz that's a lot of the problems
EDL	00:14:33,471	00:14:36,287	| IOT179 |	People have but they do support like SimpliSafe
EDL	00:14:36,287	00:14:39,103	| IOT179 |	Security they have a bunch of baby monitors
EDL	00:14:39,103	00:14:39,871	| IOT179 |	Cameras
EDL	00:14:40,383	00:14:42,175	| IOT179 |	August door locks ring doorbell
EDL	00:14:43,199	00:14:44,223	| IOT179 |	Detarius hubs
EDL	00:14:44,735	00:14:46,271	| IOT179 |	So that's kind of a bummer
EDL	00:14:46,783	00:14:48,319	| IOT179 |	Yeah maybe.
EDL	00:14:48,319	00:14:51,391	| IOT179 |	Expand that cuz if I recall these guys are actually like
EDL	00:14:51,391	00:14:52,671	| IOT179 |	Smartphone repair
EDL	00:14:52,671	00:14:54,975	| IOT179 |	Best internet expanded into this
EDL	00:14:54,975	00:14:55,743	| IOT179 |	Sector
EDL	00:14:55,743	00:15:01,375	| IOT179 |	So maybe this is a future Edition for them is to add Electrical Services
EDL	00:15:01,375	00:15:02,655	| IOT179 |	Because that is actually a
EDL	00:15:02,655	00:15:03,679	| IOT179 |	Competitive advantage
EDL	00:15:03,679	00:15:04,703	| IOT179 |	Or like
EDL	00:15:04,703	00:15:07,263	| IOT179 |	Comcast when I talk to them about their installernet
EDL	00:15:07,263	00:15:08,799	| IOT179 |	Working like that's awesome you have this
EDL	00:15:08,799	00:15:10,847	| IOT179 |	It's a very big deal but they don't have a
EDL	00:15:10,847	00:15:11,871	| IOT179 |	Electricians and
EDL	00:15:12,383	00:15:13,151	| IOT179 |	That
EDL	00:15:13,151	00:15:17,247	| IOT179 |	How is a really convenient thing to have someone who can install light switches
EDL	00:15:17,247	00:15:18,527	| IOT179 |	Just for you order Outlets
EDL	00:15:20,063	00:15:24,671	| IOT179 |	That's just my take one of the more painful things I have to do is install Outlets
EDL	00:15:24,671	00:15:25,951	| IOT179 |	So maybe that's just me
EDL	00:15:25,951	00:15:26,719	| IOT179 |	Maybe that's just me
EDL	00:15:27,487	00:15:28,511	| IOT179 |	Okay
EDL	00:15:28,511	00:15:29,279	| IOT179 |	So
EDL	00:15:29,279	00:15:30,815	| IOT179 |	These guys got a lot of money
EDL	00:15:30,815	00:15:31,327	| IOT179 |	What else is
EDL	00:15:32,607	00:15:34,655	| IOT179 |	Oster some changes coming to the Google app
EDL	00:15:34,655	00:15:38,495	| IOT179 |	Assistant 95 Google took a look at the latest
EDL	00:15:38,495	00:15:41,055	| IOT179 |	File installation for Google Assistant
EDL	00:15:41,055	00:15:43,103	| IOT179 |	I don't know if it's nothing released yet
EDL	00:15:43,103	00:15:47,455	| IOT179 |	They're seeing bits of code revealing household family mode and downtime
EDL	00:15:47,967	00:15:51,295	| IOT179 |	So it looks like we got some adjustments coming there or some improvement
EDL	00:15:51,295	00:15:52,319	| IOT179 |	Since they're so that's good
EDL	00:15:52,831	00:15:54,879	| IOT179 |	I'm chasing household will let you kind of
EDL	00:15:54,879	00:15:59,999	| IOT179 |	Put different people's personal information together in the home you know
EDL	00:15:59,999	00:16:01,279	| IOT179 |	I appreciate that
EDL	00:16:01,279	00:16:03,071	| IOT179 |	You know they got it right and do this
EDL	00:16:03,071	00:16:05,887	| IOT179 |	But I will say every time they update something
EDL	00:16:05,887	00:16:06,655	| IOT179 |	I have to
EDL	00:16:06,655	00:16:09,215	| IOT179 |	Like they're adding basically a new user interface
EDL	00:16:09,983	00:16:13,567	| IOT179 |	Austin away and then suddenly like half the time I find it I have now
EDL	00:16:13,567	00:16:17,151	| IOT179 |	If I want to use this new functionality I have named my devices
EDL	00:16:17,151	00:16:18,175	| IOT179 |	Does poorly or maybe
EDL	00:16:18,175	00:16:18,943	| IOT179 |	Put them in the wrong
EDL	00:16:18,943	00:16:19,967	| IOT179 |	Rooms
EDL	00:16:19,967	00:16:21,759	| IOT179 |	Or I need to put them in rooms
EDL	00:16:21,759	00:16:26,879	| IOT179 |	So the sounds terrible this iterative process I'm not sure it's working really well for
EDL	00:16:26,879	00:16:29,183	| IOT179 |	Are people and I think they probably just give up
EDL	00:16:29,183	00:16:31,999	| IOT179 |	Cuz I know that sometimes I just look at this and I'm like oh
EDL	00:16:32,511	00:16:33,791	| IOT179 |	I'm not going to connect this
EDL	00:16:33,791	00:16:39,167	| IOT179 |	Google home because I already have something called the front door and that's the lock and now I've got to have a doorbell called
EDL	00:16:39,167	00:16:40,703	| IOT179 |	Light called this
EDL	00:16:40,703	00:16:41,727	| IOT179 |	Synonym like
EDL	00:16:42,495	00:16:48,127	| IOT179 |	Yeah we're going to talk about this little more later but I'm right there with you with some recent challenges on these
EDL	00:16:48,127	00:16:50,175	| IOT179 |	Updates and changes in the First Reactions
EDL	00:16:50,175	00:16:52,479	| IOT179 |	So yeah I don't know the answer because it's like
EDL	00:16:52,479	00:16:53,503	| IOT179 |	Don't do it
EDL	00:16:53,503	00:16:58,879	| IOT179 |	Wait install it professionally I mean I do want them to iterate on things right that's a
EDL	00:16:59,903	00:17:01,183	| IOT179 |	Jumping ahead
EDL	00:17:01,695	00:17:06,815	| IOT179 |	Last little bit of news for us is Google Assistant now can control your nest by Yale lock
EDL	00:17:08,351	00:17:09,631	| IOT179 |	Organys
EDL	00:17:09,631	00:17:10,399	| IOT179 |	Because
EDL	00:17:10,399	00:17:12,959	| IOT179 |	I tried this and perhaps it's just not
EDL	00:17:12,959	00:17:13,983	| IOT179 |	Rolled out yet
EDL	00:17:13,983	00:17:15,775	| IOT179 |	Maybe it's a rolling release
EDL	00:17:15,775	00:17:16,543	| IOT179 |	But
EDL	00:17:16,543	00:17:18,079	| IOT179 |	My home app is not even
EDL	00:17:18,079	00:17:19,103	| IOT179 |	Show the
EDL	00:17:19,103	00:17:19,871	| IOT179 |	Nest
EDL	00:17:19,871	00:17:20,895	| IOT179 |	Buy a lock
EDL	00:17:20,895	00:17:22,687	| IOT179 |	It does show my Nest hello doorbell
EDL	00:17:22,687	00:17:24,223	| IOT179 |	And it shows my nest
EDL	00:17:24,735	00:17:25,503	| IOT179 |	Camera
EDL	00:17:25,503	00:17:28,063	| IOT179 |	So Stacy suggested wisely you know what
EDL	00:17:28,575	00:17:30,111	| IOT179 |	I think you've got to unlink
EDL	00:17:30,111	00:17:30,879	| IOT179 |	Your nest
EDL	00:17:30,879	00:17:34,463	| IOT179 |	Products from Google home a demand account back and then it should appear
EDL	00:17:34,463	00:17:35,487	| IOT179 |	So I did that
EDL	00:17:35,487	00:17:36,767	| IOT179 |	But in doing so
EDL	00:17:36,767	00:17:42,655	| IOT179 |	I need to get the verification code Nest will send you free SMS when you add an account to Google home
EDL	00:17:42,655	00:17:44,191	| IOT179 |	And it never came
EDL	00:17:44,191	00:17:49,055	| IOT179 |	Okay well I should say never about 30 minutes later we'd already given up it came so I finally re-added
EDL	00:17:49,055	00:17:50,591	| IOT179 |	The Nest back to Google home
EDL	00:17:50,591	00:17:51,615	| IOT179 |	And guess what happened
EDL	00:17:51,615	00:17:52,383	| IOT179 |	It's not there
EDL	00:17:52,383	00:17:53,919	| IOT179 |	It's still not there so
EDL	00:17:53,919	00:18:00,319	| IOT179 |	Maybe just rolling out with the whole fact that you have to unlink accounts just to add new devices
EDL	00:18:00,319	00:18:01,343	| IOT179 |	Is Eminem
EDL	00:18:01,343	00:18:03,135	| IOT179 |	Maybe will magically disappear
EDL	00:18:03,135	00:18:04,159	| IOT179 |	Google home for me
EDL	00:18:04,159	00:18:06,463	| IOT179 |	Mine has not met so I have one
EDL	00:18:06,463	00:18:08,511	| IOT179 |	And I have linked to my Google home account
EDL	00:18:09,023	00:18:10,559	| IOT179 |	To my nest
EDL	00:18:10,559	00:18:12,095	| IOT179 |	Account it is not magically appear
EDL	00:18:13,375	00:18:14,911	| IOT179 |	Okay what when it does
EDL	00:18:14,911	00:18:17,471	| IOT179 |	If and when it does you should be able to
EDL	00:18:17,471	00:18:19,263	| IOT179 |	Query your Google home
EDL	00:18:19,263	00:18:23,871	| IOT179 |	To see if the front door or the front door any door the lock is locked or not
EDL	00:18:23,871	00:18:25,919	| IOT179 |	And you can lock it by voice
EDL	00:18:25,919	00:18:27,455	| IOT179 |	For security reasons
EDL	00:18:27,455	00:18:30,271	| IOT179 |	They have decided to not allow voice unlocking at this
EDL	00:18:32,319	00:18:33,599	| IOT179 |	Before start complaining
EDL	00:18:33,599	00:18:35,135	| IOT179 |	Kevin would you like
EDL	00:18:35,135	00:18:36,927	| IOT179 |	To talk about the new device that you tried
EDL	00:18:37,695	00:18:39,231	| IOT179 |	I would love to talk about
EDL	00:18:39,231	00:18:42,559	| IOT179 |	I tested out and still testing out the Phillips
EDL	00:18:42,559	00:18:44,351	| IOT179 |	Hue Lily spotlight
EDL	00:18:44,351	00:18:47,167	| IOT179 |	I'll tell you right up front what you get they are
EDL	00:18:47,167	00:18:47,935	| IOT179 |	3
EDL	00:18:47,935	00:18:49,471	| IOT179 |	LED outdoor spots
EDL	00:18:49,983	00:18:51,263	| IOT179 |	And a low voltage
EDL	00:18:51,263	00:18:57,151	| IOT179 |	Plug-in Transformer so you literally just plugged into an outlet they are weather resistant so they obviously they could be outside
EDL	00:18:57,663	00:18:59,455	| IOT179 |	It's $280
EDL	00:18:59,455	00:18:59,967	| IOT179 |	For these
EDL	00:19:00,479	00:19:02,015	| IOT179 |	If you would like to add additional
EDL	00:19:02,015	00:19:02,527	| IOT179 |	Spots
EDL	00:19:03,039	00:19:07,135	| IOT179 |	They are $80 each and I know that sounds odd because you're like what wattage is by
EDL	00:19:07,135	00:19:07,903	| IOT179 |	Free
EDL	00:19:07,903	00:19:09,695	| IOT179 |	Regular spots because you don't get the
EDL	00:19:09,695	00:19:11,231	| IOT179 |	A Transformer with a single
EDL	00:19:11,231	00:19:11,999	| IOT179 |	LED
EDL	00:19:11,999	00:19:13,535	| IOT179 |	Spot
EDL	00:19:13,535	00:19:15,327	| IOT179 |	Transformer can handle up a 5 spotlights
EDL	00:19:15,839	00:19:17,119	| IOT179 |	Being from Philips Hue
EDL	00:19:17,119	00:19:17,631	| IOT179 |	You got your choice
EDL	00:19:18,143	00:19:19,167	| IOT179 |	16 million colors
EDL	00:19:19,679	00:19:22,239	| IOT179 |	The nice thing about these you can control each
EDL	00:19:22,751	00:19:23,519	| IOT179 |	Color
EDL	00:19:23,519	00:19:25,311	| IOT179 |	Honeyspot individually
EDL	00:19:25,311	00:19:29,151	| IOT179 |	So I kind of celebrating Christmas for example with one red and one green eye
EDL	00:19:29,919	00:19:34,271	| IOT179 |	Last night which everybody was walking by going what are you doing and I said okay I'll put it back to White
EDL	00:19:34,271	00:19:36,831	| IOT179 |	So you got all your choice of the colors and regular white
EDL	00:19:37,343	00:19:43,487	| IOT179 |	Set up pretty easy I like how they've done that they've made a wiring heavy duty and these connectors will you
EDL	00:19:43,999	00:19:45,279	| IOT179 |	Connect and
EDL	00:19:45,279	00:19:46,559	| IOT179 |	Screw in the
EDL	00:19:46,559	00:19:47,327	| IOT179 |	1
EDL	00:19:47,327	00:19:51,935	| IOT179 |	Wire to the next wire it's very simple you cannot not do it correctly it's impossible to do wrong
EDL	00:19:51,935	00:19:53,471	| IOT179 |	So that part is easy
EDL	00:19:53,471	00:19:55,263	| IOT179 |	Is about 15 ft in between each
EDL	00:19:55,263	00:19:56,543	| IOT179 |	Anywhere
EDL	00:19:56,543	00:19:57,311	| IOT179 |	Scrapy
EDL	00:19:57,311	00:19:59,615	| IOT179 |	However I don't know maybe it's my home
EDL	00:19:59,615	00:20:00,895	| IOT179 |	I could not
EDL	00:20:00,895	00:20:01,663	| IOT179 |	Connect this
EDL	00:20:01,663	00:20:04,479	| IOT179 |	2eather matinee
EDL	00:20:04,479	00:20:05,247	| IOT179 |	Google assist
EDL	00:20:05,759	00:20:07,551	| IOT179 |	I was successful with
EDL	00:20:07,551	00:20:08,575	| IOT179 |	Siri and
EDL	00:20:08,575	00:20:09,087	| IOT179 |	Home Care
EDL	00:20:09,599	00:20:13,183	| IOT179 |	So that worked out fine but I don't know why I could not connect this
EDL	00:20:13,183	00:20:15,743	| IOT179 |	True either my other assistants for my wake up
EDL	00:20:15,743	00:20:16,255	| IOT179 |	So
EDL	00:20:16,767	00:20:21,375	| IOT179 |	Not sure this requires the Philips Hue Bridge which is not included so hopefully you already have one
EDL	00:20:21,375	00:20:23,167	| IOT179 |	If not I can take over about 60 bucks
EDL	00:20:23,167	00:20:26,239	| IOT179 |	And pre-teen just like any other
EDL	00:20:26,239	00:20:28,543	| IOT179 |	Set of bulbs you know it's very similar just meant for outdoors
EDL	00:20:29,567	00:20:31,359	| IOT179 |	And you had a hue Bridge
EDL	00:20:33,151	00:20:36,223	| IOT179 |	I do have a Hubert sent to me all these are loaner units yes
EDL	00:20:36,223	00:20:37,759	| IOT179 |	One Challenge
EDL	00:20:38,271	00:20:44,159	| IOT179 |	That I had during setup I said it was easy and it was but for some reason not the bridge but the bulbs themselves
EDL	00:20:44,159	00:20:45,183	| IOT179 |	Needed a firmware up
EDL	00:20:45,183	00:20:48,255	| IOT179 |	Update and it said right in the app this could take up to an hour
EDL	00:20:48,255	00:20:51,583	| IOT179 |	And I told you say so you're like I haven't felt I'm sorry quick
EDL	00:20:51,583	00:20:53,375	| IOT179 |	It wasn't quick it was like 30 minutes
EDL	00:20:53,887	00:20:59,519	| IOT179 |	30 minutes to get that firmware update pushed over I guess because of the zigbee connection
EDL	00:21:01,055	00:21:01,823	| IOT179 |	Yes signius
EDL	00:21:04,383	00:21:07,967	| IOT179 |	Is that happened but that is a constant Source actually for me
EDL	00:21:07,967	00:21:08,735	| IOT179 |	With my shoes
EDL	00:21:08,735	00:21:09,759	| IOT179 |	I very rarely going
EDL	00:21:09,759	00:21:10,527	| IOT179 |	NBA app
EDL	00:21:10,527	00:21:11,295	| IOT179 |	Cuz I have home
EDL	00:21:11,295	00:21:12,319	| IOT179 |	Factory automated
EDL	00:21:12,319	00:21:14,879	| IOT179 |	So it is inevitable that when I want to do something
EDL	00:21:15,391	00:21:16,159	| IOT179 |	Like a little
EDL	00:21:16,159	00:21:16,928	| IOT179 |	Fancy
EDL	00:21:16,928	00:21:18,208	| IOT179 |	I turned it the app
EDL	00:21:18,208	00:21:20,000	| IOT179 |	Inevitably there is an update
EDL	00:21:20,000	00:21:20,512	| IOT179 |	Waiting for me
EDL	00:21:21,024	00:21:22,816	| IOT179 |	And that I can't do what I want to do
EDL	00:21:22,816	00:21:23,584	| IOT179 |	Until I
EDL	00:21:23,584	00:21:24,352	| IOT179 |	Download
EDL	00:21:24,352	00:21:25,120	| IOT179 |	The update
EDL	00:21:25,120	00:21:28,704	| IOT179 |	I kind of wish those were automatic I understand why they might not be
EDL	00:21:28,704	00:21:30,752	| IOT179 |	Because sometimes when they do an update the lights to flash
EDL	00:21:31,264	00:21:36,128	| IOT179 |	For example dated at 2 a.m. and I was sleeping in my lights only flash tan I would be
EDL	00:21:36,640	00:21:38,688	| IOT179 |	Upset so I can get where like
EDL	00:21:38,688	00:21:41,248	| IOT179 |	As a manufacturer there when do we let the
EDL	00:21:41,248	00:21:44,320	| IOT179 |	Control passed to the user versus us doing it
EDL	00:21:44,832	00:21:45,856	| IOT179 |	But it is
EDL	00:21:46,368	00:21:47,648	| IOT179 |	And that is a long time
EDL	00:21:47,648	00:21:49,440	| IOT179 |	And speaking of frustrating
EDL	00:21:49,440	00:21:50,720	| IOT179 |	Let's talk about some frustration
EDL	00:21:52,000	00:21:53,536	| IOT179 |	So this week I have had
EDL	00:21:54,048	00:21:56,352	| IOT179 |	Two devices do software update
EDL	00:21:56,352	00:21:57,888	| IOT179 |	Broken functionality
EDL	00:21:59,168	00:21:59,680	| IOT179 |	It makes me sad
EDL	00:22:00,192	00:22:00,960	| IOT179 |	The first is my Tesla
EDL	00:22:01,472	00:22:01,984	| IOT179 |	I don't know what
EDL	00:22:02,496	00:22:04,544	| IOT179 |	There is some update and now
EDL	00:22:04,544	00:22:05,824	| IOT179 |	My garage door won't
EDL	00:22:05,824	00:22:06,592	| IOT179 |	Open the Homelink
EDL	00:22:06,592	00:22:07,872	| IOT179 |	Functionality does not work on
EDL	00:22:08,384	00:22:09,920	| IOT179 |	And I can't reprogram it
EDL	00:22:09,920	00:22:10,432	| IOT179 |	I can't do anything
EDL	00:22:11,200	00:22:11,968	| IOT179 |	And so basically
EDL	00:22:12,736	00:22:16,064	| IOT179 |	This is very much a first world problem probably a one percenter problem
EDL	00:22:16,064	00:22:17,856	| IOT179 |	Not actually 1-percenter but
EDL	00:22:17,856	00:22:19,136	| IOT179 |	I get this is not something
EDL	00:22:19,136	00:22:20,160	| IOT179 |	Is attic about
EDL	00:22:20,160	00:22:21,952	| IOT179 |	I don't have to use my garage door opener
EDL	00:22:21,952	00:22:24,512	| IOT179 |	My car does not automatically open the garage door anymore
EDL	00:22:26,048	00:22:26,816	| IOT179 |	Because
EDL	00:22:26,816	00:22:28,096	| IOT179 |	Can a lot of money for this car
EDL	00:22:29,120	00:22:30,656	| IOT179 |	I don't really have a lot of recoil
EDL	00:22:30,656	00:22:32,704	| IOT179 |	Of course I called the Tesla people in there going to
EDL	00:22:32,704	00:22:33,728	| IOT179 |	I'll look into it but
EDL	00:22:33,728	00:22:37,056	| IOT179 |	It's a little frustrating to have something work one day and then the next.
EDL	00:22:38,592	00:22:40,896	| IOT179 |	Yeah software updates in general it's
EDL	00:22:40,896	00:22:47,296	| IOT179 |	Hit or miss you know you'd hope things are tested but is every single function tested somebody test the Homelink feature
EDL	00:22:47,296	00:22:50,368	| IOT179 |	Probably not because it changes are likely not related
EDL	00:22:50,368	00:22:52,672	| IOT179 |	To it but something broke something is what it sounds like
EDL	00:22:53,184	00:22:54,208	| IOT179 |	So the other asp
EDL	00:22:55,232	00:22:56,000	| IOT179 |	Is
EDL	00:22:56,000	00:22:58,304	| IOT179 |	Frustrating is my June oven
EDL	00:22:58,304	00:23:00,096	| IOT179 |	Y'all my June oven
EDL	00:23:00,096	00:23:01,632	| IOT179 |	The device I thought could do no wrong
EDL	00:23:02,144	00:23:03,168	| IOT179 |	And I still love it but
EDL	00:23:03,680	00:23:05,472	| IOT179 |	It didn't update to add some
EDL	00:23:05,984	00:23:09,824	| IOT179 |	Actually really good functionality that's more instructions for people like where to put the
EDL	00:23:09,824	00:23:11,616	| IOT179 |	The temperature probe when you're trying to cook
EDL	00:23:11,616	00:23:12,640	| IOT179 |	It shows you a picture
EDL	00:23:13,152	00:23:13,920	| IOT179 |	Nice
EDL	00:23:13,920	00:23:15,200	| IOT179 |	Because some people that were like
EDL	00:23:15,200	00:23:16,736	| IOT179 |	My food isn't done and I'm like
EDL	00:23:16,736	00:23:20,576	| IOT179 |	Kitchen start at deeply enough in the right spot and they're like no insert the probe
EDL	00:23:21,088	00:23:23,136	| IOT179 |	So that was good but somehow
EDL	00:23:23,648	00:23:24,416	| IOT179 |	I don't know how
EDL	00:23:24,416	00:23:25,696	| IOT179 |	It no longer recognizes
EDL	00:23:25,696	00:23:26,464	| IOT179 |	Does my toast
EDL	00:23:26,464	00:23:27,488	| IOT179 |	My brand of bread
EDL	00:23:27,488	00:23:30,048	| IOT179 |	So it keeps telling me I put my bread in the oven
EDL	00:23:30,048	00:23:30,560	| IOT179 |	To toast it
EDL	00:23:31,072	00:23:31,840	| IOT179 |	And it's like
EDL	00:23:31,840	00:23:33,376	| IOT179 |	Is a strudel or a poptart
EDL	00:23:35,936	00:23:40,800	| IOT179 |	Is Pop-Tarts and salmon one of the other cuz they're both kind of square
EDL	00:23:40,800	00:23:41,312	| IOT179 |	Oh yeah yeah
EDL	00:23:41,824	00:23:44,128	| IOT179 |	So it's not strudel it's not Pop-Tarts
EDL	00:23:44,128	00:23:45,920	| IOT179 |	It's toast and it used to recognize it
EDL	00:23:45,920	00:23:47,968	| IOT179 |	It needs to be all cool if you like oh
EDL	00:23:47,968	00:23:49,248	| IOT179 |	The bread and
EDL	00:23:49,248	00:23:51,040	| IOT179 |	Four pieces of it do you want me to toast
EDL	00:23:51,040	00:23:51,552	| IOT179 |	Lately or
EDL	00:23:52,320	00:23:53,344	| IOT179 |	Medium or whatever
EDL	00:23:53,344	00:23:54,368	| IOT179 |	But now I have to press
EDL	00:23:55,648	00:23:56,416	| IOT179 |	Again
EDL	00:23:56,416	00:23:57,696	| IOT179 |	Not the end of the world
EDL	00:23:57,696	00:23:58,464	| IOT179 |	Nobody
EDL	00:23:58,464	00:24:02,048	| IOT179 |	But it's not functioning the way you expect as you are was functioning
EDL	00:24:02,048	00:24:03,072	| IOT179 |	Totally agree
EDL	00:24:03,072	00:24:07,424	| IOT179 |	I'm going to take a wild guess here though because I actually had a problem with my June oven as well Reese
EDL	00:24:08,960	00:24:12,544	| IOT179 |	Mine was not preheating anything you would literally
EDL	00:24:12,544	00:24:14,592	| IOT179 |	Set a temperature in normally would say
EDL	00:24:14,592	00:24:15,360	| IOT179 |	Pre-heating
EDL	00:24:15,360	00:24:16,896	| IOT179 |	But it just wasn't preheating
EDL	00:24:16,896	00:24:17,920	| IOT179 |	They would just start cooking
EDL	00:24:18,432	00:24:21,504	| IOT179 |	And that's not good because that's not the right temperature yet
EDL	00:24:21,504	00:24:24,832	| IOT179 |	The good thing about the June there support people are fantastic
EDL	00:24:24,832	00:24:26,368	| IOT179 |	Tandoori over there help me out
EDL	00:24:27,904	00:24:34,304	| IOT179 |	They're all good they're all good but somehow I always get to where the thing is they can actually
EDL	00:24:34,304	00:24:35,328	| IOT179 |	Delete with your permission
EDL	00:24:35,328	00:24:36,864	| IOT179 |	Go and look at the logs
EDL	00:24:36,864	00:24:37,632	| IOT179 |	Of
EDL	00:24:37,632	00:24:39,680	| IOT179 |	The oven see everything that happened
EDL	00:24:39,680	00:24:44,544	| IOT179 |	Which is awesome for finding problems and they found a problem with one of my heating elements one time before and
EDL	00:24:44,544	00:24:46,336	| IOT179 |	Literally just sent me a brand new oven
EDL	00:24:46,336	00:24:48,896	| IOT179 |	You know they paid to send that and send back the other one
EDL	00:24:48,896	00:24:51,200	| IOT179 |	So they found that out from the logs in this case
EDL	00:24:51,712	00:24:54,784	| IOT179 |	The problem that I had anymore wondering if it's related
EDL	00:24:54,784	00:24:56,320	| IOT179 |	Christine
EDL	00:24:56,320	00:24:58,368	| IOT179 |	Camera up top of the oven
EDL	00:24:58,368	00:25:00,416	| IOT179 |	Gets eventually covered with
EDL	00:25:00,416	00:25:00,928	| IOT179 |	Stuff
EDL	00:25:03,488	00:25:09,632	| IOT179 |	You have to at least clean the camera off and I'll tell you why because the June my June was functioning as
EDL	00:25:09,632	00:25:11,936	| IOT179 |	Design it doesn't see any food
EDL	00:25:11,936	00:25:13,984	| IOT179 |	In there that's how it goes to preheat
EDL	00:25:14,496	00:25:19,360	| IOT179 |	Because they were struts on the camera said we must be something here I don't know what it is but
EDL	00:25:19,360	00:25:20,128	| IOT179 |	Let's start cooking
EDL	00:25:20,640	00:25:21,408	| IOT179 |	So
EDL	00:25:21,408	00:25:23,200	| IOT179 |	That's what happened to me and sure enough
EDL	00:25:23,968	00:25:24,992	| IOT179 |	After checking the log
EDL	00:25:25,504	00:25:28,064	| IOT179 |	We determined that was my issue I clean off the camera
EDL	00:25:28,064	00:25:29,600	| IOT179 |	And I got my preheat function back
EDL	00:25:29,600	00:25:34,976	| IOT179 |	100% of the time so it could be the food ID is not quite right because you're not giving it
EDL	00:25:34,976	00:25:35,488	| IOT179 |	Best data
EDL	00:25:36,000	00:25:39,072	| IOT179 |	OKC and that's a very analog problem
EDL	00:25:39,584	00:25:40,608	| IOT179 |	I love it okay
EDL	00:25:40,608	00:25:42,912	| IOT179 |	D'usse try that and then go down the South
EDL	00:25:43,936	00:25:45,216	| IOT179 |	And I was thinking
EDL	00:25:45,216	00:25:46,240	| IOT179 |	Another aspect of
EDL	00:25:46,752	00:25:47,776	| IOT179 |	Especially with
EDL	00:25:47,776	00:25:51,104	| IOT179 |	And you'll see because I have the CEO of chefsteps
EDL	00:25:51,104	00:25:51,872	| IOT179 |	Which makes the
EDL	00:25:51,872	00:25:52,896	| IOT179 |	Joule sous vide
EDL	00:25:52,896	00:25:55,712	| IOT179 |	I was thinking about some of their recipes so
EDL	00:25:55,712	00:25:56,480	| IOT179 |	June
EDL	00:25:56,480	00:25:58,528	| IOT179 |	Creates these pre-selected
EDL	00:25:58,528	00:25:59,552	| IOT179 |	Recipes for you so you just
EDL	00:25:59,552	00:26:01,088	| IOT179 |	Pop salmon in and say
EDL	00:26:01,088	00:26:03,136	| IOT179 |	Hadist I want it done and it just does it
EDL	00:26:03,136	00:26:05,184	| IOT179 |	But those things get tweaked over time
EDL	00:26:05,696	00:26:08,000	| IOT179 |	I was thinking band what if I really liked
EDL	00:26:08,000	00:26:11,328	| IOT179 |	One way they cooked it and they change that recipe over time and then
EDL	00:26:11,328	00:26:14,144	| IOT179 |	Suddenly It's just slightly different and maybe not as good
EDL	00:26:14,144	00:26:15,680	| IOT179 |	And you may not there's not a lot of
EDL	00:26:15,680	00:26:16,448	| IOT179 |	Transparency
EDL	00:26:16,960	00:26:17,728	| IOT179 |	So
EDL	00:26:17,728	00:26:19,264	| IOT179 |	You may just be like huh
EDL	00:26:19,264	00:26:20,032	| IOT179 |	What's happened here
EDL	00:26:20,032	00:26:21,056	| IOT179 |	I was thinking about that
EDL	00:26:21,056	00:26:22,336	| IOT179 |	Because I was thinking about changing
EDL	00:26:23,104	00:26:27,456	| IOT179 |	The sous-vide and suddenly I was like I kind of have lost all control over how things
EDL	00:26:27,456	00:26:28,224	| IOT179 |	Thanks might taste
EDL	00:26:28,224	00:26:31,040	| IOT179 |	But most of it is better so that's an okay tradeoff
EDL	00:26:31,040	00:26:31,808	| IOT179 |	I don't know these are things
EDL	00:26:32,320	00:26:36,672	| IOT179 |	Yeah I know you're right it's not transparent because the algorithms get tweet
EDL	00:26:36,672	00:26:38,720	| IOT179 |	Is all the information from device owners
EDL	00:26:38,720	00:26:40,768	| IOT179 |	It's crowdsource on the cooking results and such
EDL	00:26:40,768	00:26:41,536	| IOT179 |	So
EDL	00:26:41,536	00:26:45,120	| IOT179 |	I guess when we took a stake it tastes the same for everybody as a June oven
EDL	00:26:45,120	00:26:46,144	| IOT179 |	Cooking a steak
EDL	00:26:46,144	00:26:49,472	| IOT179 |	And I would love I'm pretty sure I suggested it on the
EDL	00:26:49,472	00:26:50,496	| IOT179 |	User forum
EDL	00:26:50,496	00:26:52,032	| IOT179 |	He let me save
EDL	00:26:52,032	00:26:53,568	| IOT179 |	The cooking method
EDL	00:26:53,568	00:26:55,104	| IOT179 |	Because that's how I like it
EDL	00:26:55,104	00:27:00,224	| IOT179 |	Right you did it right but all the sudden it changed and all I wanted the way that used to be so let me save that
EDL	00:27:00,224	00:27:00,992	| IOT179 |	Yes
EDL	00:27:00,992	00:27:02,528	| IOT179 |	Basically your own personal rollbacks on
EDL	00:27:03,040	00:27:04,320	| IOT179 |	I like it
EDL	00:27:04,320	00:27:06,880	| IOT179 |	Okay which is only useful for
EDL	00:27:06,880	00:27:08,928	| IOT179 |	Things that are not security-related that's
EDL	00:27:08,928	00:27:09,440	| IOT179 |	Probably have
EDL	00:27:10,720	00:27:11,488	| IOT179 |	You got a patch
EDL	00:27:12,512	00:27:13,280	| IOT179 |	But other than that
EDL	00:27:14,048	00:27:14,816	| IOT179 |	Okay
EDL	00:27:14,816	00:27:16,352	| IOT179 |	Well this was our
EDL	00:27:16,352	00:27:17,888	| IOT179 |	Yes weekly complain session
EDL	00:27:17,888	00:27:19,424	| IOT179 |	We don't usually complain very much but
EDL	00:27:20,192	00:27:21,472	| IOT179 |	Monthly
EDL	00:27:21,472	00:27:23,520	| IOT179 |	So let's go to Riot
EDL	00:27:23,520	00:27:26,848	| IOT179 |	She podcast listener hotline for a question from you guys
EDL	00:27:27,360	00:27:28,640	| IOT179 |	The iot podcast
EDL	00:27:28,640	00:27:30,944	| IOT179 |	Listener hotline is brought to you by Schlage

EDL	00:27:42,208	00:27:43,232	| IOT179 |	6 to 3
EDL	00:27:43,232	00:27:46,304	| IOT179 |	7424 and ask us a question
EDL	00:27:46,304	00:27:47,584	| IOT179 |	And we will
EDL	00:27:47,584	00:27:48,608	| IOT179 |	Are you into the drawing
EDL	00:27:48,608	00:27:53,984	| IOT179 |	This month's drawing actually ends Friday at midnight eastern time so Friday August 31st
EDL	00:27:53,984	00:27:54,752	| IOT179 |	Pikachu
EDL	00:27:54,752	00:27:56,288	| IOT179 |	Basically a day-and-a-half
EDL	00:27:56,288	00:27:57,568	| IOT179 |	Tacoma's and remember
EDL	00:27:57,568	00:27:58,592	| IOT179 |	Smarter homes
EDL	00:27:58,592	00:27:59,360	| IOT179 |	Starfish leg
EDL	00:27:59,872	00:28:04,480	| IOT179 |	As of last week we answered a question from the a listener about tracking his
EDL	00:28:04,992	00:28:09,344	| IOT179 |	And we gave many options but we kind of forgot a really obvious one in
EDL	00:28:09,344	00:28:10,880	| IOT179 |	A bunch of guys called us on it
EDL	00:28:10,880	00:28:11,648	| IOT179 |	So thank you
EDL	00:28:11,648	00:28:12,928	| IOT179 |	We forgot about life
EDL	00:28:13,952	00:28:20,352	| IOT179 |	Which is a really good app that it is an app that you can put on your phone it also integrates with lots of services like if this
EDL	00:28:20,352	00:28:23,168	| IOT179 |	Send that it has a deal with BMW has a deal with some
EDL	00:28:23,680	00:28:28,032	| IOT179 |	Security companies in basically this app lets you see where your kids are
EDL	00:28:28,032	00:28:28,800	| IOT179 |	Where any of your family
EDL	00:28:29,568	00:28:32,896	| IOT179 |	And it can be really useful and if you use it with f
EDL	00:28:32,896	00:28:37,248	| IOT179 |	When your kids get within your house range they can actually give you an alert
EDL	00:28:37,248	00:28:40,576	| IOT179 |	So David include some nice pictures like a group chat
EDL	00:28:40,576	00:28:42,112	| IOT179 |	Fear family and such within the app
EDL	00:28:42,624	00:28:43,392	| IOT179 |	So
EDL	00:28:43,392	00:28:45,184	| IOT179 |	Guys we didn't talk about that
EDL	00:28:45,184	00:28:48,000	| IOT179 |	Because it's not a thing but we should have because it does talk to things
EDL	00:28:48,512	00:28:49,280	| IOT179 |	What is a thing
EDL	00:28:49,792	00:28:50,304	| IOT179 |	Is the thing on your phone
EDL	00:28:51,584	00:28:52,352	| IOT179 |	Okay
EDL	00:28:52,352	00:28:54,656	| IOT179 |	So this week's question comes to us from
EDL	00:28:55,168	00:28:55,680	| IOT179 |	Donna
EDL	00:28:56,192	00:28:56,960	| IOT179 |	Hey guys
EDL	00:28:57,472	00:28:57,984	| IOT179 |	Doncic
EDL	00:28:59,776	00:29:01,056	| IOT179 |	My question for you is
EDL	00:29:01,568	00:29:02,848	| IOT179 |	Is it against
EDL	00:29:02,848	00:29:03,872	| IOT179 |	I'm wondering
EDL	00:29:03,872	00:29:05,920	| IOT179 |	Is there something you can think of
EDL	00:29:05,920	00:29:07,456	| IOT179 |	I could either make
EDL	00:29:07,456	00:29:08,224	| IOT179 |	Or by
EDL	00:29:08,736	00:29:09,504	| IOT179 |	The budget of
EDL	00:29:09,504	00:29:10,784	| IOT179 |	Lesson about fish
EDL	00:29:10,784	00:29:11,552	| IOT179 |	Dollars
EDL	00:29:11,552	00:29:12,832	| IOT179 |	Love you good gifts
EDL	00:29:12,832	00:29:16,160	| IOT179 |	For someone who is moving into a college dorm
EDL	00:29:17,440	00:29:18,720	| IOT179 |	So the money is leaving home
EDL	00:29:19,744	00:29:20,768	| IOT179 |	Moving into a dorm
EDL	00:29:23,584	00:29:26,656	| IOT179 |	I'd love to hear your ideas
EDL	00:29:27,424	00:29:27,936	| IOT179 |	Project
EDL	00:29:29,984	00:29:30,496	| IOT179 |	Show
EDL	00:29:31,520	00:29:37,920	| IOT179 |	Oh. Free question and Kevin actually just wrote a story last week about how to out
EDL	00:29:37,920	00:29:42,016	| IOT179 |	Take your kids to worm with some smart stuff so you should definitely check that out
EDL	00:29:42,016	00:29:44,832	| IOT179 |	But it sounds like this isn't your kids are just trying to be a thot
EDL	00:29:44,832	00:29:45,344	| IOT179 |	4% witch
EDL	00:29:45,856	00:29:46,624	| IOT179 |	Amazing
EDL	00:29:46,624	00:29:49,696	| IOT179 |	So we try to come up with some equally thoughtful
EDL	00:29:49,696	00:29:50,976	| IOT179 |	Ideas for you that are
EDL	00:29:50,976	00:29:51,744	| IOT179 |	Beyond Justice
EDL	00:29:53,536	00:29:54,304	| IOT179 |	Plant sow
EDL	00:29:54,816	00:29:56,352	| IOT179 |	Kevin came up with
EDL	00:29:56,352	00:29:57,120	| IOT179 |	I really don't want
EDL	00:29:57,120	00:30:01,728	| IOT179 |	Well it's a potentially good one it depends on the person that you're buying for
EDL	00:30:01,728	00:30:04,032	| IOT179 |	This past weekend I move my
EDL	00:30:04,032	00:30:06,848	| IOT179 |	Daughter into Kutztown University for her
EDL	00:30:06,848	00:30:09,152	| IOT179 |	First-year College one thing I noticed
EDL	00:30:09,152	00:30:10,432	| IOT179 |	A lot of the kids
EDL	00:30:10,432	00:30:12,480	| IOT179 |	Walking around with water bottles
EDL	00:30:12,992	00:30:18,624	| IOT179 |	There was a hot day I will say that but you know they weren't carrying a Starbucks cup they were carrying their own water bottle
EDL	00:30:18,624	00:30:24,000	| IOT179 |	So I thought you know what Stacy has a bunch of water bottles I'll bet you there's an inexpensive one
EDL	00:30:24,000	00:30:29,632	| IOT179 |	It's kind of connected to help you track your hydration for under fifty bucks and I think you found one
EDL	00:30:29,632	00:30:31,168	| IOT179 |	It is called the hydrate
EDL	00:30:31,168	00:30:32,192	| IOT179 |	Hi
EDL	00:30:32,192	00:30:33,472	| IOT179 |	Dra.
EDL	00:30:33,472	00:30:34,496	| IOT179 |	Spark
EDL	00:30:34,496	00:30:35,520	| IOT179 |	To. O
EDL	00:30:35,520	00:30:36,800	| IOT179 |	There are two of these
EDL	00:30:37,312	00:30:38,848	| IOT179 |	One is $50
EDL	00:30:38,848	00:30:39,872	| IOT179 |	But that's right
EDL	00:30:39,872	00:30:43,456	| IOT179 |	The edge of your price range there so I say go for the $45 one
EDL	00:30:43,968	00:30:44,992	| IOT179 |	Is Bluetooth
EDL	00:30:44,992	00:30:46,528	| IOT179 |	It links to an app
EDL	00:30:46,528	00:30:47,296	| IOT179 |	And it
EDL	00:30:47,296	00:30:47,808	| IOT179 |	The Lowe's
EDL	00:30:48,320	00:30:49,600	| IOT179 |	When you need to drink more
EDL	00:30:49,600	00:30:53,440	| IOT179 |	So it starts blowing and it also integrates with Fitbit Apple watch
EDL	00:30:53,440	00:30:53,952	| IOT179 |	Other things
EDL	00:30:54,464	00:30:56,768	| IOT179 |	So basically as you drink
EDL	00:30:56,768	00:31:00,608	| IOT179 |	That water's going to get transferred into your Fitbit data and
EDL	00:31:00,608	00:31:02,912	| IOT179 |	As you need to drink it'll start
EDL	00:31:02,912	00:31:09,312	| IOT179 |	Chloe which actually might be kind of disruptive so think about it in a darkened classroom or movie theater you may want to turn that glow
EDL	00:31:09,312	00:31:10,336	| IOT179 |	Low functionality off
EDL	00:31:10,848	00:31:11,616	| IOT179 |	Oh I wouldn't
EDL	00:31:16,736	00:31:20,320	| IOT179 |	I got a battery-powered Hue Spotlight I'm taking with me to the movies
EDL	00:31:21,344	00:31:26,208	| IOT179 |	So that was one option another I was looking for a bluetooth light bulb
EDL	00:31:26,720	00:31:27,744	| IOT179 |	That had a remote
EDL	00:31:28,256	00:31:31,072	| IOT179 |	Because I thought it'd be nice to have a
EDL	00:31:31,072	00:31:31,840	| IOT179 |	Light bulb
EDL	00:31:31,840	00:31:34,144	| IOT179 |	That you could put in something like a lamp
EDL	00:31:34,144	00:31:35,680	| IOT179 |	And be able to turn it off
EDL	00:31:35,680	00:31:37,216	| IOT179 |	Even if the switch is across the
EDL	00:31:37,216	00:31:37,984	| IOT179 |	The real or
EDL	00:31:38,496	00:31:39,264	| IOT179 |	At night
EDL	00:31:39,264	00:31:41,312	| IOT179 |	But I couldn't find a Bluetooth one that had a remote
EDL	00:31:41,312	00:31:42,080	| IOT179 |	So if anyone else
EDL	00:31:42,080	00:31:42,848	| IOT179 |	Found one
EDL	00:31:42,848	00:31:46,432	| IOT179 |	Let me know I did find some on Amazon but I can't say that
EDL	00:31:46,432	00:31:50,784	| IOT179 |	Use them or heard of anybody that uses them and almost all of them they did have remotes
EDL	00:31:50,784	00:31:54,624	| IOT179 |	But almost all of them also had a speaker built in which actually might be nicer
EDL	00:31:54,624	00:31:55,648	| IOT179 |	Tazewell for playing
EDL	00:31:55,648	00:31:56,416	| IOT179 |	Some music
EDL	00:31:56,416	00:31:58,720	| IOT179 |	But I cannot speak to the quality of the morning like that
EDL	00:32:00,512	00:32:01,792	| IOT179 |	So I found
EDL	00:32:01,792	00:32:02,816	| IOT179 |	I recommend
EDL	00:32:02,816	00:32:03,584	| IOT179 |	The
EDL	00:32:03,584	00:32:04,608	| IOT179 |	Ikea
EDL	00:32:04,608	00:32:05,632	| IOT179 |	Tradfri
EDL	00:32:05,632	00:32:06,912	| IOT179 |	For $50 you can
EDL	00:32:06,912	00:32:08,192	| IOT179 |	Barely get away with it
EDL	00:32:08,192	00:32:10,240	| IOT179 |	So there is a dimmer and a bulb
EDL	00:32:10,240	00:32:12,288	| IOT179 |	And then you have to buy the hub for $30
EDL	00:32:12,800	00:32:14,848	| IOT179 |	If that appeals to you
EDL	00:32:14,848	00:32:16,896	| IOT179 |	It's going to have a Wi-Fi component I was trying to avoid
EDL	00:32:18,176	00:32:19,456	| IOT179 |	But I couldn't
EDL	00:32:19,456	00:32:25,600	| IOT179 |	So those are the two things that we thought might be a good gift for someone going away to college that are under $50
EDL	00:32:26,112	00:32:29,440	| IOT179 |	We also found one other thing that you may love or hate
EDL	00:32:29,440	00:32:30,464	| IOT179 |	T Phillips
EDL	00:32:30,464	00:32:32,768	| IOT179 |	Makes a wake up light alarm clock
EDL	00:32:32,768	00:32:33,280	| IOT179 |	With a sunrise
EDL	00:32:34,048	00:32:35,584	| IOT179 |	It also has a clock in there
EDL	00:32:35,584	00:32:36,608	| IOT179 |	So this is
EDL	00:32:36,608	00:32:39,424	| IOT179 |	About 50 bucks on Amazon there are more expensive models
EDL	00:32:40,192	00:32:45,056	| IOT179 |	Colors that basically you set your alarm and it can make noise but it doesn't have to
EDL	00:32:45,056	00:32:46,336	| IOT179 |	It can also
EDL	00:32:46,336	00:32:47,616	| IOT179 |	That is that it would
EDL	00:32:47,616	00:32:48,128	| IOT179 |	Light up
EDL	00:32:48,640	00:32:51,200	| IOT179 |	Instead so this might be good if you have a roommate
EDL	00:32:51,200	00:32:51,712	| IOT179 |	That you know
EDL	00:32:52,224	00:32:53,248	| IOT179 |	Doesn't like
EDL	00:32:53,248	00:32:55,040	| IOT179 |	To wake up as early as you do
EDL	00:32:55,040	00:32:58,368	| IOT179 |	And it might also be a nice way for someone who may not be used
EDL	00:32:58,368	00:33:00,416	| IOT179 |	Used to getting up in the morning on their own
EDL	00:33:00,416	00:33:01,440	| IOT179 |	Kind of
EDL	00:33:01,440	00:33:05,536	| IOT179 |	Set up an alarm that's loud and also a force function with the lady
EDL	00:33:05,536	00:33:06,048	| IOT179 |	I don't know
EDL	00:33:06,560	00:33:07,328	| IOT179 |	There's another ID
EDL	00:33:08,352	00:33:09,888	| IOT179 |	Okay Donna I hope that helps
EDL	00:33:09,888	00:33:10,400	| IOT179 |	End
EDL	00:33:10,912	00:33:11,936	| IOT179 |	Guys if you guys think of any
EDL	00:33:12,960	00:33:13,728	| IOT179 |	What is that
EDL	00:33:13,728	00:33:14,240	| IOT179 |	All right
EDL	00:33:14,752	00:33:15,776	| IOT179 |	I think it is
EDL	00:33:15,776	00:33:17,568	| IOT179 |	Now time for us to
EDL	00:33:17,568	00:33:18,848	| IOT179 |	Take a break for a bit
EDL	00:33:18,848	00:33:22,688	| IOT179 |	Message from our sponsor and stick around because after that we are going to be talking to
EDL	00:33:22,688	00:33:25,504	| IOT179 |	To Chris Young the CEO of chefsteps
EDL	00:33:25,504	00:33:29,344	| IOT179 |	About why he didn't put it in her face on the Joule sous vide cooker
EDL	00:33:29,344	00:33:31,136	| IOT179 |	We're going to tell you about what the heck sous vide
EDL	00:33:31,136	00:33:32,160	| IOT179 |	Actually is
EDL	00:33:32,160	00:33:32,928	| IOT179 |	And
EDL	00:33:32,928	00:33:34,720	| IOT179 |	His decision to
EDL	00:33:34,720	00:33:37,024	| IOT179 |	Go it alone as opposed to licensing
EDL	00:33:37,024	00:33:38,304	| IOT179 |	With large Appliance vendor
EDL	00:33:38,816	00:33:39,584	| IOT179 |	Aldis
EDL	00:33:39,584	00:33:40,864	| IOT179 |	And more in a moment
EDL	00:33:41,888	00:33:48,288	| IOT179 |	Hey everyone we are taking a break from this week's Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor this week
EDL	00:33:48,288	00:33:49,056	| IOT179 |	Cancer is a
EDL	00:33:49,056	00:33:49,824	| IOT179 |	Pharaoh
EDL	00:33:49,824	00:33:51,104	| IOT179 |	And I have Joe Britt
EDL	00:33:51,104	00:33:52,384	| IOT179 |	CEO of a feral here
EDL	00:33:53,664	00:33:55,968	| IOT179 |	To get started why don't you describe a pharaoh for
EDL	00:33:56,736	00:33:59,296	| IOT179 |	A pharaoh is a sensor to Cloud IO
EDL	00:33:59,296	00:34:00,064	| IOT179 |	Party platform
EDL	00:34:00,064	00:34:02,368	| IOT179 |	We really take a lot of pride in
EDL	00:34:02,368	00:34:04,160	| IOT179 |	The fact that it really just
EDL	00:34:04,160	00:34:10,048	| IOT179 |	Works our customers tell us that it's the best choice for them for a fantastic end-user experience
EDL	00:34:10,560	00:34:12,352	| IOT179 |	And great developer productivity
EDL	00:34:12,352	00:34:13,888	| IOT179 |	I think a lot of this comes
EDL	00:34:13,888	00:34:18,240	| IOT179 |	From the fact that a bunch of acid of pharaoh came from places like apple nest
EDL	00:34:18,240	00:34:24,640	| IOT179 |	Google Android or Netflix and we really wanted to bring the best of engineering and design disciplines from the
EDL	00:34:24,640	00:34:25,408	| IOT179 |	Those previous
EDL	00:34:25,408	00:34:27,200	| IOT179 |	Experiences into iot
EDL	00:34:27,200	00:34:32,832	| IOT179 |	We've been talking for the last few weeks about a pharaoh and how some of its customers such as Kenmore and D-Link
EDL	00:34:32,832	00:34:35,392	| IOT179 |	Camping using your software to cut 80%
EDL	00:34:35,392	00:34:36,672	| IOT179 |	Off their time-to-market
EDL	00:34:36,672	00:34:39,744	| IOT179 |	And giving them the ability to reuse 90%
EDL	00:34:39,744	00:34:40,512	| IOT179 |	Of their works
EDL	00:34:40,512	00:34:41,024	| IOT179 |	Someone project
EDL	00:34:41,792	00:34:43,328	| IOT179 |	This is really exceptional
EDL	00:34:43,328	00:34:46,912	| IOT179 |	So let's focus today on what you guys do with the
EDL	00:34:46,912	00:34:48,192	| IOT179 |	Back end of
EDL	00:34:48,192	00:34:48,704	| IOT179 |	Iot system
EDL	00:34:49,216	00:34:52,288	| IOT179 |	You can really think of Artie and three big parts
EDL	00:34:52,800	00:34:54,592	| IOT179 |	There's first the supply chain
EDL	00:34:54,592	00:34:56,128	| IOT179 |	Which is all about the sea
EDL	00:34:56,128	00:34:57,664	| IOT179 |	Security and efficiency
EDL	00:34:57,664	00:34:58,432	| IOT179 |	Actually
EDL	00:34:58,432	00:34:58,944	| IOT179 |	Building a
EDL	00:34:59,456	00:35:00,736	| IOT179 |	Then you've got the
EDL	00:35:00,736	00:35:01,504	| IOT179 |	Device in
EDL	00:35:01,504	00:35:06,624	| IOT179 |	Which has to do with the security and Wade that particular device communicates
EDL	00:35:06,624	00:35:07,904	| IOT179 |	But then we reach the part that you
EDL	00:35:08,672	00:35:09,184	| IOT179 |	The back
EDL	00:35:09,696	00:35:10,720	| IOT179 |	And the backend device
EDL	00:35:11,488	00:35:13,280	| IOT179 |	Is really the engine room of
EDL	00:35:13,280	00:35:15,072	| IOT179 |	The system and it's all about how
EDL	00:35:15,072	00:35:15,584	| IOT179 |	Responsive
EDL	00:35:16,096	00:35:19,936	| IOT179 |	Scalable and how resilient the system is insecurity has to undergo
EDL	00:35:19,936	00:35:20,704	| IOT179 |	And all of that
EDL	00:35:20,704	00:35:23,008	| IOT179 |	Many end-user complaints that we
EDL	00:35:23,008	00:35:25,056	| IOT179 |	We heard can ultimately be traced
EDL	00:35:25,056	00:35:28,896	| IOT179 |	2 problems with the back end the back end is the part that guides the
EDL	00:35:28,896	00:35:35,296	| IOT179 |	Policy and business logic and is triggered by different events that translate ultimately into the vital control
EDL	00:35:35,296	00:35:37,088	| IOT179 |	And asset data for an application
EDL	00:35:37,088	00:35:38,880	| IOT179 |	So what happens to device
EDL	00:35:38,880	00:35:39,648	| IOT179 |	Stata when it arrives
EDL	00:35:40,416	00:35:41,440	| IOT179 |	This is critical
EDL	00:35:41,440	00:35:43,744	| IOT179 |	The data has to be processed instantly
EDL	00:35:43,744	00:35:47,072	| IOT179 |	So the end-user feels like they're just using
EDL	00:35:47,072	00:35:52,192	| IOT179 |	Normal or traditional remote control and he can't be something that takes seconds and seconds to respond
EDL	00:35:52,192	00:35:53,984	| IOT179 |	So we've got to take into account
EDL	00:35:53,984	00:35:55,008	| IOT179 |	Whole round trip
EDL	00:35:55,008	00:35:55,776	| IOT179 |	The traffic
EDL	00:35:55,776	00:35:57,312	| IOT179 |	Plus acting on whatever the
EDL	00:35:57,312	00:35:59,872	| IOT179 |	Particular command was and implementing whatever the
EDL	00:35:59,872	00:36:02,176	| IOT179 |	The policies are there relevant to that command
EDL	00:36:02,176	00:36:03,968	| IOT179 |	We have to squeeze all of this down in
EDL	00:36:03,968	00:36:04,480	| IOT179 |	2 millisecond
EDL	00:36:04,992	00:36:06,016	| IOT179 |	This demands
EDL	00:36:06,016	00:36:07,296	| IOT179 |	I truly elasticum
EDL	00:36:07,296	00:36:10,112	| IOT179 |	Implementation that is extremely optimized
EDL	00:36:10,112	00:36:11,392	| IOT179 |	In terms of processing
EDL	00:36:11,392	00:36:12,160	| IOT179 |	Achieve that
EDL	00:36:12,160	00:36:14,208	| IOT179 |	The data also has
EDL	00:36:14,208	00:36:15,488	| IOT179 |	Be structured properly
EDL	00:36:15,488	00:36:19,584	| IOT179 |	So that once we retrieve it we can easily feed it into different Analytics
EDL	00:36:19,584	00:36:20,864	| IOT179 |	Machine learning tool
EDL	00:36:20,864	00:36:22,912	| IOT179 |	And then we have to scale all of that
EDL	00:36:22,912	00:36:23,936	| IOT179 |	Up to thousands
EDL	00:36:23,936	00:36:25,216	| IOT179 |	Millions of devices
EDL	00:36:25,216	00:36:29,824	| IOT179 |	Without sacrificing any of that responsiveness or security then on top of the whole thing
EDL	00:36:30,336	00:36:34,176	| IOT179 |	We have to make it super reliable and that means High availability
EDL	00:36:34,176	00:36:36,480	| IOT179 |	Multi-zone multi cloud implementations
EDL	00:36:36,992	00:36:40,064	| IOT179 |	That sounds like a lot so where can people go to find out more
EDL	00:36:40,576	00:36:41,344	| IOT179 |	In about a pharaoh
EDL	00:36:41,344	00:36:42,368	| IOT179 |	The best place
EDL	00:36:42,368	00:36:44,672	| IOT179 |	To start is a pharaoh.
EDL	00:36:44,672	00:36:45,952	| IOT179 |	Slash go big
EDL	00:36:45,952	00:36:46,720	| IOT179 |	That's

EDL	00:37:05,152	00:37:10,016	| IOT179 |	Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham
EDL	00:37:10,016	00:37:11,040	| IOT179 |	And today's guest
EDL	00:37:11,040	00:37:11,552	| IOT179 |	Is
EDL	00:37:12,320	00:37:13,344	| IOT179 |	Young who is this
EDL	00:37:13,344	00:37:15,136	| IOT179 |	CEO and co-founder at
EDL	00:37:15,136	00:37:15,648	| IOT179 |	Chefsteps
EDL	00:37:16,416	00:37:17,184	| IOT179 |	Hi Chris how are you doing
EDL	00:37:17,696	00:37:18,208	| IOT179 |	I'm doing great
EDL	00:37:18,976	00:37:20,000	| IOT179 |	You're having me on today
EDL	00:37:20,000	00:37:21,024	| IOT179 |	All right
EDL	00:37:21,024	00:37:22,816	| IOT179 |	I am super excited because
EDL	00:37:22,816	00:37:23,584	| IOT179 |	You guys
EDL	00:37:23,584	00:37:25,376	| IOT179 |	Not only are you a recipe site
EDL	00:37:25,376	00:37:26,656	| IOT179 |	But you are also
EDL	00:37:26,656	00:37:28,960	| IOT179 |	The maker of the Joule sous vide
EDL	00:37:28,960	00:37:31,008	| IOT179 |	Booker and I've been playing with us for a while
EDL	00:37:31,520	00:37:35,616	| IOT179 |	Okay let's kick it off with why you guys decided to basic
EDL	00:37:35,616	00:37:37,408	| IOT179 |	Invent a
EDL	00:37:37,408	00:37:38,688	| IOT179 |	Internet connected
EDL	00:37:38,688	00:37:39,200	| IOT179 |	Cooking device
EDL	00:37:40,224	00:37:41,504	| IOT179 |	Sure it's not the most obvious
EDL	00:37:42,016	00:37:45,600	| IOT179 |	Project that supposedly we didn't start as a Huntington recipe
EDL	00:37:45,600	00:37:49,184	| IOT179 |	Late 2011 early 2012 and we had a real Folk
EDL	00:37:49,952	00:37:51,232	| IOT179 |	Modernist approaches
EDL	00:37:51,232	00:37:53,024	| IOT179 |	Cooking because I had been too cooperative.
EDL	00:37:54,048	00:37:54,560	| IOT179 |	We started this
EDL	00:37:55,584	00:37:56,864	| IOT179 |	Videos up on YouTube
EDL	00:37:57,376	00:37:58,656	| IOT179 |	Cookie recipes
EDL	00:37:58,656	00:37:59,680	| IOT179 |	Stuff.com
EDL	00:37:59,680	00:38:00,960	| IOT179 |	And the real point was to see if anyone
EDL	00:38:01,472	00:38:03,008	| IOT179 |	Interested if anybody you know
EDL	00:38:03,520	00:38:04,032	| IOT179 |	Would follow what
EDL	00:38:04,544	00:38:05,824	| IOT179 |	And that was about as far as
EDL	00:38:07,360	00:38:10,432	| IOT179 |	The really good news was it turned out there was a huge Global audience
EDL	00:38:10,432	00:38:11,712	| IOT179 |	Dewberry very quickly
EDL	00:38:11,712	00:38:12,224	| IOT179 |	And a lot of
EDL	00:38:13,248	00:38:15,552	| IOT179 |	Custom content videos
EDL	00:38:15,552	00:38:17,344	| IOT179 |	The information we were providing
EDL	00:38:17,344	00:38:18,368	| IOT179 |	And there was a real
EDL	00:38:19,136	00:38:20,928	| IOT179 |	That we were clearly serving
EDL	00:38:20,928	00:38:24,512	| IOT179 |	Okay before we go any further we should probably tell everybody what sous vide
EDL	00:38:25,792	00:38:29,632	| IOT179 |	Chevy cooking is I think about it is just the way of adding a measured amount of
EDL	00:38:30,144	00:38:32,192	| IOT179 |	A recipe for that food is never older cook
EDL	00:38:32,192	00:38:32,704	| IOT179 |	Or under
EDL	00:38:33,216	00:38:36,032	| IOT179 |	And it's a technique that used and many of the best restaurants
EDL	00:38:36,032	00:38:38,592	| IOT179 |	Around the world and even many restaurants does it surprise you
EDL	00:38:43,200	00:38:48,064	| IOT179 |	Usually in some sort of flexible food grade plastic bag of your vacuum sealed bags
EDL	00:38:48,064	00:38:50,624	| IOT179 |	FoodSaver you didn't put the food into a water bath
EDL	00:38:51,136	00:38:52,160	| IOT179 |	You have some device
EDL	00:38:52,160	00:38:54,464	| IOT179 |	Marquesa Jewel suvee cooker
EDL	00:38:55,488	00:38:56,768	| IOT179 |	Temperature for the doneness
EDL	00:38:56,768	00:38:57,792	| IOT179 |	You want so if
EDL	00:38:57,792	00:39:00,608	| IOT179 |	Do you want your steak medium rare you might put it in the water
EDL	00:39:00,608	00:39:01,632	| IOT179 |	The water might heat up
EDL	00:39:01,632	00:39:08,032	| IOT179 |	Tuesday 122 degrees 124 degrees Fahrenheit
EDL	00:39:08,032	00:39:11,616	| IOT179 |	The water and when you're ready to eat you can take the food out and give it a quick
EDL	00:39:11,616	00:39:15,968	| IOT179 |	Beer and you're going to have a steak this better than I would say probably 95% of all dressed
EDL	00:39:16,480	00:39:17,248	| IOT179 |	You would go to
EDL	00:39:17,248	00:39:21,856	| IOT179 |	Because the food is actually going to have no risk of being overcooked and it's relatively simple
EDL	00:39:21,856	00:39:23,136	| IOT179 |	Okay
EDL	00:39:23,136	00:39:24,672	| IOT179 |	So from the website
EDL	00:39:24,672	00:39:27,488	| IOT179 |	You decided that people are interested especially in sous vide
EDL	00:39:29,536	00:39:31,584	| IOT179 |	Yeah so we decided ultimately
EDL	00:39:31,584	00:39:33,120	| IOT179 |	We recognize it was a real
EDL	00:39:33,120	00:39:34,144	| IOT179 |	I'll need to have a better p
EDL	00:39:34,144	00:39:37,216	| IOT179 |	Piece of sushi Hardware that we could see that no matter how much cost
EDL	00:39:38,240	00:39:40,288	| IOT179 |	After we put in education
EDL	00:39:41,312	00:39:44,640	| IOT179 |	Should we give people the most accurate thermostat
EDL	00:39:44,640	00:39:46,432	| IOT179 |	Ever had in their kitchen before
EDL	00:39:46,432	00:39:47,200	| IOT179 |	The problem is
EDL	00:39:47,200	00:39:47,712	| IOT179 |	Nobody else
EDL	00:39:48,224	00:39:50,272	| IOT179 |	Set it to 2 degrees difference
EDL	00:39:50,272	00:39:52,064	| IOT179 |	A pretty big difference in the final outcome
EDL	00:39:53,600	00:39:54,624	| IOT179 |	Or that chicken
EDL	00:39:54,624	00:39:56,928	| IOT179 |	And you know what we saw was everything
EDL	00:39:56,928	00:39:58,976	| IOT179 |	The time was a direct descendant of Laboratory
EDL	00:39:58,976	00:40:00,768	| IOT179 |	Gadget

EDL	00:40:01,792	00:40:03,072	| IOT179 |	And we need the benefits
EDL	00:40:03,072	00:40:04,352	| IOT179 |	Tremendous
EDL	00:40:04,352	00:40:05,120	| IOT179 |	Professional
EDL	00:40:05,632	00:40:08,448	| IOT179 |	Habits to be tremendously helpful to Homefront
EDL	00:40:08,448	00:40:09,728	| IOT179 |	But you're going to need
EDL	00:40:09,728	00:40:12,288	| IOT179 |	To have a piece of Hardware it was designs in the ground up
EDL	00:40:12,288	00:40:13,056	| IOT179 |	Be more helpful to home
EDL	00:40:14,080	00:40:14,848	| IOT179 |	Not forcing
EDL	00:40:17,920	00:40:21,760	| IOT179 |	We did spend some time talking to other Hardware manufacturers about this because
EDL	00:40:21,760	00:40:24,064	| IOT179 |	Our eyes were recently wide open about whatever
EDL	00:40:25,088	00:40:26,368	| IOT179 |	Make a hardware device
EDL	00:40:26,368	00:40:28,416	| IOT179 |	Ourselves but after spending several months
EDL	00:40:29,184	00:40:34,560	| IOT179 |	Leading Hardware manufacturers became convinced that they didn't see the same vision that we did for what was
EDL	00:40:34,560	00:40:35,328	| IOT179 |	Possible
EDL	00:40:35,328	00:40:37,888	| IOT179 |	In terms of creating internet-connected devices
EDL	00:40:37,888	00:40:39,168	| IOT179 |	It would actually be there till
EDL	00:40:40,192	00:40:41,728	| IOT179 |	Help them get the most out of their tools
EDL	00:40:46,592	00:40:48,128	| IOT179 |	We're going to make the device
EDL	00:40:48,128	00:40:51,712	| IOT179 |	We safe to be an actual cooking tool that's really going to empower
EDL	00:40:52,992	00:40:54,784	| IOT179 |	That was supposed to be goal and it was
EDL	00:40:54,784	00:40:57,088	| IOT179 |	Still pretty naive about making
EDL	00:41:00,160	00:41:01,184	| IOT179 |	You opened it right up
EDL	00:41:01,184	00:41:01,696	| IOT179 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:41:03,232	00:41:06,048	| IOT179 |	One of the things that we thought was important as we didn't want it to be a gadget
EDL	00:41:06,048	00:41:07,072	| IOT179 |	We wanted it to be
EDL	00:41:07,584	00:41:08,864	| IOT179 |	What is a professional chef
EDL	00:41:11,424	00:41:13,216	| IOT179 |	The knife for example
EDL	00:41:13,216	00:41:14,496	| IOT179 |	Play the tool I reline a tie

EDL	00:41:18,080	00:41:19,104	| IOT179 |	You might look at a bread maker
EDL	00:41:22,688	00:41:25,248	| IOT179 |	Who bought one maybe comes out once a year and then it goes to
EDL	00:41:25,248	00:41:26,784	| IOT179 |	The back of the cupboard and never get
EDL	00:41:26,784	00:41:27,552	| IOT179 |	It again
EDL	00:41:27,552	00:41:28,832	| IOT179 |	We didn't want to be
EDL	00:41:28,832	00:41:30,112	| IOT179 |	All in the back
EDL	00:41:30,624	00:41:31,136	| IOT179 |	We knew how beautiful
EDL	00:41:31,648	00:41:32,672	| IOT179 |	Holiday today

EDL	00:41:36,256	00:41:38,816	| IOT179 |	Countertop real estate or top-drawer real estate
EDL	00:41:39,328	00:41:40,608	| IOT179 |	Really really valuable
EDL	00:41:40,608	00:41:41,888	| IOT179 |	And things need to be compact
EDL	00:41:43,680	00:41:45,472	| IOT179 |	CB devices wait about 9 or 10
EDL	00:41:45,472	00:41:47,520	| IOT179 |	Towns they were relatively enormous

EDL	00:41:49,824	00:41:50,592	| IOT179 |	We set out with the

EDL	00:41:55,455	00:41:57,247	| IOT179 |	Quick to use on a Wednesday night
EDL	00:41:57,247	00:41:58,527	| IOT179 |	But one of the challenges
EDL	00:41:58,527	00:41:59,551	| IOT179 |	Sous vide is your heating water
EDL	00:42:00,063	00:42:02,879	| IOT179 |	And anybody who has a background in physics

EDL	00:42:18,495	00:42:23,871	| IOT179 |	Small enough to fit into a countertop door needs to be about an inch and 3/4 deep
EDL	00:42:23,871	00:42:24,639	| IOT179 |	You're sinking

EDL	00:42:36,415	00:42:38,207	| IOT179 |	Actually pull that off
EDL	00:42:38,207	00:42:39,231	| IOT179 |	We had to invent some
EDL	00:42:39,231	00:42:41,023	| IOT179 |	Proprietary New Heating technology
EDL	00:42:41,023	00:42:44,863	| IOT179 |	Even make that possible so these are in retrospect there was a lot of goo
EDL	00:42:44,863	00:42:46,911	| IOT179 |	We thought we could do that those are just some of the engineer
EDL	00:42:47,935	00:42:50,239	| IOT179 |	Let you know we wrangled with
EDL	00:42:50,239	00:42:51,263	| IOT179 |	Trying to figure out how do you be a hardware
EDL	00:42:52,543	00:42:54,847	| IOT179 |	Actually want to tell people I'm cooking with nuclear fission
EDL	00:42:54,847	00:42:55,615	| IOT179 |	I know
EDL	00:42:55,615	00:42:56,383	| IOT179 |	I'm right
EDL	00:42:56,383	00:42:59,711	| IOT179 |	Let's talk about one of the controversial decision
EDL	00:43:00,223	00:43:00,991	| IOT179 |	You guys made
EDL	00:43:00,991	00:43:07,135	| IOT179 |	Because I'll be honest when I pulled out the jewel I was like hey there's just this one button on the top and
EDL	00:43:07,135	00:43:10,719	| IOT179 |	I don't actually I'm not a huge lover of screen to my smartphone to
EDL	00:43:11,231	00:43:13,279	| IOT179 |	Pest control things so I kind of looked askance
EDL	00:43:13,279	00:43:13,791	| IOT179 |	The fact that this

EDL	00:43:22,495	00:43:23,519	| IOT179 |	Wasn't taken light
EDL	00:43:25,311	00:43:26,079	| IOT179 |	It was polarized
EDL	00:43:26,591	00:43:28,895	| IOT179 |	In fact I think when we first launched I remember reading
EDL	00:43:28,895	00:43:30,431	| IOT179 |	Comments on the subreddit

EDL	00:43:32,479	00:43:33,759	| IOT179 |	This decision should be dragging the

EDL	00:43:35,295	00:43:36,319	| IOT179 |	Whoever that person was
EDL	00:43:36,831	00:43:37,855	| IOT179 |	And the person you want to go out
EDL	00:43:38,367	00:43:39,135	| IOT179 |	The reason for that
EDL	00:43:40,927	00:43:42,207	| IOT179 |	We did as good a job as we

EDL	00:43:57,311	00:43:58,847	| IOT179 |	Because if you think about it
EDL	00:43:58,847	00:44:00,127	| IOT179 |	Every technology we have
EDL	00:44:00,639	00:44:01,919	| IOT179 |	The average home kitchen

EDL	00:44:07,551	00:44:11,903	| IOT179 |	And all of them require you to translate what you want I want

EDL	00:44:14,975	00:44:18,303	| IOT179 |	I want it done at 7:30 you have to translate that into
EDL	00:44:18,303	00:44:19,839	| IOT179 |	Engineer parameters like should the oven be
EDL	00:44:22,143	00:44:23,167	| IOT179 |	How long will it
EDL	00:44:23,679	00:44:25,471	| IOT179 |	This is where a lot of

EDL	00:44:28,543	00:44:29,823	| IOT179 |	Opportunity
EDL	00:44:30,335	00:44:32,383	| IOT179 |	What's the actually create a way of interacting

EDL	00:44:34,687	00:44:36,479	| IOT179 |	You could express your crap

EDL	00:44:39,295	00:44:44,159	| IOT179 |	This time and you didn't have to translate that necessarily into knowing that that means
EDL	00:44:44,159	00:44:45,695	| IOT179 |	Probably want your water Bassett

EDL	00:44:52,607	00:44:53,631	| IOT179 |	Or you can just look at the image

EDL	00:44:57,727	00:44:58,495	| IOT179 |	The one I want
EDL	00:44:58,495	00:44:59,775	| IOT179 |	The texture of that short
EDL	00:44:59,775	00:45:01,055	| IOT179 |	Rib that looks right to me

EDL	00:45:05,407	00:45:07,711	| IOT179 |	It looks like the food will be done at this
EDL	00:45:10,271	00:45:12,831	| IOT179 |	Pulled over
EDL	00:45:12,831	00:45:13,599	| IOT179 |	2% right
EDL	00:45:13,599	00:45:14,111	| IOT179 |	We also
EDL	00:45:14,879	00:45:15,903	| IOT179 |	Depersonalized
EDL	00:45:15,903	00:45:19,743	| IOT179 |	Because different people would want to post advice in different ways by moving all those

EDL	00:45:22,559	00:45:25,375	| IOT179 |	Ability to make the device better over time
EDL	00:45:25,375	00:45:26,143	| IOT179 |	It gave us the Opera
EDL	00:45:26,655	00:45:28,703	| IOT179 |	To think about new ways to interact such as
EDL	00:45:28,703	00:45:29,215	| IOT179 |	We have now
EDL	00:45:31,263	00:45:32,799	| IOT179 |	Because voice when your hand
EDL	00:45:33,311	00:45:35,615	| IOT179 |	Voices of phenomena way of communicating with your device

EDL	00:45:44,575	00:45:45,599	| IOT179 |	Preverbal
EDL	00:45:45,599	00:45:47,391	| IOT179 |	Why we know some people would like to have that fish
EDL	00:45:47,903	00:45:49,695	| IOT179 |	We basically felt it
EDL	00:45:49,695	00:45:50,719	| IOT179 |	The trade-offs
EDL	00:45:50,719	00:45:56,095	| IOT179 |	Worth living things
EDL	00:45:56,095	00:45:59,167	| IOT179 |	We were really interested in finding the customers who bought into this idea
EDL	00:46:00,447	00:46:01,215	| IOT179 |	More devices
EDL	00:46:01,215	00:46:07,615	| IOT179 |	Create new features we can get better over time and that's really the long-term View
EDL	00:46:07,615	00:46:11,455	| IOT179 |	Just about Joule sous-vide device there will be other Hardware there will be other services
EDL	00:46:11,455	00:46:12,223	| IOT179 |	We wanted to demonstrate
EDL	00:46:12,991	00:46:15,807	| IOT179 |	The kitchen can actually leverage software in a way
EDL	00:46:15,807	00:46:16,575	| IOT179 |	It allows you to
EDL	00:46:17,087	00:46:18,111	| IOT179 |	More
EDL	00:46:18,111	00:46:21,439	| IOT179 |	Make it more human not less human because there are things
EDL	00:46:21,951	00:46:24,255	| IOT179 |	Computers and software can do they're just really hard
EDL	00:46:24,255	00:46:25,791	| IOT179 |	Skilled professional set
EDL	00:46:26,303	00:46:28,607	| IOT179 |	That was kind of a decision behind it
EDL	00:46:28,607	00:46:29,631	| IOT179 |	And I think on some level
EDL	00:46:30,143	00:46:31,167	| IOT179 |	We could have put us
EDL	00:46:31,167	00:46:34,751	| IOT179 |	That really would have been
EDL	00:46:35,263	00:46:37,311	| IOT179 |	Thai chicken the pressure off us
EDL	00:46:37,823	00:46:39,615	| IOT179 |	Really think very hard about how to make
EDL	00:46:41,919	00:46:44,479	| IOT179 |	14 function that required us to be really good at
EDL	00:46:45,247	00:46:47,039	| IOT179 |	I need to be really focused on reliability
EDL	00:46:47,551	00:46:49,343	| IOT179 |	To really think about user experience
EDL	00:46:49,343	00:46:50,623	| IOT179 |	How does needed to work
EDL	00:46:52,415	00:46:53,695	| IOT179 |	We could have laid out but you know
EDL	00:46:53,695	00:47:00,095	| IOT179 |	As far as we can tell where the best-selling connected to be device now where the number two in the market the leading devices is large
EDL	00:47:00,095	00:47:00,863	| IOT179 |	Actually not Reliant
EDL	00:47:01,375	00:47:02,911	| IOT179 |	And that gives us
EDL	00:47:03,679	00:47:05,471	| IOT179 |	Going relationship with our customers
EDL	00:47:05,471	00:47:08,287	| IOT179 |	So that we keep getting better over time so it looks like that
EDL	00:47:08,287	00:47:09,055	| IOT179 |	Asian accent
EDL	00:47:09,055	00:47:10,591	| IOT179 |	Panned out pretty well for us
EDL	00:47:10,591	00:47:11,359	| IOT179 |	Havaianas
EDL	00:47:11,359	00:47:12,127	| IOT179 |	Totally honest
EDL	00:47:12,639	00:47:18,015	| IOT179 |	Continue to demonstrate our customers that was a good decision I continually shipping updates
EDL	00:47:18,527	00:47:19,295	| IOT179 |	Okay
EDL	00:47:19,295	00:47:22,111	| IOT179 |	So what is your thought process around if
EDL	00:47:22,111	00:47:23,647	| IOT179 |	The company goes out of business
EDL	00:47:23,647	00:47:25,695	| IOT179 |	Do you have actual things in place
EDL	00:47:25,695	00:47:27,231	| IOT179 |	Sword is everyone sous vide
EDL	00:47:27,231	00:47:27,743	| IOT179 |	To stop work
EDL	00:47:28,255	00:47:30,303	| IOT179 |	One of the nice day
EDL	00:47:30,303	00:47:33,375	| IOT179 |	Think about that in there are we've actually had
EDL	00:47:34,143	00:47:38,239	| IOT179 |	I'll be able to security pretty seriously so there are aspects of
EDL	00:47:38,239	00:47:39,519	| IOT179 |	The device where we would have to
EDL	00:47:40,031	00:47:43,871	| IOT179 |	To make it possible for other developers to support it but there are plans
EDL	00:47:44,639	00:47:49,247	| IOT179 |	Do that the infrastructure is in place simply we're using our own internal apis to do
EDL	00:47:49,247	00:47:55,647	| IOT179 |	Do these kind of things that would be relatively trivial press to open that up this is kind of the end of life for Oscar
EDL	00:47:55,647	00:47:58,207	| IOT179 |	That would be something we could do and we have seen enough
EDL	00:47:58,207	00:48:00,767	| IOT179 |	People attempt to reverse-engineer some
EDL	00:48:00,767	00:48:01,535	| IOT179 |	I'm going to basic
EDL	00:48:04,607	00:48:07,167	| IOT179 |	Acordeon Sol
EDL	00:48:08,959	00:48:10,495	| IOT179 |	That's a tricky question
EDL	00:48:10,495	00:48:13,055	| IOT179 |	Still an internal discussion of where those boundaries are how do we
EDL	00:48:13,567	00:48:16,895	| IOT179 |	Spectre customers data privacy so we're not quite ready to do
EDL	00:48:17,407	00:48:19,967	| IOT179 |	But that is something we're actively thinking about how do we
EDL	00:48:19,967	00:48:23,295	| IOT179 |	Encourage more people to keep innovating with soccer in the kitchen
EDL	00:48:23,295	00:48:24,575	| IOT179 |	And connecting your device
EDL	00:48:24,575	00:48:25,855	| IOT179 |	Put that software
EDL	00:48:26,879	00:48:27,903	| IOT179 |	Apache Corp
EDL	00:48:28,927	00:48:30,719	| IOT179 |	Along this line
EDL	00:48:30,719	00:48:33,023	| IOT179 |	Let's talk about business models for the smart
EDL	00:48:33,791	00:48:35,327	| IOT179 |	Because a lot of Kinect
EDL	00:48:35,327	00:48:35,839	| IOT179 |	Set device maker
EDL	00:48:36,351	00:48:37,631	| IOT179 |	There's a lot of innovation have
EDL	00:48:42,495	00:48:46,847	| IOT179 |	But there's also a really big establish number of vendors out there who make
EDL	00:48:46,847	00:48:48,127	| IOT179 |	The traditional home appliances
EDL	00:48:48,639	00:48:51,199	| IOT179 |	When I look at what they're trying to do it feels like
EDL	00:48:51,711	00:48:54,527	| IOT179 |	You're a pure software the intelligence you guys are built
EDL	00:48:55,039	00:48:56,575	| IOT179 |	The years might be
EDL	00:48:56,575	00:49:00,415	| IOT179 |	Well suited for GE or Whirlpool to come in and buy in
EDL	00:49:00,415	00:49:01,183	| IOT179 |	Maybe make part of
EDL	00:49:01,695	00:49:05,023	| IOT179 |	I know they don't have a sous-vide option yet but make part of their own
EDL	00:49:05,023	00:49:05,791	| IOT179 |	Kitchen ecosys
EDL	00:49:06,303	00:49:07,583	| IOT179 |	What are your thoughts around
EDL	00:49:07,583	00:49:08,095	| IOT179 |	How that's going
EDL	00:49:12,447	00:49:13,215	| IOT179 |	These companies
EDL	00:49:13,215	00:49:14,495	| IOT179 |	But we haven't yet results
EDL	00:49:14,495	00:49:16,031	| IOT179 |	Questions we have
EDL	00:49:16,031	00:49:17,055	| IOT179 |	Allow us to go forward
EDL	00:49:17,055	00:49:18,079	| IOT179 |	One of the first
EDL	00:49:18,079	00:49:18,847	| IOT179 |	Issues X
EDL	00:49:18,847	00:49:19,615	| IOT179 |	Pragmatic
EDL	00:49:19,615	00:49:21,151	| IOT179 |	A lot of the things we really want
EDL	00:49:21,151	00:49:22,687	| IOT179 |	We will have more announced
EDL	00:49:27,807	00:49:29,855	| IOT179 |	Control over the hardware the sensors
EDL	00:49:29,855	00:49:30,367	| IOT179 |	Calibration
EDL	00:49:30,879	00:49:31,903	| IOT179 |	Be able to
EDL	00:49:32,415	00:49:33,695	| IOT179 |	Provide clean data
EDL	00:49:33,695	00:49:35,487	| IOT179 |	To our various cloud services
EDL	00:49:35,487	00:49:36,255	| IOT179 |	To do things like
EDL	00:49:36,767	00:49:37,535	| IOT179 |	Cooking times
EDL	00:49:37,535	00:49:40,095	| IOT179 |	Significantly or make predictions about how the
EDL	00:49:41,119	00:49:42,911	| IOT179 |	Do you think you certainly see how they would be a
EDL	00:49:42,911	00:49:44,959	| IOT179 |	But those device manufacturers
EDL	00:49:44,959	00:49:47,775	| IOT179 |	We have to get on board
EDL	00:49:47,775	00:49:51,103	| IOT179 |	Much much better sensors in the device make the best of it
EDL	00:49:51,103	00:49:51,871	| IOT179 |	The market
EDL	00:49:51,871	00:49:52,895	| IOT179 |	$10,000 rack
EDL	00:49:53,919	00:49:55,199	| IOT179 |	If you actually test
EDL	00:49:55,199	00:49:56,223	| IOT179 |	And we did for love
EDL	00:49:56,223	00:49:58,015	| IOT179 |	You'd be surprised to find that the app
EDL	00:49:58,527	00:49:59,295	| IOT179 |	About plus or minus
EDL	00:50:00,575	00:50:01,087	| IOT179 |	Dad
EDL	00:50:01,599	00:50:02,367	| IOT179 |	It's terrible
EDL	00:50:02,367	00:50:03,135	| IOT179 |	Right
EDL	00:50:05,951	00:50:09,535	| IOT179 |	Humidity control is well so these oem's of
EDL	00:50:09,535	00:50:10,047	| IOT179 |	Kitchen Hardware
EDL	00:50:12,607	00:50:14,911	| IOT179 |	We have to get really serious about
EDL	00:50:14,911	00:50:15,679	| IOT179 |	Pretty much better
EDL	00:50:16,191	00:50:18,751	| IOT179 |	The hard work of calibrating to get
EDL	00:50:19,263	00:50:20,543	| IOT179 |	Usually reserved for
EDL	00:50:20,543	00:50:23,615	| IOT179 |	Precision lab equipment
EDL	00:50:25,919	00:50:27,711	| IOT179 |	You could imagine we could work with him on that but
EDL	00:50:28,991	00:50:30,015	| IOT179 |	Distortion everything for us
EDL	00:50:30,527	00:50:32,063	| IOT179 |	All the sudden we're really having
EDL	00:50:32,063	00:50:35,903	| IOT179 |	And most of our time working with these licensees to bring them up to where we're already
EDL	00:50:37,439	00:50:38,207	| IOT179 |	How much is
EDL	00:50:39,999	00:50:41,535	| IOT179 |	What is teams
EDL	00:50:41,535	00:50:42,559	| IOT179 |	Other issue is
EDL	00:50:43,071	00:50:44,351	| IOT179 |	We're building our own Hardware
EDL	00:50:46,143	00:50:46,911	| IOT179 |	Software
EDL	00:50:46,911	00:50:48,703	| IOT179 |	When were citic vertically integrated that way
EDL	00:50:48,703	00:50:50,239	| IOT179 |	We have real Clarity over
EDL	00:50:50,239	00:50:51,007	| IOT179 |	Lacoste
EDL	00:50:51,007	00:50:56,639	| IOT179 |	There's no ambiguity of how we make money there's no ambiguity about like whose needs are you serving
EDL	00:50:56,639	00:50:57,151	| IOT179 |	Change it
EDL	00:50:57,663	00:50:59,711	| IOT179 |	Licensing organization well
EDL	00:50:59,711	00:51:00,991	| IOT179 |	Is Electrolux a customer
EDL	00:51:00,991	00:51:01,759	| IOT179 |	Is there any
EDL	00:51:03,807	00:51:05,343	| IOT179 |	When you start to get ambiguity
EDL	00:51:05,343	00:51:07,647	| IOT179 |	In particular we want a very low structure and Bayern

EDL	00:51:09,951	00:51:11,231	| IOT179 |	Customer is always LED
EDL	00:51:11,743	00:51:14,303	| IOT179 |	Problem bad decision-making about
EDL	00:51:14,303	00:51:16,607	| IOT179 |	What's a prioritize what's a really work on
EDL	00:51:16,607	00:51:17,375	| IOT179 |	So does that
EDL	00:51:17,887	00:51:22,495	| IOT179 |	You guys kind of has a niche product or a luxury product for a while to come then
EDL	00:51:23,007	00:51:26,079	| IOT179 |	I don't think $100 a day
EDL	00:51:26,079	00:51:29,151	| IOT179 |	Without disclosing numbers and we have customers
EDL	00:51:29,151	00:51:32,735	| IOT179 |	In the six-figure range and growing rapidly
EDL	00:51:34,271	00:51:37,343	| IOT179 |	Free to continue to grow out from this week
EDL	00:51:37,343	00:51:39,135	| IOT179 |	Can't wait to grow our Revenue fast
EDL	00:51:39,135	00:51:40,927	| IOT179 |	Goodbye license yet but that's never been out
EDL	00:51:41,439	00:51:44,767	| IOT179 |	Yeah we are really focused on making sure that we are
EDL	00:51:44,767	00:51:47,327	| IOT179 |	Retaining our customers engaging them and serving them
EDL	00:51:47,327	00:51:50,143	| IOT179 |	Well over time so that they continue to be customer for years
EDL	00:51:50,655	00:51:53,727	| IOT179 |	And let's talk about additional Hardware I'm sure you're not going to
EDL	00:51:53,727	00:51:55,007	| IOT179 |	Disclosure product ramp
EDL	00:51:55,007	00:51:57,055	| IOT179 |	But let's talk about where you might
EDL	00:51:57,055	00:51:58,591	| IOT179 |	Go pure products
EDL	00:51:58,591	00:52:00,383	| IOT179 |	Lot of companies who build Hardware looking
EDL	00:52:00,895	00:52:01,919	| IOT179 |	Milky Chance
EDL	00:52:01,919	00:52:02,687	| IOT179 |	So
EDL	00:52:02,687	00:52:03,455	| IOT179 |	What are you guys think
EDL	00:52:03,967	00:52:04,735	| IOT179 |	There's a few things

EDL	00:52:53,887	00:52:56,959	| IOT179 |	Guarantee it's going to be relatively convenient to do it
EDL	00:52:56,959	00:52:57,983	| IOT179 |	And we think there's
EDL	00:52:57,983	00:52:59,519	| IOT179 |	Real meaning of ways that
EDL	00:52:59,519	00:53:00,799	| IOT179 |	Better interfaces
EDL	00:53:00,799	00:53:02,591	| IOT179 |	Facial interfaces machine learning
EDL	00:53:02,591	00:53:03,615	| IOT179 |	Actually put

EDL	00:53:16,415	00:53:20,255	| IOT179 |	Pictures to cook on a Wednesday night we were playing with meal kits back in 20
EDL	00:53:20,255	00:53:21,023	| IOT179 |	Tina's Chester
EDL	00:53:21,535	00:53:24,351	| IOT179 |	Prototype then we beta-tested them with some of our community
EDL	00:53:24,351	00:53:25,887	| IOT179 |	To love them
EDL	00:53:26,399	00:53:28,191	| IOT179 |	We should have listened to we don't know when these
EDL	00:53:28,191	00:53:29,727	| IOT179 |	Economics address look right side up
EDL	00:53:29,727	00:53:31,007	| IOT179 |	So we had a team that's
EDL	00:53:31,007	00:53:34,591	| IOT179 |	Started working on that bumper few years and they had a real break
EDL	00:53:34,591	00:53:37,919	| IOT179 |	Late last year and in fact they've been building a pilot production
EDL	00:53:37,919	00:53:38,943	| IOT179 |	Facility in Seattle
EDL	00:53:38,943	00:53:42,783	| IOT179 |	1011 manufacturing the way they want to and we hope to have something to announce
EDL	00:53:42,783	00:53:43,551	| IOT179 |	In a few weeks
EDL	00:53:43,551	00:53:46,367	| IOT179 |	Ella comes out of beta but we really see this as a product
EDL	00:53:47,903	00:53:49,951	| IOT179 |	Consumable space
EDL	00:53:51,743	00:53:55,839	| IOT179 |	To choose to cook more frequently and have a greater diversity of options and have more compass

EDL	00:54:05,055	00:54:05,823	| IOT179 |	What is your
EDL	00:54:05,823	00:54:09,663	| IOT179 |	Favorite thing to sous vide and give us a recommendation
EDL	00:54:09,663	00:54:10,943	| IOT179 |	For anybody who's
EDL	00:54:10,943	00:54:11,711	| IOT179 |	A novice
EDL	00:54:11,711	00:54:12,223	| IOT179 |	Austin saying

EDL	00:54:15,807	00:54:19,647	| IOT179 |	As a super duper complicated Chef person and then
EDL	00:54:19,647	00:54:21,695	| IOT179 |	Maybe something to convince everyone else
EDL	00:54:22,207	00:54:22,719	| IOT179 |	Sous vide might be
EDL	00:54:23,231	00:54:26,815	| IOT179 |	Okay so for the meat lovers there's two things that are free
EDL	00:54:26,815	00:54:27,839	| IOT179 |	Goat cheese for me
EDL	00:54:27,839	00:54:29,119	| IOT179 |	Beef short rib
EDL	00:54:29,119	00:54:30,655	| IOT179 |	You really want to get from ribs
EDL	00:54:30,655	00:54:36,799	| IOT179 |	4 5 and 6 that doesn't mean anything to you go talk to a butcher it will mean something to them but that's the thickest part of the short rib
EDL	00:54:36,799	00:54:38,591	| IOT179 |	You take that short ribs
EDL	00:54:39,103	00:54:42,943	| IOT179 |	You cook it at 54 degrees Celsius or you pull our visual Douglas guidance
EDL	00:54:42,943	00:54:43,967	| IOT179 |	Pictures of textures
EDL	00:54:43,967	00:54:45,759	| IOT179 |	Little wind up with this for three days
EDL	00:54:45,759	00:54:46,527	| IOT179 |	That sounds crazy
EDL	00:54:47,551	00:54:48,319	| IOT179 |	3 days book
EDL	00:54:48,319	00:54:52,927	| IOT179 |	I promise you this is one of these dishes at tends to change people wise the first day and they have it
EDL	00:54:52,927	00:54:54,207	| IOT179 |	Especially
EDL	00:54:54,207	00:54:55,743	| IOT179 |	Is just so much more flavor
EDL	00:54:55,743	00:55:01,887	| IOT179 |	In a short Redmond sale ribeye or especially a flaming yawn but three days of cooking in a very low temperature Converse All That
EDL	00:55:02,399	00:55:03,167	| IOT179 |	In the short rib
EDL	00:55:03,167	00:55:04,959	| IOT179 |	The tender gelatin without making it
EDL	00:55:04,959	00:55:07,775	| IOT179 |	Play Ear braised and you end up something is very steak like
EDL	00:55:08,287	00:55:09,311	| IOT179 |	The tender filet mignon in
EDL	00:55:10,079	00:55:11,359	| IOT179 |	Ugly delicious
EDL	00:55:12,383	00:55:13,407	| IOT179 |	Play something more easy
EDL	00:55:13,919	00:55:16,223	| IOT179 |	Weeknight you usually can find in supermarkets
EDL	00:55:16,223	00:55:18,783	| IOT179 |	Pork shoulder steaks that usually at uppercut
EDL	00:55:18,783	00:55:21,087	| IOT179 |	Flavorful but you drop those in the morning when you
EDL	00:55:21,087	00:55:22,367	| IOT179 |	You go to work and
EDL	00:55:22,367	00:55:23,647	| IOT179 |	Cook them they'll be
EDL	00:55:23,647	00:55:25,439	| IOT179 |	Incredibly tender when you get home
EDL	00:55:25,439	00:55:26,463	| IOT179 |	Perfect medium-rare
EDL	00:55:26,975	00:55:28,511	| IOT179 |	Really it's hot pork should be cooked
EDL	00:55:28,511	00:55:30,047	| IOT179 |	I really recommend adding up
EDL	00:55:30,047	00:55:31,583	| IOT179 |	Char sui sauce to the bags
EDL	00:55:33,375	00:55:35,935	| IOT179 |	Candy at the end for those who are not
EDL	00:55:36,447	00:55:36,959	| IOT179 |	Beats
EDL	00:55:37,471	00:55:38,495	| IOT179 |	Lentils and
EDL	00:55:38,495	00:55:39,263	| IOT179 |	Asparagus
EDL	00:55:39,263	00:55:41,823	| IOT179 |	Are just vegetables or grain preparation
EDL	00:55:41,823	00:55:45,663	| IOT179 |	Can really benefit from CBD cooking chicken with the grain
EDL	00:55:45,663	00:55:47,455	| IOT179 |	What's nice
EDL	00:55:47,455	00:55:48,735	| IOT179 |	Leave them in the fridge
EDL	00:55:48,735	00:55:50,015	| IOT179 |	Easily up to a month
EDL	00:55:50,015	00:55:53,343	| IOT179 |	So you can have a really quick meal for together

EDL	00:55:54,623	00:55:56,159	| IOT179 |	And to get The Machinist out of them
EDL	00:55:56,159	00:55:56,927	| IOT179 |	They're really great
EDL	00:55:56,927	00:55:58,975	| IOT179 |	Beat you retain their natural sweetness
EDL	00:55:58,975	00:55:59,999	| IOT179 |	Earthy flavors
EDL	00:55:59,999	00:56:02,559	| IOT179 |	Little goat cheese for salad
EDL	00:56:02,559	00:56:03,583	| IOT179 |	Maybe some toast it
EDL	00:56:03,583	00:56:04,351	| IOT179 |	Conn's
EDL	00:56:04,351	00:56:05,375	| IOT179 |	Classic restaurant
EDL	00:56:05,375	00:56:06,655	| IOT179 |	Starter and it's delicious
EDL	00:56:06,655	00:56:07,935	| IOT179 |	Asparagus
EDL	00:56:07,935	00:56:09,471	| IOT179 |	Is one of these things where
EDL	00:56:09,471	00:56:13,055	| IOT179 |	It really just needs to be lightly cooked you wanted to snap but you don't want it
EDL	00:56:13,055	00:56:13,823	| IOT179 |	He stood
EDL	00:56:13,823	00:56:16,639	| IOT179 |	You don't really want to cook it in anything other than it
EDL	00:56:16,639	00:56:20,479	| IOT179 |	On juices maybe a knob of butter so asparagus is one of these things where
EDL	00:56:20,479	00:56:21,503	| IOT179 |	It will be much better.
EDL	00:56:21,503	00:56:24,831	| IOT179 |	Asparagus you typically getting a restaurant that has been steamed
