EDL	00:01:46,240	00:01:48,288	| IOT130 |	Let's get started with a big
EDL	00:01:48,288	00:01:49,568	| IOT130 |	News of
EDL	00:01:49,568	00:01:50,336	| IOT130 |	Week
EDL	00:01:50,336	00:01:50,848	| IOT130 |	Which is
EDL	00:01:51,616	00:01:52,384	| IOT130 |	Nat Nast
EDL	00:01:53,152	00:01:53,664	| IOT130 |	Yay
EDL	00:01:54,176	00:01:55,968	| IOT130 |	Wednesday they had a massive press
EDL	00:01:56,736	00:01:58,784	| IOT130 |	And we have known about this for a while
EDL	00:01:58,784	00:02:02,624	| IOT130 |	Speculation was rampant at cedia we talked about things like
EDL	00:02:02,624	00:02:04,160	| IOT130 |	Oh my gosh they're going to doorbell
EDL	00:02:04,160	00:02:04,672	| IOT130 |	Oh my gosh
EDL	00:02:05,184	00:02:06,208	| IOT130 |	They're doing a security system
EDL	00:02:06,208	00:02:06,976	| IOT130 |	Oh my God
EDL	00:02:06,976	00:02:08,512	| IOT130 |	They're doing all of that
EDL	00:02:08,512	00:02:10,048	| IOT130 |	So quick rundown
EDL	00:02:10,048	00:02:11,328	| IOT130 |	So you got a sensor
EDL	00:02:11,328	00:02:12,096	| IOT130 |	What's happening
EDL	00:02:12,608	00:02:13,888	| IOT130 |	This all went live yesterday
EDL	00:02:13,888	00:02:14,912	| IOT130 |	But
EDL	00:02:14,912	00:02:15,680	| IOT130 |	3
EDL	00:02:15,680	00:02:16,960	| IOT130 |	Hardware elements
EDL	00:02:16,960	00:02:17,728	| IOT130 |	And then there's this
EDL	00:02:18,240	00:02:19,008	| IOT130 |	Cool
EDL	00:02:19,008	00:02:21,824	| IOT130 |	Little additional feature let's hit the additional feature first
EDL	00:02:21,824	00:02:23,104	| IOT130 |	What's the biggest news I think
EDL	00:02:23,616	00:02:24,896	| IOT130 |	Really alright
EDL	00:02:24,896	00:02:27,456	| IOT130 |	Kevin's biggest news Google Assistant
EDL	00:02:27,456	00:02:28,736	| IOT130 |	Coming to the nest
EDL	00:02:28,736	00:02:30,016	| IOT130 |	Cam IQ
EDL	00:02:30,016	00:02:30,528	| IOT130 |	Indoor
EDL	00:02:31,040	00:02:34,624	| IOT130 |	So that's $300 camera that Nest announced
EDL	00:02:34,624	00:02:35,392	| IOT130 |	Fairly recently
EDL	00:02:35,904	00:02:38,464	| IOT130 |	It's got neat features like Nest aware
EDL	00:02:40,512	00:02:41,792	| IOT130 |	They come on in and now
EDL	00:02:42,304	00:02:43,840	| IOT130 |	It's basically like
EDL	00:02:43,840	00:02:44,608	| IOT130 |	In a lot of respects
EDL	00:02:45,376	00:02:50,240	| IOT130 |	It is and I think it's great news but I'm also like I just want a regular Nest cam
EDL	00:02:50,240	00:02:53,824	| IOT130 |	So if I didn't know this was coming I might have waited
EDL	00:02:54,336	00:02:55,872	| IOT130 |	Splurge on the nicer one
EDL	00:02:55,872	00:02:57,408	| IOT130 |	Well maybe this will make you feel better
EDL	00:02:57,408	00:02:59,200	| IOT130 |	There's going to be no Direct Media playback
EDL	00:02:59,712	00:03:00,224	| IOT130 |	On this device
EDL	00:03:00,992	00:03:03,296	| IOT130 |	So you know how you can tell it to play songs for
EDL	00:03:03,296	00:03:04,832	| IOT130 |	Spotify if you're not going to be able to do
EDL	00:03:04,832	00:03:11,232	| IOT130 |	And that's okay because that's exactly what those little Invidia Underwood called that we talked about two weeks ago the plugin
EDL	00:03:11,232	00:03:12,000	| IOT130 |	Mike's
EDL	00:03:12,000	00:03:18,144	| IOT130 |	We just enable you to speak commands for maybe media playback elsewhere or the house or whatever it's on okay with that
EDL	00:03:18,144	00:03:22,752	| IOT130 |	Okay yes and you can use it to play media back actually you can tell Google to play things on
EDL	00:03:22,752	00:03:23,520	| IOT130 |	Other speaker
EDL	00:03:23,520	00:03:24,800	| IOT130 |	You just can't play it from there
EDL	00:03:25,312	00:03:28,384	| IOT130 |	Turn lights on unlock a door give commands
EDL	00:03:28,384	00:03:28,896	| IOT130 |	Yes
EDL	00:03:29,408	00:03:29,920	| IOT130 |	You all of that
EDL	00:03:30,944	00:03:33,504	| IOT130 |	So but I actually don't think that's the biggest news I goofed
EDL	00:03:35,296	00:03:40,672	| IOT130 |	I wasn't sure the order you're going in there I thought you will get through it and then I'll jump back in and say that I think this is the big
EDL	00:03:43,488	00:03:46,816	| IOT130 |	Okay so we'll go in order of complexity
EDL	00:03:46,816	00:03:49,120	| IOT130 |	Nest is also announcing a
EDL	00:03:49,632	00:03:50,400	| IOT130 |	Nest
EDL	00:03:50,400	00:03:51,424	| IOT130 |	Cam IQ
EDL	00:03:51,424	00:03:51,936	| IOT130 |	Outdoor
EDL	00:03:52,704	00:03:55,776	| IOT130 |	To all of the functionality of I should say
EDL	00:03:55,776	00:03:57,312	| IOT130 |	The Google Assistant that's going to happen
EDL	00:03:58,336	00:03:59,104	| IOT130 |	So it's going to be
EDL	00:04:02,176	00:04:04,992	| IOT130 |	Nest cam outdoor it's coming
EDL	00:04:04,992	00:04:06,784	| IOT130 |	That's going to happen in November
EDL	00:04:07,296	00:04:10,112	| IOT130 |	That's pretty much an outdoor camera only thing that
EDL	00:04:10,112	00:04:11,904	| IOT130 |	Maybe worth noting is it
EDL	00:04:12,928	00:04:14,464	| IOT130 |	Super water resistant
EDL	00:04:14,464	00:04:16,000	| IOT130 |	Because it's ip66
EDL	00:04:17,536	00:04:18,815	| IOT130 |	There's this crazy readings
EDL	00:04:20,351	00:04:22,399	| IOT130 |	Any other thing you should know about it is
EDL	00:04:22,399	00:04:23,935	| IOT130 |	It actually plugs in
EDL	00:04:23,935	00:04:24,703	| IOT130 |	Through
EDL	00:04:24,703	00:04:25,215	| IOT130 |	Inside
EDL	00:04:25,727	00:04:27,263	| IOT130 |	So you got to drill a hole through your house
EDL	00:04:28,543	00:04:31,103	| IOT130 |	My hunch is going to be more professional installer
EDL	00:04:31,103	00:04:31,615	| IOT130 |	Nothing but
EDL	00:04:32,127	00:04:32,895	| IOT130 |	You can DIY this
EDL	00:04:33,663	00:04:34,431	| IOT130 |	I know they have
EDL	00:04:34,431	00:04:36,735	| IOT130 |	Like the face ID stuff where they can
EDL	00:04:36,735	00:04:43,135	| IOT130 |	Yeah I wish you could apply that to say to a delivery truck such as UPS FedEx Etc because it's always handy to know
EDL	00:04:43,135	00:04:47,999	| IOT130 |	When they pull up you can just come get them at the door that's just me or I get stuff delivered a lot too but
EDL	00:04:47,999	00:04:48,511	| IOT130 |	So like that
EDL	00:04:50,047	00:04:51,327	| IOT130 |	All right we're going to ask nest
EDL	00:04:51,839	00:04:52,607	| IOT130 |	Think about identifying
EDL	00:04:53,119	00:04:53,631	| IOT130 |	Track ID
EDL	00:04:54,399	00:04:56,191	| IOT130 |	Track ID
EDL	00:04:56,191	00:04:56,959	| IOT130 |	For all the gadgets
EDL	00:04:58,751	00:05:02,591	| IOT130 |	All six of us all right
EDL	00:05:02,591	00:05:04,639	| IOT130 |	They also are going to do a doorbell
EDL	00:05:04,639	00:05:05,407	| IOT130 |	Nest
EDL	00:05:05,407	00:05:06,431	| IOT130 |	Hello
EDL	00:05:06,431	00:05:10,527	| IOT130 |	Is the name of the doorbell it will also be Nest aware and have some of your face
EDL	00:05:10,527	00:05:12,575	| IOT130 |	Recognition the other thing is
EDL	00:05:12,575	00:05:14,367	| IOT130 |	As adorable so it's a little bit unique
EDL	00:05:14,367	00:05:17,183	| IOT130 |	It's going to be closer got a 4:3 aspect ratio
EDL	00:05:17,183	00:05:19,231	| IOT130 |	Which is kind of like the August doorbell
EDL	00:05:19,231	00:05:19,999	| IOT130 |	So
EDL	00:05:19,999	00:05:20,767	| IOT130 |	Up and down
EDL	00:05:20,767	00:05:23,071	| IOT130 |	As opposed to kind of the wide-angle that
EDL	00:05:23,071	00:05:24,607	| IOT130 |	News24 rain
EDL	00:05:24,607	00:05:25,631	| IOT130 |	Skybell in those guys
EDL	00:05:25,631	00:05:28,703	| IOT130 |	And I kind of like it looks nice on the phone and
EDL	00:05:28,703	00:05:29,727	| IOT130 |	You can see your packages
EDL	00:05:30,751	00:05:31,519	| IOT130 |	You can always do
EDL	00:05:32,031	00:05:34,335	| IOT130 |	Hypocrite in the wrong spot like right under the doorbell
EDL	00:05:34,335	00:05:40,735	| IOT130 |	Okay so the other thing about that that's interesting is those quick actions that they talked about it's a list of all
EDL	00:05:40,735	00:05:43,807	| IOT130 |	Options that you can have happened when the doorbell rang
EDL	00:05:43,807	00:05:44,319	| IOT130 |	Sole
EDL	00:05:44,831	00:05:50,719	| IOT130 |	In our case with the UPS man who does Rings it runs you know it might can have it say leave the package by the door
EDL	00:05:50,719	00:05:51,999	| IOT130 |	Are you going to be
EDL	00:05:51,999	00:05:52,767	| IOT130 |	Not your voice
EDL	00:05:53,279	00:05:54,047	| IOT130 |	But
EDL	00:05:55,071	00:05:57,375	| IOT130 |	Leave the package by the door
EDL	00:05:57,375	00:05:58,655	| IOT130 |	Human voice
EDL	00:05:58,655	00:06:00,191	| IOT130 |	It's like that
EDL	00:06:01,983	00:06:02,495	| IOT130 |	Spotify
EDL	00:06:03,007	00:06:05,055	| IOT130 |	Gotcha so that'll be
EDL	00:06:05,055	00:06:05,823	| IOT130 |	Excited
EDL	00:06:05,823	00:06:07,103	| IOT130 |	And that is going to be
EDL	00:06:07,615	00:06:08,383	| IOT130 |	Turtles are hard
EDL	00:06:08,895	00:06:09,663	| IOT130 |	Don't come out until
EDL	00:06:09,663	00:06:10,175	| IOT130 |	G1
EDL	00:06:11,711	00:06:12,991	| IOT130 |	So we'll see it at CES
EDL	00:06:13,503	00:06:14,015	| IOT130 |	Yeah
EDL	00:06:15,551	00:06:16,319	| IOT130 |	Yes
EDL	00:06:16,319	00:06:18,111	| IOT130 |	And finally the big exciting
EDL	00:06:18,623	00:06:19,135	| IOT130 |	Plicated crazy
EDL	00:06:20,159	00:06:20,671	| IOT130 |	Which is
EDL	00:06:21,183	00:06:22,975	| IOT130 |	The session border can
EDL	00:06:22,975	00:06:24,255	| IOT130 |	Stroller
EDL	00:06:24,255	00:06:24,767	| IOT130 |	Yes
EDL	00:06:25,279	00:06:26,047	| IOT130 |	So
EDL	00:06:26,047	00:06:28,095	| IOT130 |	This is the big news
EDL	00:06:30,143	00:06:30,911	| IOT130 |	But that's what it is
EDL	00:06:30,911	00:06:32,447	| IOT130 |	So this is Nest overalls
EDL	00:06:32,447	00:06:33,471	| IOT130 |	Security system
EDL	00:06:33,471	00:06:35,263	| IOT130 |	And we'll get into the features
EDL	00:06:36,031	00:06:37,823	| IOT130 |	You probably already read about those
EDL	00:06:37,823	00:06:39,359	| IOT130 |	But there's two elements here that
EDL	00:06:39,359	00:06:40,127	| IOT130 |	Really
EDL	00:06:40,127	00:06:42,175	| IOT130 |	Fighting one is the return of
EDL	00:06:42,175	00:06:43,455	| IOT130 |	Weave which is
EDL	00:06:43,455	00:06:45,503	| IOT130 |	Speakable protocol for
EDL	00:06:45,503	00:06:46,783	| IOT130 |	Device Communications
EDL	00:06:46,783	00:06:49,343	| IOT130 |	In home so like it'll be like hey
EDL	00:06:49,343	00:06:52,927	| IOT130 |	I would like I can turn on and off that's kind of what we've does every device
EDL	00:06:53,439	00:06:54,207	| IOT130 |	Can say what it does
EDL	00:06:54,207	00:06:54,719	| IOT130 |	Aunt
EDL	00:06:55,231	00:06:55,999	| IOT130 |	All the other devices
EDL	00:06:58,047	00:06:58,815	| IOT130 |	We know it's like
EDL	00:06:59,327	00:07:01,119	| IOT130 |	So the other piece of news
EDL	00:07:01,119	00:07:04,703	| IOT130 |	Is the other thing that Kevin is really excited about I don't
EDL	00:07:04,703	00:07:05,471	| IOT130 |	Blame him
EDL	00:07:05,471	00:07:07,007	| IOT130 |	Is there going to be the nest
EDL	00:07:07,519	00:07:08,287	| IOT130 |	Connect
EDL	00:07:08,287	00:07:11,103	| IOT130 |	Which is a device that's going to both.
EDL	00:07:11,103	00:07:11,871	| IOT130 |	Heater for light
EDL	00:07:12,383	00:07:13,151	| IOT130 |	Red
EDL	00:07:13,151	00:07:14,175	| IOT130 |	Stuff in your home
EDL	00:07:14,175	00:07:16,223	| IOT130 |	And thread is a nest
EDL	00:07:16,223	00:07:17,247	| IOT130 |	Designed
EDL	00:07:17,247	00:07:19,295	| IOT130 |	Protocol that actually is a wireless
EDL	00:07:19,807	00:07:20,575	| IOT130 |	Protocol
EDL	00:07:20,575	00:07:22,111	| IOT130 |	It's on par with like
EDL	00:07:22,111	00:07:23,903	| IOT130 |	Zigbee or Z-Wave
EDL	00:07:23,903	00:07:25,183	| IOT130 |	So it is a mesh Network
EDL	00:07:25,183	00:07:27,231	| IOT130 |	Dang it runs over the same radio actually that
EDL	00:07:27,231	00:07:27,743	| IOT130 |	Sopitas
EDL	00:07:29,535	00:07:30,303	| IOT130 |	Anyway
EDL	00:07:30,303	00:07:31,839	| IOT130 |	This thing also access
EDL	00:07:31,839	00:07:32,607	| IOT130 |	What is attacked at
EDL	00:07:33,119	00:07:33,887	| IOT130 |	I get the
EDL	00:07:34,399	00:07:37,471	| IOT130 |	Session border controller SBC
EDL	00:07:37,471	00:07:37,983	| IOT130 |	Indecision
EDL	00:07:39,519	00:07:42,847	| IOT130 |	Because what it could theoretically do if we're right
EDL	00:07:42,847	00:07:49,247	| IOT130 |	Session border controller skin kind of create or Bridge networks together that use in Enterprise and even when I carry
EDL	00:07:49,247	00:07:51,551	| IOT130 |	Facilities and what you could do is
EDL	00:07:51,551	00:07:53,087	| IOT130 |	Essentially have that
EDL	00:07:53,087	00:07:54,111	| IOT130 |	Secure
EDL	00:07:54,111	00:07:58,207	| IOT130 |	Iot Network kind of inside your regular home network with this
EDL	00:07:58,207	00:07:59,743	| IOT130 |	Again if we're understanding this correct
EDL	00:08:00,255	00:08:01,023	| IOT130 |	Yes
EDL	00:08:01,023	00:08:01,791	| IOT130 |	So
EDL	00:08:01,791	00:08:04,095	| IOT130 |	Lots of questions and actually next week
EDL	00:08:04,095	00:08:06,143	| IOT130 |	That writers of Nest will be here in the park
EDL	00:08:07,679	00:08:09,983	| IOT130 |	So this would be exciting it would add
EDL	00:08:09,983	00:08:11,519	| IOT130 |	A lot of security we think it
EDL	00:08:12,287	00:08:13,567	| IOT130 |	The most
EDL	00:08:13,567	00:08:16,383	| IOT130 |	Interesting news here because this real problem
EDL	00:08:17,663	00:08:18,943	| IOT130 |	Meeting is private.
EDL	00:08:19,967	00:08:20,991	| IOT130 |	Now this network
EDL	00:08:21,759	00:08:22,271	| IOT130 |	Weave
EDL	00:08:24,831	00:08:27,903	| IOT130 |	This is important for your security system because you know
EDL	00:08:27,903	00:08:29,951	| IOT130 |	But it helps keep it more tamper-proof
EDL	00:08:29,951	00:08:32,255	| IOT130 |	Hopefully but let's talk quickly about the
EDL	00:08:32,255	00:08:33,023	| IOT130 |	Security system
EDL	00:08:33,023	00:08:34,047	| IOT130 |	Cuz there's some things to like in a
EDL	00:08:36,607	00:08:37,375	| IOT130 |	Things I wish
EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:40,191	| IOT130 |	So
EDL	00:08:40,191	00:08:40,959	| IOT130 |	Thirsty
EDL	00:08:40,959	00:08:41,727	| IOT130 |	It's $500
EDL	00:08:42,239	00:08:42,751	| IOT130 |	So this is actually
EDL	00:08:43,519	00:08:44,287	| IOT130 |	Reasonable price
EDL	00:08:44,287	00:08:46,079	| IOT130 |	For what is a
EDL	00:08:46,079	00:08:49,919	| IOT130 |	Hub 2 sensors and then to kind of presence detection pops
EDL	00:08:49,919	00:08:52,479	| IOT130 |	Sonus Calls the Heart but guard and
EDL	00:08:52,479	00:08:55,807	| IOT130 |	It has a motion sensor it has a siren on it
EDL	00:08:55,807	00:08:57,087	| IOT130 |	And it has
EDL	00:08:57,087	00:09:00,415	| IOT130 |	So it works like an alarm system you come in and
EDL	00:09:00,415	00:09:02,207	| IOT130 |	Can't you punch in the keypad or
EDL	00:09:02,207	00:09:03,999	| IOT130 |	You can come in and use one of the
EDL	00:09:03,999	00:09:04,767	| IOT130 |	The presence of tag
EDL	00:09:06,047	00:09:08,351	| IOT130 |	Stacks and you wave it over it or you can disarm it
EDL	00:09:10,143	00:09:10,911	| IOT130 |	I kind of
EDL	00:09:10,911	00:09:11,679	| IOT130 |	I wanted something
EDL	00:09:12,959	00:09:15,519	| IOT130 |	Like my favorite feature in the entire world
EDL	00:09:15,519	00:09:16,287	| IOT130 |	Apple Smart Home
EDL	00:09:16,287	00:09:21,663	| IOT130 |	And I'm so sad no one else does it is netatmo has a facial recognition you can train it to recognize
EDL	00:09:21,663	00:09:22,175	| IOT130 |	People eater
EDL	00:09:22,687	00:09:23,711	| IOT130 |	And then
EDL	00:09:23,711	00:09:26,271	| IOT130 |	It arms itself at a certain point like you
EDL	00:09:26,271	00:09:29,087	| IOT130 |	Until it's 15 minutes after you don't see anyone in my family
EDL	00:09:29,087	00:09:30,879	| IOT130 |	Armed and so it automatically arms
EDL	00:09:32,159	00:09:33,695	| IOT130 |	I like it when someone come
EDL	00:09:35,231	00:09:36,511	| IOT130 |	If you want to disarm
EDL	00:09:37,023	00:09:39,071	| IOT130 |	And you can actually I believe say disarm
EDL	00:09:40,863	00:09:43,423	| IOT130 |	So you don't think that would be a fun
EDL	00:09:43,423	00:09:44,959	| IOT130 |	Option for the nest because then you don't have to
EDL	00:09:45,727	00:09:47,263	| IOT130 |	Wear something punch something or
EDL	00:09:47,263	00:09:48,287	| IOT130 |	Do something
EDL	00:09:49,823	00:09:50,847	| IOT130 |	Ennis
EDL	00:09:50,847	00:09:51,871	| IOT130 |	They have the camera
EDL	00:09:51,871	00:09:53,919	| IOT130 |	So I have to assume something like that
EDL	00:09:53,919	00:09:54,943	| IOT130 |	Could be updated
EDL	00:09:56,223	00:09:58,783	| IOT130 |	And then finally there's these Nest detect
EDL	00:09:58,783	00:09:59,807	| IOT130 |	Spencer's they're little
EDL	00:10:00,319	00:10:01,855	| IOT130 |	Multi sensors date
EDL	00:10:01,855	00:10:02,879	| IOT130 |	Door window
EDL	00:10:02,879	00:10:05,439	| IOT130 |	The clothes in the mail so act as a motion sensor
EDL	00:10:05,439	00:10:07,487	| IOT130 |	Pop it on your wall and it will be
EDL	00:10:07,999	00:10:10,303	| IOT130 |	Which is kind of unique thing
EDL	00:10:10,303	00:10:11,839	| IOT130 |	Most overdosed sensors in motion
EDL	00:10:12,351	00:10:13,119	| IOT130 |	Separate
EDL	00:10:13,119	00:10:19,263	| IOT130 |	And if you want to buy more of them you can they're $59 and then the tags that you have more than two people in your family
EDL	00:10:19,263	00:10:22,335	| IOT130 |	Starter pack comes with two you can buy more of those for
EDL	00:10:22,335	00:10:22,847	| IOT130 |	$25
EDL	00:10:24,127	00:10:26,175	| IOT130 |	These are also kind of like
EDL	00:10:26,175	00:10:26,943	| IOT130 |	Tiles in the sea
EDL	00:10:26,943	00:10:28,479	| IOT130 |	When you run out of battery on
EDL	00:10:34,879	00:10:35,391	| IOT130 |	So
EDL	00:10:35,903	00:10:37,183	| IOT130 |	That's all the News That's fit to
EDL	00:10:37,183	00:10:38,463	| IOT130 |	Or talk about
EDL	00:10:38,463	00:10:39,231	| IOT130 |	Unnest
EDL	00:10:39,231	00:10:41,023	| IOT130 |	Thoughts here are
EDL	00:10:41,023	00:10:42,815	| IOT130 |	I like this idea
EDL	00:10:42,815	00:10:43,327	| IOT130 |	Of
EDL	00:10:43,839	00:10:44,607	| IOT130 |	You know having this
EDL	00:10:44,607	00:10:46,399	| IOT130 |	Extender that also acts as like a
EDL	00:10:46,911	00:10:47,935	| IOT130 |	A bridge between your network
EDL	00:10:48,959	00:10:51,775	| IOT130 |	I feel like they cut it a little bit more innovative
EDL	00:10:51,775	00:10:53,311	| IOT130 |	Anna home security front
EDL	00:10:53,311	00:10:55,359	| IOT130 |	But maybe we're just going to wait and see
EDL	00:10:55,359	00:11:01,759	| IOT130 |	It's a start I'm actually more excited because this is really in my opinion the first time since Google
EDL	00:11:01,759	00:11:03,295	| IOT130 |	Alphabet bought nest
EDL	00:11:03,295	00:11:08,415	| IOT130 |	That we've had a true integration between what Google currently offers and what Nest has
EDL	00:11:08,927	00:11:09,951	| IOT130 |	It's been a long time
EDL	00:11:09,951	00:11:12,255	| IOT130 |	As long time, cuz basically
EDL	00:11:12,255	00:11:14,047	| IOT130 |	All we saw that was that
EDL	00:11:14,047	00:11:16,607	| IOT130 |	Hey just always worked with your Google home
EDL	00:11:17,119	00:11:18,655	| IOT130 |	Google assist
EDL	00:11:18,655	00:11:19,679	| IOT130 |	Not always
EDL	00:11:19,679	00:11:20,703	| IOT130 |	It was one of the first
EDL	00:11:20,703	00:11:21,983	| IOT130 |	Innovations that was.
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:23,007	| IOT130 |	And I was being sent up there
EDL	00:11:24,031	00:11:30,175	| IOT130 |	So you're right that is good and I I also like that this is actually a very easy alarm system
EDL	00:11:30,687	00:11:31,967	| IOT130 |	Car security system
EDL	00:11:31,967	00:11:32,735	| IOT130 |	To build an a
EDL	00:11:32,735	00:11:33,247	| IOT130 |	Install
EDL	00:11:34,271	00:11:36,063	| IOT130 |	But also public cellular backup
EDL	00:11:36,575	00:11:40,671	| IOT130 |	Prices are details on that yet but cellular backup in a battery so
EDL	00:11:40,671	00:11:43,743	| IOT130 |	But it is still DIY so a lot of people might say
EDL	00:11:43,743	00:11:46,047	| IOT130 |	Oh that's cool I want to do that
EDL	00:11:46,047	00:11:47,839	| IOT130 |	And it kinda reminds me like a
EDL	00:11:47,839	00:11:50,911	| IOT130 |	Abode or less a SimpliSafe cuz I've got a monitor
EDL	00:11:51,679	00:11:54,495	| IOT130 |	This could have a manager component if you want it later
EDL	00:11:54,495	00:11:57,567	| IOT130 |	Nestos plan to introduce that at some point in future
EDL	00:11:57,567	00:12:00,895	| IOT130 |	So I don't know I feel like this is a pretty approachable way
EDL	00:12:01,407	00:12:02,687	| IOT130 |	To do security
EDL	00:12:02,687	00:12:03,711	| IOT130 |	Do people like Ark
EDL	00:12:03,711	00:12:04,991	| IOT130 |	Color last week actually
EDL	00:12:04,991	00:12:06,783	| IOT130 |	But
EDL	00:12:06,783	00:12:07,807	| IOT130 |	Best of them alone
EDL	00:12:07,807	00:12:12,159	| IOT130 |	We're going to see a lot more companies coming in with this ring is building an alarm system and
EDL	00:12:12,671	00:12:13,695	| IOT130 |	We also have
EDL	00:12:13,695	00:12:18,815	| IOT130 |	Comcast and their scheme of the existing alarm systems although ATT
EDL	00:12:18,815	00:12:19,327	| IOT130 |	Stopped with
EDL	00:12:20,095	00:12:20,863	| IOT130 |	Soap
EDL	00:12:20,863	00:12:21,887	| IOT130 |	I don't know what time
EDL	00:12:24,191	00:12:30,335	| IOT130 |	And we might have a alarm system from another company that we all know which I never to talk about a few minutes
EDL	00:12:30,847	00:12:33,151	| IOT130 |	Sexy saying we are
EDL	00:12:36,223	00:12:37,247	| IOT130 |	Yeah tell me
EDL	00:12:37,247	00:12:38,527	| IOT130 |	Don't keep me in suspense
EDL	00:12:38,527	00:12:39,039	| IOT130 |	Amazon
EDL	00:12:42,879	00:12:44,159	| IOT130 |	All right talk about that
EDL	00:12:44,671	00:12:49,279	| IOT130 |	Answer this news just hit this week and it is just a report in the financial times
EDL	00:12:50,047	00:12:53,119	| IOT130 |	That Amazon is reportedly making
EDL	00:12:53,119	00:12:54,143	| IOT130 |	Two things
EDL	00:12:54,143	00:12:56,703	| IOT130 |	1 is a pair of smart glasses with
EDL	00:12:56,703	00:13:03,103	| IOT130 |	She shall not be named assistant built in
EDL	00:13:03,103	00:13:09,503	| IOT130 |	Apparently her camera glass did I kind of wish it will have a camera
EDL	00:13:09,503	00:13:15,647	| IOT130 |	Pictures more for scanning objects when I'm shopping I can just take a picture of something
EDL	00:13:16,159	00:13:18,719	| IOT130 |	What it is and tell me what the cheapest prices on Amazon
EDL	00:13:21,023	00:13:21,791	| IOT130 |	Security bit
EDL	00:13:22,303	00:13:25,887	| IOT130 |	The financial times says that Amazon's working at home security camera
EDL	00:13:25,887	00:13:27,935	| IOT130 |	It's Echo devices
EDL	00:13:28,447	00:13:32,031	| IOT130 |	So I don't know if they are reading into what the echo look does
EDL	00:13:32,543	00:13:36,639	| IOT130 |	Or they just have some good inside sources but it could be that
EDL	00:13:36,639	00:13:38,943	| IOT130 |	We have amazon security systems in the near future
EDL	00:13:40,735	00:13:43,551	| IOT130 |	So I have some thoughts about that because I actually
EDL	00:13:43,551	00:13:45,599	| IOT130 |	Use the Echo Show
EDL	00:13:45,599	00:13:48,671	| IOT130 |	Because I have these doorbells that work with it from August
EDL	00:13:48,671	00:13:49,951	| IOT130 |	I actually
EDL	00:13:49,951	00:13:54,303	| IOT130 |	Can see like I can see who's at my door on my show and then I can actually with her
EDL	00:13:54,303	00:13:55,071	| IOT130 |	See what's happening
EDL	00:13:57,631	00:14:03,775	| IOT130 |	So you can put your own system together now with Amazon as part of it but I'm wondering are they going to supply a hole
EDL	00:14:04,287	00:14:06,335	| IOT130 |	System and maybe even
EDL	00:14:06,335	00:14:08,127	| IOT130 |	Inexpensive monitoring system
EDL	00:14:08,127	00:14:10,431	| IOT130 |	Maybe because they actually have been
EDL	00:14:10,431	00:14:14,783	| IOT130 |	Show me the news at cedia was that they've been pressuring their Partners to really
EDL	00:14:14,783	00:14:16,319	| IOT130 |	Go all-in.
EDL	00:14:16,319	00:14:18,111	| IOT130 |	To get a madame a badge
EDL	00:14:18,623	00:14:21,439	| IOT130 |	You have you have to bring your
EDL	00:14:21,439	00:14:22,207	| IOT130 |	Camera stuff
EDL	00:14:22,207	00:14:23,231	| IOT130 |	Into
EDL	00:14:23,231	00:14:24,511	| IOT130 |	The show
EDL	00:14:24,511	00:14:25,279	| IOT130 |	So
EDL	00:14:25,279	00:14:25,791	| IOT130 |	That would it
EDL	00:14:26,303	00:14:27,071	| IOT130 |	Explain
EDL	00:14:27,071	00:14:28,095	| IOT130 |	Why they're soaked
EDL	00:14:28,095	00:14:28,863	| IOT130 |	Keen on that
EDL	00:14:28,863	00:14:31,167	| IOT130 |	Some of their partners are like really really I just
EDL	00:14:31,167	00:14:31,935	| IOT130 |	I want to
EDL	00:14:31,935	00:14:33,727	| IOT130 |	Just a plain old skill that says
EDL	00:14:34,239	00:14:37,055	| IOT130 |	I feel that does the things I wanted to I don't want to
EDL	00:14:37,055	00:14:38,335	| IOT130 |	Do the formal
EDL	00:14:38,335	00:14:39,103	| IOT130 |	Amazon
EDL	00:14:39,103	00:14:42,431	| IOT130 |	Programs it gets me this bad but now I kind of need a badge
EDL	00:14:42,431	00:14:43,455	| IOT130 |	Because I don't work
EDL	00:14:43,455	00:14:44,223	| IOT130 |	Work with the echo
EDL	00:14:46,271	00:14:47,039	| IOT130 |	Very interesting
EDL	00:14:47,039	00:14:49,343	| IOT130 |	So yeah if glasses are confusing to me
EDL	00:14:49,343	00:14:52,159	| IOT130 |	They sounds like glasses that act like the airpods
EDL	00:14:52,159	00:14:54,207	| IOT130 |	Because it's not going to have a screen or a camera
EDL	00:14:54,207	00:15:00,351	| IOT130 |	Conduction speaker which is exactly what
EDL	00:15:00,863	00:15:07,263	| IOT130 |	Which was easy to hear and other people really couldn't hear it when they're around you so that's a way to get that assistant
EDL	00:15:07,263	00:15:11,871	| IOT130 |	Type information only into your brain and not out in the general conversation
EDL	00:15:11,871	00:15:12,639	| IOT130 |	Why not to
EDL	00:15:13,663	00:15:14,687	| IOT130 |	Maybe
EDL	00:15:15,199	00:15:18,527	| IOT130 |	Peapod's yes
EDL	00:15:21,855	00:15:22,623	| IOT130 |	Yeah yeah
EDL	00:15:23,135	00:15:23,903	| IOT130 |	Don't know
EDL	00:15:23,903	00:15:25,695	| IOT130 |	I mean yeah so what do you need glasses
EDL	00:15:27,487	00:15:33,887	| IOT130 |	Yes he that's kind of why I'm thinking maybe they do have a camera because what do they do today in the Amazon app you can scan
EDL	00:15:33,887	00:15:35,423	| IOT130 |	Items and it magically
EDL	00:15:35,935	00:15:40,287	| IOT130 |	You sees them and determines what it is and it returns
EDL	00:15:40,287	00:15:42,847	| IOT130 |	I think if you're going to have glasses I think you're going to have a
EDL	00:15:42,847	00:15:44,127	| IOT130 |	A camera just for that reason
EDL	00:15:44,127	00:15:46,431	| IOT130 |	Not to take pictures of people in space
EDL	00:15:46,431	00:15:47,711	| IOT130 |	Record things
EDL	00:15:47,711	00:15:48,735	| IOT130 |	Stop Chatham
EDL	00:15:48,735	00:15:50,015	| IOT130 |	But two
EDL	00:15:50,015	00:15:51,295	| IOT130 |	Get you to buy more stuff
EDL	00:15:51,295	00:15:52,319	| IOT130 |	From Amazon
EDL	00:15:52,319	00:15:53,855	| IOT130 |	That's always what it comes out to
EDL	00:15:54,623	00:15:56,415	| IOT130 |	And nobody should take pictures of themselves
EDL	00:15:56,415	00:15:56,927	| IOT130 |	Whippies
EDL	00:15:58,975	00:16:00,511	| IOT130 |	Let's talk now about
EDL	00:16:00,511	00:16:01,023	| IOT130 |	August
EDL	00:16:01,535	00:16:04,351	| IOT130 |	Everything's getting over shattered so much news
EDL	00:16:04,351	00:16:05,887	| IOT130 |	But August this week
EDL	00:16:05,887	00:16:06,655	| IOT130 |	Launched
EDL	00:16:06,655	00:16:08,703	| IOT130 |	New devices
EDL	00:16:08,703	00:16:09,727	| IOT130 |	And theater
EDL	00:16:09,727	00:16:12,031	| IOT130 |	Lovely devices I installed
EDL	00:16:12,031	00:16:13,567	| IOT130 |	One of them but doing really good
EDL	00:16:13,567	00:16:15,871	| IOT130 |	Play with it so next week I will tell you all about it
EDL	00:16:16,383	00:16:18,687	| IOT130 |	So the three things they added are a
EDL	00:16:18,687	00:16:20,479	| IOT130 |	Fancy 279
EDL	00:16:20,991	00:16:21,503	| IOT130 |	Smart Lock
EDL	00:16:22,015	00:16:22,527	| IOT130 |	Row
EDL	00:16:23,039	00:16:23,807	| IOT130 |	And that is
EDL	00:16:24,319	00:16:25,599	| IOT130 |	It's basically like the homekit
EDL	00:16:26,111	00:16:27,647	| IOT130 |	Smart Lock that they really
EDL	00:16:27,647	00:16:28,671	| IOT130 |	Lease last year
EDL	00:16:28,671	00:16:29,183	| IOT130 |	Siri
EDL	00:16:30,719	00:16:32,767	| IOT130 |	Google Assistant but it also has the August
EDL	00:16:33,791	00:16:36,607	| IOT130 |	And I think they were you triggered some things and then they
EDL	00:16:36,607	00:16:38,399	| IOT130 |	The big news is they added
EDL	00:16:38,399	00:16:38,911	| IOT130 |	Capability
EDL	00:16:39,423	00:16:39,935	| IOT130 |	Doorsense
EDL	00:16:40,447	00:16:41,215	| IOT130 |	So this
EDL	00:16:41,215	00:16:45,055	| IOT130 |	This has a sensor built into the Locking a sensor that comes separately that you stick on the door
EDL	00:16:45,055	00:16:47,103	| IOT130 |	Basically says hey is this door open
EDL	00:16:47,615	00:16:49,151	| IOT130 |	Closed cuz what happens is
EDL	00:16:49,151	00:16:49,663	| IOT130 |	What's some people say
EDL	00:16:50,175	00:16:53,247	| IOT130 |	They walk out the remotely enable the door lock
EDL	00:16:53,247	00:16:54,015	| IOT130 |	At the door
EDL	00:16:54,015	00:16:54,527	| IOT130 |	Is actually still
EDL	00:16:55,295	00:16:56,831	| IOT130 |	And there's actually no way
EDL	00:16:56,831	00:16:57,599	| IOT130 |	Tell that
EDL	00:16:57,599	00:16:58,367	| IOT130 |	Without
EDL	00:16:58,367	00:17:00,159	| IOT130 |	So you be like your walking around
EDL	00:17:00,159	00:17:00,927	| IOT130 |	All day
EDL	00:17:00,927	00:17:01,695	| IOT130 |	Your doors wide open
EDL	00:17:03,999	00:17:04,511	| IOT130 |	And that is a sad
EDL	00:17:05,023	00:17:06,559	| IOT130 |	So that is what August
EDL	00:17:06,559	00:17:07,327	| IOT130 |	Doorsense
EDL	00:17:07,327	00:17:07,839	| IOT130 |	Does
EDL	00:17:08,351	00:17:08,863	| IOT130 |	Yay
EDL	00:17:09,631	00:17:10,399	| IOT130 |	You'll know if your doors closed
EDL	00:17:11,935	00:17:15,263	| IOT130 |	I actually I run into this problem all the time because my daughter takes
EDL	00:17:15,263	00:17:18,847	| IOT130 |	A jar slightly just a little bit in the door lock
EDL	00:17:18,847	00:17:21,919	| IOT130 |	Can't get into its insertion point so and I don't know that
EDL	00:17:21,919	00:17:24,991	| IOT130 |	So that it is a problem for me but in your case
EDL	00:17:25,503	00:17:26,271	| IOT130 |	Just as it
EDL	00:17:26,271	00:17:26,783	| IOT130 |	Unlocked cell
EDL	00:17:28,063	00:17:28,831	| IOT130 |	It does
EDL	00:17:28,831	00:17:30,879	| IOT130 |	That's true if I go check that's correct
EDL	00:17:32,159	00:17:32,927	| IOT130 |	Now
EDL	00:17:32,927	00:17:34,207	| IOT130 |	I will say also
EDL	00:17:34,719	00:17:35,231	| IOT130 |	Tapered deadbolt
EDL	00:17:37,279	00:17:40,863	| IOT130 |	But there is more there is a noun
EDL	00:17:40,863	00:17:41,631	| IOT130 |	Cheaper smart
EDL	00:17:42,143	00:17:42,911	| IOT130 |	Is 149
EDL	00:17:43,679	00:17:45,471	| IOT130 |	That's going to replace
EDL	00:17:45,471	00:17:46,239	| IOT130 |	It's
EDL	00:17:46,239	00:17:47,007	| IOT130 |	Baidu
EDL	00:17:47,007	00:17:50,335	| IOT130 |	It's a bottom-line Smart Lock but that's what it is so
EDL	00:17:50,847	00:17:52,639	| IOT130 |	Entry-level thank you thank you
EDL	00:17:52,639	00:17:53,663	| IOT130 |	But it is
EDL	00:17:53,663	00:17:54,687	| IOT130 |	It is funky
EDL	00:17:56,223	00:17:56,735	| IOT130 |	This
EDL	00:17:57,247	00:17:59,039	| IOT130 |	I don't know how you just have to look at a pic
EDL	00:17:59,039	00:18:05,439	| IOT130 |	Picture it's funky looking it's not the Yves Behar designed around chunk it looks more like a traditional lock.
EDL	00:18:05,439	00:18:06,463	| IOT130 |	That goes over your door
EDL	00:18:07,231	00:18:07,999	| IOT130 |	Kind of big
EDL	00:18:07,999	00:18:09,791	| IOT130 |	Some people will like it some people want
EDL	00:18:09,791	00:18:10,815	| IOT130 |	As is the case in
EDL	00:18:11,583	00:18:12,607	| IOT130 |	So
EDL	00:18:12,607	00:18:14,399	| IOT130 |	It also will have doorsense
EDL	00:18:14,399	00:18:15,167	| IOT130 |	But it won't support hose
EDL	00:18:16,191	00:18:16,703	| IOT130 |	And then finally
EDL	00:18:17,215	00:18:17,727	| IOT130 |	The news
EDL	00:18:18,239	00:18:19,519	| IOT130 |	Did I am super
EDL	00:18:19,519	00:18:20,287	| IOT130 |	Super
EDL	00:18:20,287	00:18:23,871	| IOT130 |	Super excited about introduced another doorbell Cam and maybe this time
EDL	00:18:25,407	00:18:26,175	| IOT130 |	I don't have this
EDL	00:18:26,687	00:18:27,967	| IOT130 |	But I will get one
EDL	00:18:27,967	00:18:28,991	| IOT130 |	II
EDL	00:18:28,991	00:18:30,015	| IOT130 |	Did it comes out
EDL	00:18:30,015	00:18:30,783	| IOT130 |	Because I love
EDL	00:18:30,783	00:18:32,063	| IOT130 |	The look at the August doorbell
EDL	00:18:33,087	00:18:34,623	| IOT130 |	I liked a lot of the features but
EDL	00:18:34,623	00:18:35,391	| IOT130 |	It was a terrible
EDL	00:18:35,903	00:18:41,023	| IOT130 |	Two reasons one connectivity was always kind of an issue is very sensitive that way and it drew a lot of
EDL	00:18:41,023	00:18:42,559	| IOT130 |	Power so that's what
EDL	00:18:42,559	00:18:44,095	| IOT130 |	They say that they redone the
EDL	00:18:44,095	00:18:44,863	| IOT130 |	Antenna design
EDL	00:18:44,863	00:18:48,447	| IOT130 |	So the connectivity is better but they also have solved another problem
EDL	00:18:48,447	00:18:50,751	| IOT130 |	Which was they didn't actually put any sort of
EDL	00:18:50,751	00:18:51,519	| IOT130 |	Camera that can
EDL	00:18:51,519	00:18:52,287	| IOT130 |	Can see in the dark
EDL	00:18:52,287	00:18:54,079	| IOT130 |	So no IR no night vision
EDL	00:18:54,079	00:18:57,151	| IOT130 |	Hang on there so it when it's dark you can't actually see who's at your
EDL	00:18:57,151	00:19:02,015	| IOT130 |	A lot of people may not have an issue with this because they're street lights and stuff and it does well in those situation
EDL	00:19:02,527	00:19:04,831	| IOT130 |	But now it has a flood like it holy cow
EDL	00:19:04,831	00:19:05,599	| IOT130 |	A floodlight looks
EDL	00:19:06,111	00:19:06,879	| IOT130 |	Peri-Peri
EDL	00:19:06,879	00:19:07,647	| IOT130 |	So that's
EDL	00:19:08,415	00:19:08,927	| IOT130 |	Adventure
EDL	00:19:10,463	00:19:15,583	| IOT130 |	I don't know if I wanted like black people in the face with light with a ring or doorbell
EDL	00:19:15,583	00:19:17,119	| IOT130 |	But we'll see
EDL	00:19:17,119	00:19:21,215	| IOT130 |	So I can't wait to test that and next week I'll tell you all about how
EDL	00:19:21,215	00:19:22,239	| IOT130 |	Deluxe work
EDL	00:19:22,239	00:19:23,007	| IOT130 |	Compared to the
EDL	00:19:24,287	00:19:26,335	| IOT130 |	So that is a lot of news
EDL	00:19:27,103	00:19:27,871	| IOT130 |	I feel
EDL	00:19:27,871	00:19:28,639	| IOT130 |	Bright Kevin
EDL	00:19:28,639	00:19:30,943	| IOT130 |	So let's move over into some of the
EDL	00:19:30,943	00:19:31,711	| IOT130 |	Quaker newspaper
EDL	00:19:32,223	00:19:34,783	| IOT130 |	Before getting to LT watches from Apple and
EDL	00:19:36,575	00:19:38,623	| IOT130 |	Ready Google home mini go
EDL	00:19:38,623	00:19:45,023	| IOT130 |	Google how many $49 is there in may hear about this on October 4th it looks like a small
EDL	00:19:45,023	00:19:51,167	| IOT130 |	Speaker just like you'd expect round, pill shape that would call it doesn't do anything different that we're going to
EDL	00:19:52,959	00:19:56,287	| IOT130 |	If you're into the Google home ecosystem and you don't want
EDL	00:19:56,287	00:19:58,591	| IOT130 |	Dad Echo dots you could add a Google home Mini
EDL	00:19:58,591	00:20:00,127	| IOT130 |	Perhaps after October 4th is my guess
EDL	00:20:00,639	00:20:01,151	| IOT130 |	Or
EDL	00:20:01,919	00:20:03,967	| IOT130 |	You can just wait till sometime in winter
EDL	00:20:03,967	00:20:05,759	| IOT130 |	Enable it on your fancy fancy camera
EDL	00:20:05,759	00:20:07,039	| IOT130 |	You can't have it
EDL	00:20:08,319	00:20:10,111	| IOT130 |	Silver Springs which is a
EDL	00:20:10,623	00:20:11,647	| IOT130 |	Smart grid startup
EDL	00:20:12,671	00:20:16,255	| IOT130 |	It's publicly traded company has been around for a really long time
EDL	00:20:16,767	00:20:17,791	| IOT130 |	They built
EDL	00:20:17,791	00:20:18,815	| IOT130 |	A smart grid system
EDL	00:20:19,583	00:20:20,351	| IOT130 |	In the early aughts
EDL	00:20:20,351	00:20:21,631	| IOT130 |	And they were bought
EDL	00:20:21,631	00:20:23,423	| IOT130 |	Buy itron
EDL	00:20:23,423	00:20:24,703	| IOT130 |	Interesting here
EDL	00:20:24,703	00:20:27,519	| IOT130 |	They were bought for 1625 per share
EDL	00:20:27,519	00:20:29,311	| IOT130 |	That was just a premium of 25%
EDL	00:20:30,335	00:20:30,847	| IOT130 |	Silver Springs
EDL	00:20:31,615	00:20:33,919	| IOT130 |	Its Revenue growth was not everything it should be
EDL	00:20:33,919	00:20:35,967	| IOT130 |	Its total value was eight hundred
EDL	00:20:35,967	00:20:36,735	| IOT130 |	30 million
EDL	00:20:38,271	00:20:39,039	| IOT130 |	And
EDL	00:20:39,039	00:20:40,063	| IOT130 |	Basically
EDL	00:20:40,063	00:20:43,135	| IOT130 |	Silver Spring was trying to transition from the smart grid into
EDL	00:20:43,135	00:20:44,415	| IOT130 |	Smart cities and Lighting
EDL	00:20:45,183	00:20:46,719	| IOT130 |	Itron is a
EDL	00:20:46,719	00:20:47,487	| IOT130 |	Company in the
EDL	00:20:47,487	00:20:47,999	| IOT130 |	Energy Spa
EDL	00:20:48,511	00:20:53,887	| IOT130 |	So you basically they do energy and water usage so they try to help
EDL	00:20:53,887	00:20:54,911	| IOT130 |	Utilities
EDL	00:20:54,911	00:20:56,959	| IOT130 |	Cities manage our resources
EDL	00:20:56,959	00:20:59,007	| IOT130 |	Sufficiently so this makes sense
EDL	00:20:59,007	00:21:00,799	| IOT130 |	It makes me feel like the Silver Springs
EDL	00:21:00,799	00:21:02,591	| IOT130 |	Smart cities efforts
EDL	00:21:02,591	00:21:03,615	| IOT130 |	When panning out
EDL	00:21:03,615	00:21:05,151	| IOT130 |	Or maybe itron is just going in
EDL	00:21:06,175	00:21:06,943	| IOT130 |	Big news
EDL	00:21:07,711	00:21:08,735	| IOT130 |	Finally
EDL	00:21:08,735	00:21:10,527	| IOT130 |	Comcast bought
EDL	00:21:10,527	00:21:11,807	| IOT130 |	Stringify
EDL	00:21:11,807	00:21:13,599	| IOT130 |	Comcast is not commenting
EDL	00:21:13,599	00:21:15,135	| IOT130 |	On the deal but
EDL	00:21:15,135	00:21:16,416	| IOT130 |	I got an email from
EDL	00:21:17,696	00:21:19,744	| IOT130 |	Subscriber user whatever the word is
EDL	00:21:19,744	00:21:20,768	| IOT130 |	And
EDL	00:21:20,768	00:21:22,560	| IOT130 |	I got an email and everything
EDL	00:21:25,376	00:21:27,168	| IOT130 |	So Comcast isn't talking about it
EDL	00:21:27,168	00:21:29,984	| IOT130 |	But basically stringify was a way to
EDL	00:21:29,984	00:21:30,752	| IOT130 |	Paul
EDL	00:21:30,752	00:21:31,520	| IOT130 |	Services
EDL	00:21:31,520	00:21:34,080	| IOT130 |	So many devices
EDL	00:21:34,080	00:21:36,384	| IOT130 |	Together for users in the
EDL	00:21:36,384	00:21:37,408	| IOT130 |	Idea was
EDL	00:21:37,408	00:21:38,944	| IOT130 |	Companies would also
EDL	00:21:38,944	00:21:40,224	| IOT130 |	Payit2
EDL	00:21:40,224	00:21:41,248	| IOT130 |	Get there
EDL	00:21:41,248	00:21:42,016	| IOT130 |	Connected device
EDL	00:21:42,784	00:21:44,576	| IOT130 |	Together so I'm not sure what this is
EDL	00:21:44,576	00:21:47,648	| IOT130 |	Really a consumer-focused thing for Comcast or if this is
EDL	00:21:47,648	00:21:49,952	| IOT130 |	Part of like they're bigger business leanings
EDL	00:21:49,952	00:21:51,232	| IOT130 |	Cuz they got their machine
EDL	00:21:51,232	00:21:51,744	| IOT130 |	Two kind of
EDL	00:21:52,256	00:21:56,352	| IOT130 |	Offerings so that's what I'm actually looking forward to hearing about when they start
EDL	00:21:56,864	00:21:57,376	| IOT130 |	Which
EDL	00:21:57,888	00:21:58,656	| IOT130 |	They are not
EDL	00:21:58,656	00:21:59,168	| IOT130 |	Cuz I did not
EDL	00:21:59,680	00:22:00,192	| IOT130 |	To my request
EDL	00:22:01,728	00:22:03,776	| IOT130 |	I know these guys have in common
EDL	00:22:03,776	00:22:06,848	| IOT130 |	And we probably don't know the answer to this book stringified today is a
EDL	00:22:06,848	00:22:08,896	| IOT130 |	Free product for consumers to use right
EDL	00:22:09,920	00:22:12,736	| IOT130 |	Yeah my guess is we're going to find out very soon that it's not
EDL	00:22:13,760	00:22:14,272	| IOT130 |	So
EDL	00:22:14,784	00:22:15,808	| IOT130 |	Now that we've been through
EDL	00:22:15,808	00:22:16,320	| IOT130 |	Most of them
EDL	00:22:24,768	00:22:30,144	| IOT130 |	Yeah so I think last time we said or I said I was considering purchasing one and I can
EDL	00:22:30,144	00:22:31,680	| IOT130 |	Tell people now that I did
EDL	00:22:31,680	00:22:38,080	| IOT130 |	It's not here yet they will be here in time for the next show so I'll be able to discuss my thoughts on that I do have an Apple Watch series 2
EDL	00:22:38,080	00:22:39,616	| IOT130 |	So really this is just
EDL	00:22:39,616	00:22:45,504	| IOT130 |	Newer Hardware inside obviously LTE connection the reviews are hitting
EDL	00:22:45,504	00:22:51,904	| IOT130 |	I've already hit and I read through most of them and it seems like there are a fair number of issues probably the most negative Apple
EDL	00:22:51,904	00:22:54,720	| IOT130 |	Product reviews I've read amongst everyone
EDL	00:22:54,720	00:22:57,792	| IOT130 |	Reviews and total in probably forever quite honestly
EDL	00:22:57,792	00:23:04,192	| IOT130 |	Lots of challenges that are even appears to be an issue that apple is admitted to wear the watch is trying to connect to unknown
EDL	00:23:04,192	00:23:05,984	| IOT130 |	Wifi networks
EDL	00:23:05,984	00:23:08,032	| IOT130 |	And it will drop its LTE connection
EDL	00:23:08,032	00:23:11,360	| IOT130 |	And they are going to address any software update is what they say so there I would you to make rice
EDL	00:23:17,760	00:23:20,576	| IOT130 |	What LTE and any wearable is really
EDL	00:23:20,576	00:23:22,112	| IOT130 |	For because
EDL	00:23:22,112	00:23:23,904	| IOT130 |	All of the reviews have just gone
EDL	00:23:23,904	00:23:25,440	| IOT130 |	Off about the battery life when your
EDL	00:23:25,440	00:23:26,208	| IOT130 |	Talking
EDL	00:23:26,208	00:23:30,304	| IOT130 |	Making phone calls with this in lieu of your phone and I get that but
EDL	00:23:30,816	00:23:33,120	| IOT130 |	You have a much smaller battery than you would have been
EDL	00:23:33,120	00:23:35,168	| IOT130 |	Pinterest with this watch
EDL	00:23:35,168	00:23:39,008	| IOT130 |	An hour of talk time is not good this should not be a primary phone for anybody
EDL	00:23:39,008	00:23:41,056	| IOT130 |	It's a secondary phone device at
EDL	00:23:41,056	00:23:43,872	| IOT130 |	Best and I think people need to really understand that
EDL	00:23:44,384	00:23:47,456	| IOT130 |	The way apple is doing this from
EDL	00:23:47,456	00:23:51,296	| IOT130 |	Apple watches connected to your phone via Bluetooth it's going to use that connection
EDL	00:23:51,296	00:23:57,696	| IOT130 |	If it's not in Bluetooth range of a phone but it has more power
EDL	00:23:57,696	00:24:00,512	| IOT130 |	If it's not near your phone at all minis left the phone at home
EDL	00:24:00,512	00:24:06,912	| IOT130 |	Which is what most people try and do it this thing people then go up to the highest power connection that is LTE
EDL	00:24:06,912	00:24:10,240	| IOT130 |	Switching between connections here but don't think
EDL	00:24:10,240	00:24:14,336	| IOT130 |	That you're going to put your phone down at the house and walk out of the house for 8 hours and you're going to be
EDL	00:24:14,336	00:24:20,736	| IOT130 |	Fine just like you had your phone with you cuz that's not the case so I just one thing I want to point out with all these reviews I think they're all well worth reading
EDL	00:24:20,736	00:24:22,784	| IOT130 |	I think they're legitimate issues but I also think
EDL	00:24:22,784	00:24:23,808	| IOT130 |	You have to either
EDL	00:24:23,808	00:24:29,440	| IOT130 |	You got manager connections are going to manage your expectations so it's just a thought before I get my watch will see how it actually works when I get
EDL	00:24:31,488	00:24:32,768	| IOT130 |	Vintager connections
EDL	00:24:35,584	00:24:36,864	| IOT130 |	Can we trademark
EDL	00:24:37,632	00:24:38,656	| IOT130 |	Try
EDL	00:24:38,656	00:24:39,168	| IOT130 |	Alright
EDL	00:24:39,936	00:24:40,704	| IOT130 |	Now
EDL	00:24:40,704	00:24:41,472	| IOT130 |	Let's go
EDL	00:24:41,984	00:24:43,776	| IOT130 |	To the hotline
EDL	00:24:45,056	00:24:49,408	| IOT130 |	Would you like to remind people of the hotline where we will solve your pressing iot issues or
EDL	00:24:49,408	00:24:50,944	| IOT130 |	We will admit to Battlement
EDL	00:24:51,456	00:24:53,504	| IOT130 |	Because not every issue can be solved
EDL	00:24:53,504	00:24:57,856	| IOT130 |	I will try all you have to do is call and leave a voicemail at 5 1/2
EDL	00:24:57,856	00:25:00,160	| IOT130 |	623-7424
EDL	00:25:00,672	00:25:01,440	| IOT130 |	Shut up
EDL	00:25:01,440	00:25:03,232	| IOT130 |	And this week's voicemail is from Bruce
EDL	00:25:03,744	00:25:04,256	| IOT130 |	Santa Fe
EDL	00:25:05,024	00:25:06,048	| IOT130 |	Stacy and Kevin
EDL	00:25:06,048	00:25:06,816	| IOT130 |	Hi this is
EDL	00:25:06,816	00:25:07,840	| IOT130 |	Spruce in Santa Fe
EDL	00:25:08,352	00:25:09,632	| IOT130 |	You can use this on
EDL	00:25:09,632	00:25:10,400	| IOT130 |	Broadcast
EDL	00:25:10,400	00:25:11,936	| IOT130 |	If you like my question is this
EDL	00:25:12,704	00:25:15,264	| IOT130 |	Moved into a new non-automated house
EDL	00:25:16,800	00:25:18,080	| IOT130 |	Adding Hue bulbs and
EDL	00:25:18,080	00:25:19,360	| IOT130 |	Things like that over the course of
EDL	00:25:19,360	00:25:20,896	| IOT130 |	Is that drive up in
EDL	00:25:20,896	00:25:21,408	| IOT130 |	Evening
EDL	00:25:21,920	00:25:23,200	| IOT130 |	Hit my garage door open
EDL	00:25:23,712	00:25:25,248	| IOT130 |	It seems to me that I had to be able to
EDL	00:25:25,760	00:25:26,272	| IOT130 |	Homelink
EDL	00:25:26,784	00:25:27,808	| IOT130 |	Italian pie
EDL	00:25:27,808	00:25:28,576	| IOT130 |	Hue bulbs in
EDL	00:25:28,576	00:25:30,624	| IOT130 |	Turn on my lights near the garage in
EDL	00:25:31,392	00:25:31,904	| IOT130 |	Dali courtyard
EDL	00:25:32,672	00:25:34,720	| IOT130 |	Make my travels that much easier if
EDL	00:25:35,488	00:25:36,512	| IOT130 |	As we get into fall and winter
EDL	00:25:37,280	00:25:38,304	| IOT130 |	The Dark Knight
EDL	00:25:38,304	00:25:39,328	| IOT130 |	I need your help
EDL	00:25:39,328	00:25:40,608	| IOT130 |	And I hope you have a great aunt
EDL	00:25:40,608	00:25:41,120	| IOT130 |	Thanks so much
EDL	00:25:41,888	00:25:42,400	| IOT130 |	Oh
EDL	00:25:42,912	00:25:44,192	| IOT130 |	Reus we have
EDL	00:25:44,192	00:25:45,216	| IOT130 |	Options for youth
EDL	00:25:45,984	00:25:47,008	| IOT130 |	Exciting
EDL	00:25:47,008	00:25:47,776	| IOT130 |	And they're not
EDL	00:25:48,288	00:25:48,800	| IOT130 |	Credibly
EDL	00:25:49,824	00:25:50,592	| IOT130 |	Except for Spencer
EDL	00:25:53,920	00:25:54,944	| IOT130 |	Yellow realtor
EDL	00:25:55,456	00:25:56,224	| IOT130 |	Relatively
EDL	00:25:56,736	00:25:58,528	| IOT130 |	So basically you want
EDL	00:25:58,528	00:25:59,296	| IOT130 |	In need
EDL	00:25:59,296	00:26:00,320	| IOT130 |	Ewe
EDL	00:26:00,320	00:26:02,880	| IOT130 |	To see if your garage door is open and closed
EDL	00:26:02,880	00:26:07,488	| IOT130 |	And your luck because I have exactly what you want already set up in my house and it works like a
EDL	00:26:07,488	00:26:08,768	| IOT130 |	Charm and I love it
EDL	00:26:08,768	00:26:09,536	| IOT130 |	But I did have to buy some
EDL	00:26:10,304	00:26:12,352	| IOT130 |	So I don't mind with the Chamberlain MyQ
EDL	00:26:12,864	00:26:16,192	| IOT130 |	And we actually recently talked about it because they're starting a program
EDL	00:26:16,192	00:26:17,728	| IOT130 |	With it we're
EDL	00:26:17,728	00:26:20,544	| IOT130 |	You have to buy the device and its $99 ish
EDL	00:26:20,544	00:26:26,688	| IOT130 |	Sometimes I see it for a little bit more sometimes I see it for Less so you buy this device you install it and what it does
EDL	00:26:27,200	00:26:32,320	| IOT130 |	Tells you if your garage door is open or closed and there's an app that will open and close it for you
EDL	00:26:32,320	00:26:35,648	| IOT130 |	So it's very nice I had a little reminder setup so after
EDL	00:26:35,648	00:26:38,464	| IOT130 |	15 minutes of my garage door is open I get a notification on my phone
EDL	00:26:41,792	00:26:42,304	| IOT130 |	Shut it
EDL	00:26:44,352	00:26:45,888	| IOT130 |	So you need that
EDL	00:26:45,888	00:26:47,168	| IOT130 |	It won't interfere with Homelink
EDL	00:26:47,168	00:26:48,704	| IOT130 |	Because I have that on my car too
EDL	00:26:48,704	00:26:49,728	| IOT130 |	And that will act
EDL	00:26:49,728	00:26:50,496	| IOT130 |	As a trigger
EDL	00:26:51,008	00:26:52,288	| IOT130 |	Here's where you have two options
EDL	00:26:52,800	00:26:56,128	| IOT130 |	I have set mine up and had my running for over a year
EDL	00:26:56,128	00:26:57,408	| IOT130 |	On the wink hub
EDL	00:26:57,408	00:26:58,944	| IOT130 |	In the wink Hub works with Chamberlain
EDL	00:26:59,456	00:27:00,224	| IOT130 |	And
EDL	00:27:00,224	00:27:06,624	| IOT130 |	The only caveat I have there is Wink recently changed ownership and we're not really sure how long that's going to last
EDL	00:27:06,624	00:27:08,160	| IOT130 |	They're not expensive
EDL	00:27:08,160	00:27:10,208	| IOT130 |	So if you buy the wink hub
EDL	00:27:10,208	00:27:12,256	| IOT130 |	You set up they called a robot it's like a
EDL	00:27:12,768	00:27:13,536	| IOT130 |	And
EDL	00:27:13,536	00:27:16,864	| IOT130 |	I have connected mine to actually my front porch lights in
EDL	00:27:16,864	00:27:18,144	| IOT130 |	The robot says
EDL	00:27:18,144	00:27:19,168	| IOT130 |	If the garage
EDL	00:27:19,168	00:27:20,192	| IOT130 |	Store open
EDL	00:27:20,704	00:27:21,728	| IOT130 |	After
EDL	00:27:21,728	00:27:22,496	| IOT130 |	Dark
EDL	00:27:22,496	00:27:23,520	| IOT130 |	And there's a sunrise Sun
EDL	00:27:23,520	00:27:25,056	| IOT130 |	Set option so after Dark
EDL	00:27:25,568	00:27:26,336	| IOT130 |	During these times
EDL	00:27:26,848	00:27:28,640	| IOT130 |	It's 30 minutes after sunset
EDL	00:27:28,640	00:27:29,408	| IOT130 |	Till sunrise
EDL	00:27:29,920	00:27:30,944	| IOT130 |	Turn on
EDL	00:27:30,944	00:27:31,712	| IOT130 |	Porch lights
EDL	00:27:31,712	00:27:34,016	| IOT130 |	Neither Lutron enabled lights but it would work with
EDL	00:27:34,016	00:27:35,040	| IOT130 |	Hue Lights
EDL	00:27:35,040	00:27:35,552	| IOT130 |	Whatever else
EDL	00:27:36,576	00:27:38,368	| IOT130 |	Wink so that's how I've done it
EDL	00:27:38,368	00:27:41,440	| IOT130 |	Now they also recently did this affect integration
EDL	00:27:41,440	00:27:43,232	| IOT130 |	So for a dollar a month
EDL	00:27:43,232	00:27:44,512	| IOT130 |	Or $10 a year you can
EDL	00:27:48,352	00:27:49,120	| IOT130 |	Control your Chamberlain
EDL	00:27:50,144	00:27:50,912	| IOT130 |	So
EDL	00:27:50,912	00:27:55,264	| IOT130 |	It's a way to connect to the MyQ to other things in your house and then
EDL	00:27:55,776	00:27:56,800	| IOT130 |	Yeah and then you won't by the way
EDL	00:27:57,312	00:27:58,336	| IOT130 |	You won't need that
EDL	00:27:58,336	00:27:59,360	| IOT130 |	But you will pay $10
EDL	00:28:00,128	00:28:01,152	| IOT130 |	To keep them
EDL	00:28:01,664	00:28:03,200	| IOT130 |	So I don't wake up by the wake up
EDL	00:28:06,528	00:28:07,552	| IOT130 |	Yeah I did
EDL	00:28:07,552	00:28:13,952	| IOT130 |	You just get so much more flexibility cuz now you can truly said he doesn't have a smart home if you think you want to get into the Smart Home
EDL	00:28:13,952	00:28:18,048	| IOT130 |	And eventually add more things get The Hub and that way you can just keep adding to your heart's content
EDL	00:28:18,048	00:28:20,864	| IOT130 |	And I can see wink hubs
EDL	00:28:20,864	00:28:23,168	| IOT130 |	They're on sale for like 60 bucks
EDL	00:28:23,680	00:28:24,704	| IOT130 |	You can buy one used
EDL	00:28:26,240	00:28:28,032	| IOT130 |	Original version
EDL	00:28:29,568	00:28:30,080	| IOT130 |	So
EDL	00:28:30,592	00:28:34,432	| IOT130 |	You know it another thought if we're going to go down this wink Hub pass or Bruce
EDL	00:28:34,432	00:28:36,736	| IOT130 |	Could he just get an inexpensive
EDL	00:28:36,736	00:28:37,504	| IOT130 |	Sensor
EDL	00:28:37,504	00:28:39,808	| IOT130 |	Like a door open sensor and use that
EDL	00:28:39,808	00:28:40,832	| IOT130 |	For the garage door
EDL	00:28:40,832	00:28:42,368	| IOT130 |	The challenge is
EDL	00:28:42,368	00:28:43,136	| IOT130 |	So you
EDL	00:28:43,136	00:28:45,440	| IOT130 |	But you won't know if it's open or closed
EDL	00:28:45,440	00:28:46,464	| IOT130 |	There's some logic
EDL	00:28:46,976	00:28:49,280	| IOT130 |	The Chamberlain knows if it's open or closed
EDL	00:28:49,792	00:28:50,560	| IOT130 |	So
EDL	00:28:50,560	00:28:51,328	| IOT130 |	Well if it's magnetic
EDL	00:28:51,840	00:28:56,192	| IOT130 |	You have one piece yet one piece on the wall one piece on the door that's not far or less
EDL	00:28:56,192	00:28:59,264	| IOT130 |	Expensive way to go like a Z-Wave door sensor
EDL	00:28:59,264	00:29:02,848	| IOT130 |	Okay so you could do that but then you got to think it was so here's the thing.
EDL	00:29:02,848	00:29:04,128	| IOT130 |	You got to think about whether
EDL	00:29:04,128	00:29:07,968	| IOT130 |	So thinking about weather and then you also have to think about
EDL	00:29:07,968	00:29:11,040	| IOT130 |	Usually Those sensors because their battery powered they're going to rain
EDL	00:29:11,040	00:29:13,344	| IOT130 |	Stickney or Z-Wave your garage is
EDL	00:29:13,344	00:29:15,136	| IOT130 |	Kind of far out if you don't have other
EDL	00:29:15,136	00:29:19,488	| IOT130 |	Take me to Z-Wave devices on the network you're going to want your wink Hub to be pretty close to it
EDL	00:29:19,488	00:29:20,256	| IOT130 |	Correct
EDL	00:29:20,256	00:29:21,280	| IOT130 |	I would worry about
EDL	00:29:21,280	00:29:21,792	| IOT130 |	Weather
EDL	00:29:26,656	00:29:27,680	| IOT130 |	This is something that
EDL	00:29:27,680	00:29:29,472	| IOT130 |	I've looked at in there at their other ways
EDL	00:29:29,472	00:29:31,776	| IOT130 |	To do this there fancier ways that involve
EDL	00:29:32,544	00:29:33,312	| IOT130 |	Programming
EDL	00:29:33,312	00:29:34,336	| IOT130 |	People if you Google
EDL	00:29:34,848	00:29:35,872	| IOT130 |	Connected garage
EDL	00:29:35,872	00:29:37,152	| IOT130 |	Store UK
EDL	00:29:37,664	00:29:38,688	| IOT130 |	Arduino zener
EDL	00:29:38,688	00:29:39,200	| IOT130 |	You can do some crazy
EDL	00:29:39,712	00:29:42,016	| IOT130 |	So you're right this is by no means
EDL	00:29:42,016	00:29:42,528	| IOT130 |	The only way
EDL	00:29:43,040	00:29:43,552	| IOT130 |	This is one
EDL	00:29:45,856	00:29:46,880	| IOT130 |	Bruce
EDL	00:29:46,880	00:29:47,648	| IOT130 |	Pick your level of
EDL	00:29:50,464	00:29:51,232	| IOT130 |	That is it
EDL	00:29:52,512	00:29:53,536	| IOT130 |	Sweet show
EDL	00:29:53,536	00:29:54,816	| IOT130 |	We are going to take a break for
EDL	00:29:54,816	00:29:55,584	| IOT130 |	A word from our
EDL	00:29:55,584	00:30:00,704	| IOT130 |	Car sponsor and then after that we're going to have Rob Tiffany the CEO of
EDL	00:30:00,704	00:30:01,728	| IOT130 |	Itachi's
EDL	00:30:01,728	00:30:02,496	| IOT130 |	Ramada Plaza
EDL	00:30:03,008	00:30:05,056	| IOT130 |	Talking about the creation of a new
EDL	00:30:05,056	00:30:06,080	| IOT130 |	Company called band
EDL	00:30:06,080	00:30:07,360	| IOT130 |	Aura and
EDL	00:30:07,360	00:30:11,456	| IOT130 |	We get into the industrial but for those who are interested in that what's going to happen
EDL	00:30:11,456	00:30:17,856	| IOT130 |	With the industrial iot it's going to be a good in stay tuned everyone we are breaking into the internet
EDL	00:30:17,856	00:30:24,000	| IOT130 |	Better things podcast with a message from our sponsor
EDL	00:30:26,304	00:30:28,864	| IOT130 |	Shrek is a digital identity management
EDL	00:30:28,864	00:30:30,400	| IOT130 |	For talking about
EDL	00:30:30,400	00:30:31,424	| IOT130 |	Edge security
EDL	00:30:31,424	00:30:32,960	| IOT130 |	So can you explain
EDL	00:30:32,960	00:30:33,984	| IOT130 |	What the problem
EDL	00:30:33,984	00:30:34,752	| IOT130 |	Is here
EDL	00:30:34,752	00:30:41,152	| IOT130 |	Two interconnected world where we make business decisions based on data that comes from devices or device
EDL	00:30:41,152	00:30:47,040	| IOT130 |	Vices make decision based on data that comes from other devices we really need to establish trust in these devices
EDL	00:30:47,040	00:30:48,832	| IOT130 |	Whether it's at the humans Trust
EDL	00:30:48,832	00:30:55,232	| IOT130 |	The data is coming from the device is authentic that the data has not been tampered with or that device is also Trust
EDL	00:30:55,232	00:30:58,560	| IOT130 |	The date of that I was coming from each other so in order to establish Trust
EDL	00:30:58,560	00:30:59,328	| IOT130 |	Devices
EDL	00:30:59,328	00:31:00,608	| IOT130 |	We have to have a
EDL	00:31:00,608	00:31:03,168	| IOT130 |	Picture process that establishes an identity
EDL	00:31:03,168	00:31:07,264	| IOT130 |	Can be used and trusted by all different players in the ecosystem
EDL	00:31:07,264	00:31:10,336	| IOT130 |	All right so can you tell us what forgerock is doing
EDL	00:31:10,336	00:31:11,616	| IOT130 |	Help securities iot
EDL	00:31:13,152	00:31:19,552	| IOT130 |	So there's two main pieces in our new Ford Rockledge security offering is coming up later this fall the first one is called the I dunno
EDL	00:31:19,552	00:31:20,576	| IOT130 |	The Edge controller
EDL	00:31:20,576	00:31:22,368	| IOT130 |	And if you think about what
EDL	00:31:22,368	00:31:24,160	| IOT130 |	People need to do to establish Trust
EDL	00:31:24,160	00:31:26,976	| IOT130 |	Online or evening person there's different levels of trust
EDL	00:31:26,976	00:31:33,376	| IOT130 |	For example you trust a passport more than you trust a driver's license but you trust more than a year lanyard that you
EDL	00:31:33,376	00:31:34,400	| IOT130 |	You get out of conference
EDL	00:31:34,400	00:31:36,704	| IOT130 |	What you need to provide your driver's license to get
EDL	00:31:36,704	00:31:42,592	| IOT130 |	Versus a business card that anyone can have printed up so those are examples of credentials that provide different levels of
EDL	00:31:42,592	00:31:45,664	| IOT130 |	Insurance for humans super devices they also need
EDL	00:31:45,664	00:31:47,712	| IOT130 |	Those credentials and different devices
EDL	00:31:47,712	00:31:49,760	| IOT130 |	Different levels of a shirt
EDL	00:31:49,760	00:31:53,856	| IOT130 |	But you need to be sure that if you have a solution that you can get that highest
EDL	00:31:53,856	00:31:57,696	| IOT130 |	Level of assurance and Trust in the device like the passport level
EDL	00:31:57,696	00:32:04,096	| IOT130 |	Security in a nutshell the identity Edge controller provides process and technology and software that allows
EDL	00:32:04,096	00:32:09,728	| IOT130 |	Devices to establish that high level of trust or lower levels of trust depending on what these cases
EDL	00:32:09,728	00:32:10,496	| IOT130 |	So weird
EDL	00:32:10,496	00:32:12,544	| IOT130 |	Sending our platform
EDL	00:32:12,544	00:32:14,336	| IOT130 |	And the code that runs our platform
EDL	00:32:14,336	00:32:17,152	| IOT130 |	You also run on edge devices to help
EDL	00:32:17,152	00:32:23,552	| IOT130 |	Establish trusted device identities course then credentials authentication and authorization for devices which
EDL	00:32:23,552	00:32:24,064	| IOT130 |	Also help
EDL	00:32:25,856	00:32:27,136	| IOT130 |	Ashley this is great
EDL	00:32:27,136	00:32:29,696	| IOT130 |	So where can I learn more about forgerock in it
EDL	00:32:30,464	00:32:34,816	| IOT130 |	A Dracula for drug.com or we've got a whole page that decayed Tourette's
EDL	00:32:34,816	00:32:39,168	| IOT130 |	Security where you can look at case studies and even see a link to a recent webinar about the
EDL	00:32:39,168	00:32:39,680	| IOT130 |	This very subject
EDL	00:32:48,896	00:32:55,296	| IOT130 |	Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your house Stacy Higginbotham of it and today's guest is rough
EDL	00:32:55,296	00:32:59,904	| IOT130 |	Tiffany who is the CTO and Global product manager for the LaMotta iot
EDL	00:32:59,904	00:33:00,672	| IOT130 |	Platform at
EDL	00:33:01,184	00:33:02,720	| IOT130 |	Tai Chi hi Rob how you doing
EDL	00:33:03,232	00:33:05,280	| IOT130 |	Hey Stacy how are you
EDL	00:33:05,280	00:33:07,584	| IOT130 |	Excellent so we're here because
EDL	00:33:07,584	00:33:09,632	| IOT130 |	Itachi this week unveiled
EDL	00:33:09,632	00:33:11,936	| IOT130 |	A major industrial iot initiative
EDL	00:33:11,936	00:33:15,776	| IOT130 |	That was a little weird about this as we are recording it before the unveiling
EDL	00:33:15,776	00:33:17,312	| IOT130 |	If we don't actually know what it's called
EDL	00:33:17,312	00:33:19,104	| IOT130 |	But by the time this publishes
EDL	00:33:19,104	00:33:19,616	| IOT130 |	You will know what is
EDL	00:33:20,128	00:33:21,152	| IOT130 |	But everything else
EDL	00:33:21,152	00:33:21,920	| IOT130 |	Is going to stay the same
EDL	00:33:21,920	00:33:22,688	| IOT130 |	So
EDL	00:33:22,688	00:33:24,224	| IOT130 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:33:24,224	00:33:25,504	| IOT130 |	Why Hitachi
EDL	00:33:25,504	00:33:26,272	| IOT130 |	It's doing this
EDL	00:33:27,040	00:33:29,344	| IOT130 |	Sure so Itachi
EDL	00:33:29,344	00:33:35,488	| IOT130 |	As you know one of the major yeah there's only a handful of really giant Global industrial conglomerates you know they make bullet train
EDL	00:33:36,512	00:33:37,792	| IOT130 |	Windmill turbines
EDL	00:33:37,792	00:33:38,816	| IOT130 |	Giant mining trucks
EDL	00:33:39,328	00:33:45,728	| IOT130 |	Factory machines all that kind of fun stuff has been around for like over a hundred and six years in that.
EDL	00:33:45,728	00:33:48,544	| IOT130 |	Space building all this stuff but also Itachi
EDL	00:33:48,544	00:33:49,568	| IOT130 |	He's been at the it
EDL	00:33:49,568	00:33:50,336	| IOT130 |	T space
EDL	00:33:50,336	00:33:52,128	| IOT130 |	Or like 57
EDL	00:33:52,128	00:33:53,920	| IOT130 |	Urine stay actually made bed frame
EDL	00:33:54,432	00:33:56,224	| IOT130 |	So there is at lineage
EDL	00:33:56,224	00:34:02,624	| IOT130 |	Actual legit it and OT experience for a woman long time
EDL	00:34:02,624	00:34:05,184	| IOT130 |	I believe the sinking is while it's great to
EDL	00:34:05,184	00:34:07,744	| IOT130 |	Made it this far for over a hundred years
EDL	00:34:07,744	00:34:09,536	| IOT130 |	Being a big Industrial conglomerates
EDL	00:34:10,048	00:34:12,608	| IOT130 |	The sinking is moving forward into the future
EDL	00:34:12,608	00:34:14,144	| IOT130 |	It's going to be harder and harder to
EDL	00:34:14,144	00:34:15,424	| IOT130 |	Survived another Hunter
EDL	00:34:15,424	00:34:17,472	| IOT130 |	Years without a large tibbitts
EDL	00:34:17,472	00:34:19,008	| IOT130 |	Coyote
EDL	00:34:19,008	00:34:20,288	| IOT130 |	IAAI
EDL	00:34:20,288	00:34:23,872	| IOT130 |	To get more value out of the Machinery that we're selling to our house
EDL	00:34:25,152	00:34:29,248	| IOT130 |	So Hitachi is really looking to the Future and it sees an existential threat
EDL	00:34:30,016	00:34:34,112	| IOT130 |	We mentioned earlier some things businesses might fall away
EDL	00:34:34,624	00:34:35,648	| IOT130 |	Some of the storage option
EDL	00:34:36,160	00:34:38,208	| IOT130 |	You guys have
EDL	00:34:38,208	00:34:43,584	| IOT130 |	So what kind of challenges do you guys see specifically as a threat to
EDL	00:34:43,584	00:34:44,352	| IOT130 |	The way that
EDL	00:34:44,352	00:34:45,632	| IOT130 |	Business operates
EDL	00:34:45,632	00:34:46,912	| IOT130 |	Or what it sells today
EDL	00:34:47,424	00:34:53,568	| IOT130 |	Sure I think in a big way so I just kind of generically think of all the type of heavy equipment and stuff does Itachi make
EDL	00:34:54,080	00:34:56,128	| IOT130 |	Picture of Japan think of Germany
EDL	00:34:57,408	00:34:58,176	| IOT130 |	Ultra high-end
EDL	00:34:58,688	00:35:01,760	| IOT130 |	High quality product but more expensive labor forces
EDL	00:35:01,760	00:35:02,528	| IOT130 |	Covington
EDL	00:35:02,528	00:35:04,064	| IOT130 |	Compete against lower-cost
EDL	00:35:04,064	00:35:04,832	| IOT130 |	Equipment
EDL	00:35:04,832	00:35:07,392	| IOT130 |	Machinery coming from China right and as
EDL	00:35:07,392	00:35:08,160	| IOT130 |	You start adding
EDL	00:35:08,672	00:35:14,816	| IOT130 |	Machine learning and Ai and you instruments all that equipment the threat I would say the threat is
EDL	00:35:14,816	00:35:15,584	| IOT130 |	Is good enough
EDL	00:35:15,584	00:35:18,400	| IOT130 |	Machinery or equipment and lower-cost
EDL	00:35:18,400	00:35:19,424	| IOT130 |	And so
EDL	00:35:19,424	00:35:24,288	| IOT130 |	How do you differentiate yourself how do you make your equipment more valuable than
EDL	00:35:24,288	00:35:25,312	| IOT130 |	Brand X
EDL	00:35:25,312	00:35:26,080	| IOT130 |	Right
EDL	00:35:26,080	00:35:30,176	| IOT130 |	And so what can you do with software and all of our experience
EDL	00:35:30,176	00:35:34,016	| IOT130 |	And ML and AI to create a differentiator
EDL	00:35:34,016	00:35:39,648	| IOT130 |	Hitachi equipment across the border
EDL	00:35:40,160	00:35:46,560	| IOT130 |	And it launched its own predix platform it started internal
EDL	00:35:46,560	00:35:50,912	| IOT130 |	Equipment
EDL	00:35:50,912	00:35:51,680	| IOT130 |	Those
EDL	00:35:51,680	00:35:54,752	| IOT130 |	To start building this canal software-based
EDL	00:35:54,752	00:35:55,776	| IOT130 |	Asset in terms of
EDL	00:35:55,776	00:35:57,056	| IOT130 |	Predictive failure
EDL	00:35:58,592	00:36:01,408	| IOT130 |	Guess to what Hitachi
EDL	00:36:02,944	00:36:03,456	| IOT130 |	Absolutely
EDL	00:36:04,736	00:36:07,296	| IOT130 |	And it's not like this is new to Itachi
EDL	00:36:07,808	00:36:10,624	| IOT130 |	Play like a lots of big companies Itachi has been
EDL	00:36:10,624	00:36:13,184	| IOT130 |	Manufacturing instrumented equipment
EDL	00:36:13,184	00:36:17,280	| IOT130 |	Three years you know what their own microcontroller reason sending Telemetry but
EDL	00:36:17,280	00:36:21,888	| IOT130 |	Is there probably well aware if you think of the forerunners to iot things like machines
EDL	00:36:21,888	00:36:23,168	| IOT130 |	Machine in the bed stuff
EDL	00:36:23,168	00:36:24,704	| IOT130 |	Going on for a long time
EDL	00:36:24,704	00:36:25,984	| IOT130 |	Siloed
EDL	00:36:25,984	00:36:29,312	| IOT130 |	Orbitz airline to different business units or product line
EDL	00:36:29,824	00:36:33,664	| IOT130 |	Sometimes everybody's got their own thing so how to do this is not new
EDL	00:36:33,664	00:36:39,808	| IOT130 |	Since you been doing it for so long to try to get all of the touchy machinery and then ultimately external machinery and you're right
EDL	00:36:40,320	00:36:41,344	| IOT130 |	Very analogous
EDL	00:36:41,344	00:36:42,624	| IOT130 |	Say what Jesus has done
EDL	00:36:42,624	00:36:44,672	| IOT130 |	All right we're going to get to that
EDL	00:36:45,184	00:36:46,976	| IOT130 |	First I want to bring up
EDL	00:36:47,744	00:36:48,512	| IOT130 |	Conceptual challenge
EDL	00:36:49,280	00:36:50,304	| IOT130 |	In the industrialized
EDL	00:36:50,816	00:36:52,608	| IOT130 |	Just actually
EDL	00:36:52,608	00:36:54,912	| IOT130 |	Scale back some of its Ambitions around
EDL	00:37:02,336	00:37:02,848	| IOT130 |	Going to work with
EDL	00:37:03,360	00:37:06,944	| IOT130 |	Just a few months ago it basically said
EDL	00:37:06,944	00:37:11,552	| IOT130 |	Hey you know how we're going to do all Industrial
EDL	00:37:11,552	00:37:13,344	| IOT130 |	3 core areas where
EDL	00:37:13,344	00:37:14,112	| IOT130 |	We've already got
EDL	00:37:14,112	00:37:15,904	| IOT130 |	Customer said that was
EDL	00:37:15,904	00:37:16,672	| IOT130 |	Energy
EDL	00:37:16,672	00:37:17,696	| IOT130 |	And I am forgetting
EDL	00:37:18,464	00:37:21,536	| IOT130 |	Especially the industry's took this and said hey
EDL	00:37:21,536	00:37:26,912	| IOT130 |	It's really hard to do industrial iot well across a huge swath of Industries
EDL	00:37:26,912	00:37:27,936	| IOT130 |	Redis doesn't scale
EDL	00:37:28,448	00:37:30,496	| IOT130 |	And so I'm curious if you guys are
EDL	00:37:30,496	00:37:31,520	| IOT130 |	Looking at that
EDL	00:37:31,520	00:37:32,800	| IOT130 |	Insane oh
EDL	00:37:32,800	00:37:38,176	| IOT130 |	Should we take a lesson from there or do you have technology or something that you think actually changes that equation
EDL	00:37:39,200	00:37:40,736	| IOT130 |	I think we have a lot of humility
EDL	00:37:40,736	00:37:41,760	| IOT130 |	Hitachi
EDL	00:37:41,760	00:37:46,880	| IOT130 |	Every know in advance that animated generic sense trying to be all things to everyone
EDL	00:37:46,880	00:37:51,744	| IOT130 |	Usually leads to failure at this whole order and so we didn't have such ambitions
EDL	00:37:51,744	00:37:53,280	| IOT130 |	Even though our
EDL	00:37:53,280	00:37:54,560	| IOT130 |	Portfolio products
EDL	00:37:54,560	00:37:56,096	| IOT130 |	Renee is very similar
EDL	00:37:56,096	00:37:58,912	| IOT130 |	GE makes and what Siemens make
EDL	00:37:58,912	00:38:00,448	| IOT130 |	We had no designs
EDL	00:38:00,448	00:38:05,568	| IOT130 |	To try to just overnight go and have a platform and tackle and try to support everything we do
EDL	00:38:05,568	00:38:08,128	| IOT130 |	So I think we're taking things with simpler
EDL	00:38:08,128	00:38:12,480	| IOT130 |	Steps even if you think of we're only going to do what we know it's still too much
EDL	00:38:12,992	00:38:16,320	| IOT130 |	Okay and what are the industries are going to focus on first
EDL	00:38:16,320	00:38:17,344	| IOT130 |	You know how
EDL	00:38:17,344	00:38:18,368	| IOT130 |	Peyote
EDL	00:38:18,368	00:38:21,440	| IOT130 |	In general people think of kind of broad use cases
EDL	00:38:21,952	00:38:23,232	| IOT130 |	Besides several specific ones
EDL	00:38:25,792	00:38:27,072	| IOT130 |	Play Bunny
EDL	00:38:28,352	00:38:31,424	| IOT130 |	Score better customer service just really generic
EDL	00:38:31,424	00:38:35,776	| IOT130 |	I didn't even hear people say and I'm going to change my business model
EDL	00:38:35,776	00:38:39,616	| IOT130 |	And I'm going to transfer my business and other sound really flowering it
EDL	00:38:39,616	00:38:40,640	| IOT130 |	Ambiguous
EDL	00:38:40,640	00:38:44,736	| IOT130 |	But a specific instance of that transforming
EDL	00:38:44,736	00:38:46,528	| IOT130 |	Model has to do with our bullet train
EDL	00:38:47,040	00:38:50,368	| IOT130 |	I'll tell you the story about what's going on in the UK
EDL	00:38:50,368	00:38:51,136	| IOT130 |	How does time zones
EDL	00:38:53,184	00:38:59,328	| IOT130 |	Perspectives Nevada is not just some iot platform that stretches out everything we're doing so it's the machine
EDL	00:39:01,888	00:39:04,448	| IOT130 |	Together to make sure we have a good holistic
EDL	00:39:04,448	00:39:09,312	| IOT130 |	We make bullet train Japan
EDL	00:39:12,640	00:39:14,176	| IOT130 |	You play never seen a Japanese
EDL	00:39:15,200	00:39:18,784	| IOT130 |	You know if you're writing on the page a baby in France or you're in ice
EDL	00:39:22,112	00:39:23,136	| IOT130 |	Something like that
EDL	00:39:23,648	00:39:24,416	| IOT130 |	UK government
EDL	00:39:25,184	00:39:30,304	| IOT130 |	Has all these Intercity trains going all over the country in as you can imagine if you ridden on some of them
EDL	00:39:30,304	00:39:32,608	| IOT130 |	They've been around for a while and they like some new one
EDL	00:39:32,608	00:39:33,376	| IOT130 |	They like to replace
EDL	00:39:35,168	00:39:40,544	| IOT130 |	Entities that want to replace something they say ever inducted in our feet and get people to put in proposals
EDL	00:39:44,128	00:39:45,152	| IOT130 |	Tens of billions
EDL	00:39:45,152	00:39:51,296	| IOT130 |	Pounce in this case to do that it's an expensive tall order and so you can imagine all The Usual Suspects showing up
EDL	00:39:52,320	00:39:54,112	| IOT130 |	And yes I'll be happy to.
EDL	00:39:54,112	00:39:54,624	| IOT130 |	Things for you
EDL	00:39:55,136	00:39:57,440	| IOT130 |	So he who has no presents
EDL	00:39:57,440	00:39:58,720	| IOT130 |	And Europe showed up
EDL	00:39:58,720	00:40:00,256	| IOT130 |	What the different kind of proposal
EDL	00:40:00,256	00:40:01,280	| IOT130 |	Which composer
EDL	00:40:01,280	00:40:02,816	| IOT130 |	Trains as a service
EDL	00:40:02,816	00:40:05,888	| IOT130 |	Instead because we're putting our money where our mouth is
EDL	00:40:05,888	00:40:07,168	| IOT130 |	We Believe
EDL	00:40:07,168	00:40:09,728	| IOT130 |	Are trains with tens of thousands
EDL	00:40:09,728	00:40:10,496	| IOT130 |	Sensors
EDL	00:40:10,496	00:40:16,896	| IOT130 |	And our LaMotta Telemetry you know our acquisition of telemetry being able to do stuff and rml and Rai
EDL	00:40:16,896	00:40:17,664	| IOT130 |	Find systems
EDL	00:40:17,664	00:40:18,688	| IOT130 |	Well enough
EDL	00:40:18,688	00:40:19,712	| IOT130 |	We're going to take that risk
EDL	00:40:20,224	00:40:21,504	| IOT130 |	So our proposal was
EDL	00:40:22,016	00:40:23,296	| IOT130 |	You don't have to pay it's anything
EDL	00:40:23,296	00:40:26,624	| IOT130 |	You're going to do train social service and working to build these trains for you
EDL	00:40:26,624	00:40:29,696	| IOT130 |	And then you're going to start using them and we're going to have to hit your SLA
EDL	00:40:30,208	00:40:32,512	| IOT130 |	Pay-as-you-go
EDL	00:40:32,512	00:40:34,048	| IOT130 |	Would be really attractive
EDL	00:40:34,048	00:40:40,192	| IOT130 |	To any governments are next who's looking at having to pay tens of billions of dollars or pounds are you
EDL	00:40:42,240	00:40:43,776	| IOT130 |	To have someone show up
EDL	00:40:43,776	00:40:46,848	| IOT130 |	You know what on our time and that's taking out risk
EDL	00:40:46,848	00:40:48,384	| IOT130 |	We will build these trains
EDL	00:40:48,384	00:40:49,408	| IOT130 |	In advance
EDL	00:40:49,408	00:40:51,968	| IOT130 |	And we will deliver them to you and then you'll just start
EDL	00:40:51,968	00:40:52,992	| IOT130 |	Paint as you go
EDL	00:40:52,992	00:40:53,760	| IOT130 |	Wow
EDL	00:40:53,760	00:40:59,648	| IOT130 |	So actually these trains are operational and you guys are delivering them as a service today or they are about to be
EDL	00:41:00,160	00:41:02,976	| IOT130 |	Operational I think there's already some trains are running now
EDL	00:41:02,976	00:41:05,536	| IOT130 |	So now let's talk about some of the technology
EDL	00:41:06,048	00:41:09,376	| IOT130 |	So you guys are creating a new company new name
EDL	00:41:09,376	00:41:14,496	| IOT130 |	And talk to me about what assets you're sticking under that new company to kind of help
EDL	00:41:15,008	00:41:15,776	| IOT130 |	With
EDL	00:41:15,776	00:41:16,544	| IOT130 |	This whole
EDL	00:41:16,544	00:41:19,104	| IOT130 |	Delivering things as a service enabling Iowa
EDL	00:41:20,128	00:41:20,640	| IOT130 |	Across your bows
EDL	00:41:21,664	00:41:23,712	| IOT130 |	That certainly includes assets
EDL	00:41:23,712	00:41:30,112	| IOT130 |	Itachi inside group that has been building LaMotta and again when I say building alibata ITP
EDL	00:41:30,112	00:41:30,880	| IOT130 |	Platform
EDL	00:41:30,880	00:41:33,184	| IOT130 |	It's not like we're just figuring it out from
EDL	00:41:33,184	00:41:34,720	| IOT130 |	Scratch we're going around
EDL	00:41:34,720	00:41:41,120	| IOT130 |	I thought you were decades event am experiencing analytics and pulling the best stuff together to make this reality so
EDL	00:41:41,120	00:41:41,632	| IOT130 |	Spotlights
EDL	00:41:42,400	00:41:44,448	| IOT130 |	Something came off the top of her head
EDL	00:41:44,448	00:41:45,216	| IOT130 |	It's
EDL	00:41:45,216	00:41:47,776	| IOT130 |	Pentaho which is Analytics
EDL	00:41:47,776	00:41:53,919	| IOT130 |	Machine learning Big Data company we acquired a few years ago that does a great job of
EDL	00:41:53,919	00:41:55,711	| IOT130 |	Enterprise Integration
EDL	00:41:55,711	00:41:58,271	| IOT130 |	Hundreds of connectors to connect to any kind of
EDL	00:41:58,271	00:42:02,111	| IOT130 |	Back-end system the customer have you have databases
EDL	00:42:03,647	00:42:05,695	| IOT130 |	Components of our storage business
EDL	00:42:06,719	00:42:07,743	| IOT130 |	Hitachi make
EDL	00:42:07,743	00:42:09,023	| IOT130 |	Really high-end
EDL	00:42:09,023	00:42:09,535	| IOT130 |	Storage
EDL	00:42:10,047	00:42:11,071	| IOT130 |	Computer systems
EDL	00:42:11,071	00:42:12,607	| IOT130 |	Battle still be apart of this
EDL	00:42:12,607	00:42:14,655	| IOT130 |	And so you know we'll be delivering to
EDL	00:42:14,655	00:42:17,215	| IOT130 |	Hyper-converged solution
EDL	00:42:17,215	00:42:19,007	| IOT130 |	Where to pre-configure
EDL	00:42:19,007	00:42:22,591	| IOT130 |	Giant stack of ultra high-end servers and terabytes
EDL	00:42:22,591	00:42:23,359	| IOT130 |	Storage
EDL	00:42:23,359	00:42:26,175	| IOT130 |	And I'll demonic platform in pentaho and all that
EDL	00:42:26,175	00:42:28,991	| IOT130 |	Technology already to go where customers
EDL	00:42:28,991	00:42:31,295	| IOT130 |	Get up and running in the industrial Spain
EDL	00:42:31,295	00:42:32,831	| IOT130 |	Unlike the consumer space
EDL	00:42:32,831	00:42:34,367	| IOT130 |	You talk to people all the time
EDL	00:42:34,367	00:42:35,647	| IOT130 |	Are they tell you hey
EDL	00:42:35,647	00:42:39,999	| IOT130 |	The day that doesn't leave my factory or can't leave my plant and it's not always
EDL	00:42:39,999	00:42:44,095	| IOT130 |	For the reasons like I'm afraid of the cloud or I'm worried about shaqiri
EDL	00:42:44,095	00:42:45,631	| IOT130 |	Sometimes it's just practical reason
EDL	00:42:46,143	00:42:47,423	| IOT130 |	You to imagine a lot of
EDL	00:42:47,423	00:42:48,191	| IOT130 |	Industrial settings
EDL	00:42:49,471	00:42:52,031	| IOT130 |	Putting off terabytes of data each day
EDL	00:42:52,031	00:42:53,823	| IOT130 |	Baby shower and sometimes
EDL	00:42:53,823	00:42:56,383	| IOT130 |	It's just not practical to try to ship all that data to it
EDL	00:42:57,407	00:42:59,199	| IOT130 |	Sometimes not even practical to do so
EDL	00:42:59,199	00:43:01,759	| IOT130 |	Some kind of hybrid
EDL	00:43:01,759	00:43:03,551	| IOT130 |	Sometimes everything needs to be
EDL	00:43:03,551	00:43:04,575	| IOT130 |	Right there on Crown
EDL	00:43:05,087	00:43:06,111	| IOT130 |	And sometimes I'm not
EDL	00:43:06,111	00:43:07,903	| IOT130 |	Just talking about
EDL	00:43:09,183	00:43:15,583	| IOT130 |	Cuz they want that like clothes into the factory or a power plant or whatever 2.2 meet the customer where they are
EDL	00:43:15,583	00:43:21,471	| IOT130 |	So that one friend storage stuff comes in there we've got the stick called Foundry
EDL	00:43:21,471	00:43:23,007	| IOT130 |	That is the underpinning of
EDL	00:43:24,031	00:43:25,823	| IOT130 |	Connect to servers
EDL	00:43:25,823	00:43:30,687	| IOT130 |	Text software that we build that makes our technology easy to be portable as far as other part that
EDL	00:43:30,687	00:43:32,991	| IOT130 |	This new company was lots of it in Japan
EDL	00:43:32,991	00:43:33,759	| IOT130 |	Factory
EDL	00:43:33,759	00:43:37,343	| IOT130 |	Easter part of that there's all kinds of data science organization
EDL	00:43:37,343	00:43:39,903	| IOT130 |	Better part of it I think we have all the right pieces
EDL	00:43:40,415	00:43:41,439	| IOT130 |	Inside the center
EDL	00:43:41,439	00:43:43,487	| IOT130 |	To drive us forward
EDL	00:43:43,487	00:43:44,767	| IOT130 |	You know in a meaningful way
EDL	00:43:45,791	00:43:48,095	| IOT130 |	Let's go back to this R&D component
EDL	00:43:48,095	00:43:49,375	| IOT130 |	So looking forward
EDL	00:43:49,375	00:43:55,775	| IOT130 |	After this new companies creation what kind of cool things is Hitachi working on that could be pulled into this that
EDL	00:43:55,775	00:43:56,543	| IOT130 |	We want to look forward
EDL	00:43:57,311	00:43:58,079	| IOT130 |	Certainly
EDL	00:43:58,079	00:44:00,127	| IOT130 |	No one to talk about people making a difference
EDL	00:44:00,639	00:44:02,175	| IOT130 |	It's the data scientist
EDL	00:44:02,175	00:44:03,711	| IOT130 |	And it's the domain experts
EDL	00:44:04,223	00:44:09,599	| IOT130 |	Whenever you for a particular piece of Machinery you want to build some ml models
EDL	00:44:09,599	00:44:10,367	| IOT130 |	Around
EDL	00:44:10,367	00:44:13,951	| IOT130 |	Cricket cellular analytics are remaining useful life or whatever it happens
EDL	00:44:13,951	00:44:15,231	| IOT130 |	Has to be you have to have
EDL	00:44:15,231	00:44:18,815	| IOT130 |	Two types of people there you have to have the Domain expert at that
EDL	00:44:18,815	00:44:21,887	| IOT130 |	Your type of machinery and those every last thing about it.
EDL	00:44:22,399	00:44:23,935	| IOT130 |	Theme parks in USA
EDL	00:44:23,935	00:44:25,471	| IOT130 |	You know actual data scientist
EDL	00:44:25,471	00:44:27,263	| IOT130 |	You're going to pick the algorithms you're going to
EDL	00:44:27,263	00:44:30,847	| IOT130 |	Create a model train the model and work on that to get that
EDL	00:44:30,847	00:44:31,615	| IOT130 |	Just wright
EDL	00:44:31,615	00:44:34,431	| IOT130 |	And that's no easy task and see if the right people
EDL	00:44:34,431	00:44:35,199	| IOT130 |	Do that
EDL	00:44:35,199	00:44:37,247	| IOT130 |	Imagine we've got those
EDL	00:44:37,247	00:44:38,783	| IOT130 |	People here already
EDL	00:44:38,783	00:44:40,575	| IOT130 |	They can make that a reality
EDL	00:44:40,575	00:44:41,343	| IOT130 |	For us
EDL	00:44:41,343	00:44:43,391	| IOT130 |	Having that know-how and not just hoping
EDL	00:44:43,391	00:44:45,439	| IOT130 |	But a customer has some of it is a big thing
EDL	00:44:45,951	00:44:49,279	| IOT130 |	Awesome alright Rob thank you so much for coming on the show this way
EDL	00:44:49,279	00:44:49,791	| IOT130 |	Sweet to talk about
EDL	00:44:50,815	00:44:52,351	| IOT130 |	Absolutely my pleasure
