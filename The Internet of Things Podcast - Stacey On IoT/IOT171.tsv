EDL	00:02:14,656	00:02:15,168	| IOT171 |	Kevin
EDL	00:02:15,680	00:02:16,704	| IOT171 |	Get it started
EDL	00:02:16,704	00:02:18,752	| IOT171 |	Our first call is from
EDL	00:02:18,752	00:02:19,264	| IOT171 |	Frank
EDL	00:02:19,776	00:02:20,544	| IOT171 |	Yes
EDL	00:02:20,544	00:02:21,824	| IOT171 |	Really good question
EDL	00:02:23,360	00:02:24,896	| IOT171 |	Penn State game
EDL	00:02:26,432	00:02:31,296	| IOT171 |	Homeowners insurance and the guest you had on
EDL	00:02:32,320	00:02:34,624	| IOT171 |	Naomi Campbell Technologies
EDL	00:02:36,672	00:02:37,952	| IOT171 |	Homeowners insurance
EDL	00:02:37,952	00:02:41,280	| IOT171 |	Places that offer discounts or some kind of antenna
EDL	00:02:41,280	00:02:43,584	| IOT171 |	Houses with Smart Home
EDL	00:02:43,584	00:02:47,168	| IOT171 |	Unlike other than just alarm just wondering if you guys had any information about
EDL	00:02:48,192	00:02:49,216	| IOT171 |	Camino
EDL	00:02:51,776	00:02:53,824	| IOT171 |	Frank this is a great question
EDL	00:02:53,824	00:02:54,592	| IOT171 |	And
EDL	00:02:54,592	00:02:57,408	| IOT171 |	I'm sad to say that a lot of them still Focus mode
EDL	00:02:57,408	00:02:58,944	| IOT171 |	Mostly on home security
EDL	00:02:58,944	00:02:59,456	| IOT171 |	Not
EDL	00:03:01,248	00:03:02,528	| IOT171 |	But we got a couple
EDL	00:03:02,528	00:03:05,856	| IOT171 |	In all of the sensors in this case are basically here
EDL	00:03:05,856	00:03:06,368	| IOT171 |	Nest
EDL	00:03:06,880	00:03:07,648	| IOT171 |	Smoke detector
EDL	00:03:07,648	00:03:09,184	| IOT171 |	Actor so American family
EDL	00:03:09,184	00:03:10,976	| IOT171 |	Insurance offers discounts
EDL	00:03:10,976	00:03:12,512	| IOT171 |	Four people have a Nest smoke
EDL	00:03:12,512	00:03:15,584	| IOT171 |	Tractor and who opted into sharing if their batteries are
EDL	00:03:16,864	00:03:18,400	| IOT171 |	This is a big question for ensure
EDL	00:03:19,168	00:03:21,216	| IOT171 |	Liberty Mutual does the same thing
EDL	00:03:21,216	00:03:23,520	| IOT171 |	And I know this is security-related
EDL	00:03:23,520	00:03:26,336	| IOT171 |	But American family also offers a discount
EDL	00:03:26,336	00:03:31,200	| IOT171 |	For people who install the ring doorbell and then ring actually offers some Disco
EDL	00:03:31,200	00:03:33,248	| IOT171 |	Counts to people as well
EDL	00:03:33,248	00:03:34,528	| IOT171 |	And finally
EDL	00:03:34,528	00:03:36,832	| IOT171 |	State Farm has a deal with Canary
EDL	00:03:36,832	00:03:38,624	| IOT171 |	Where they will offer you
EDL	00:03:38,624	00:03:40,160	| IOT171 |	I think it's $20 off
EDL	00:03:40,160	00:03:44,512	| IOT171 |	The purchase of a canary but then also $20 annually
EDL	00:03:44,512	00:03:45,536	| IOT171 |	Off the
EDL	00:03:45,536	00:03:46,048	| IOT171 |	Canary subscription
EDL	00:03:46,816	00:03:53,216	| IOT171 |	Right and that's a $10 a month subscription I know because I have the canary and I pay that so that's like getting two months of the
EDL	00:03:53,216	00:03:53,728	| IOT171 |	The service are free
EDL	00:03:55,008	00:03:58,336	| IOT171 |	So we're not get to the place where Insurance firms are saying
EDL	00:03:58,336	00:04:01,152	| IOT171 |	Hey we're going to subsidize your water sensors and that sort of thing
EDL	00:04:01,664	00:04:03,200	| IOT171 |	But I will say
EDL	00:04:03,200	00:04:09,600	| IOT171 |	I think we're going to get there and I think we're probably going to get there next year so 2019 I think we'll start seeing policies
EDL	00:04:09,600	00:04:13,696	| IOT171 |	Is start seeing more discounts but we may even start seeing some of these
EDL	00:04:13,696	00:04:14,976	| IOT171 |	Policies built around
EDL	00:04:16,256	00:04:19,583	| IOT171 |	The insurance firms are really into this but as we said
EDL	00:04:19,583	00:04:21,375	| IOT171 |	Before they need that data
EDL	00:04:22,655	00:04:23,167	| IOT171 |	All right
EDL	00:04:23,679	00:04:24,447	| IOT171 |	So
EDL	00:04:24,447	00:04:25,983	| IOT171 |	Stay tuned in your life
EDL	00:04:25,983	00:04:27,519	| IOT171 |	For insurance discounts on Summer
EDL	00:04:28,031	00:04:28,799	| IOT171 |	Homegear
EDL	00:04:28,799	00:04:29,823	| IOT171 |	Next question
EDL	00:04:31,615	00:04:35,199	| IOT171 |	Hey Kevin and Stacy my name is Jeremy and I have been thinking about getting a
EDL	00:04:35,199	00:04:35,967	| IOT171 |	Smart Lock
EDL	00:04:35,967	00:04:38,527	| IOT171 |	But sometimes you know when somebody shots
EDL	00:04:38,527	00:04:39,551	| IOT171 |	The door they don't
EDL	00:04:39,551	00:04:40,831	| IOT171 |	Closing all the way
EDL	00:04:40,831	00:04:46,719	| IOT171 |	And some wondering if you guys have had that experience where maybe it's not shut all the way and then you're somewhere else like
EDL	00:04:46,719	00:04:48,511	| IOT171 |	Maybe you know I'm not at home or
EDL	00:04:48,511	00:04:51,583	| IOT171 |	Using the app to lock it like do you know
EDL	00:04:51,583	00:04:53,375	| IOT171 |	Door doesn't lock
EDL	00:04:53,375	00:04:56,703	| IOT171 |	Because of that boat can go into the hole because the doors not shut all the way
EDL	00:04:57,215	00:04:57,983	| IOT171 |	Man
EDL	00:04:57,983	00:04:59,007	| IOT171 |	Jeremy I have
EDL	00:04:59,007	00:05:02,335	| IOT171 |	I've tried like half a dozen smart locks and I literally have
EDL	00:05:02,335	00:05:03,871	| IOT171 |	Never thought about this
EDL	00:05:04,383	00:05:08,223	| IOT171 |	It is until August actually introduced something called Dorset
EDL	00:05:08,735	00:05:12,319	| IOT171 |	Which is basically a magnetic sensor that you stick near the deadbolt
EDL	00:05:12,319	00:05:14,111	| IOT171 |	Or inside your door for
EDL	00:05:14,623	00:05:17,951	| IOT171 |	And it will actually detect if the deadbolt has been engaged
EDL	00:05:18,463	00:05:18,975	| IOT171 |	The door is actually
EDL	00:05:19,487	00:05:21,279	| IOT171 |	Still open this is literally never happy
EDL	00:05:21,791	00:05:23,839	| IOT171 |	But it's a really good question
EDL	00:05:23,839	00:05:24,863	| IOT171 |	And right now
EDL	00:05:25,375	00:05:27,167	| IOT171 |	That's really the main
EDL	00:05:27,167	00:05:30,495	| IOT171 |	Option out there so you could buy the August door lock
EDL	00:05:30,495	00:05:32,031	| IOT171 |	With doorsense in it
EDL	00:05:32,031	00:05:34,591	| IOT171 |	Has it integrated as part of the package or
EDL	00:05:34,591	00:05:35,103	| IOT171 |	Kevin came up
EDL	00:05:35,871	00:05:40,735	| IOT171 |	Well it's clever that August has done that's because they have integrated the sensor with the lock
EDL	00:05:40,735	00:05:47,135	| IOT171 |	However the center itself appears to be just a magnetic sensor and you can certainly buy any one of them
EDL	00:05:47,135	00:05:47,903	| IOT171 |	The number of
EDL	00:05:47,903	00:05:51,487	| IOT171 |	Magnetic sensors that use typically zigbee or Z-Wave
EDL	00:05:51,487	00:05:57,887	| IOT171 |	Which would replicate exactly what door sense does so if you don't want an August door lock you can certainly try a different Smart Lock
EDL	00:05:57,887	00:06:04,287	| IOT171 |	And add your own magnetic sensor it may not look as pretty because most of those are not in recessed options so you'll have a little
EDL	00:06:04,287	00:06:10,687	| IOT171 |	Sensor on the door and the door frame but still that would work and give you more options to choose from if you
EDL	00:06:10,687	00:06:16,575	| IOT171 |	Like that actually makes a lovely recessed sensor that you do then have to drill the hole in your door
EDL	00:06:17,343	00:06:18,367	| IOT171 |	Mordor and
EDL	00:06:18,367	00:06:19,135	| IOT171 |	Put it in there
EDL	00:06:19,135	00:06:20,159	| IOT171 |	But it is recessed
EDL	00:06:21,695	00:06:23,487	| IOT171 |	The final option I'll give you
EDL	00:06:23,487	00:06:24,255	| IOT171 |	Is pretty low
EDL	00:06:25,535	00:06:27,327	| IOT171 |	It's pretty easy pretty cheap so you can
EDL	00:06:27,327	00:06:29,119	| IOT171 |	Can get a wyze camera
EDL	00:06:29,119	00:06:33,215	| IOT171 |	And stick it so it faces your door and then you can always check in
EDL	00:06:33,215	00:06:35,775	| IOT171 |	With this $20 camera and be like oh hey
EDL	00:06:35,775	00:06:38,079	| IOT171 |	My deadbolt engage but my door is actually still open
EDL	00:06:38,079	00:06:38,847	| IOT171 |	If this is
EDL	00:06:38,847	00:06:39,615	| IOT171 |	Like a big concern of
EDL	00:06:40,383	00:06:44,223	| IOT171 |	The downside to all of these actually is if the door is still
EDL	00:06:44,223	00:06:44,991	| IOT171 |	Open
EDL	00:06:44,991	00:06:46,783	| IOT171 |	You do have to go back home and
EDL	00:06:46,783	00:06:47,551	| IOT171 |	Close it
EDL	00:06:47,551	00:06:48,575	| IOT171 |	Or maybe it's just call someone
EDL	00:06:49,599	00:06:55,999	| IOT171 |	Right I would probably set up some type of automation that triggers if the door magnetic sensor
EDL	00:06:55,999	00:06:57,279	| IOT171 |	Is showing open
EDL	00:06:57,279	00:07:02,911	| IOT171 |	For more than a couple minutes or something to that effect when you're not at home that way you're not too far from home and you can just go back
EDL	00:07:02,911	00:07:03,679	| IOT171 |	There you go
EDL	00:07:03,679	00:07:05,983	| IOT171 |	So if you do the external door sensor
EDL	00:07:05,983	00:07:06,751	| IOT171 |	You're going to need a hug
EDL	00:07:07,263	00:07:07,775	| IOT171 |	Cuz they are zigbee
EDL	00:07:08,543	00:07:09,823	| IOT171 |	If so you're really getting into
EDL	00:07:10,335	00:07:10,847	| IOT171 |	Investment charity
EDL	00:07:11,615	00:07:13,151	| IOT171 |	But then you got a lot of fun with your
EDL	00:07:14,943	00:07:16,735	| IOT171 |	Alright next
EDL	00:07:16,735	00:07:18,783	| IOT171 |	Stop is a question from Rob
EDL	00:07:18,783	00:07:19,551	| IOT171 |	Who is from Austin

EDL	00:07:20,831	00:07:21,343	| IOT171 |	To Rob
EDL	00:07:21,855	00:07:22,623	| IOT171 |	My hometown buddy
EDL	00:07:23,135	00:07:23,647	| IOT171 |	Alright Rob
EDL	00:07:24,415	00:07:24,927	| IOT171 |	Let's hear your question
EDL	00:07:25,695	00:07:26,719	| IOT171 |	Hi Stacy
EDL	00:07:26,719	00:07:27,999	| IOT171 |	My name is Rob
EDL	00:07:27,999	00:07:29,791	| IOT171 |	I'm a retired electronics engineer
EDL	00:07:29,791	00:07:30,815	| IOT171 |	Here in Austin
EDL	00:07:30,815	00:07:32,351	| IOT171 |	I got into Electronics
EDL	00:07:32,351	00:07:34,143	| IOT171 |	In the early 60s as a kid
EDL	00:07:34,143	00:07:37,471	| IOT171 |	Now after several years of retirement I want to get back into it
EDL	00:07:38,495	00:07:39,263	| IOT171 |	Funeral makeup
EDL	00:07:39,263	00:07:39,775	| IOT171 |	Sonic game
EDL	00:07:40,287	00:07:41,567	| IOT171 |	Home automation gadgets
EDL	00:07:41,567	00:07:43,103	| IOT171 |	Seemed like a fun Avenue
EDL	00:07:43,103	00:07:45,663	| IOT171 |	But I don't want my gadgets to be too dependent on
EDL	00:07:45,663	00:07:47,455	| IOT171 |	Proprietary protocols
EDL	00:07:47,455	00:07:48,223	| IOT171 |	Or
EDL	00:07:48,223	00:07:50,271	| IOT171 |	Access be on my own local
EDL	00:07:51,551	00:07:52,575	| IOT171 |	What tips do you have
EDL	00:07:53,087	00:07:58,463	| IOT171 |	But you can give me to find DIY friendly devices plans parts and protocols
EDL	00:07:59,231	00:07:59,999	| IOT171 |	Singson
EDL	00:07:59,999	00:08:02,047	| IOT171 |	I can have sole control over
EDL	00:08:02,559	00:08:04,095	| IOT171 |	A lot of fun
EDL	00:08:04,095	00:08:05,119	| IOT171 |	Thanks for a great podcast
EDL	00:08:05,887	00:08:07,679	| IOT171 |	Okay Rob
EDL	00:08:07,679	00:08:08,447	| IOT171 |	This
EDL	00:08:08,447	00:08:12,287	| IOT171 |	Is I think I actually really common desire among the lot of our audio
EDL	00:08:12,287	00:08:14,335	| IOT171 |	Yes you guys do not want stuff sent to
EDL	00:08:14,335	00:08:15,103	| IOT171 |	The cloud for the most
EDL	00:08:15,103	00:08:15,871	| IOT171 |	Parrot sounds like
EDL	00:08:15,871	00:08:16,639	| IOT171 |	Mike and
EDL	00:08:16,639	00:08:21,247	| IOT171 |	You don't want to have the compromises that come with the incredible lack of standards that we have in the
EDL	00:08:21,247	00:08:22,015	| IOT171 |	The industry today
EDL	00:08:22,015	00:08:22,783	| IOT171 |	I get that
EDL	00:08:22,783	00:08:23,551	| IOT171 |	But
EDL	00:08:23,551	00:08:24,831	| IOT171 |	We don't have a lot of
EDL	00:08:24,831	00:08:25,343	| IOT171 |	Options for
EDL	00:08:25,855	00:08:26,367	| IOT171 |	So
EDL	00:08:27,135	00:08:29,439	| IOT171 |	You want to control it all on your own
EDL	00:08:29,439	00:08:32,255	| IOT171 |	You could do something like load openhab
EDL	00:08:32,255	00:08:33,791	| IOT171 |	Are home assistant or
EDL	00:08:33,791	00:08:35,071	| IOT171 |	Homebridge on lyca
EDL	00:08:35,071	00:08:37,119	| IOT171 |	Hi it control everything
EDL	00:08:37,119	00:08:38,911	| IOT171 |	Locally from your pie
EDL	00:08:39,679	00:08:46,079	| IOT171 |	That's pretty complicated thing but you do say that you're doubly so you might be totally comfortable with that level
EDL	00:08:46,079	00:08:46,847	| IOT171 |	Love
EDL	00:08:46,847	00:08:47,615	| IOT171 |	Effort in
EDL	00:08:48,127	00:08:48,895	| IOT171 |	Granularity
EDL	00:08:48,895	00:08:51,967	| IOT171 |	I will say that I put openhab on
EDL	00:08:51,967	00:08:52,991	| IOT171 |	Can I use pine sol
EDL	00:08:52,991	00:08:57,343	| IOT171 |	Xt4 who's difficult to get it on there but man the level of control I had was
EDL	00:08:57,343	00:08:58,623	| IOT171 |	Awesome
EDL	00:08:58,623	00:08:59,135	| IOT171 |	And sky
EDL	00:09:00,159	00:09:01,695	| IOT171 |	But there's a downside
EDL	00:09:02,207	00:09:05,023	| IOT171 |	There is a downside if you do any of these things
EDL	00:09:05,535	00:09:06,047	| IOT171 |	You have a problem
EDL	00:09:06,559	00:09:08,607	| IOT171 |	Which is if for example your door isn't
EDL	00:09:09,375	00:09:13,727	| IOT171 |	And you're like my door is unlocked I will remotely control it from my smartphone while I am at dinner
EDL	00:09:14,239	00:09:15,519	| IOT171 |	You can't actually do that
EDL	00:09:15,519	00:09:18,079	| IOT171 |	And that lack of remote control
EDL	00:09:18,079	00:09:18,847	| IOT171 |	That made
EDL	00:09:18,847	00:09:21,663	| IOT171 |	Ear problem for you it kind of depends on the things you want to do with
EDL	00:09:21,663	00:09:22,431	| IOT171 |	Secure Smart Home
EDL	00:09:22,431	00:09:23,455	| IOT171 |	I would like
EDL	00:09:23,455	00:09:23,967	| IOT171 |	To have the remote
EDL	00:09:24,479	00:09:24,991	| IOT171 |	Access myself
EDL	00:09:25,503	00:09:27,807	| IOT171 |	I'm the same way I like my remote access
EDL	00:09:27,807	00:09:28,575	| IOT171 |	But I
EDL	00:09:28,575	00:09:33,183	| IOT171 |	Don't know that I want everything going to the cloud and you can do that you can have a local hub
EDL	00:09:33,183	00:09:39,583	| IOT171 |	Still have remote access so it sounds like you don't even want that so you can pick and choose what you'd like to do there is another new
EDL	00:09:39,583	00:09:42,655	| IOT171 |	New Option out there which is no cloud
EDL	00:09:42,655	00:09:43,679	| IOT171 |	Data an app
EDL	00:09:43,679	00:09:44,959	| IOT171 |	Is the habitat
EDL	00:09:44,959	00:09:47,519	| IOT171 |	Hub which we have a review in it
EDL	00:09:47,519	00:09:53,663	| IOT171 |	Hopefully coming soon so we'll be able to tell you a lot more but I know it's at least on paper it would meet your specifications
EDL	00:09:53,663	00:09:59,807	| IOT171 |	Because it is totally in your network does not go to the outside for its Smart Home Smart
EDL	00:10:00,319	00:10:02,111	| IOT171 |	Habitat where do they come from
EDL	00:10:02,111	00:10:04,671	| IOT171 |	Beef Elders actually built the rules engine
EDL	00:10:04,671	00:10:05,439	| IOT171 |	For the SmartThings
EDL	00:10:05,951	00:10:06,719	| IOT171 |	So
EDL	00:10:06,719	00:10:09,279	| IOT171 |	These guys they looked at SmartThings Chevrolet
EDL	00:10:09,279	00:10:10,815	| IOT171 |	Like I like where this is going
EDL	00:10:10,815	00:10:11,583	| IOT171 |	Pretty granular
EDL	00:10:12,095	00:10:13,631	| IOT171 |	Can go as deep as you want to
EDL	00:10:13,631	00:10:14,655	| IOT171 |	But they
EDL	00:10:14,655	00:10:16,959	| IOT171 |	Did not like a lot of the aspects of the
EDL	00:10:16,959	00:10:17,983	| IOT171 |	Cloud connectivity
EDL	00:10:17,983	00:10:18,751	| IOT171 |	So
EDL	00:10:18,751	00:10:21,311	| IOT171 |	They were like hey I want to control all of this on my own
EDL	00:10:23,359	00:10:25,663	| IOT171 |	Yeah well once we have that in-house we can
EDL	00:10:25,663	00:10:28,735	| IOT171 |	Tell you more how it works one other thing I'd like to mention if
EDL	00:10:28,735	00:10:29,759	| IOT171 |	Rob really wants
EDL	00:10:29,759	00:10:36,159	| IOT171 |	Tinker and not have a ton of different apps because obviously certain devices that not necessarily certain protocol
EDL	00:10:36,159	00:10:38,207	| IOT171 |	Close but just kind of use their own app
EDL	00:10:38,207	00:10:44,607	| IOT171 |	Controlling things like that you could actually get into some very light coding and use apis that are available from a lot of
EDL	00:10:44,607	00:10:51,007	| IOT171 |	The different device makers I control a lifx bulb using a Raspberry Pi and some python
EDL	00:10:51,007	00:10:52,799	| IOT171 |	It's literally just a couple lines of
EDL	00:10:52,799	00:10:58,943	| IOT171 |	Code to actually enable of lighter so on so forth so if you don't want a ton of apps as well and you want your own controls you could do that too
EDL	00:10:59,711	00:11:05,087	| IOT171 |	I will warn you and I will warn anyone who says I don't want to depend on proprietary protocols
EDL	00:11:05,087	00:11:07,391	| IOT171 |	I will say that it's not just the
EDL	00:11:07,391	00:11:08,671	| IOT171 |	Proprietary protocols that
EDL	00:11:09,951	00:11:14,047	| IOT171 |	Okay let's go with another question we have got one
EDL	00:11:14,047	00:11:14,815	| IOT171 |	From
EDL	00:11:14,815	00:11:15,583	| IOT171 |	Eric
EDL	00:11:15,583	00:11:17,375	| IOT171 |	With kind of a doozy so
EDL	00:11:17,887	00:11:18,655	| IOT171 |	Let's hear it
EDL	00:11:18,655	00:11:21,727	| IOT171 |	PlayStation Kevin Dwyer up some wise cameras
EDL	00:11:21,727	00:11:24,287	| IOT171 |	Problem before today would make a
EDL	00:11:24,287	00:11:25,823	| IOT171 |	Small USB
EDL	00:11:25,823	00:11:27,103	| IOT171 |	Tension wire
EDL	00:11:27,103	00:11:27,871	| IOT171 |	Power only
EDL	00:11:28,383	00:11:29,407	| IOT171 |	With a
EDL	00:11:29,407	00:11:30,687	| IOT171 |	Plug in the middle of it
EDL	00:11:30,687	00:11:34,527	| IOT171 |	Very small such said I can go maybe a quarter inch hole
EDL	00:11:34,527	00:11:35,551	| IOT171 |	Ancestry
EDL	00:11:35,551	00:11:37,855	| IOT171 |	We connected on the other side of the wall
EDL	00:11:37,855	00:11:39,391	| IOT171 |	Minimize the hole size
EDL	00:11:39,391	00:11:40,415	| IOT171 |	Of course.
EDL	00:11:40,415	00:11:41,439	| IOT171 |	Most USB
EDL	00:11:41,439	00:11:47,327	| IOT171 |	Hey connectors are pretty big in the night camera connectors are still fairly big so I want a midpoint disconnect
EDL	00:11:47,327	00:11:49,631	| IOT171 |	Push it through a hole
EDL	00:11:49,631	00:11:52,191	| IOT171 |	Anyway thanks for your help and love you podcast
EDL	00:11:52,703	00:11:54,495	| IOT171 |	So Eric I look
EDL	00:11:54,495	00:11:57,055	| IOT171 |	All over the web like the entire web
EDL	00:11:57,055	00:11:58,335	| IOT171 |	4 USB
EDL	00:11:58,335	00:12:02,687	| IOT171 |	Cable that has a disconnect in the middle and I struck out and I don't know if that's
EDL	00:12:02,687	00:12:06,015	| IOT171 |	Because there's no demand for them or the USB spect
EDL	00:12:06,015	00:12:07,295	| IOT171 |	Not allow for those
EDL	00:12:07,295	00:12:13,695	| IOT171 |	So the short answer is there is no cable it's going to work for what you want to do and I get while you want to do what you want to do
EDL	00:12:13,695	00:12:17,023	| IOT171 |	You want to limit the hole that you're drilling to pass through Power
EDL	00:12:17,023	00:12:17,791	| IOT171 |	4
EDL	00:12:17,791	00:12:19,327	| IOT171 |	A wyzecam in another room
EDL	00:12:19,327	00:12:20,607	| IOT171 |	So
EDL	00:12:20,607	00:12:26,239	| IOT171 |	I came up with some Alternatives and I'll let you decide if any of these are workable one is that
EDL	00:12:26,239	00:12:31,359	| IOT171 |	You could if you have an outlet within 5 Mi of the wise
EDL	00:12:31,359	00:12:37,503	| IOT171 |	Camera that you're going to put up what you could do is swap at Outlet out with another Outlet
EDL	00:12:37,503	00:12:41,343	| IOT171 |	That still has three prongs but also has additional USB port
EDL	00:12:41,343	00:12:47,743	| IOT171 |	Sports and these are inexpensive maybe $15 I have a couple of my office that are easy to wire and what that'll do is
EDL	00:12:47,743	00:12:50,047	| IOT171 |	Is it a let you use a regular USB
EDL	00:12:50,047	00:12:56,447	| IOT171 |	Cable from that outlet unfortunately you're going to see the wire because that's going to be in the same room but that is an option and I
EDL	00:12:56,447	00:13:00,287	| IOT171 |	I said five meters because that is the spec USB for length
EDL	00:13:00,799	00:13:07,199	| IOT171 |	Shouldn't be more than once you get repeaters and all but you wouldn't need that I'm trying to think of some other options there just aren't too many I know
EDL	00:13:07,199	00:13:09,247	| IOT171 |	I know Stacy you thought of something if
EDL	00:13:09,247	00:13:15,135	| IOT171 |	You want to have an electrician come in the house and drop a new outlet
EDL	00:13:15,135	00:13:17,951	| IOT171 |	Because of my life I need more outlets in weird places.
EDL	00:13:19,487	00:13:19,999	| IOT171 |	Under my sink
EDL	00:13:20,767	00:13:27,167	| IOT171 |	So you just have the electrician come out if there is a light switch or an existing outlet they can run some
EDL	00:13:27,167	00:13:29,727	| IOT171 |	Something up the wall down the wall anywhere on the wall
EDL	00:13:30,239	00:13:33,311	| IOT171 |	It cost about in Austin it cost about $25 to get
EDL	00:13:33,823	00:13:37,407	| IOT171 |	Added onto your visit so there's usually a small visit fee and
EDL	00:13:37,919	00:13:38,943	| IOT171 |	That so
EDL	00:13:38,943	00:13:39,711	| IOT171 |	And while they're out there they could
EDL	00:13:40,223	00:13:40,735	| IOT171 |	About all your lights
EDL	00:13:42,015	00:13:43,807	| IOT171 |	So that's really the only option I had
EDL	00:13:44,575	00:13:45,087	| IOT171 |	Which is not proper
EDL	00:13:46,367	00:13:49,439	| IOT171 |	Okay sorry bad news there but
EDL	00:13:49,439	00:13:50,463	| IOT171 |	We have some good news
EDL	00:13:50,975	00:13:51,743	| IOT171 |	Next color
EDL	00:13:51,743	00:13:52,767	| IOT171 |	Who is from
EDL	00:13:52,767	00:13:53,279	| IOT171 |	Canada
EDL	00:13:53,791	00:13:54,303	| IOT171 |	Hi Kevin
EDL	00:13:56,607	00:13:58,143	| IOT171 |	Canada
EDL	00:13:58,143	00:13:58,911	| IOT171 |	Work
EDL	00:14:00,191	00:14:01,215	| IOT171 |	A girlfriend
EDL	00:14:10,175	00:14:11,455	| IOT171 |	Canada
EDL	00:14:12,991	00:14:14,271	| IOT171 |	Affordable
EDL	00:14:14,271	00:14:15,551	| IOT171 |	Lucia Nutley
EDL	00:14:15,551	00:14:16,831	| IOT171 |	Hear from you
EDL	00:14:17,855	00:14:18,879	| IOT171 |	First off
EDL	00:14:18,879	00:14:21,695	| IOT171 |	Your girlfriend with the SmartThings Hub she's a keeper
EDL	00:14:21,695	00:14:23,999	| IOT171 |	Because it's hard to find people who you love and who
EDL	00:14:24,511	00:14:26,303	| IOT171 |	One day you might live with who like
EDL	00:14:26,303	00:14:27,839	| IOT171 |	Having the destruction of a smart
EDL	00:14:27,839	00:14:28,863	| IOT171 |	Courthouse cell
EDL	00:14:28,863	00:14:33,727	| IOT171 |	We went and looked for this particular product I used to try smoke alarms out
EDL	00:14:33,727	00:14:34,495	| IOT171 |	End
EDL	00:14:34,495	00:14:36,031	| IOT171 |	The challenge was my dogwood
EDL	00:14:36,799	00:14:37,311	| IOT171 |	So I stopped trying
EDL	00:14:37,823	00:14:39,615	| IOT171 |	But I did go and find
EDL	00:14:39,615	00:14:40,639	| IOT171 |	A First Alert one
EDL	00:14:40,639	00:14:44,223	| IOT171 |	Because I know that they actually work with lots of different options
EDL	00:14:44,735	00:14:45,503	| IOT171 |	Kitty
EDL	00:14:45,503	00:14:48,063	| IOT171 |	Kidde I'm not sure how you say it they have a
EDL	00:14:48,063	00:14:50,879	| IOT171 |	Proprietary radio so not all if there's work with
EDL	00:14:50,879	00:14:52,415	| IOT171 |	Other devices that
EDL	00:14:52,415	00:14:53,439	| IOT171 |	Don't have that radio in them
EDL	00:14:53,439	00:14:56,511	| IOT171 |	But I look for a First Alert Z-Wave smoke detector
EDL	00:14:57,023	00:15:01,119	| IOT171 |	Because the Wi-Fi ones 8 they need to be wired they require a lot of power
EDL	00:15:02,399	00:15:04,447	| IOT171 |	All seem to have secret surveillance
EDL	00:15:04,447	00:15:05,471	| IOT171 |	Cameras in them which kind of fruit
EDL	00:15:06,239	00:15:07,007	| IOT171 |	Is that real
EDL	00:15:07,007	00:15:09,823	| IOT171 |	I went searching for a Z-Wave smoke detector
EDL	00:15:09,823	00:15:11,103	| IOT171 |	On Amazon
EDL	00:15:11,103	00:15:12,383	| IOT171 |	Canadian site
EDL	00:15:12,383	00:15:13,919	| IOT171 |	By golly I found one
EDL	00:15:13,919	00:15:14,943	| IOT171 |	I found a
EDL	00:15:14,943	00:15:16,991	| IOT171 |	Lovely one that actually does work with smart
EDL	00:15:17,503	00:15:18,015	| IOT171 |	It does not work
EDL	00:15:19,551	00:15:20,319	| IOT171 |	And
EDL	00:15:20,319	00:15:21,343	| IOT171 |	It costs
EDL	00:15:21,343	00:15:22,879	| IOT171 |	Roughly $88 Canadian
EDL	00:15:23,391	00:15:24,927	| IOT171 |	So it felt a little expensive
EDL	00:15:25,439	00:15:29,535	| IOT171 |	But you know you can do the cool things like when your smoke alarm goes off
EDL	00:15:29,535	00:15:31,583	| IOT171 |	You can set a program and SmartThings so it
EDL	00:15:32,351	00:15:34,143	| IOT171 |	Like turn your lights on and off
EDL	00:15:34,143	00:15:34,655	| IOT171 |	If you want
EDL	00:15:35,167	00:15:36,959	| IOT171 |	Text you can do lots of fun things
EDL	00:15:37,471	00:15:43,359	| IOT171 |	It's a bummer that doesn't work with wink I know it'll work for this particular call or would not work for me my
EDL	00:15:43,359	00:15:43,871	| IOT171 |	Family is awake
EDL	00:15:44,383	00:15:47,455	| IOT171 |	Maybe I should be on your Tinder profile do you like SmartThings or wink
EDL	00:15:48,735	00:15:49,503	| IOT171 |	Your profile
EDL	00:15:49,503	00:15:52,319	| IOT171 |	No comment node of course not
EDL	00:15:52,831	00:15:53,599	| IOT171 |	Of course not
EDL	00:15:54,623	00:15:55,903	| IOT171 |	Like I'm going to have to tell your wife
EDL	00:15:56,415	00:15:57,695	| IOT171 |	No no no she's awake
EDL	00:15:58,463	00:15:58,975	| IOT171 |	There you go
EDL	00:15:59,999	00:16:03,071	| IOT171 |	So yes and Kevin I think actually before the show
EDL	00:16:03,071	00:16:03,583	| IOT171 |	He pointed out that
EDL	00:16:07,423	00:16:13,823	| IOT171 |	No because you know I looked at The Nest smoke alarms and see you know you can spend a hundred $2,250 a month
EDL	00:16:13,823	00:16:20,223	| IOT171 |	More for each one and that adds up quickly and 88 Canadian dollars is roughly around 65 you
EDL	00:16:20,223	00:16:26,623	| IOT171 |	U.s. dollar so it's a lot cheaper than the nest options that we have here so I don't think it's too terrible but again I don't know
EDL	00:16:26,623	00:16:28,159	| IOT171 |	This particular individuals budget
EDL	00:16:28,927	00:16:30,463	| IOT171 |	His first girlfriend he's going to spend the money
EDL	00:16:30,975	00:16:31,743	| IOT171 |	Spend the money
EDL	00:16:31,743	00:16:32,511	| IOT171 |	Yeah she's
EDL	00:16:32,511	00:16:33,791	| IOT171 |	Scrapy she's twerking
EDL	00:16:34,303	00:16:34,815	| IOT171 |	She's worth it
EDL	00:16:35,327	00:16:35,839	| IOT171 |	Apus next
EDL	00:16:37,375	00:16:38,143	| IOT171 |	This week's
EDL	00:16:38,143	00:16:39,679	| IOT171 |	Winner I wish we
EDL	00:16:39,679	00:16:41,215	| IOT171 |	We have little bells
EDL	00:16:41,727	00:16:42,239	| IOT171 |	I should really invest
EDL	00:16:43,263	00:16:44,799	| IOT171 |	This is Robert
EDL	00:16:44,799	00:16:45,567	| IOT171 |	And
EDL	00:16:45,567	00:16:46,335	| IOT171 |	He
EDL	00:16:46,335	00:16:48,383	| IOT171 |	Has a question that actually surprisingly
EDL	00:16:48,383	00:16:49,151	| IOT171 |	Easy to answer
EDL	00:16:49,151	00:16:49,919	| IOT171 |	Very short answer
EDL	00:16:50,431	00:16:51,967	| IOT171 |	With a very long explanation
EDL	00:16:51,967	00:16:52,735	| IOT171 |	Exactly
EDL	00:16:52,735	00:16:53,503	| IOT171 |	So let's
EDL	00:16:53,503	00:16:54,015	| IOT171 |	Tear it
EDL	00:16:55,807	00:16:59,647	| IOT171 |	Another time but I'm just getting into the home automation thing
EDL	00:16:59,647	00:17:02,719	| IOT171 |	I was looking at the home assistant
EDL	00:17:02,719	00:17:05,023	| IOT171 |	Be my first project
EDL	00:17:05,023	00:17:06,559	| IOT171 |	Start in a new home on 3rd
EDL	00:17:07,839	00:17:08,351	| IOT171 |	Getting
EDL	00:17:09,631	00:17:11,423	| IOT171 |	I just want to know if
EDL	00:17:14,495	00:17:16,287	| IOT171 |	First timer into the
EDL	00:17:16,287	00:17:17,311	| IOT171 |	World
EDL	00:17:17,823	00:17:18,847	| IOT171 |	Okay Robert
EDL	00:17:18,847	00:17:19,871	| IOT171 |	Here is the short answer
EDL	00:17:20,639	00:17:21,407	| IOT171 |	No no
EDL	00:17:23,455	00:17:26,015	| IOT171 |	And why is that
EDL	00:17:27,039	00:17:30,623	| IOT171 |	We don't have any sense Robert of how Adept you are technically
EDL	00:17:30,623	00:17:32,927	| IOT171 |	Play End like I was saved when I installed
EDL	00:17:32,927	00:17:33,695	| IOT171 |	Openhab
EDL	00:17:33,695	00:17:34,719	| IOT171 |	Home assistant
EDL	00:17:34,719	00:17:37,535	| IOT171 |	Looks actually a little bit easier to install
EDL	00:17:37,535	00:17:38,815	| IOT171 |	Then openhab
EDL	00:17:39,327	00:17:44,191	| IOT171 |	But it still requires you to be familiar with having a Raspberry Pi and
EDL	00:17:44,703	00:17:45,983	| IOT171 |	Loading software onto it
EDL	00:17:46,495	00:17:47,263	| IOT171 |	And the interface
EDL	00:17:47,775	00:17:48,799	| IOT171 |	Looks amazing
EDL	00:17:48,799	00:17:52,895	| IOT171 |	But man I'm going to tell you getting the software on these things is like a
EDL	00:17:52,895	00:17:53,663	| IOT171 |	Journey ended up
EDL	00:17:55,967	00:18:02,367	| IOT171 |	Yeah this is one of those that you would install on Raspberry Pi so that's why we're leaving towards you know but Robert if you can name for Lee
EDL	00:18:02,367	00:18:06,719	| IOT171 |	Linux distros off of top of your head that would tell me you're Savvy enough to make this happen
EDL	00:18:06,719	00:18:09,535	| IOT171 |	So if you are then yes would be our answer
EDL	00:18:09,535	00:18:15,935	| IOT171 |	Is your not then know this would be similar to as you said Stacy the hoping to have Mozilla things Etc
EDL	00:18:15,935	00:18:22,079	| IOT171 |	Probably better off as a first-time smart home buyer to get a smart home hub such as SmartThings or
EDL	00:18:22,079	00:18:24,639	| IOT171 |	Wink work will say more about habitat
EDL	00:18:24,639	00:18:26,687	| IOT171 |	Once we have that in-house it can tell you
EDL	00:18:26,687	00:18:30,527	| IOT171 |	If we would recommend that so that would be a recommendation
EDL	00:18:31,551	00:18:35,135	| IOT171 |	So on the one and you have openhab you have home assistant
EDL	00:18:35,135	00:18:36,159	| IOT171 |	Homebridge
EDL	00:18:36,159	00:18:37,695	| IOT171 |	Super powerful
EDL	00:18:37,695	00:18:40,767	| IOT171 |	Requires a lot of expertise and it also requires a lot of time like
EDL	00:18:41,279	00:18:44,863	| IOT171 |	When I was playing with openhab man I could spend an hour
EDL	00:18:44,863	00:18:47,167	| IOT171 |	Setting up one light bulb
EDL	00:18:47,167	00:18:49,471	| IOT171 |	Because that's how much greater than it was
EDL	00:18:49,471	00:18:54,335	| IOT171 |	Wonderful for anybody who ever like played D&D and spent hours designing their character
EDL	00:18:54,335	00:18:56,383	| IOT171 |	I mean that's kind of what I felt like
EDL	00:18:58,175	00:18:58,943	| IOT171 |	Now
EDL	00:18:58,943	00:19:01,247	| IOT171 |	The next level above that I would say smart
EDL	00:19:01,759	00:19:03,807	| IOT171 |	Switch gives you a lot of programmability
EDL	00:19:03,807	00:19:05,343	| IOT171 |	It's a little less
EDL	00:19:06,623	00:19:09,951	| IOT171 |	Is that a lot with the reliability but still there sometimes
EDL	00:19:09,951	00:19:10,719	| IOT171 |	Some issues
EDL	00:19:10,719	00:19:12,767	| IOT171 |	It's a little less user-friendly
EDL	00:19:12,767	00:19:15,071	| IOT171 |	I think it was idiot-proof and then wink
EDL	00:19:15,071	00:19:16,095	| IOT171 |	Is just
EDL	00:19:16,095	00:19:17,887	| IOT171 |	To me it's the gold standard of hubs for
EDL	00:19:18,655	00:19:19,167	| IOT171 |	Cuse and then
EDL	00:19:19,679	00:19:20,703	| IOT171 |	Homekit is
EDL	00:19:20,703	00:19:25,823	| IOT171 |	Also super easy probably easier than wink but you have your than in a tall Apple
EDL	00:19:25,823	00:19:26,591	| IOT171 |	Ecosystem
EDL	00:19:26,591	00:19:27,615	| IOT171 |	Which doesn't work
EDL	00:19:27,615	00:19:30,175	| IOT171 |	Right I would agree also have some limitations and that
EDL	00:19:30,175	00:19:32,223	| IOT171 |	Would be in the device choice because
EDL	00:19:32,735	00:19:37,599	| IOT171 |	You can't using Peter Z-Wave with homekit you're stuck with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth type devices
EDL	00:19:38,111	00:19:39,391	| IOT171 |	So that is our
EDL	00:19:39,391	00:19:40,671	| IOT171 |	Gradient of home hub
EDL	00:19:42,975	00:19:43,999	| IOT171 |	All right
EDL	00:19:43,999	00:19:45,023	| IOT171 |	And congratulations
EDL	00:19:46,559	00:19:47,583	| IOT171 |	You in the Schlage
EDL	00:19:48,095	00:19:49,887	| IOT171 |	Lock so that's actually a good start
EDL	00:19:51,679	00:19:52,191	| IOT171 |	And now
EDL	00:19:52,959	00:19:53,471	| IOT171 |	A question
EDL	00:19:53,983	00:19:54,495	| IOT171 |	From Twain
EDL	00:19:56,031	00:19:58,335	| IOT171 |	Atlanta
EDL	00:19:58,335	00:20:00,639	| IOT171 |	Stacy I just saw your twin
EDL	00:20:00,639	00:20:07,039	| IOT171 |	The post referring to Kevin's article on the routers and smart home hub
EDL	00:20:07,039	00:20:08,575	| IOT171 |	I have a question
EDL	00:20:08,575	00:20:10,367	| IOT171 |	I'm actually looking
EDL	00:20:10,367	00:20:14,207	| IOT171 |	Getting the Samsung connect home 3 pack
EDL	00:20:14,719	00:20:15,999	| IOT171 |	Actually for
EDL	00:20:15,999	00:20:18,303	| IOT171 |	$99 which is unbelievably
EDL	00:20:18,303	00:20:20,607	| IOT171 |	Just low and I'm wondering what are your thoughts
EDL	00:20:21,119	00:20:27,519	| IOT171 |	Is it a good unit I'm considering also get into the Google wi-fi system but I just wanted to know your salt
EDL	00:20:27,519	00:20:28,799	| IOT171 |	Samsung
EDL	00:20:31,615	00:20:32,127	| IOT171 |	Prices
EDL	00:20:33,919	00:20:34,687	| IOT171 |	Thank you
EDL	00:20:34,687	00:20:35,967	| IOT171 |	And thanks Michelle
EDL	00:20:35,967	00:20:38,271	| IOT171 |	Dwayne we are really sorry that we
EDL	00:20:38,271	00:20:40,319	| IOT171 |	We did not get to you in time
EDL	00:20:40,319	00:20:42,879	| IOT171 |	For this deal because it was a smoking hot deal
EDL	00:20:42,879	00:20:43,647	| IOT171 |	But
EDL	00:20:43,647	00:20:44,927	| IOT171 |	Is Kevin will explain
EDL	00:20:44,927	00:20:46,719	| IOT171 |	We're a little confused as to what you're asked
EDL	00:20:47,231	00:20:47,999	| IOT171 |	We think you're asking too diff
EDL	00:20:49,023	00:20:51,839	| IOT171 |	Right you should mention the Samsung connect 3 pack
EDL	00:20:51,839	00:20:57,215	| IOT171 |	Which is a mesh Network and you also mention Google Wi-Fi as a contender which is also a mesh Network
EDL	00:20:57,215	00:21:02,079	| IOT171 |	So that's fine those are on par right there there's a some subtle differences that I mention II
EDL	00:21:02,079	00:21:03,359	| IOT171 |	But there's one key
EDL	00:21:03,359	00:21:06,687	| IOT171 |	Prince the Samsung connect is also a SmartThings
EDL	00:21:06,687	00:21:08,223	| IOT171 |	Hub for your smartphone
EDL	00:21:08,223	00:21:12,831	| IOT171 |	Google Wi-Fi is not a smart home hub so it is strictly a network
EDL	00:21:13,343	00:21:14,623	| IOT171 |	Set up for your home
EDL	00:21:14,623	00:21:16,416	| IOT171 |	So if you're looking for just
EDL	00:21:16,416	00:21:16,928	| IOT171 |	A network
EDL	00:21:17,440	00:21:18,208	| IOT171 |	In your eyes
EDL	00:21:18,208	00:21:22,816	| IOT171 |	Either would do the Samsung connect uses slightly faster Wireless
EDL	00:21:22,816	00:21:29,216	| IOT171 |	Radios that are up to 1300 megabits per second theoretical real world is not going to be quite that fast.
EDL	00:21:29,216	00:21:34,080	| IOT171 |	Google Wi-Fi is 1200 megabits per second you probably wouldn't notice the difference
EDL	00:21:34,080	00:21:34,592	| IOT171 |	You may not have it
EDL	00:21:36,128	00:21:42,528	| IOT171 |	Right exactly it all depends but even for internal transfer from computer to computer that's where you would gain some benefit and see the fast
EDL	00:21:42,528	00:21:45,600	| IOT171 |	Speed regardless though if you don't have a hub
EDL	00:21:45,600	00:21:49,952	| IOT171 |	And you're looking for a hug the only choice of the two you mentioned would be the Samsung connect
EDL	00:21:49,952	00:21:50,720	| IOT171 |	Because
EDL	00:21:50,720	00:21:52,256	| IOT171 |	SmartThings is built in
EDL	00:21:53,280	00:21:54,560	| IOT171 |	Hopefully that helps
EDL	00:21:54,560	00:21:55,328	| IOT171 |	Hopefully
EDL	00:21:55,328	00:21:56,864	| IOT171 |	You see that awesome deal again
EDL	00:21:57,376	00:21:57,888	| IOT171 |	Keep decided you were
EDL	00:21:59,168	00:22:03,008	| IOT171 |	What do you pull the trigger on that $99 deal on save two hundred bucks
EDL	00:22:03,520	00:22:05,568	| IOT171 |	If so good deal good on you
EDL	00:22:06,592	00:22:07,872	| IOT171 |	All right
EDL	00:22:07,872	00:22:08,640	| IOT171 |	Final
EDL	00:22:08,640	00:22:10,176	| IOT171 |	Question of the
EDL	00:22:10,176	00:22:11,456	| IOT171 |	Week is
EDL	00:22:11,968	00:22:14,272	| IOT171 |	About our favorite smart speaker
EDL	00:22:14,272	00:22:15,296	| IOT171 |	Madam
EDL	00:22:16,320	00:22:16,832	| IOT171 |	Let's hear it
EDL	00:22:17,344	00:22:19,648	| IOT171 |	Play Kevin Spacey I just want to say really in
EDL	00:22:19,648	00:22:20,928	| IOT171 |	Enjoy your
EDL	00:22:20,928	00:22:22,976	| IOT171 |	How many Educators and IB
EDL	00:22:22,976	00:22:24,000	| IOT171 |	Been doing a lot of workshops
EDL	00:22:24,512	00:22:27,328	| IOT171 |	Temptations on using Alexa in

EDL	00:22:29,632	00:22:32,448	| IOT171 |	Just want to say really enjoyed I really don't
EDL	00:22:32,448	00:22:33,216	| IOT171 |	Any
EDL	00:22:33,216	00:22:35,008	| IOT171 |	Questions but certainly
EDL	00:22:35,008	00:22:35,776	| IOT171 |	Enjoy
EDL	00:22:35,776	00:22:36,288	| IOT171 |	If you
EDL	00:22:36,800	00:22:39,104	| IOT171 |	Add or know of any
EDL	00:22:39,104	00:22:39,872	| IOT171 |	Skills at
EDL	00:22:40,384	00:22:41,408	| IOT171 |	Teen to
EDL	00:22:41,408	00:22:42,688	| IOT171 |	Educators and if
EDL	00:22:42,688	00:22:44,224	| IOT171 |	You've heard of anyone that is
EDL	00:22:44,224	00:22:44,992	| IOT171 |	Using
EDL	00:22:44,992	00:22:46,272	| IOT171 |	Mad at me
EDL	00:22:46,784	00:22:48,576	| IOT171 |	In the classroom thanks so much and
EDL	00:22:48,576	00:22:49,856	| IOT171 |	Thanks again for a great time
EDL	00:22:50,880	00:22:53,184	| IOT171 |	Oh I am so glad you asked
EDL	00:22:53,184	00:22:54,208	| IOT171 |	This question be
EDL	00:22:54,208	00:22:57,024	| IOT171 |	Because we had so much fun
EDL	00:22:57,536	00:23:03,680	| IOT171 |	We as we did yes we did The r4000 Madam a skills in the education and reference
EDL	00:23:04,448	00:23:08,544	| IOT171 |	And I wouldn't say we went through all of them but we went through a bunch
EDL	00:23:08,544	00:23:10,336	| IOT171 |	And we installed and use them
EDL	00:23:10,336	00:23:11,104	| IOT171 |	To come up with
EDL	00:23:11,104	00:23:16,992	| IOT171 |	Five recommendations here granted you can go through yourself and find additional ones but we really enjoyed using these
EDL	00:23:16,992	00:23:17,760	| IOT171 |	Yes and
EDL	00:23:19,040	00:23:19,552	| IOT171 |	Smarter and
EDL	00:23:20,576	00:23:22,880	| IOT171 |	We weren't
EDL	00:23:22,880	00:23:24,160	| IOT171 |	So first up
EDL	00:23:24,160	00:23:26,720	| IOT171 |	Is the National Geographic
EDL	00:23:26,720	00:23:27,488	| IOT171 |	Wiz
EDL	00:23:27,488	00:23:28,768	| IOT171 |	Skill reputable name
EDL	00:23:29,280	00:23:30,048	| IOT171 |	And
EDL	00:23:30,048	00:23:34,912	| IOT171 |	A very functional quiz so what this does is it every single day you get 6 dude
EDL	00:23:34,912	00:23:35,936	| IOT171 |	Geography based question
EDL	00:23:36,448	00:23:36,960	| IOT171 |	And the Americans
EDL	00:23:39,264	00:23:40,544	| IOT171 |	This was good Kevin and I however
EDL	00:23:42,848	00:23:44,896	| IOT171 |	I believe we scored 6 out of 6 on AR quiz
EDL	00:23:45,408	00:23:49,760	| IOT171 |	And there's a range some of them are very easy and some of them
EDL	00:23:49,760	00:23:51,808	| IOT171 |	We're a little more challenging I wouldn't say any of them
EDL	00:23:52,832	00:23:53,600	| IOT171 |	With your liking
EDL	00:23:53,600	00:23:54,880	| IOT171 |	Jeopardy champion
EDL	00:23:54,880	00:23:57,696	| IOT171 |	Quiz Bowl champion these are probably not going to stump you but
EDL	00:23:57,696	00:23:58,976	| IOT171 |	Definitely good for the classroom
EDL	00:23:59,488	00:24:00,256	| IOT171 |	Then we have
EDL	00:24:01,536	00:24:03,072	| IOT171 |	NASA NASA Mars
EDL	00:24:03,072	00:24:06,400	| IOT171 |	Yes That's Amore as I thought it would be
EDL	00:24:06,400	00:24:08,192	| IOT171 |	Good and it was
EDL	00:24:08,192	00:24:09,472	| IOT171 |	However it
EDL	00:24:09,472	00:24:15,872	| IOT171 |	Was very information dense it sometimes we'd asked what we thought was a simple question and we would hear a 5 min
EDL	00:24:15,872	00:24:20,224	| IOT171 |	Answer so there's a lot of detail in here this is me by JPL
EDL	00:24:20,224	00:24:22,528	| IOT171 |	Who would certainly know what's going on on Mars
EDL	00:24:27,648	00:24:29,184	| IOT171 |	That's correct
EDL	00:24:29,184	00:24:34,048	| IOT171 |	And you can get information about Mars but what we thought was really cool you can get
EDL	00:24:34,048	00:24:36,864	| IOT171 |	What is a real time but same day information
EDL	00:24:36,864	00:24:37,632	| IOT171 |	On the
EDL	00:24:37,632	00:24:38,656	| IOT171 |	Curiosity Rover
EDL	00:24:39,168	00:24:41,216	| IOT171 |	And when we happen to ask about it
EDL	00:24:41,216	00:24:42,240	| IOT171 |	Curiosity
EDL	00:24:42,240	00:24:45,824	| IOT171 |	Actually did not go as far as planned on Mars that day
EDL	00:24:45,824	00:24:51,968	| IOT171 |	And we found out exactly what the problem is and exactly what NASA is doing to resolve it I mean it was
EDL	00:24:51,968	00:24:54,016	| IOT171 |	Serious information really really cool
EDL	00:24:54,784	00:24:57,856	| IOT171 |	It was awesome and they had you know we asked I didn't realize this but
EDL	00:25:00,160	00:25:01,184	| IOT171 |	And we found out
EDL	00:25:01,696	00:25:02,464	| IOT171 |	The Moon's name
EDL	00:25:02,464	00:25:04,000	| IOT171 |	And we also found out
EDL	00:25:04,000	00:25:04,768	| IOT171 |	Why they were named
EDL	00:25:05,536	00:25:09,120	| IOT171 |	Complete mythological history very very very
EDL	00:25:09,120	00:25:10,656	| IOT171 |	So if
EDL	00:25:10,656	00:25:14,240	| IOT171 |	I was just asking about how many moons it had we got all of that information
EDL	00:25:14,240	00:25:14,752	| IOT171 |	Yes
EDL	00:25:15,264	00:25:15,776	| IOT171 |	We did not have to
EDL	00:25:19,360	00:25:20,384	| IOT171 |	It's actually probably a lot
EDL	00:25:21,920	00:25:23,712	| IOT171 |	Why does this work and then I'm like
EDL	00:25:24,224	00:25:25,504	| IOT171 |	Let me explain it to you
EDL	00:25:29,344	00:25:31,904	| IOT171 |	A half an hour and two drinks later you'll get your answer
EDL	00:25:31,904	00:25:32,416	| IOT171 |	Exactly
EDL	00:25:32,928	00:25:35,232	| IOT171 |	So we like that is probably for older
EDL	00:25:36,000	00:25:36,768	| IOT171 |	Patient people
EDL	00:25:36,768	00:25:38,304	| IOT171 |	We also tried for younger
EDL	00:25:38,304	00:25:39,328	| IOT171 |	Kids smart math
EDL	00:25:39,840	00:25:41,376	| IOT171 |	Which there a lot of smart math
EDL	00:25:41,888	00:25:43,680	| IOT171 |	I was looking for a math fact skill
EDL	00:25:43,680	00:25:45,472	| IOT171 |	Basically for my daughter
EDL	00:25:45,472	00:25:48,288	| IOT171 |	Because not too long ago we were in that realm of like
EDL	00:25:48,288	00:25:49,824	| IOT171 |	Hey what's 2 + 2 2
EDL	00:25:49,824	00:25:50,592	| IOT171 |	2 * 2
EDL	00:25:50,592	00:25:51,104	| IOT171 |	2 / 2
EDL	00:25:51,616	00:25:53,664	| IOT171 |	All of those fun things and
EDL	00:25:53,664	00:25:55,712	| IOT171 |	How cool would it be if you could just ask
EDL	00:25:56,480	00:25:56,992	| IOT171 |	Mate for your man
EDL	00:25:57,760	00:25:58,528	| IOT171 |	And it's
EDL	00:25:58,528	00:26:00,064	| IOT171 |	Pretty cool but it's also
EDL	00:26:00,576	00:26:02,880	| IOT171 |	Bus RTC it starts really easy
EDL	00:26:02,880	00:26:06,720	| IOT171 |	And this skill basically gives you 40 seconds and
EDL	00:26:06,720	00:26:09,280	| IOT171 |	Matinee will ask you math facts for that
EDL	00:26:09,280	00:26:10,048	| IOT171 |	Amount of time
EDL	00:26:10,048	00:26:11,328	| IOT171 |	I really wanted to go like
EDL	00:26:11,840	00:26:14,400	| IOT171 |	All out super fast but Madam is not super
EDL	00:26:14,912	00:26:16,448	| IOT171 |	But I did get 40 seconds
EDL	00:26:16,448	00:26:18,240	| IOT171 |	Which was 8 questions and they were like
EDL	00:26:19,008	00:26:19,776	| IOT171 |	OnePlus 4
EDL	00:26:19,776	00:26:20,800	| IOT171 |	Kevin heard me
EDL	00:26:20,800	00:26:22,592	| IOT171 |	Answer this at first I was like
EDL	00:26:22,592	00:26:23,872	| IOT171 |	Nervous about doing math
EDL	00:26:23,872	00:26:25,664	| IOT171 |	Nothing from the Kevin but it was not hard
EDL	00:26:25,664	00:26:27,456	| IOT171 |	But you can level up but I
EDL	00:26:27,456	00:26:27,968	| IOT171 |	I think it's a Time
EDL	00:26:30,016	00:26:31,296	| IOT171 |	Ruidoso baby for younger
EDL	00:26:32,320	00:26:32,832	| IOT171 |	And then
EDL	00:26:33,600	00:26:34,368	| IOT171 |	Kevin and I
EDL	00:26:36,928	00:26:38,464	| IOT171 |	You want to talk about our secret shame
EDL	00:26:39,232	00:26:44,864	| IOT171 |	Yeah I'm very disappointed in my performance on the periodic table quiz because I just
EDL	00:26:44,864	00:26:47,680	| IOT171 |	Went through the periodic table in the big history project
EDL	00:26:47,680	00:26:50,752	| IOT171 |	Switch I highly recommend for people if you could have big history project
EDL	00:26:50,752	00:26:51,520	| IOT171 |	X.com
EDL	00:26:51,520	00:26:56,640	| IOT171 |	I screwed up my alkaline metals in my transition metals in this one is really
EDL	00:26:56,640	00:26:58,944	| IOT171 |	Really challenging but educational
EDL	00:26:58,944	00:26:59,968	| IOT171 |	Tons of
EDL	00:26:59,968	00:27:00,736	| IOT171 |	Good
EDL	00:27:00,736	00:27:03,808	| IOT171 |	Good tough questions but I learned so much
EDL	00:27:03,808	00:27:05,344	| IOT171 |	I forget how many questions it asks
EDL	00:27:05,344	00:27:06,368	| IOT171 |	Fastest 5K
EDL	00:27:06,880	00:27:07,648	| IOT171 |	Sweet By the way
EDL	00:27:08,160	00:27:08,672	| IOT171 |	Only got
EDL	00:27:09,952	00:27:11,744	| IOT171 |	Two or three
EDL	00:27:11,744	00:27:13,024	| IOT171 |	We were not great but
EDL	00:27:13,024	00:27:13,536	| IOT171 |	Will be better next
EDL	00:27:14,048	00:27:15,840	| IOT171 |	I'm actually I kept that on there cuz I'm like
EDL	00:27:15,840	00:27:16,864	| IOT171 |	You will not pass
EDL	00:27:16,864	00:27:17,376	| IOT171 |	Best me.
EDL	00:27:18,656	00:27:19,168	| IOT171 |	But it did
EDL	00:27:20,448	00:27:21,472	| IOT171 |	But not again
EDL	00:27:21,472	00:27:25,824	| IOT171 |	And it's also better more for the sciencey kids that are in a folder or
EDL	00:27:25,824	00:27:32,224	| IOT171 |	Higher grade level so it's not Elementary School obviously which we had some pics in there if this was more towards the middle school and heck maybe even
EDL	00:27:32,224	00:27:32,736	| IOT171 |	High School
EDL	00:27:33,504	00:27:34,272	| IOT171 |	Or adults
EDL	00:27:34,784	00:27:36,064	| IOT171 |	As we sold our
EDL	00:27:36,576	00:27:39,648	| IOT171 |	All right in our final one is educational for anybody
EDL	00:27:39,648	00:27:40,672	| IOT171 |	I just liked
EDL	00:27:40,672	00:27:44,000	| IOT171 |	This and hopefully you guys will too it is the Autobahn
EDL	00:27:44,000	00:27:44,768	| IOT171 |	Bird songs
EDL	00:27:45,280	00:27:46,304	| IOT171 |	Scale and
EDL	00:27:46,304	00:27:49,120	| IOT171 |	You basically you ask madam A2
EDL	00:27:49,120	00:27:50,144	| IOT171 |	Ask Audubon
EDL	00:27:50,656	00:27:51,680	| IOT171 |	What a Mockingbird
EDL	00:27:51,680	00:27:52,448	| IOT171 |	It sounds like
EDL	00:27:52,448	00:27:53,728	| IOT171 |	And it will play
EDL	00:27:54,240	00:27:55,008	| IOT171 |	Mockingbird
EDL	00:27:55,008	00:27:57,824	| IOT171 |	I just thought this was needed it's not like Shazam for birds
EDL	00:27:58,336	00:28:02,176	| IOT171 |	Which would be even cooler but it's still for anybody who likes the animals or
EDL	00:28:02,688	00:28:03,456	| IOT171 |	To hear what's around them
EDL	00:28:05,248	00:28:11,648	| IOT171 |	Yeah you can ask it about any different bird I forget how many it actually has how many birds that actually covers butt
EDL	00:28:11,648	00:28:18,048	| IOT171 |	There are 2,000 bird calls in the skill and anything is with the Mockingbird and obviously with several other birds if
EDL	00:28:18,048	00:28:24,448	| IOT171 |	The bird has multiple sounds or calls it will play all of them I think for the Mockingbird played for different ones all in a row
EDL	00:28:24,448	00:28:27,008	| IOT171 |	Rose we can hear the different calls of a Mockingbird for example
EDL	00:28:27,776	00:28:28,288	| IOT171 |	Because that's what my king
EDL	00:28:30,336	00:28:31,104	| IOT171 |	Yes
EDL	00:28:31,104	00:28:32,128	| IOT171 |	Super cool
EDL	00:28:32,640	00:28:36,736	| IOT171 |	Those are some skills I recommend going digging through that we found a couple
EDL	00:28:36,736	00:28:38,016	| IOT171 |	Like we found a spelling test
EDL	00:28:38,016	00:28:39,296	| IOT171 |	Skill that we thought was great
EDL	00:28:39,296	00:28:42,368	| IOT171 |	Because it let you import your own spelling words but then
EDL	00:28:42,368	00:28:44,672	| IOT171 |	If you spelled something incorrectly it was like
EDL	00:28:44,672	00:28:45,184	| IOT171 |	Yeah
EDL	00:28:45,696	00:28:46,464	| IOT171 |	Didn't say anything
EDL	00:28:46,464	00:28:47,232	| IOT171 |	Nix that one
EDL	00:28:47,744	00:28:50,560	| IOT171 |	That was disappointing because I had such promise because
EDL	00:28:50,560	00:28:54,400	| IOT171 |	Stacy created around list online with the skill and then
EDL	00:28:54,400	00:28:56,704	| IOT171 |	Matabei regurgitated the list perfectly
EDL	00:28:56,704	00:28:59,264	| IOT171 |	But when you misspelled something you just didn't know
EDL	00:29:00,032	00:29:00,544	| IOT171 |	Didn't say anything
EDL	00:29:01,056	00:29:04,896	| IOT171 |	Kids with low confidence well it might be good for them but yes
EDL	00:29:04,896	00:29:07,712	| IOT171 |	So I would recommend all of these skills
EDL	00:29:07,712	00:29:08,992	| IOT171 |	Look for what you want
EDL	00:29:08,992	00:29:11,296	| IOT171 |	And then I would say test them out
EDL	00:29:11,296	00:29:13,344	| IOT171 |	Because some of them are of dubious quality
EDL	00:29:13,344	00:29:14,624	| IOT171 |	The ones we kiss
