Corwin efforts

17
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:48,128
It's called machineq so we can learn a lot about that

18
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:49,664
After we hear from

19
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,200
Our sponsor this week

20
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:51,968
Schlage

21
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:52,992
Now

22
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:56,064
Let's get the show started with a message from another one of our sponsor

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,744
Smart Kitchen Summit is the only event of his kind to tackle the future of food cookie

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,096
And the kitchen with decision-makers and disruptors across the food

25
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:11,424
Cooking appliance retail and Technology Industries

On October 10th at 11

29
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:26,272
My listeners get to take 25% off of any ticket type with the code

30
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:29,344
Stacey Stacey

31
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,112
Don't wait

32
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:34,208
Because early bird ticket pricing ends July 31st

33
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:36,256
An added bonus

34
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:37,536
Or not I don't know

35
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:38,560
I'll be there

36
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:39,584
All right

37
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,608
Is it a bonus

38
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:41,632
That's a bonus

39
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:43,168
Kevin's hang out with me in person

40
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:45,216
It's a bonus people trust me

41
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:46,752
So okay

42
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:48,544
I am actually in Seattle this week

43
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,312
So

44
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:50,336
It's nice up here

45
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:51,872
Maybe one day the show

46
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,152
All the time

47
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:57,248
So let's get started with

48
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:00,064
Embedded RFID tags because I don't know

49
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:07,744
Kevin yes or no yes or no so so that the news isn't that a company is

50
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,512
Implanting

51
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:12,352
Microchips and some of its employees little RFID tags

52
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,632
They're certainly not the first

53
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:16,704
People to have these I've seen for a couple years now people

54
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:22,080
Actually putting a little RFID chips in the webbing between their thumb and their

55
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,872
A palm in their hand

56
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:25,664
These are just they're doing in cells

57
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:31,040
Albert is actually employee a three Square Market is the name of the company in Wisconsin

58
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,832
About 50 employees are

59
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,160
Can you get implanted with RFID tags and why are they doing that

60
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:41,536
So it's easier to buy snacks and things from kiosks there at the

61
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:44,864
Office without using a credit card cash or smartphone

62
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:45,888
So

63
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:51,520
A lot of people read this and say exactly what you did say say it's creepy because it's so they're going to know everything

64
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:56,384
There's no tracking your GPS or like that so I don't know how creepy it really is

65
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,920
Why do you say it's creepy

66
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:00,992
PÃ©kin planting things in your body to buy

67
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:02,528
Snickers bars is

68
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,832
A step too far now we should clarify this

69
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:05,600
Voluntary

70
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:07,904
We should also clarify that

71
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:14,560
For the most part you have to actually get pretty close to it a reader that reads RR

72
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,680
Yes you have this thing in your body

73
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,216
But you have to get

74
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:21,984
Usually within a

75
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,312
Oh my God

76
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:29,408
A couple inches

77
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:31,456
There's passive and active

78
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,480
Enticing

79
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:33,504
The Pacifier

80
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:38,880
I would imagine that they are everything to keep them as small as possible I would never agree with you

81
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:39,648
So

82
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,184
If you don't eat just

83
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,280
But I've been to it so Facebook you know that they've had these for a while you can

84
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,072
They have vending machines full of like

85
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:49,888
All kinds of stuff and you just input your employer code

86
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:51,680
You get your thing

87
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,216
So that's also cashless

88
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:56,288
Facebook pay pay for it but it other places you could

89
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,056
Tie it to someone

90
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:57,824
Paycheck

91
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,736
If there's obviously there are alternatives to this

92
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:08,576
You know you could use your smartphone and ID badge watch Etc

93
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:12,672
I thought about doing this myself a couple years back and to test it

94
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:16,256
I don't know if you remember this but I'm going to say back in 20

95
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,791
12 or so

96
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:22,143
Samsung was selling programmable NFC stickers

97
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,447
Yeah

98
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:29,823
So I said before I put something in my body let me put something on my body cuz it at that time there was no

99
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:30,847
NFC

100
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:33,919
Smart watches and things like that it was we knew they were coming

101
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,711
Am I going to stick this on my

102
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:40,063
On the back of my hand for a couple days I put an NFC Reader in my

103
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:46,719
Mudroom door to get in the house when I came in I would just swipe my hand over the reader and all the lights would come on so I was doing some kind of automation

104
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,791
If I did this myself

105
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,327
I don't see that there's any

106
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,631
Creepy Factor new Big Brother Factor but

107
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:58,495
I can understand people not wanting a company into an item I would not want to companies do that either

108
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,823
I think we're getting to the point now where you can program these things

109
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,103
Easily

110
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:05,663
And you could actually do this yourself and not

111
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:08,223
And you have control I guess that's really what it comes down to

112
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:11,807
Because it comes it comes down to it being voluntary

113
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:15,135
Implicit question with a poises does it some point it become

114
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:15,903
Coercive

115
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:18,207
Like if you were the only person who is like

116
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,999
Yeah you know what I don't want

117
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,327
That's a pretty picture

118
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,119
Invasive

119
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:26,911
Crispy definition

120
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:30,751
That's where I am

121
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:34,847
I have this feels like a slippery slope that we're going down

122
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:39,967
What if it was you and I'm not saying that you would do this but what if you said you would if you had total

123
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:43,039
Control over it so you could program it to your door locks and

124
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,831
Your bank accounts

125
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:45,599
Send

126
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:49,951
Maybe three API through a place that you worked out and they would just allow

127
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:50,719
You did

128
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,999
No enter in

129
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,279
Country security with

130
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,071
You had control

131
00:05:55,583 --> 00:06:01,727
That feels like a step too far just in turkey oven if I had control because I'm not sure that I would have control and then they become

132
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,007
What are some

133
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,567
You know tapped into that API

134
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,847
Pulling out information

135
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:10,175
Are there mechanisms to change that without having to

136
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:12,223
Remove the implant and pop another

137
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:15,551
Oh you can you can reprogram these things

138
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,343
I reprogram it with my phone

139
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,111
Mini

140
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:24,767
Yeah you just tell the program what you want to do what you want the NFC tag to represent

141
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,559
I just tap it and it reprogrammed

142
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,863
Probably

143
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,655
It's not give me the instructions

144
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:31,935
Instructions

145
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:32,703
But it's

146
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:33,983
Is it's kind of

147
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,775
Caring for lack of a better word

148
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,055
And can they be spoofed

149
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,871
Magic anything can be smooth

150
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:42,175
10 min but I don't think it would be easy

151
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:46,015
These are the questions that I would want before I post

152
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,295
Like

153
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,599
There's also you know how long do electronics

154
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:54,975
Nothing to deserve because they're encased in some kind of capsule

155
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:57,023
That's about the size of a grain of rice

156
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:57,791
Pink

157
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,327
But they're good for about 10 years

158
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,375
So it's like a microchip in a dog

159
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,959
Is it okay to do to the dog

160
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:06,495
Really really

161
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:09,055
You know I will

162
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,335
Alright so

163
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,127
This is happening you guys

164
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:14,175
And if you think this is awesome

165
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:16,991
Then you know there's a company in Wisconsin plus you

166
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,271
Cheese curds

167
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,039
Which

168
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:20,575
Apparently our delicious

169
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:23,391
Moving right along into

170
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:24,671
Possibly

171
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:25,951
Google is equal to

172
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,743
Let's talk about the Roomba

173
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,791
I was saying if you thought poop

174
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:32,351
Apocalypse was bad you should see Matt gaetz

175
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:34,143
But then Kevin and I discussed how hard it was

176
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:34,911
Say that words

177
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:38,751
Remember how rubos were taking people's apparently their pets

178
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:39,775
Poop on the carpet

179
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:42,591
Everywhere I never was a guy

180
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,359
Why robots

181
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,127
The comedy behind

182
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:45,663
Is that again

183
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:46,943
Bad press

184
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,223
This time about

185
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:51,295
Liru bizarre it's the 900 in

186
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,831
80 I believe

187
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:55,903
Ribeye so the ones with Wi-Fi the 980

188
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,719
Evolution 2015

189
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,743
Maps your home

190
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:02,303
And apparently according to the terms of service

191
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,375
You can actually send that mapping data

192
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,447
And people are like

193
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,215
We don't like this

194
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,543
Well yeah I mean I don't

195
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:17,407
Biscuits Pakistani talk about a week or two ago consumer awareness and and maybe putting

196
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:21,759
And very clear print on the packaging of these things what happens to the data what are you

197
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,807
I know there's that you learned all that but

198
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:25,599
People don't read that and it's just

199
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:27,135
Not simple to read

200
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,415
So

201
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,719
There's got to be a better way to communicate it

202
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:34,047
Because if you agree to it then room is doing there within their bounds

203
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,607
Yes and

204
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,143
Here's again like

205
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:38,911
Like you said

206
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:39,679
We talked about

207
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,983
Companies that want

208
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:44,543
To be proactive about this are going to do better

209
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,335
Because right now everyone is

210
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,615
Freaking out

211
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,919
Roomba said in that it was

212
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:52,991
Committed to the absolute privacy of their customer related data

213
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,271
They can use

214
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,807
The rainbow without connecting it

215
00:08:56,063 --> 00:09:00,671
Go to the internet and you can opt out of sending that data to the cloud through switch on the mobile app

216
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:07,327
The company also said that no data is sold to third parties no data will be shared with third parties without informed consent

217
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,351
Of our customer

218
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:09,887
Zoe

219
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,423
I read

220
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:17,823
About half of the hughleys in terms of service in terms of service in the privacy policy or two different

221
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,615
Document

222
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:22,175
I read those in about half of my

223
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,223
Barely Legal

224
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,503
These are not things that

225
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,271
Explain stuff

226
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,039
Very clearly

227
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,831
I read a lot of them so I

228
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:29,855
Have a sense

229
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:30,623
What's me

230
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:34,719
Done but no one reads the terms of service on their back

231
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:36,255
Just like I didn't read the terms

232
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,279
Service that appeared

233
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,303
My oven

234
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,351
We don't have time for that

235
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:47,263
It's not consumer-friendly it's not that day it's all legally isn't and what time did you need to know what you're looking for

236
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,287
I think

237
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:51,359
Before you understand it and it's just not easy

238
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:53,919
Absent regulation which I do think we need

239
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:54,943
We need

240
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:59,039
Friendly ways to say hey

241
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,319
Here's how to opt-out

242
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,367
And it should be like

243
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,159
Possibly like

244
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:08,255
Permissions on like an Android app for an iPhone app with a like this company is trying to

245
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,535
Is asking for access

246
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,095
Could be something as simple as

247
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,119
The Roomba

248
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,143
Wants to

249
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:14,911
Cher

250
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:18,495
So this is what I think we need to get to

251
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,519
Otherwise

252
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:20,799
People are not like

253
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,335
I guarantee like

254
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:23,871
People read this were like

255
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,199
And if you already did

256
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:30,527
You're like okay well I'm going to turn that off

257
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,807
No data for you

258
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:34,367
In a sense that the problem because room is using

259
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:38,207
You said that mapping data to the cloud so that I could get better

260
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,231
Right

261
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:41,279
And so that's why

262
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,327
Topic need to be like

263
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,119
Transparent about was happy

264
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,655
Not transparent

265
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:49,215
Phuket legalese for transparency

266
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,751
Hey we're going to do this with your data

267
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:57,151
Yeah it's a tricky because a lot of these products you provide better Services when they crowdsource the data that they all cap

268
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:59,967
Right they can make the devices smarter and

269
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:03,551
Optimize and so on on the flipside people have to have a

270
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:06,879
Clear wedge opt-in or opt-out early early on

271
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:09,183
I need to know what they're opting in or out to

272
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,743
Okay

273
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,511
That's rude

274
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:13,791
So what's worse

275
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:16,095
Sharing your spreading your dog's paw

276
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,191
I'm sure for some people exposed

277
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,007
All right

278
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,287
Let's see August

279
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:26,079
B-connected door lock maker

280
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:29,151
About 25 million dollars in additional

281
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:29,919
Funding

282
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,223
This is on top of

283
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,759
Around the Rays last year

284
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,551
Here is

285
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,831
They've actually launched

286
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:37,855
A bunch of products

287
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,647
They launched a prologue

288
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,951
A new version of their locked

289
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,487
Tomcat version ticket

290
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:44,511
Valentines

291
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:50,655
The goal here is to boost their access August access Services Program

292
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:53,215
Lets people into your house

293
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:53,983
When you

294
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,007
Can see what it is

295
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,287
Or you can give codes

296
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,055
Do people like

297
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,335
Delivery folks

298
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,103
Etcetera

299
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,127
So

300
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,175
This is pretty cool

301
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,711
In addition to a funding

302
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,271
Gay good news we have an acquisition

303
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,063
This is an industrial internet

304
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:08,831
Things

305
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:10,367
Acquisition this is a company called

306
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,951
It is acquired a company called a rant

307
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:16,767
You may not recognize these companies

308
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:17,791
Because they

309
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,583
Direct consumer

310
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:24,447
Is iot services provider to a lot of company

311
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,495
Big Appliance makers

312
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:30,335
Basically have been doing this since 2006

313
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,127
So they're old school

314
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,479
They can connecting devices to the internet and managing those connections for a long time

315
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,783
I don't know how much the deal was for

316
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:41,087
Protea is a really strange company

317
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,391
They came out of nowhere

318
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:46,463
Is my 2015 with a hundred million dollars

319
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,487
In funding

320
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:51,327
It's the Ansari family who does the Ansari x-prize

321
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,119
The cell

322
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:55,679
An operating system for the Smart Home

323
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:58,751
To telcos and service providers

324
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:02,847
And I was kind of like really is that is that going to be a big business

325
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:05,407
But what they've done here is

326
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:08,991
They're still doing that line of business but with the acquisition of a rayon

327
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,527
They now basically have a

328
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:14,111
God I hate these words end in solution oh my God but they can do everything

329
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:19,231
And it really approaching it from that Telco mentality of

330
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:22,559
It's five nines reliability and all that

331
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:24,351
The one thing that I think is

332
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:27,679
Interesting and we never talked about this and it's a really big deal

333
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:29,471
Is they have

334
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,007
Really flexible

335
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,031
Pricing

336
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:34,335
For creating iot services

337
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:40,991
That's actually a big deal in the Telco space because a lot of these companies like when you have a cell phone plan

338
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:46,623
The software that manages all of that for the billing perspective is Arcane and in

339
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,671
Tents and it's slow

340
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:51,999
So a service provider champs-elysees

341
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,023
Swap out my

342
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,815
Plants I want to change things up a little

343
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,119
That takes weeks

344
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:02,495
So what these guys have done if they made it on demand

345
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:06,079
They have that capability to create an on-demand service

346
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,175
Program I'm just using one

347
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:13,247
I wonder that also helps

348
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,271
Companies

349
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,807
Startups actually

350
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:22,207
Get their connectivity easier in a sense of you know sometimes if you're not big enough Verizon AT&T is not going to talk to you

351
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,999
They will work with startups

352
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:26,815
You can call

353
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,423
But this is more for like a big company

354
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,959
Come in and say hey

355
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:34,751
All of these connected devices

356
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:37,311
I want you guys to connect them and manager

357
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:41,663
What my customers when I have 10 million customers

358
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,711
What services thereby in charge them

359
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:44,735
Inappropriately for them

360
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:46,783
Got it

361
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,319
The scalability then

362
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,855
Yeah it's hard

363
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:52,671
I know it sounds really excruciating lead all it does

364
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,695
But it's hard

365
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:55,743
This is

366
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:56,767
Not a small thing

367
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,047
Okay

368
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,839
We got our funding

369
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:02,143
We got in a position and sadly

370
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,447
We have a company that has stopped

371
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:08,543
I hate this

372
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:09,823
So finkton

373
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:10,847
Which

374
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:11,871
How do upstairs

375
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:14,943
I left the founders I would have met with him a bunch of times

376
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,271
It was a consumer-oriented

377
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,551
Text based

378
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,831
Home automation

379
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:24,415
So basically it was kind of conversational interface

380
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,463
It was tied to your Twitter account

381
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:28,255
Any idea was like

382
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:31,071
Your things knew who you were in there

383
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:33,119
I knew your friends were

384
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:40,543
It would even if I remember correctly reach out to you it's not like you would just not like a chatbot where you have to initiate the conversation

385
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:45,663
And it may notice something from a sensor or location of a friend or something and it would tell you something

386
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:48,479
Yeah so this was a really friendly in

387
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,503
Cute in

388
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:52,063
Fun idea for how to communicate with

389
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:54,879
That is not where the bark

390
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,159
It's going so

391
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:58,975
Tom Coates a co-founder he he said that

392
00:15:59,231 --> 00:15:59,743
It's not working

393
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:01,279
Southington is is dead

394
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,399
Nice interface

395
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,447
So

396
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:11,775
All right

397
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:12,543
Elon Musk

398
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:14,847
So we've got

399
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:17,663
Funny acquisition death and

400
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:21,247
Something more exciting stuff and now we have something boring

401
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,015
Flooring

402
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,063
Literally

403
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:31,999
Not too much to tell but it's kind of cool the boring car elevator from Elon Musk

404
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:35,327
He tweeted out a video of

405
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,607
The first demonstration

406
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:37,887
Showing a

407
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:40,447
Tesla of course pulling up to a little

408
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:43,775
Platform and then down down down the car went and this is

409
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,823
I can choose this before we were talking about

410
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,615
Just before the show started

411
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:51,711
I was thinking hyperlipid this actually doesn't have any idea what the hyperloop this is going to

412
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:55,807
The platform's going to bring cars down to almost like a conveyor belt

413
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:58,623
Type of solution for underneath cities

414
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:01,439
This is at this is your cortical on-ramp

415
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:05,791
Yes this is so basically you drive on it there's a really great Debo it's

416
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,095
Super fun in your life

417
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:08,863
Real

418
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,911
The cars

419
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:12,447
Elevator that

420
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,983
Disguised as a parking space

421
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,263
Ghost

422
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:17,055
And it drops you into this

423
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:20,383
Zips along underneath the ground

424
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:27,039
Either Menard report or iRobot

425
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:29,087
In the movie

426
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:35,231
Yeah I guess it's like that but I remember is that the highways on one of those two movies I think it was iRobot work

427
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:35,999
It would drop

428
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:38,047
Cars down to lower levels

429
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,839
And whatnot and they were just

430
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,119
Be automated

431
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,679
No traffic you know everything was happy

432
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:44,703
Pappy and Autumn

433
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:45,983
Yeah

434
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,775
So boring not doing it

435
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,055
But

436
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,591
That's what's happening there

437
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:51,615
How far are we from this

438
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:53,663
Lord Only Knows do we want this

439
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:57,247
Although

440
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,527
With automation

441
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,295
You know

442
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:02,623
Maybe we should get there without having to dig tunnels underneath the ground

443
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:04,927
Baby you know adding more freeways

444
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,719
Has never solved

445
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,487
Traffic

446
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:08,767
Really I don't know

447
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:11,071
Places like Houston we have

448
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:11,839
Luckily freeways

449
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:15,423
There still traffic so with autonomous driving

450
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,447
More

451
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:19,519
Space may be helpful but I think autonomous-driving is probably the bigger

452
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,543
Solution to this

453
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,311
Exactly

454
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:23,871
So also an industrial news

455
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,407
Because it's fun

456
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:28,223
We got two reports worth checking out

457
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:33,087
Actually we've got one report was checking out in the news that the industrial internet-of-things

458
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:33,855
Consortium

459
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,391
Has put out April

460
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,415
Vocabulary

461
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:39,231
For the industrial internet-of-things

462
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:42,303
Can I can I just

463
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:45,887
Reading that is like a dictionary and then that's the ultimate

464
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,423
Boring example

465
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:49,471
Yes

466
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:53,311
Yes that's true we we miss our great Segway

467
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,591
Sorry

468
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:55,359
Nope

469
00:18:56,383 --> 00:19:00,735
So basically what this is is they've added 16 new words so

470
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:03,295
You know what we're talking about when we have the inner

471
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:05,599
We're talking about the industrial internet-of-things

472
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,135
This isn't

473
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,159
Bad idea

474
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:12,767
Because even just two weeks ago I wrote a story where is it I don't even know what the edge of the network

475
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:15,071
Cuz everyone's come throws these terms around in you

476
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,095
What is

477
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:17,119
So now

478
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:21,215
They actually have a definition not of the edge but they do have the edge Gateway in here

479
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:25,311
I'm still out of luck at my definition for the edge but that's okay

480
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:27,359
So they've defined things

481
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:32,223
Using their own standards but also ISO standards for people who are going to have to be

482
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,759
Compliant which is a big deal for me

483
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:34,527
Manufacturing

484
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,599
If it turns a definer is mundane as

485
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:38,879
Mosquito cryptography

486
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,159
Data-at-rest

487
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:42,207
Who is esoteric as

488
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,487
A cross-cutting

489
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:45,535
Concern or a cross-cutting function

490
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:48,607
By the way those are things that affect the whole system

491
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:49,887
It may impact

492
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:52,191
Multiple viewpoints of the architecture

493
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:59,359
Cross-cutting function is a function that may be applied and realize across multiple functional domains

494
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:02,943
Describe the architecture to address

495
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:03,711
Cross-cutting

496
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:04,479
Concerns

497
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:06,527
So you can see this is riveting stuff

498
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:08,831
But if you're in the industrial internet-of-things

499
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,111
You may want to check it out

500
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,647
Also in the white paper

501
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:12,671
World

502
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:14,207
We actually have a really cool paper

503
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:18,303
We won't dig into it but we going to link to it and I'll probably do it my newsletter as well be

504
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,095
That rich

505
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,119
And inciting

506
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,935
Arm has put out a paper a white paper on

507
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:27,775
The internet of things and the economics of a trillion connected devices

508
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:29,567
Because when arm was bought by soft

509
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,359
DC or something

510
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:32,639
Came out to there

511
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:34,687
Add event last year and was like

512
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:36,223
You know how people are like

513
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:38,783
20 billion connected devices

514
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,087
Inside

515
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:43,135
It was actually really great

516
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:47,487
Talk in this paper basically backs that up and then gets lots of data on

517
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:50,815
What that's going to cost but it's going to need to tail

518
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:52,607
In my favorite chart

519
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,143
Is

520
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:56,959
A chart that basically gives you the cost

521
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:58,239
There it just made it cost

522
00:20:58,495 --> 00:20:59,775
A different iot

523
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:00,799
Modules

524
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:03,615
Was that your favorite chart

525
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:06,687
I like that chart I think

526
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:07,455
There

527
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:14,111
I'm a little more optimistic the prices will come down faster than what they say but they do take something in consideration that you pointed out to me

528
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:18,464
And that is the power for these modules such as using solar cells to power a lot of them

529
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:21,024
And that'll increase cost so

530
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,304
I see where they're coming from

531
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,632
I like to have a broken down by industry to on

532
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:27,680
How much each industry will

533
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:28,960
Benefit financially

534
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:31,776
Switching over to iot tech devices

535
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:32,544
Yes

536
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,312
So

537
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:35,616
I think everyone should actually check this out

538
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:36,896
Because

539
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:38,432
You're going to feel smarter after

540
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:39,456
I promise you

541
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:41,504
And you're going to be smarter with actual data

542
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,272
Which is the best

543
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:45,088
Okay

544
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,880
We each have two things

545
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:47,904
To talk about

546
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:52,256
Kevin's got a book recommendation and then I was going to tell you about my life with the Amazon

547
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:53,280
His theme

548
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:55,072
With a wand

549
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,864
The echo Dot

550
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:59,168
The echo wand

551
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,192
I thought this

552
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:04,032
A while back but we haven't talked about it

553
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:05,312
Basically this is a

554
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,872
This is my gateway to Amazon shopping

555
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:10,176
In the market and I bought it because of that

556
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:11,200
Whole Foods deal

557
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:14,528
You can only buy things

558
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:16,064
It's like a track sure

559
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:17,344
Your quest

560
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,392
Here at the shopping list you can talk to it and

561
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:20,416
Scan things

562
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:21,440
So

563
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:23,488
But it only buys things on Amazon

564
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:24,768
Put it on your Amazon list

565
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:25,536
Switch

566
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:26,816
How convenient

567
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:29,376
Yeah I guess you know Amazon's not that great

568
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:30,912
Does not

569
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:31,680
Grocery shopping

570
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:33,472
So I don't actually use it

571
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:38,592
Except I do scan these three things I buy an Amazon all the time I will use the one to

572
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:39,872
Escaneador

573
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:41,408
But

574
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,432
It also has

575
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:46,272
So what is actually kind of fun for is

576
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,552
You have to hold down the button

577
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:48,320
Can I talk to it

578
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:49,344
But

579
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:55,744
I gave it to my mom when she was staying over and it became like this little remote control cuz there's no. In the

580
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,024
Bedroom or an echo in the bedroom

581
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,304
Does she got to like

582
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,328
Control things like

583
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,352
Hey

584
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:02,144
If it's too cold for you at night

585
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,704
Press this button and say Madam a

586
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:07,520
Turn the ecobee to blah blah blah

587
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:11,360
So that was kind of nice cuz it was twenty bucks and was actually free

588
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:13,408
Because I got into $20 Amazon credit

589
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:15,456
So basically I got like a little remote

590
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,224
Controls for my echo

591
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:23,136
Yeah I actually never thought of it like that. I did not buy one because I'm Mighty now that I have Dash buttons for certain things I've heard

592
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:24,928
Amazon grocery wise

593
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:29,024
Didn't see the need for one that you're right I mean you can walk around the whole house

594
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:31,328
It's like carrying an echo in your pocket

595
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,352
So

596
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:35,168
It's not design

597
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:36,192
If you're carrying a

598
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:36,960
IPhone

599
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:40,800
Brighten also have that yeah

600
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:42,080
I found it useful for that

601
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:44,384
And I saw actually somebody

602
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,944
Link to it someone put an echo dot in there

603
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:47,712
Your car

604
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:51,040
Wichita that I wanted to do so I was like hell

605
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:52,064
Can I bring this into my

606
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,088
Far

607
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,880
But I don't have an always-on Wi-Fi

608
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,440
But I am constantly in my

609
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,464
My car and I want to ask

610
00:23:59,232 --> 00:23:59,744
Questions

611
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:01,536
So that was

612
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,864
What was certain smartphones you can do that now

613
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:07,680
That is true or I could just ask Google who's actually smart

614
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:08,960
Questions I usually come up

615
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:12,800
Do squirrels have opposing

616
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:13,568
Thumbs

617
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,360
They do not

618
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:17,664
Titans

619
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,432
Good to know

620
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,968
Will there be a child

621
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:23,552
This is this is what happens when you're at a red light and you're watching a squirrel like I was

622
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,600
Doing origami

623
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:27,392
Somebody's been driving too much

624
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:30,464
Yeah yeah that's not drinking just right

625
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:32,512
So that's

626
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:34,304
Kevin Kevin maybe house

627
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:38,656
Well since we gave people some

628
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:40,192
Good reading song

629
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:45,568
I still think boring reading here some exciting reading and I didn't realize you would already read this

630
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:48,128
I'm not ready for the show but I read a book

631
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:50,176
By Matthew Mather

632
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,456
Called darknet

633
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:54,016
Activate mobile me

634
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:57,088
Well in bookstores obviously and I read it on my Kindle on tickets

635
00:24:57,344 --> 00:25:00,672
Part of Kindle unlimited so if you already parking on unlimited you can read it

636
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:01,952
Free or

637
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:06,816
Prescription if not the Kindle prices $5.99

638
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:07,840
It's so hard

639
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:10,656
Talk about this book without giving too much away

640
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:11,424
But

641
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:16,544
I why am recommending it is because we've always talked about all these sensors around the world and

642
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:19,104
Only can have more than one trillion size arm

643
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,688
Nai and autonomous this and that

644
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:26,016
And privacy concerns and spoofing

645
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:26,784
Yes

646
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,088
So I'm not going to say anymore but

647
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:31,392
It's all that and a bag of chips

648
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,160
So

649
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:36,256
Wrapped in a story

650
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:37,536
Maybe years ago

651
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:40,096
Think about it

652
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:47,520
Yeah because it's one of those sci-fi books that way after you read it especially because it's now to wish years old

653
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:48,544
Any industry

654
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,336
Ramps up so fast that you're like

655
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,152
2 years ago this was science

656
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:55,456
Fiction now it's not even so much

657
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,480
Fiction

658
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:58,784
I want to see anymore

659
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,552
Yes

660
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,344
I will say that

661
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,880
Will be reading future

662
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:06,464
Underground bunkers with absolutely no connectivity

663
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:10,048
Etiwanda

664
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,632
That's not coming

665
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:14,656
All right

666
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,960
That's a good stopping

667
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:18,240
For this week

668
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:20,800
Next up we are going to have a word for

669
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:22,848
And after that

670
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,128
We are going to

671
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:25,152
To hear from Alex

672
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:27,200
Scrum who is in charge of

673
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:27,968
Comcast

674
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:29,248
Machineq Network

675
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:32,064
And this is not just Comcast

676
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,088
Life

677
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:35,904
In X with machine Cube It's all about Laura

678
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,696
Low power

679
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:39,232
Wide area network

680
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:41,024
Technology and how

681
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,840
You can use that you're gonna learn a lot about power constraints bandwidth

682
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:44,608
Security

683
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,168
Is chock-full of awesome stuff in a lot of

684
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:48,960
It's really useful for asset tracking

685
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:52,032
Stay tuned for that

686
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:55,872
And now a word from our sponsor

687
00:26:56,128 --> 00:27:02,272
Everyone we are breaking into the Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor this week sponsor is Al

688
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,552
Legion which makes

689
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:05,088
Schlage Locks

690
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,368
I've got robbed

691
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,416
Set futuristics Lake here to talk to us

692
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:09,952
Yesterday hi Rob how are you doing

693
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:12,000
I'm great Stacy how are you

694
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,024
Excellent

695
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:15,072
So what are some considerations

696
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,864
In choosing a Smart Lock

697
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:19,168
Stacy I have some thoughts

698
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:20,960
Surround electronic lock

699
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:23,776
Consideration or selection for your viewers

700
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:27,872
Basics candy Left Behind when you're thinking about technology first

701
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,432
So one of the things we recommend is

702
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:34,272
Make sure first and foremost that you get a good grated lock

703
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:37,344
So Beacham a grading is important

704
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:39,904
But also things like understanding

705
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:40,672
Hey

706
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:42,464
Can I replace the deadbolt

707
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:45,024
Or do I need to go with a retrofit

708
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:45,792
Solution

709
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:48,608
Now the benefits of replacing your deadbolt parts

710
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:49,376
Control

711
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:51,168
If you replace the deadbolt

712
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:54,752
You're guaranteed that all the keys that you may have delivered

713
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:55,520
Neighbors

714
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:56,288
Friends

715
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,312
Whoever

716
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,336
Overtime

717
00:27:58,848 --> 00:27:59,616
Are not going to work

718
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:00,384
And that deadbolt

719
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:03,712
So when you replace the deadbolt you have the benefit of key

720
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:04,480
Control

721
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:07,040
Other things to consider when you buy

722
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:10,368
An electronic deadbolt touchscreen deadbolt solution

723
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:12,416
Does it have a tapered deadbolt

724
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:15,232
If you don't replace the original deadbolt

725
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:18,048
You're going to have a traditional deadbolt that's not tape

726
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,072
Rob

727
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:20,352
What is a tapered deadbolt

728
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:25,728
A tapered deadbolt is exactly that it's a deadbolt that's slightly tapered

729
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:26,752
On each end

730
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:29,056
This is important for door alignment

731
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:32,128
Door alignment is important because

732
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:34,176
With heat your door expand

733
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:36,736
With called your dorm a shrink

734
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:40,320
And if that deadbolt isn't aligned properly

735
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:41,856
It will never

736
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:42,880
Close fully

737
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:43,904
Secondly

738
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:46,208
The other thing associated with that is

739
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:46,976
Motors

740
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:50,048
It's important have a strong motor on your touch

741
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:51,072
Screen deadbolt

742
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:52,608
So that has enough strength

743
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:54,400
Where is that taper deadbolt

744
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:55,168
Couches

745
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:57,728
Pull the door closed

746
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,776
Any other considerations

747
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:02,080
So Stacy one of the things

748
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:05,152
That we focus on is ease of installation

749
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:06,432
We like to think

750
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:07,456
That you can

751
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:11,296
Install one of our touchscreen deadbolt in less than 10 minutes

752
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:13,600
With just a Phillips head screwdriver

753
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:14,368
Another thing

754
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:20,768
Consider is battery life we don't believe in using proprietary batteries we think they should be conveniently available

755
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:22,816
We also

756
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:24,864
Specify are touchscreen deadbolt

757
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,144
What's the last at least

758
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:27,168
12 month

759
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:28,704
Width for double a batteries

760
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:30,240
And that doesn't mean

761
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:31,008
That is just

762
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:31,776
On

763
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:37,152
Day in and day out that means testing it with a minimum of 10 usages a day

764
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:37,920
Fourier

765
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:38,944
Hot diggity

766
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:39,968
That's pretty awesome

767
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,016
So where can I go to find out more

768
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,808

772
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:05,056
Hey we would welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest is

773
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:06,848
Alex Karim who is

774
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:09,408
General manager at machineq

775
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:10,688
Which is Comcast

776
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:12,480
Lorawan Network effort

777
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:14,272
Alex how are you doing today

778
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:15,552
I'm doing great thanks Stacy

779
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:18,112
I am excited to have you on the show

780
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:20,160
About a year ago Comcast

781
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:22,720
Excited about law

782
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,768
And I was like who

783
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:31,168
This could be fine and we didn't hear much from you until a couple weeks ago when you guys run doubt to total of 15 markets

784
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,960
Adam-12 markets

785
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:38,848
And here you are today to talk not just about Comcast's efforts but also what people should think of

786
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:39,872
When they think of Laura

787
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,664
Tall order can you handle it

788
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,432
Yes

789
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,712
And thank you for having

790
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:44,736
Guess

791
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:46,784
Alright let's get started with

792
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,552
Why

793
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:48,320
Laura

794
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:49,344
Laura win

795
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,112
For Comcast

796
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:51,392
How did this all come about

797
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:56,000
About two years ago we started looking at low-power wide area Networks

798
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:57,792
There's an opportunity for Comcast

799
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:59,328
To provide a whole

800
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,864
New set of services

801
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:01,632
To its client

802
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:03,168
Primarily business clients

803
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:08,032
Conversations business and Bose technical

804
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:10,336
Looking at the competing on license

805
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:11,872
Opportunities out there

806
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:15,456
As you know probably that recently we actually acquired Spectrum as well

807
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:19,040
But at that point we are focused primarily on license opportunities

808
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:20,064
And so

809
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,112
Begin a pretty intensive

810
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:23,904
R&D research effort

811
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,184
Travel the globe

812
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,256
Supposed to different carriers both Wireline and Wireless

813
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:31,072
Understand how they were thinking about iot in the future

814
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:34,912
And after having their own field trials here in Philadelphia and having looked at

815
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:39,008
Are the dishes opportunities visibility the unlicensed Technologies

816
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,312
Became pretty obvious to us when you had

817
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,080
Interrupting

818
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:43,872
Thirtysomething or Plus

819
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:46,944
Types of carriers mobile carriers in NY line carriers

820
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:50,016
Adopted lorwyn standard that the ecosystem was

821
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:51,552
Going to be critical going for

822
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:52,832
And Laura Wang

823
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:54,112
Heather ecosystem

824
00:31:54,368 --> 00:32:00,512
In addition to Hardware companies I Cisco who are who are supported Etc thrust feeling of Laurel and all fertile

825
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:02,304
The best long-term strategy

826
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:04,096
Future-proof having

827
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:06,144
And iot Enterprise iot

828
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:07,936
Got it now

829
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:08,960
Let's talk about

830
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:10,496
Laura as a standard

831
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:13,568
Because there's a lot going on there and it's not like everybody

832
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:15,616
What Laura in

833
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:17,664
As you mentioned it's unlicensed

834
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:20,736
Work

835
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:23,552
Let's talk about bandwidth rates and all of that kind

836
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:25,088
Power consumption

837
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:29,184
Sure seal or Bay City is a physical communication protocol that

838
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,464
Have traction

839
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,768
Primarily is New Beginning days is a camp

840
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:33,536
Campus

841
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:34,816
Regional opportunity

842
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:38,144
But you were able to set up a Gateway and start managing

843
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,192
Tickler device using the Laura

844
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:43,008
Protocol he did such a great job of

845
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:49,664
Doing that and I'm providing the right propagation and because of you it's very low-power depending on certain what they require

846
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,944
Apartments off of the device

847
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:51,968
Allura

848
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:54,784
Battery powered device can remain out in the field for about a decade

849
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:55,808
That

850
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:58,112
Carriage got together and started thinking through

851
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:04,512
Can we create a mock layer basically a way for this to move out of the campus of Art and more into true

852
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:05,792
Why the area of arm

853
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:07,072
Weekend blanket

854
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:09,120
Cities Region's countries

855
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:11,168
With this applicant with his protocol

856
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,472
Okay so. Laura

857
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:15,776
In one of the band width what are the up and downs

858
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:16,544
Flora and

859
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,616
Downelink

860
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,920
It's probably about you 20 kilobits to seconds

861
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:24,224
These were saying in the field

862
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,016
I think we're talking about

863
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:27,552
The 5 to 10 kilobits

864
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:30,112
Most of the Transmissions we see

865
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:36,512
Domestic limited I think it differs by market depending on need of what the unlicensed regime You Are by 9:15

866
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:38,304
Hiossen Bandit States

867
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,376
But I'd say like if you're looking to build an application devices

868
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:43,424
Sub 5 kilobits per second

869
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,984
Then this is the ideal protocol for you

870
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:49,312
And there is no Universal

871
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:50,592
Laura Spectrum

872
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:54,176
SWAT so if you're going to build a Lora based products

873
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:56,224
You're going to have to build different radios for

874
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,248
Each different country

875
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:59,552
Right I think there's definitely

876
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:04,672
Some countries have very similar artists in South Korea share the same band that were using on

877
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:06,720
And so today is your sort of decision to

878
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:08,256
Manufacturer product for booth

879
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:09,280
Certain markets

880
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:13,376
Europeans have a different subsets of Standards but that's correct that you have to do some

881
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:14,144
Testing

882
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:18,752
You have to get certifications in in these sort of domestic country to before you can launch that

883
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,800
Going Global is always hard

884
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:22,080
Alright so

885
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:23,616
Let's talk about the challenges

886
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:25,920
Because you you correct me earlier and I appreciate

887
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,968
I'm thinking Laura

888
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,248
Laura is Laura

889
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:32,320
And this is

890
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:33,856
The radio protocol Plus

891
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:34,880
Next level

892
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:37,952
Standardization turn Zalora Network

893
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:39,744
Work into something broader so

894
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,536
What is that architecture

895
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:42,560
Look like broccoli

896
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:44,352
What devices have what cave

897
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:46,912
Sure so

898
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,960
After tracking

899
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,032
It's easy to go put Alora wanker

900
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:52,800
Client

901
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:55,360
Module into a an asset tracker

902
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:59,200
It requires a lot less battery power than traditional cellular Technologies

903
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:00,992
They can remain in the field for years

904
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:02,784
The reason why again it's

905
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,832
We've mentioned or versus or when

906
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:06,112
Laura Wynn

907
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:06,880
It can work

908
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:13,280
Across different country so orange is an example just publicly announced that they're working on Laurel and roaming in Europe for

909
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:17,376
For next year so I think that's where things are going as I said it should have started out as this

910
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:18,400
Greycampus

911
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:22,240
Tool but it became a domestic cool now it's becoming international roaming tool

912
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,776
Why were all on

913
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:26,848
Different sort of as you mention standards in terms of the band

914
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:27,872
That is

915
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:34,272
There's ways of making sure that we can serve Rome among each other but the vast majority of devices that were focused on it

916
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:38,112
I think the other carriage for the Doppler Wendy's are things that really happen

917
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:41,184
Connected to the cloud they want to connect it wannabe

918
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:47,584
Providing information quite frankly to visit businesses to improve operations and improve Services everything from

919
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,352
Pallets

920
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,376
Two containers

921
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:52,960
And we just had a hackathon in Philadelphia recently actually

922
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:56,800
And some of the winners had some amazing things that they came up with

923
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:57,568
Number one

924
00:35:57,824 --> 00:36:02,944
It's a device that basically just monitors temperature in the real use case was for elderly people

925
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,480
Monkey living by themselves

926
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:05,760
To make sure that

927
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:07,808
You can go put this in parts of their homes

928
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:10,112
They might have another connected device in the house

929
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:16,768
They might not want to pair something with their smartphone but it would be able to alert anyone that needed to be alerted it is certain

930
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:18,304
Temperature threshold is met

931
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:20,352
That there's a danger here for that person

932
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:23,168
And that you can do with Laurel and it sort of set in Africa

933
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:26,752
Hackathon winners Nikes you know would love to commercialize and ghosts

934
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:28,032
Citgo pry this to

935
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:34,432
Folks and you can go put it into let's say one of our markets over building in it would automatically sort of authenticate over-the-air and it be nice

936
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:37,248
Easy sort of on-ramp and you would solve that problem for

937
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:43,648
That's subset of the market is someone of the second prize winners was a tool that would go into it was a kraut source

938
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:44,672
Pothole tool

939
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:48,512
The application was to go and put a little sensor on this

940
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:49,280
Extensions

941
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:51,072
As Municipal vehicles

942
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:57,472
They put on the fire truck in front of police vehicle in a particular area and it goes down a certain number of degrees it would

943
00:36:57,728 --> 00:37:00,032
Identify where the wheel would go down

944
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:06,432
And actually have a GPS coordinates recorded events ended up and eventually you have enough of this data to predict until the city officials

945
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:10,528
It's probably a bunch of potholes developing here you probably should go check this out

946
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:12,832
But those are things quite frankly that before

947
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:16,672
Be difficult to sort of the field

948
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:18,720
I think like right around 5 to $10

949
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:21,536
So these modules

950
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:24,352
The gateways as opposed to going straight up to the end

951
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:25,376
That's correct

952
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:29,216
So how many lorawan Network

953
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:31,264
How many gateways do I need

954
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,312
Cover a square mile

955
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:37,664
Depends on sword of the use case if you if you're looking to cover a square mile for

956
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:44,064
An outdoor only use case and there's no sort of high buildings for Square mall you can if you have a high enough power

957
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:44,832
In this case

958
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:47,392
Anybody put two or three gateways new cover that

959
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:48,928
But the reality is is that

960
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:50,720
I mean I think you know

961
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:55,328
But each one of these devices has its own sort of particular use case so if you're looking to Culver City

962
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,352
But

963
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,912
Your application requires getting into a

964
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:00,192
Parking garage

965
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:00,960
Two floors down

966
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:03,264
Different types of Gateway Tennessee show me there

967
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:05,568
And I'm trying to remember

968
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:06,592
900

969
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:07,360
900

970
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:08,384
10 megahertz

971
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,408
How does that travel

972
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:11,968
Walter Wallace this is something that's going to work indoors

973
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,040
Yes I think it propagations excellent soil

974
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:21,696
Clearly that one of the reasons why laurel-ann Works in many ways for most of these iety industrial applications because of

975
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:22,976
It can penetrate

976
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:29,376
A lot better than other bands this person is always been there for vism industrial science and medical devices

977
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:32,960
So what does propagate very well but it going to goes back to

978
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:38,080
Making sure you still have the right Gateway density in the right locations which goes back to one of the reasons why I think

979
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:42,432
We were able to successfully work with within Comcast cable to make sure that

980
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:47,808
You look at the long-term vision of how lower way I could be the toilets multi-user of nodal

981
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:52,416
And it's just in the way of looking at building a network it's not I'm just going to go build a mackerel layer

982
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:53,696
Towers

983
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:58,304
But you can look at potentially putting it on strands of your looks a data cable operator

984
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,400
You can put them in homes or other locations if you want to put into CPE

985
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:05,216
And this is not unlike what the Europeans I couldn't have been

986
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:08,032
You're looking at for about a year or so that

987
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:14,432
Real use public examples of what they've done but I think an orange has been a leader in the space for quite a while.

988
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:16,736
Build a macro based

989
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:19,296
Cell tower filled out in France

990
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,320
With lorawan

991
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:26,720
And then they were experimenting with putting in home devices like a lorawan lamp for some employees

992
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:28,768
It's a Gateway effectively

993
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:29,536
Okay

994
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:31,328
Identification in Paris

995
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:34,912
All right to Comcast having all of this

996
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:41,312
Consumer promise equipment so basically it's any gear that you get from Comcast could we possibly one day see you guys

997
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:42,080
Okay

998
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:47,456
Let's make this more dense let's put this in homes because it makes sense for like smoke detectors or other crazy ideas

999
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:52,064
Restless Papo Gateway into our routers are

1000
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,344
Set up exercise

1001
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,160
That's exactly right I think all those options on the table

1002
00:39:56,672 --> 00:40:01,792
And I think if you look at sort of what other folks are looking to deploy globally and get ourselves that

1003
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:08,192
I think naturally that the more more applications in the more B2B to see the more consumer applications be fine for I

1004
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:12,544
30th and cook good more likely to start saying companies like ourselves considered adoption

1005
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:14,080
All right now

1006
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:15,360
If I have a business

1007
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:19,200
Sitting here and like I don't really care

1008
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:20,224
In Great Neck

1009
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,784
Work staff who should care about

1010
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:24,576
You've got this

1011
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:28,928
Siri you can send small amounts of data pretty far distances really cheaply

1012
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:29,696
Play so

1013
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:31,488
What kind of use cases can we see

1014
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:33,792
Loose cases Racine

1015
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:34,816
Stan

1016
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:36,352
Ferreus Industries

1017
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:38,912
So if you look at the most natural ones

1018
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:41,472
Asset heavy Industries which have

1019
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:48,128
High-value devices are assets in the field and needed pracna crucially couldn't track them because they lack the power

1020
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:49,664
That's a no-brainer

1021
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,432
We've seen that

1022
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:54,272
I think you look at heavy machinery II metering

1023
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:56,064
Do you want to know where something is

1024
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,344
Geo-fence something

1025
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,904
Vegetable with a cost of the modules coming

1026
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,208
Further down leaving sub $5 and in

1027
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:03,744
Put it in the near future

1028
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:07,072
Now using the return on investment should I spend you know

1029
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:09,888
10 $15 put a tracker on this device

1030
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,448
And pay Comcast

1031
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:14,752
We're just in this case our partner will pay us

1032
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:15,520
Disconnect

1033
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:18,080
That device for them and feel for your so

1034
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:22,432
To make sure that I know where all this devices are they leave this particular area I should know

1035
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,784
Do you have that sort of that side of the equation the other side there's people who are looking

1036
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,832
Revolutionize everything from

1037
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:33,184
Parts of the pharmaceutical industry or mention adherents

1038
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,464
I'll put it out there

1039
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,744
Dispenser to this

1040
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,864
Dream to be able to have a connected Hilltop it didn't require constant battery patio

1041
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:41,632
Replenishing

1042
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:43,680
How does the device like this

1043
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:45,728
Help solve problems ie

1044
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:48,544
How many times has this person has a station opened up

1045
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,568
That device

1046
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:51,616
License office

1047
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:52,895
2

1048
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:56,223
Even advertising we've seen other interesting spaces were

1049
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:58,527
I can't get into specifics but more or less

1050
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:01,855
I think about the prettiest trees and being able to track

1051
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:03,135
What people are doing

1052
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:05,183
On catalogs

1053
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:07,487
Wait people still get catalogs

1054
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:10,559
Play get on the questions do they open or not

1055
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:11,839
Okay

1056
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:13,375
That feels kind of like spine

1057
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:18,495
You send me mail and suddenly I've got this like sensor on it that's a poop

1058
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:26,431
These are the examples of people are coming up with them out there in the field

1059
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:27,455
But you ask

1060
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:30,271
What are use cases in my point is everything from

1061
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:32,319
Yo heavy Industrial

1062
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:35,135
Pharma the advertising the pest control

1063
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:37,183
Ozium

1064
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:37,951
Smart now

1065
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:45,119
That's awesome

1066
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:47,167
Exactly so

1067
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:51,263
That's been through my conversation to given day of the week she's been all those people

1068
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:52,287
Flooring

1069
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:53,567
And those opportunities

1070
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:56,127
Understanding what the technology is capable of doing

1071
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:58,175
It is wonderful seeing

1072
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:01,503
Their brains race to think about how this can help their business

1073
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:04,575
All right now I'm going to go into some of the things that

1074
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:05,343
Concern me

1075
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:08,671
Because it's always fun to talk about the trade-offs and every technology

1076
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:09,439
Does happen

1077
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:10,719
So

1078
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:13,279
The Gatorades here

1079
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:14,815
It worries me because

1080
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:17,119
It's a very small amount

1081
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:18,143
A data and

1082
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:23,007
Security being what it is I feel like things are going to need more over the air updates in the

1083
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:24,287
Future not fewer

1084
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:27,871
Sub-5 kilobits

1085
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:28,895
Per second

1086
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:29,919
Is that enough

1087
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:30,943
To keep things updated

1088
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:32,223
Transmit neusoft

1089
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:33,759
Yes we went

1090
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:37,599
Through this analysis we definitely thought about Serta firm over there updates is being

1091
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:40,159
Critical analysis especially when these devices

1092
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:43,487
Requirements of being out in the field for many many years

1093
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:47,839
And as I said before it right now but the average type of

1094
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:49,119
Interactional

1095
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:53,727
Floral and device I've seen anyway it's looking for Farmer 5 kilobits but in terms of downlink

1096
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:56,287
You can go to 25 kilobits per second

1097
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:57,311
They'll get it

1098
00:43:57,567 --> 00:44:00,383
Still nowhere near what you expect from trishul cellular Technologies

1099
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:01,663
Requirements

1100
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:02,687
But

1101
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:04,991
That's part of the value of working

1102
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:08,063
Comcast and other folks in the others a huge ecosystem

1103
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:11,391
All the partners in the in the Laurel and Alliance

1104
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:15,231
Is working on firmware over-the-air serve best practice standards

1105
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:16,255
So

1106
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:17,279
We can do things

1107
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:18,303
Hush

1108
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:21,887
Silent the rest of the Network's we can sort of make sure that this client

1109
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:25,471
10000 devices are going to be updated over an ex

1110
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:26,239
Happy Days

1111
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:27,519
For this upgrade

1112
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:33,151
An actual. Talk about scale how many devices can you put on a Gateway or

1113
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:34,431
How big can is net worth

1114
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:35,199
Work schedule

1115
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:37,503
Get it comes down to being serve application

1116
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:41,087
Specifically our trials we put things on tracking that immitracker needs

1117
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:45,183
To talk every couple seconds versus be put of the lights out there we need to talk every year

1118
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:46,975
Putting General work Hawking

1119
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:51,327
Tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of devices potentially forget what

1120
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:52,351
That feels

1121
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:53,119
Doable

1122
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:54,143
All right

1123
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:55,167
Now Comcast

1124
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:57,983
You guys have embarked upon Wireless

1125
00:44:58,751 --> 00:44:59,263
And

1126
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:00,031
Then you guys were

1127
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:06,943
Why create your own iot

1128
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:08,223
Wireless net

1129
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:10,015
I think

1130
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:11,039
The reason why we're

1131
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:13,087
Pitabilities networks and to get in

1132
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:15,391
This is because there's no other Alternatives today

1133
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:17,183
That we're not looking too

1134
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:18,719
Sorted offer

1135
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:21,279
This is not a cytotechnologist

1136
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:24,863
Right there's a lot of business has a lot of

1137
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:26,399
Opportunities for

1138
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:28,447
Provide some real value here

1139
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:32,031
For Industries which until another alternative comes up

1140
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:33,055
That we

1141
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:35,359
Put it upon ourselves looking at was out there

1142
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:38,943
We have a network we have the assets we have the relationships

1143
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:43,295
We provide a service which is valuable not only to businesses but also you communities

1144
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:46,111
Geauga CCR Smart City vertical being pretty important

1145
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:47,391
And we've been in these

1146
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:49,951
Calories for 50 plus years of time

1147
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:54,559
As you start hearing about Urban landscape Suburban rural needs

1148
00:45:55,071 --> 00:46:01,215
It became obvious that seeing other carriers globally what they're doing and why they're doing it that it made sense for us considering the

1149
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:03,007
Mixture of assets available to us

1150
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:05,567
And how is Comcast

1151
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:07,103
Going to sell this so

1152
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:08,383
In this case

1153
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:11,455
Your building these networks in the 15 cities

1154
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:12,991
Partybell temp

1155
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:14,783
You're going to sell these two

1156
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:16,575
And users or

1157
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:19,391
Systems integrators or the cities themselves how does a

1158
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:21,695
Key question I think that

1159
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:22,463
Having

1160
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:23,743
Barton

1161
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:26,303
Being a public trial 6 months ago in October

1162
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:28,095
Become obvious that are our first

1163
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:32,447
Sweet spot is working with partners partners being those who are manufacturing device

1164
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:33,983
They have

1165
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:35,007
The expertise

1166
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:36,799
Understand the technology

1167
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:38,335
Coming to us

1168
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:39,871
Looking to

1169
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:41,919
Connect other devices to us

1170
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:43,711
Avenues partners

1171
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:47,807
Have verticals and channel expertise industry expertise

1172
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:52,159
Busy themselves with once they've connected to us they're going to bomb a bath together

1173
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:54,975
And going to work with their channels to sell so

1174
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:57,279
Yes indeed a we are in the Smart City

1175
00:46:57,535 --> 00:46:58,047
Space

1176
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:01,887
But right now we don't see ourselves as going in

1177
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:04,191
Raising her hand becoming a prime

1178
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:05,471
Contractors

1179
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:07,519
Do any Municipal requests comes in

1180
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:08,799
However our partners are

1181
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:10,591
And

1182
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:13,919
You also are looking for partners among startups in other develop

1183
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:16,223
That's right so I think it's

1184
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:21,087
It one of the fascinating things is we're dealing with Fortune 500 companies and also startups

1185
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:23,391
So on both sides of the spectrum

1186
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:27,999
You see a lot of big corporations doing pilots and proof of Concepts and their

1187
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:29,279
We're working on them

1188
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:32,351
And proving out that this particular need they have

1189
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:35,167
The technology is exactly what fits for their needs

1190
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:36,959
Economics work for them

1191
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:41,311
And they have no natural teams thinking about how to Andino add sensors if you will

1192
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:43,359
2 horse float existing businesses

1193
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:44,383
But they have

1194
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:45,151
And

1195
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:47,199
That levels of excavate

1196
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:51,551
Some of them have that deep level of expertise and I have all the skill sets and how some of them don't

1197
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:54,623
Torquing them on the other side of the spectrum

1198
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:56,927
Plus startup sir also engaging

1199
00:47:57,439 --> 00:48:01,023
I have been using that quite frankly other types of Wireless protocols

1200
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:04,863
Heather now looking dust insecticide might have used you know XYZ before

1201
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:09,215
I was only a wifi-only device or I was a Bluetooth only device

1202
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:15,615
Right here that you were offering lorwyn in my market are you and your spending this I like to work with you on how I can help my device

1203
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:17,151
Right onto them to network

1204
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:18,687
Still working in Spanish

00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:25,855
Got it okay well Alex thanks so much for coming on and sharing all this great information about Laurel or away
