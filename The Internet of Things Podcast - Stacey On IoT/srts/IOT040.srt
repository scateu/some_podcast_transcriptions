1
00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:12,800
Hey everyone it is the Internet of Things show and I am your host

2
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:14,336
Stacey Higginbotham

3
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:15,872
This your co-host

4
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:17,152
Kevin tofel

5
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:17,920
It is

6
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:19,200
CES time

7
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:22,272
And while I and pounding the show floor here in Vegas

8
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:23,808
Are but Kevin is

9
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:26,880
At home for the first time in ten years during CES week

10
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:29,440
He has earned his break but he did confess

11
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,720
To be that he misses the

12
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:33,280
Hustle the bustle the fun of hanging out

13
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:34,560
Baidu

14
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:40,960
Why do we always have such a good time at CES last year we hung out and it was a fun time on the plus side you probably have better weather cuz it's like

15
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:47,360
11 freaking degrees where I am in Pennsylvania right now

16
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:51,456
So

17
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:54,272
I'm good I'm good

18
00:00:55,552 --> 00:01:00,416
I've technically because of the weird time constraints of podcast recording and editing process

19
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:03,232
You know we're going to do a little time travel to play a little

20
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:07,072
I have only seen

21
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:08,608
Like day one

22
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,632
Actually date

23
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:10,912
Day one and a half

24
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:12,704
But

25
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,240
I see the light I feel

26
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:15,008
I feel good

27
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:15,776
About what I said

28
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:18,080
So we're going to start off the show

29
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:22,432
With everybody's favorite platform the only true Internet of Things

30
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:24,992
Myvue which is

31
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:26,784
The Amazon Echo

32
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:29,088
She who shall not be named

33
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:30,624
Is playing a starring role

34
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:31,648
Addition show

35
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:32,928
Everyone

36
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,208
Is integrating

37
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,488
With chicken

38
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:36,768
So

39
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:37,536
The echo

40
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:38,560
Kevin what-have-you

41
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,400
Well I seen a bunch a lot of people are

42
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:48,800
Cortical planning to do Integrations it's going to take them some time but one of the biggest that I'm intrigued about

43
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:50,080
Is actually Ford

44
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:53,408
Ford is working on Amazon Echo integration

45
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,784
Which you like well why would they do that with their sync platform in the car what does that have to do with

46
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,832
That cylinder that sitting in my

47
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:01,856
In my house

48
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:04,160
It's kind of interesting it's a two-way

49
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,720
Connection and here's how it kind of works

50
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:10,048
You will be able to control your

51
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:16,448
Home Smart Home devices that you would normally with your Echo from your car so let's say your

52
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:18,752
5 miles from home and you're like oh you know what

53
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:23,872
It's getting dark out I don't want to come into a dark home I'm just going to tell my echo through the car

54
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:25,664
Turn on my lights

55
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,968
Obviously have had at 7 to dance but

56
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:31,552
It's kind of one of the core things that people do with Amazon Echo right now

57
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:37,184
So that's kind of cool you can modify your temperature and so on directly from the car through voice navigation

58
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,768
The only way around 2 if you're sitting around at home

59
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:45,632
And you like I wonder if I need gas in my Ford vehicle you can ask the echo

60
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:52,032
What's the range on my car right now and it will tell you how many miles you have to go before you run out of gas

61
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:58,432
If you got remote car starting in your car as well you can remotely start the car with your Echo it's a

62
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:02,784
Cool two-way sync to me it's not one that was obvious immediately to me

63
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,368
That sounds really cool so I actually tested something like this

64
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:07,648
4

65
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,952
Okay I'm just going to say it for my Tesla

66
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:14,560
It was a software program

67
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:17,120
It was a software program called

68
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:21,216
And it is Kali for Tesla

69
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:24,544
And it works through the website on the car

70
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,104
And it was an integration with the wink

71
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:27,872
Hub

72
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,152
And

73
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,200
Yeah okay there was

74
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,248
I thought it was actually pretty cool

75
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,272
Except

76
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:35,552
Because of the way the

77
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:36,832
Tesla update

78
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:39,392
It took forever to do anything with me

79
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,160
My smartphone

80
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,184
So

81
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,976
I'm actually kind of jealous

82
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:45,280
Because now I kind of want to have Tesla

83
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:46,560
Immigration

84
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,328
Quit Amazon

85
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,376
Do you hear that Eli please

86
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,936
Or I want these guys to make

87
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,472
Well if it's a Tesla issue

88
00:03:53,984 --> 00:04:00,128
I want this to be a lot faster because I actually found it super convenient when it worked on time because I would live

89
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:01,664
Literally just drive away

90
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,200
In my garage door

91
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,480
From the Chamberlain

92
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,528
We just closed

93
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:09,088
Because it was like Hey Stacy's cars driving off

94
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,672
I mean I know it's this is voice activated but I would totally talked

95
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:14,720
So

96
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,768
I love it and I love it that it's

97
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,047
804

98
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,327
That's awesome

99
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,607
Okay so you guys

100
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:21,887
If you have an echo

101
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:22,911
Totally

102
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:23,935
And

103
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:27,007
With a sinking car

104
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:33,407
Yep and I should mention that they have not provide a timeline for this Ford has not and only because you mentioned wink they said there are

105
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:35,967
Also working on a similar integration with wink

106
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,783
So even if you don't have an echo but you have a wink

107
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,319
You're going to be able to do some cool things

108
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:42,111
Oh my God if you have the wink

109
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,391
When they integrate this

110
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:44,671
Go out

111
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:45,951
Get the garage

112
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,255
Because not using

113
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,279
Using your voice

114
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,071
To control your garage door

115
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,095
Or just using

116
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:52,863
Cartoon

117
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:55,935
Control your garage door without like having to press buttons

118
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:58,751
I'll be honest

119
00:04:59,263 --> 00:04:59,775
Okay

120
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:01,055
So that's

121
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:01,823
1

122
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,127
Play Store

123
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,151
Again

124
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:07,199
Superstar

125
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,991
Total Superstar at CVS

126
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:12,319
There an alarm.com both announced

127
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,599
Alexa

128
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,671
DocuSign

129
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,231
Okay

130
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,511
Announce

131
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:21,535
Integrations

132
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,071
With she who shall not be named

133
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,375
Alarm.com

134
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:27,167
Did it through a skill

135
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,447
And so did

136
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,215
Didn't

137
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:31,519
It's worth pointing out you guys

138
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,055
We haven't talked about

139
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,079
Like skills

140
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:36,127
Skills yet for the show and we should

141
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,151
Because

142
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:39,455
Right now Amazon through it

143
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:42,015
You know straight up connected home

144
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:46,111
Paris in the settings where you go to discover new devices only really supports

145
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,647
Lights for the smart

146
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,695
So you can say things like

147
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:51,743
Switch on this turn on that

148
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:57,119
So what a lot of companies are doing to give you more kind of freedom to do cool things like

149
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,423
So it's so tell my house to go to sleep

150
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,959
They're using skills

151
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:04,543
It what you do to enable the skill is just going settings and

152
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,335
You go to skills in you

153
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,359
Enable

154
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,383
Like all kinds of stuff

155
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:15,039
And they have all kinds like when I told you guys about playing bingo that's a skill they have like a 7-minute workout you can able

156
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:16,575
Which I've done and it's

157
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:19,647
Kind of chill because she is not a great coach she's just like

158
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:21,183
Do jumping jacks

159
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:22,463
Jay

160
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:24,767
It's okay

161
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:29,119
So you can enable like the alarm.com you have a

162
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,679
A sentence that you say to enable it

163
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,727
And then boom. Action

164
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:36,031
And so through these things

165
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:39,103
People are actually enabling all these really in-depth

166
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,895
Kind of smart home

167
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,551
Challenges you have to have the code words remember exactly the thing to say

168
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,831
Which can be hard

169
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,111
Especially if you're going to bed

170
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,647
Or your garage in your waking up in the

171
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,183
But the benefit is

172
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:55,231
Like with Vivint you can actually

173
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,511
Close your locks

174
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:59,327
You can turn off your thermostat

175
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,351
You can

176
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,143
All kinds of fun stuff

177
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:05,215
With the alarm.com you can

178
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:08,799
Pretty much only control your I think it's your lights and

179
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:12,639
A couple other things cuz they were actually concerned about the security part

180
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,687
About the you control your locks

181
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,455
With your boys

182
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:17,247
I also heard

183
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,039
This is the gossip at CES

184
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:22,879
Amazon later this year is going to be coming out with some

185
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:25,183
Deeper cooler Smart Home

186
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,231
Kind of platform stuff

187
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,023
At the actual

188
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:29,791
Platform

189
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:32,095
Also not just letting you control your lights

190
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,375
What those will be

191
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:34,911
Percent sure yet

192
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:38,495
So if I'm understanding what skills are

193
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,263
Date

194
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:43,615
Can you cut your native features that Amazon is baking into the echo

195
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:46,175
That can work with other cloud services and such

196
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:51,551
But the skills seem to be third-party if Amazon is not doing it natively you can still add things and

197
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:56,159
Perfect one is AccuWeather has is a skill you know if you enable you can say

198
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,439
Echo

199
00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:01,023
Singer named Echo ask AccuWeather what time the Sun will rise and

200
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:04,095
Because of a table parse out there that phrase and

201
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:06,911
Use the AccuWeather skilled AccuWeather is created

202
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:08,703
And return the information so

203
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:09,983
You know it's interesting

204
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,799
That we're seeing so many Integrations here and I think it's

205
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,847
It speaks to what we were talking about before with us

206
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,895
It's just a wide open platform

207
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,943
That's the beauty of the echo

208
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,991
It is

209
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:24,575
You have the option of remembering your complicated phraseology

210
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,623
And in some of it

211
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,903
It's not really

212
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:30,463
Pacific specific

213
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,999
And the cool thing is

214
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,791
You have the option of enabling the

215
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,327
So

216
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,375
If you don't want me there is a farting

217
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:39,423
Scale so if you don't want the fighting skill

218
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:40,703
You will

219
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,751
Forever free

220
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:45,823
The word fart around she Who Shall Not Be Named without

221
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,103
Ever having

222
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,127
The dangerous

223
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,175
. wonderful farting sounds

224
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:54,271
I can't believe that's the top skill in my list right now

225
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:56,319
We did it

226
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:58,367
For a little bit

227
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,391
Didn't

228
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:06,559
It's actually not very good I've got to be honest we were not impressed with the first results

229
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:07,583
So you know

230
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,351
Just so you guys

231
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:13,727
I think they're advertising its it's

232
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,007
It starts with a number

233
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:15,775
Okay

234
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,359
Okay

235
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:22,687
So other things are getting Amazon Echo

236
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:24,223
Commands that we saw

237
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:27,551
I saw a radio this is actually it's called

238
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,319
Chubby

239
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,111
It's my company called in

240
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:30,879
Noxious

241
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,183
It is a

242
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,207
Kitchen radio

243
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:38,559
And you could actually be one of the first devices using

244
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,095
The A's

245
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,119
Voice

246
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,143
Services

247
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,447
So it's built in

248
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:46,239
To the device

249
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:49,311
That you can talk to it and it uses

250
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:51,103
The Voice Services platform

251
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:53,919
Music you can ask it to do anything

252
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:56,223
Anna talks to the Cloud Inn

253
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,247
That boys

254
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,039
So

255
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,063
It's very cool

256
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,343
It's designed to sit

257
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,367
On your kitchen

258
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,903
Bridge Inn

259
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,183
Just be like

260
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,207
The school radio

261
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:09,535
And I'm trying to remember when it goes on sale

262
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,327
Because that would be useful for you

263
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,119
It's triby by invoxia

264
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:15,423
This is what happens when you

265
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,959
Gradually are going senile

266
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:20,287
It's a connected speaker for the kitchen

267
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:24,383
Is $199 and it has little Message Board to

268
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,151
That you can write on

269
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,199
It comes in blue

270
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,479
Red and green

271
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:32,575
I wonder how many products this year will actually integrate the

272
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:34,111
Echo voice services

273
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,647
Because it's

274
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:41,279
Kind of like having Echoes all over the place it's at some point you noticed any gives you that whole consistent user experience

275
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:43,327
I can't wait for it to be in my back

276
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,375
Iwata vacuum cleaner that I can

277
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:47,935
Like vacuum

278
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,215
Really that's all I

279
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,031
I'm a simple woman

280
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:57,151
Okay so other the final integration that we talked about is

281
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:59,711
Wonderworld little unclear on what is intriguing

282
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:00,735
It is

283
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:04,319
Lumos still around this is

284
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:10,975
2009 it had it was one of Ashton Kutcher's First Tech Investments

285
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,023
I know it's a winner

286
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,047
I just

287
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:16,351
Menarche

288
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,655
So what is up

289
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,423
Avoid

290
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,215
Don't copy came out is like

291
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:22,751
Back in the early days of weight

292
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:24,543
Hey

293
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:27,871
Let's give it a hand for still being around

294
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,919
It's a phone and a little

295
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,455
It's basically a hub

296
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,735
And

297
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:34,015
You can program

298
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:36,575
People's phone numbers in and you can tell it

299
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:41,439
And now you can use the Echo and say hey,

300
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,719
It's another skill

301
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:44,767
Hey so-and-so

302
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,559
Ask

303
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:47,327
Better call Bob

304
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,095
And

305
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,119
Lo and behold

306
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:52,447
What year does it happen is the question

307
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:54,751
Yes we don't know if

308
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:57,055
What I know is

309
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,591
Echo cannot

310
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,871
Or could not

311
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,943
Camp right unless it is change it could not act

312
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,479
A speaker

313
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:08,831
Like a Bluetooth speaker for hands-free phone calling speaker right

314
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:11,903
It could act as a Bluetooth speaker for your music but it could not

315
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,951
Act is a hands-free speaker for you

316
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:18,047
I don't know if that's changed my has done something weird

317
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:18,815
Using

318
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:19,839
The scales

319
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,375
Or if it's just

320
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:24,703
Like basically then takes your phone in like

321
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,727
Calls your mom

322
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:28,799
Yeah that's at the thing if it just does that if it just

323
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:32,639
You know it saves you from dialing and I'm like okay but

324
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:36,223
If it actually Taps into the microphone and the speaker of

325
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:40,575
The Amazon Echo hardware and let you complete the call hands-free right

326
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,599
Speaking to

327
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,367
The device

328
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,159
Venom I'm interested

329
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:46,207
Yeah cuz that changes the function of the device

330
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:49,535
Yeah exactly

331
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:50,815
Puma

332
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:51,839
Adecco

333
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:54,655
And wants to enable the skill and let us know

334
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:55,935
Interstellar

335
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:57,983
You're going to email it

336
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:58,751
Info

337
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,407
Call Me Maybe

338
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:09,503
Okay so that was our first segment

339
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:12,575
On really cool things that have happened with the Amazon Echo at sea

340
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:13,855
So far

341
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,647
Now let's talk about

342
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,231
Because

343
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:20,255
I love it

344
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:23,583
I know I've been shipped nerd and we have got a lot of radio news

345
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,351
Started with

346
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:25,887
Halo Halo

347
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:33,311
Hello Halo CE I ain't like the news here from the Wi-Fi Alliance about this new 802. 11n a h or

348
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,103
As I like to call it

349
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:38,175
Halo is the friendly name for attitude at 11 a.m.

350
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:42,271
You're not too keen on this and I want to hear why but let me just explain what it is

351
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,295
The Wi-Fi Alliance

352
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:47,647
Says that by 2018 will be certifying products that use the standard

353
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:52,255
It's mainly meant for Internet of Things devices because it uses

354
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,535
Low power

355
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,607
And will not transmit data very fast but

356
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:57,887
That's okay with

357
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:01,471
Are the small bits of data that devices in the house actually word

358
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:03,519
In the reprise actually yeah

359
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:04,287
Transmit

360
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:08,127
Can you use the 900 megahertz unlicensed Spectrum band

361
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,479
And that gives it better range than current Wi-Fi Solutions

362
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,783
I think it sounds like a win

363
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:18,879
But before the show you're like I'm not sold on that and you didn't tell me why so why

364
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:19,903
All right

365
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,951
Mostly because I have more question

366
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,487
So

367
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,023
Wi-Fi alliances

368
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,303
Talked about the 900

369
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:30,399
What you guys need to know about that is it is

370
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,679
Really awesome Spectra

371
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:36,799
It is currently used for a lot of things because it is so awesome so it

372
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:37,823
Microwaves

373
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:38,847
Baby Mana

374
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,127
Garage door open

375
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,663
It's a really crowded

376
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:42,687
So

377
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:45,503
Really crowded Spectrum lot of opportunity for interference

378
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,807
It also is great because it goes through

379
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:48,575
Walls

380
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:52,159
Which means you can stick stuff in your basement you're going to get an awesome signal

381
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,695
That's why they're really pumped about it

382
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:57,023
But in other countries

383
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,095
Like in parts of Asia and Europe actually

384
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:03,935
It's also part is like the is M BAND that is used for cellular

385
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:05,215
Guess so

386
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:07,519
Third kind of like wool

387
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:13,663
Is this unified for the rest of the world or is this us only so there's some questions about how that Spectrum

388
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,199
Going to be used for like

389
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:15,967
All of it

390
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,015
Where is currently the Wi-Fi

391
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,807
Bands that we have now

392
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,343
Arbroath wide

393
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,135
Everywhere

394
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:25,439
The Wi-Fi Alliance doesn't have

395
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,207
Great answer

396
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:29,279
So that's question number one we're like

397
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:34,655
And because it's unlicensed spectrum they really can't control it so that's that's an issue

398
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:35,679
It is

399
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,215
How big of an issue

400
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,239
We will see

401
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,007
We will see

402
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:39,775
2

403
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:44,383
Last year when I was talking to the chipmaker's about

404
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:46,431
They were really skeptical about the

405
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:49,247
Power draw and I asked the Wi-Fi a lion sound like

406
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,015
Hey

407
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:52,319
They're kind of positioning this to be kind of like

408
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,599
Competitor to Bluetooth

409
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:57,439
Not necessarily Bluetooth low energy but they were talking about using it wearables

410
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,207
And

411
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:01,023
That's a really big deal because

412
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,047
Syfy sucks

413
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:02,815
Power

414
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,351
I mean it's a great don't give me wrong

415
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:06,655
But you know there's always tradeoffs when you're

416
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:07,935
Engineering something

417
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:11,775
Because the alliance didn't

418
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:12,543
Give me

419
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,103
The power draw they just didn't have it

420
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:15,871
They're like nope

421
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:23,807
I really curious if in the years since I've last talked to these guys and that's that's what I'm about to find out

422
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:25,087
I'm talking to guys today

423
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,111
Is

424
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,647
Have they fix that problem

425
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:30,207
I mean a year is a long time when your engineer

426
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:30,975
Lyrics oh

427
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:32,255
Maybe they have

428
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:34,815
When I last talked to people about age they were like

429
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:36,607
Stacy

430
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:37,631
Is

431
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:38,399
Better

432
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,167
But it is

433
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:39,935
Not

434
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:40,959
Bluetooth

435
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:41,983
Bro

436
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:42,751
Better

437
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,031
You know

438
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,567
Better is good

439
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:47,615
It's not something you could put in the world

440
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:50,687
Or a sensor that you know you really want to be battery powered

441
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,223
That's another question

442
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,783
So those are my big questions about

443
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:58,111
I'm not saying that that's going to kill this at all

444
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,903
Has changed

445
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,183
It feels

446
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:03,487
Barry marketing at this point

447
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:07,839
What's the Wi-Fi Alliance has a marketing organization and they have to go into the Internet of Things

448
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:11,935
If they're doing this and positioning this is like a technology that you

449
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,471
You can stick on things that are like

450
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:15,775
Your washing machine that's down in your basement

451
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,567
The Great

452
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:20,127
This is great I mean on washing machines plugged in

453
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:22,175
You definitely do want

454
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:24,223
You're connected washing machine in your basement

455
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,247
Table talk

456
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,551
Or reasons we'll talk about later in the shower

457
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:28,575
But

458
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:30,623
If you're really going to try to

459
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:32,159
Compete with Bluetooth or

460
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,695
Superior thread

461
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:34,463
No

462
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:37,279
So the devil's in the details

463
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,047
Always

464
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,839
And I don't even care about like

465
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,375
The date eraser talking about

466
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,911
Are up to 80 megabits

467
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,447
Which I think is great

468
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:49,311
And at the small end is like 100 56 kilobits per second

469
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,079
I think it is

470
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:54,431
So that's a big range so I'm also kind of like

471
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:59,551
Yeah well that's like I think it's up to four channels depends on how much data per channel in someone's butt

472
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:02,367
It does its 1 megahertz to 4 megahertz I believe

473
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:04,927
Alright so

474
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,207
There we have it

475
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:07,231
Wi-Fi Halo

476
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:10,559
Very exciting

477
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,095
In case you're like

478
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,631
Hello

479
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:16,447
Excited

480
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:22,847
We also will be seeing Halo in devices in 2016 we probably won't see an official certification until 2

481
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:23,871
2018

482
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:26,175
That's how the Wi-Fi Alliance works

483
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:28,735
You know that's not a surprise to anybody

484
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:32,063
I know and it won't be surprising to see some

485
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:35,391
Halo ready products in 2017 I wouldn't be surprised at all

486
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,183
There we have it

487
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,463
Next up

488
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:40,767
Zigbee and thread

489
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:41,791
Get married

490
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,631
I bet this is Vegas they could totally do it

491
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:48,191
What happened is back in April

492
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:50,495
Sydney is another Mesh networking protocol

493
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:54,847
There in light bulbs out there

494
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:56,383
RCP certified

495
00:18:56,895 --> 00:19:00,223
And a lot of your sensors are it's a low-power Mesh networking

496
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:02,271
Standard just so you guys know what it is

497
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:05,343
Add back in April

498
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,879
We're going to work with the

499
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:07,903
Upcoming

500
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:08,671
Red

501
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,439
Wireless

502
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:12,255
Standard to kind of see if they could get together because

503
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:13,279
Underneath

504
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:18,911
At the radio level zigbee and threader actually using the same IEEE radio protocol

505
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,703
It's 800

506
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:21,471
2

507
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,263
15.

508
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,031
4

509
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:28,895
That's for you IEEE nerds out there who are like but for everybody else

510
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:31,199
Just think they have the same

511
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,479
Basic radio

512
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:38,111
Different different entirely

513
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:41,695
Okay

514
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:44,511
So they've got the same radio but they've got different software

515
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,535
On top of it gif

516
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,303
Protocols

517
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,607
What they said they would do though is

518
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:52,959
They would try to like see how they can make it easier for down the line

519
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:54,495
Things to work together

520
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:56,799
Because everybody was kind of like

521
00:19:57,055 --> 00:20:01,919
Crap another radio protocol this is terrible we've already got zigbee Z-Wave Bluetooth

522
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:03,455
Wi-Fi

523
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,735
Our homes are a mess

524
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,015
So

525
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:08,319
What they announced at CES

526
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,087
Is

527
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:10,367
That

528
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:11,903
The upcoming

529
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:12,927
Zigbee

530
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:13,695
Three.

531
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:14,463
Oh

532
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,231
Standard

533
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:15,999
And

534
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:19,327
Thread with basically have the same

535
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:20,863
Okay this is complicated

536
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:23,423
They would not be interoperable

537
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,191
But

538
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:25,983
The device manufacturers

539
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:29,823
Through a hub the devices with share the same

540
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:30,591
Play notes

541
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:32,383
Communication in

542
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:33,407
Profile

543
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:34,687
Show

544
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:39,807
If you were building a device that worked on thread and you were building a device that worked on zippy

545
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:41,343
It wouldn't actually be able to talk

546
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,367
Directly to each other

547
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:43,647
But

548
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:44,927
If you had a hub

549
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:49,279
A light bulb that said it was a lightbulb in CB and a lightbulb it said it was a lightbulb

550
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,583
Thread would say they were light bulb

551
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:53,631
The same way so they could actually talk

552
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,935
Exactly are

553
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:56,959
Itachi how to draw

554
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:02,591
They'll start a certification program later this year I believe to

555
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:05,407
Thread + zigbee I believe it is

556
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,199
Yes that was really complicate

557
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:12,831
The two are pretty similar at at at at an underlying level to begin with so this makes them

558
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:15,135
A little more compatible even though they're not

559
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:16,672
The same things that make sense

560
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:19,744
But you're still as a consumer

561
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:22,048
And that's really what we care about

562
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:24,096
You're still going to have to look for them

563
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:25,632
To be compatible

564
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:26,656
All together

565
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:29,984
But if you buy a zigbee

566
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,008
Rio products

567
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:35,616
You will no longer have to worry about oh my God is it take me lightly certified

568
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:37,408
Or is it

569
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,944
You could just be like

570
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,504
I'll look this is Zippy 300 compatible

571
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:44,320
Yeah and this is it be 300 compatible

572
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:45,344
We're together

573
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:48,928
So going forward you should look just look for his MP3

574
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:49,952
Now

575
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,280
It's supposed to be backwards compatible

576
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:55,072
Gpha

577
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:56,352
Zigbee light Link

578
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,632
Sleepy all those things

579
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:00,448
But we all know how that's kind of a risky game to play

580
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,728
It is supposed to be

581
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:03,264
Nina

582
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,312
SEPTA's kind of good news bad news

583
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,592
Okay so

584
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:07,872
How is that

585
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,152
Better

586
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:10,944
Okay

587
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,224
Okay good

588
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:14,528
Next radio news

589
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:15,552
And they were through it

590
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,344
Bluetooth decks

591
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:20,416
I was really kind of excited about this

592
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,184
Cuz I tried

593
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:28,352
It's easy to install there's a lot of cool Bluetooth stuff coming out in the lighting section A lot of light switches and light bulb

594
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:30,912
Set up Bluetooth compatible so you don't have to do any wiring

595
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,496
You just like screwing a bluetooth light bulb and then you like literally

596
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:36,288
Stick a switchblade to your

597
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,080
Controls it right

598
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:39,616
It's awesome

599
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:43,200
The downside is because the Bluetooth matches not like

600
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:44,224
Super Gray

601
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,528
Phone sometimes

602
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:47,552
To be flaky

603
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:50,624
Discovery podcast

604
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:56,000
Introduced a Bluetooth Hub that controls 22 Bluetooth devices

605
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:58,816
I thought that was kind of a hundred feet

606
00:22:59,328 --> 00:22:59,840
Which

607
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:01,120
I like

608
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:07,008
What they're saying Bluetooth range of up to a thousand feet in the open air or through as many as

609
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,032
3 walls

610
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:13,152
Cuz I and that's good I I know that sometimes I'm walking to my house I'm streaming music or doing something

611
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:15,968
I walked into two rooms away and that's it I'm gone

612
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:19,040
You know and then disconnected how to reconnect and so on so

613
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:21,344
This would solve that problem but

614
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:23,904
But other problems as well because they have

615
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:26,208
Other Bluetooth accessories

616
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:27,488
Bike smart home accessories

617
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,048
They do and this Hub is only

618
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:33,888
$100 and it supports Bluetooth low energy and classic Bluetooth

619
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:39,520
So I kind of look like if you're going to invest in a lot of Bluetooth accessories

620
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:41,824
This is like kind of $100 range

621
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:47,712
Yeah it supported more devices because I kind of feel like

622
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:48,480
You're going to

623
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:50,784
It especially if you're going to install a bunch of light switches

624
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,064
But

625
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:52,832
I still kind of think

626
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:57,952
It is an in 22 sounds like a lot in order for Bluetooth it is

627
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:02,048
But then again you know look at all the lights that we have in our houses these days you want to hide and

628
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:04,608
Switches and so on so I don't know if I would build hold

629
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:05,632
System out of this

630
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:07,936
You know you'll go through that 22 real fast

631
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:13,056
Yeah the facet my Hue Hub only supports 50 devices is actually kind of an issue

632
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:15,616
But the fact that he bolts kostek

633
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:21,760
I thought this was cool

634
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:23,040
That concludes our radios

635
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:26,112
And moving right along to

636
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:27,648
Services

637
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,696
Services integration

638
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,488
Honestly

639
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:35,584
If I'm calling a story for CES this year it is that the Internet of Things

640
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:37,376
Is moved from things

641
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:39,680
Two Services which is about

642
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:40,448
Time

643
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:43,776
That's what makes everything talk to each other

644
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:46,336
It's we're still not really there yet but

645
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:47,360
Let's hit

646
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:48,640
You want to talk about

647
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:54,784
Yeah, and they're not the only one but Whirlpool is highlighting some of their new smart appliances with guess what

648
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,600
Integrated Amazon Dash buttons

649
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:02,976
I'm almost surprised to see his eye when the Dash came out with the little $5 dongle

650
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:05,280
You press a button and orders whatever

651
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:08,608
Laundry detergent or whatever that button is for through Amazon

652
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:12,448
I was like yeah I know and it's cuz I'm kind of silly to me

653
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:17,312
Integrate into products it just kind of makes sense I'm starting to wonder will

654
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:19,616
How many products will actually have these kind of

655
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:20,896
Reorder buttons

656
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:24,224
This is the Amazon doordash fulfillment service

657
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:26,272
So it's not even

658
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:28,832
But miss

659
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:29,600
Kind of silica

660
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:31,904
It's really just an integrated like order from Amazon

661
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:35,744
Which is awesome

662
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:36,768
So

663
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:37,536
I love it

664
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:38,304
Recite

665
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:43,424
Of course a bunch of companies integrating with Nest my favorite is Chamberlain

666
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:45,472
Doing some Nest Integrations

667
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:49,056
With the nest Dropcam stuff and lot of stuff there

668
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:53,152
I also thought Lowe's doing a monitored security

669
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:56,736
Service through is Iris home hub was worth mentioning because

670
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:58,528
Again services

671
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:02,112
And they're still planning to do another service through

672
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:05,696
Helping to plug mic hook you up with plumbers and that sort of thing

673
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:07,488
I also believe Samsung

674
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,816
SmartThings is also going to continue a line that plan

675
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:16,448
Service announcement

676
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,728
Ginni rometty is giving

677
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:19,520
Jeremy the CEO of IBM

678
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:21,056
Is giving a keynote

679
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:23,872
@ces Witcher like with Enterprise

680
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:24,640
Crazy

681
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:26,176
Watson

682
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:27,968
IBM's cognitive

683
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,040
Picture of a dozen just play Jeopardy

684
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:31,808
Doesn't trust

685
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:35,136
Crazy and

686
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,160
Lake

687
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:38,720
Hooking up with all these consumer-tech players

688
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:40,256
Such as Medtronic

689
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:43,328
To help anticipate diabetes

690
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:44,096
Track

691
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:44,864
And predict

692
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,448
Wearable medical sensors there is a partnership with whirlpool

693
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:51,776
To help like anticipate needs in the Smart Home

694
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:53,568
Partnership with SoftBank

695
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,640
Robotics which is the creator of pepper

696
00:26:56,896 --> 00:27:03,040
And a partnership with Under Armour so Kevin you want to talk a little bit more about the Under Armour and maybe pepper will Pepper

697
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:09,440
Real quick for those don't know what it's a little robot from aldeberan that's been around for a while they also make the now and I don't

698
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:11,232
I'm saying that represent a o

699
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:15,584
Like a $20,000 Little Robot that's really cool walks around and so on

700
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:16,864
So

701
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:22,496
IBM is going to tie into pepper what they're going to do is provide a little more smarts to the robot

702
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:27,360
Which I don't see that you can buy just yet I'm not sure if you can or not AIDS

703
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:30,688
Based in Japan through SoftBank so it may be a

704
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:37,088
Japanese thing only but I want a pepper also IBM is working with Under Armour and that sounds kind of strange like me

705
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:38,368
What does the people make like

706
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:42,208
All the clothes at the athletes wear that I can go buy at the store

707
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:49,120
And I have these products Under Armour Justin LCS they launched their UA healthbox

708
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:52,448
I have a health box and it is a $400

709
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,008
Kit that has a brand new

710
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:57,056
Under Armour scale with

711
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:58,848
Wi-Fi built in

712
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:01,920
Measures your body fat as well as your weight

713
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:06,272
Morgan update people need to step on it it knows who you are based on your weight and body fat

714
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:08,064
It sent that they dumped into the cloud

715
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:10,112
I thought it worked

716
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:16,256
No no no it's not that big it's a regular very well-designed glass scaler nice

717
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:20,864
There's also in the box and Under Armour band which I've been wearing for a couple weeks

718
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,400
Measures your

719
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:24,192
Steps sleep

720
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:27,008
You are activity or Fitness

721
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:30,592
And has a heart rate monitor Optical heart rate monitor not talk about that'll it more

722
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:32,896
They also include a

723
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:34,176
UA

724
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:38,016
Chest strap heart rate chest strap for those who would rather wear a chest strap

725
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:39,296
That's all in the Box

726
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:43,136
Not in the Box optional $450 I also have these

727
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:47,488
Are the Under Armour Gemini 2 speedform sneakers

728
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,792
With it looks like regular running

729
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:52,608
Shoes but inside is a battery and sensors

730
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:56,192
You wouldn't know it which I love it because it's invisible you don't turn them on or them

731
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:56,960
Just work

732
00:28:57,216 --> 00:29:00,288
They measure your steps your stride your Cadence soup

733
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:01,568
Pace and so on

734
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:05,920
It all feeds into the Under Armour record app for iOS or Android

735
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:11,552
Addicts well-designed shows the four quadrants of activity Fitness Nutrition and sleep

736
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:13,344
I'm getting tons of data

737
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,624
But back to IBM

738
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:17,440
I'm getting insights from Watson

739
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:21,792
Which is using all of the big data that IBM has on health

740
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:27,424
And it's telling me how my maybe my fitness compared to people in my age group

741
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:31,008
Men in my age group for example actually goes at specific

742
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:34,080
Talks about health bits it just provides insight

743
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:38,432
It's not doing too much just yet but then again they just launched this but

744
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:40,992
I did notice the past couple days before the announcement

745
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:45,088
I was getting Watson insights in my Under Armour record app

746
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:46,368
Based on my data

747
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:48,672
And how compared to the big data that Watson has

748
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:50,208
Awesome

749
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:51,488
On Thursday

750
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:53,792
Morning when this goes

751
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:57,376
Let you know

752
00:29:57,632 --> 00:30:01,984
Ask Watson for the Powerball numbers the Powerball numbers tell me Owasso

753
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:07,104
It will be at Watson plan breakfast which means it will be

754
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:12,992
You know as you guys know what's and not only anticipates Kevin's every need

755
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:14,272
ASCII exercise

756
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:17,344
Watson also plans delicious recipes

757
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,160
It's recipes before so

758
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:23,744
All right so that is kind of the services thing there is

759
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,792
The stuff also happening at the connect

760
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:28,096
Car front will probably talk about that next show

761
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:29,632
The partnership with whirlpool

762
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:31,936
Watson will actually be gathering data

763
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:33,728
From whirlpools new

764
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:36,288
Connected washers fridges

765
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:40,640
Other things which is why your wife I should be better in your basement in case you

766
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:42,688
You keep your Whirlpool washer and dryer

767
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:43,968
So

768
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,760
It's a little scary actually

769
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:48,064
I'm not going to lie to you

770
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,088
Vital thing

771
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:51,648
If we don't actually have a guest for the show so don't worry

772
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,184
You're going to spend the whole time

773
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:55,232
Is cameras

774
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:57,792
Because there were a lot of really good cameras and you know how

775
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:59,584
Actually we know how you live cam

776
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,352
Because

777
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:03,424
I'm not too sold on them except when they're outside

778
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,960
In this case in my fridge

779
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:06,240
This is me

780
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:07,008
So

781
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:08,288
Starters

782
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:14,688
It was actually here last year at CVS and they had a smarter coffee pot and hot water kettle that we talked about

783
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,968
Dissing your cake

784
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,576
Fisher they were showing off a connected fridge cam

785
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:23,904
It was $199

786
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:30,304
And I don't know if you guys recall this but I'm super psyched about the idea of a connected fridgecam because

787
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:34,144
Catalog in what's in your fridge

788
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,168
Boracay news

789
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:38,496
Grocery shopping purposes

790
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:41,824
That might happen but it's going to take awhile

791
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:42,848
And I need to know if I have no

792
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:44,384
So

793
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,968
This camera basically

794
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,248
It's a picture

795
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:50,272
And it sent it to you

796
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:51,040
On your phone

797
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:52,320
And that's it

798
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:53,600
And then you can be like

799
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:54,624
Hey

800
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,952
They also have a line of connected math

801
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:01,280
For your pantry basically it's mats with the weight sensor in it

802
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:02,304
And

803
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,840
You tell it was on that mat

804
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:07,936
It's like hey whatever this thing is

805
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,032
I'm loving that that concept

806
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:13,312
I'm loving the fridge cam

807
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,592
What is a little

808
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:19,968
Yeah I mean I'd rather just keep a grocery list and said pay $200

809
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:21,760
But I love the concept of

810
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:23,552
I'm out and about at the

811
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:25,088
Story of the grocery store

812
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:27,392
Cheese how much milk do we really have I forget

813
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:30,720
Pop open the app you look at your camera in your fridge now you know

814
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:32,512
Yeah I have to cut the tops

815
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:33,792
Set of my egg carton

816
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:36,352
I did get rid of my

817
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:37,376
Quickie eggs

818
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:38,656
And I'm

819
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:39,936
Now I wouldn't know

820
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:41,728
So I like that

821
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,568
I like this kind of like having you had a great idea cuz we

822
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:50,432
Is tiny little cameras I've written about them actually in my previous life at giga

823
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:51,968
They're called blink

824
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,016
They did a Kickstarter last August

825
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:56,832
Not this most recent August but August 2014

826
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:58,880
These are it's actually a

827
00:32:59,136 --> 00:32:59,904
Companies

828
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:00,672
Started

829
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:05,280
They had a video processing chip that was really good

830
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:07,584
Really low power

831
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:13,984
And they realize that they couldn't make it as a video Processing Company like the margins were just too thin they could sell these chips

832
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,800
You know are actually $2

833
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:17,824
Tencent youku

834
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:18,848
Margins

835
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:19,872
Will Barton

836
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:21,152
To DVD Maker

837
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:22,432
DVD player makers

838
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:23,200
Blu-ray player

839
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:25,760
Instalike what is the Terrible

840
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:26,784
Nobody wants this

841
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:27,808
What could make

842
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,344
Connect to camera

843
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,672
So they decided to make a connect to camera they got out of the chip business and

844
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:34,720
When did the consumer product business and they like

845
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:36,000
Sonys cameras

846
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:42,656
Are $79 for one tiny little it's probably a 2 and 1/2 by 2 and 1/2 in maybe 3 by 3 in

847
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:44,960
And a wireless

848
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:45,984
And cordless

849
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:50,080
Yeah they run out of battery should last quite a while

850
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:53,920
You can if you buy these and both are even less than the $79 each because

851
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:57,504
And get to 41393 for 189 and 5

852
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,784
289

853
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:02,880
I like this because of the portability

854
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:07,488
It still uses Wi-Fi so it's not like using some funky radio protocol

855
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,768
You actually

856
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:13,376
Plug-in into an outlet with a little help it comes with it so it's not hanging off router

857
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:16,448
You can't use them outside or not waterproof but that's okay

858
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:20,800
But you could use one in your fridge

859
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:23,872
They turn up their not recording all the time when they see motion

860
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:25,920
The record that's the power conservation

861
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:26,944
Method obviously

862
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,504
So when you open your fridge door they're going to start recording

863
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:30,784
And you close it

864
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,856
The recording of what's in your fridge right

865
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:38,464
What about your friends being a giant Faraday cage I talked to the inhibitor

866
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,536
Behind what we thought that too

867
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:47,936
But there's a lot of like rubber gaskets and stuff that actually allow the Wi-Fi signal to get out so I was like okay great

868
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:51,776
What about you know the colder the fridge sucking the battery

869
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:53,056
You know what he's like

870
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:55,360
We also were concerned about that but you know

871
00:34:55,616 --> 00:35:01,504
Tell battery life actually it's actually really good for the batteries up until you get to about 0 degrees Celsius

872
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:03,296
Then

873
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:04,320
The battery life

874
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:07,392
Maybe you could use

875
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:09,184
479 bus

876
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:12,256
If I don't use it in my fridge and I'm tempted because

877
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:14,816
These look simple to use during expensive

878
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:16,864
You can move them around easily

879
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:17,888
I like it

880
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:19,936
They're getting through their Kickstarter orders

881
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:23,264
And then they said by mid-January they'll be shipping

882
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,032
Comstock

883
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,568
So you don't even have to wait

884
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:29,152
So there you got blink for home. Com is where you can order them from

885
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:30,688
Two more cameras

886
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,224
That are worth mentioning

887
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:34,272
The ring doorbell launched

888
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:35,296
Stick up camera

889
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:39,904
Which Kevin these are the last two are outdoor cameras since I'm obsessed with outdoor camera

890
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:40,672
Price right now

891
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:46,560
The ring doorbell camera is the stick up camera is $199 of Kobe shipping in two to three weeks

892
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:48,608
You were looking actually for

893
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:49,888
A smaller outdoor

894
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:51,168
Camera this is bracket

895
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,472
Yeah bracket mounted might work for 9

896
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:55,776
What's neat about this is

897
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:57,568
It works with the ring doorbell

898
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:59,872
But two is a two-way audio

899
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,968
I'm so you can talk to someone if you see them running around on your property

900
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:04,736
Used to be like

901
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:06,784
Hey that my mom

902
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:07,808
Quite literally

903
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:09,344
Which

904
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:13,184
And then the other camera is the netatmo presence

905
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:14,464
Outdoor camera

906
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:16,256
And I like this

907
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:17,536
A couple reason

908
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,096
1 this is a wired camera

909
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:23,680
So the ring doorbell camera is actually not its Wireless

910
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:25,472
Battery power

911
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:28,288
But the netatmo is wired but what happens is you

912
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:29,824
You wire it into

913
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:32,640
An existing outdoor security light

914
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:34,944
Or an existing outdoor light

915
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:40,064
And it's got an egg LED light that turns on that actually gives the camera enough light to

916
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:40,832
Come by

917
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:42,368
And

918
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:43,136
Skinny

919
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:46,464
It's not going to be out till Q3 I don't have pricing for it

920
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:49,792
I've been wanting a camera to stick up on my rooftop

921
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,072
And this

922
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:53,376
I just seems like it might be the camera

923
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:55,424
