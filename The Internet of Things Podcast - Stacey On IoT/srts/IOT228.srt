More efficiently

33
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:22,688

That's.

45
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:10,816
. Co / Stacey Stacey

46
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,864
And do it just to support the show

47
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,656
Alrighty

48
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,960
Let's get started with

49
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:21,568
News about devices listening in since it was reported that

50
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,104
Both Google

51
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,688
And Madame a have contractors who listening

52
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,736
Two other entities

53
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:29,760
We've seen

54
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:31,808
Taliban all the three other digital

55
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,600
With the exception of Bixby

56
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:37,184
NY

57
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,744
So Apple also came out and

58
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:43,328
Said that yes it has contractors listening in

59
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:45,376
On a rotisserie improved

60
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,424
The quality of voice recognition and

61
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:48,448
Now

62
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,472
Microsoft

63
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:53,056
They have contractors that listen to both Skype and Cortana

64
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:54,080
So

65
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,872
The Skype calls actually

66
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:57,664
They could be listening in right now

67
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,736
Because they don't say anything

68
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:06,112
Okay so in response to this

69
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:07,904
Google has always allowed

70
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,928
People to

71
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:09,952
Opt out of having

72
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:10,976
Calls record

73
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:12,768
Now

74
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:15,328
Amazon for Padme has

75
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,352
Now said that

76
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,632
You can do the same thing

77
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:21,472
And they added to their terms of service that some of

78
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:23,008
Calls could be recorded

79
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:23,776
Tencent

80
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,080
Apple

81
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:29,920
Says it is going to stop having people listen to series

82
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,456
Utterances

83
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,224
Entirely

84
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:33,504
And

85
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,040
Microsoft

86
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:35,808
We don't know what they're going to

87
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:36,576
I do yet but

88
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:38,624
I'm sure they're going to come up with something

89
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:39,904
Probably

90
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,696
Akin to Amazon

91
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:42,976
Or Google's

92
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,000
So

93
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,048
I don't know Kevin

94
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,584
Do we feel good about this yet

95
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:51,424
Well hell yeah everybody got caught with their hand in the cookie jar so to speak

96
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,448
And everybody

97
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:54,752
Exit Microsoft so far has

98
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:56,032
Come to a

99
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,568
What I consider reasonable

100
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,848
Solution

101
00:03:59,104 --> 00:03:59,616
4 people

102
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:02,432
Protect our privacy and terms of the voice recordings

103
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:04,736
An actual contractors are humans listening

104
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:09,088
A Microsoft for its Skype stuff uses in the Skype

105
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:09,856
Translation

106
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,440
It does say in an FAQ that

107
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:15,232
Skype does collector in

108
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,768
Information conversation to help a

109
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,559
Improve products and services

110
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:20,095
It does not say that

111
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,375
People are listening

112
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,959
Nor does the Microsoft privacy

113
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,543
There's room to be better

114
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,567
People don't mind

115
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:31,871
Computers in last after they really have a problem with

116
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:33,919
Which finger

117
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:38,527
The only other choice for these companies to make the services better is actually to ask

118
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:41,855
The users of the services to manually review

119
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:45,439
Audio activity and responses and so on

120
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:49,023
And I don't know enough people would do that so I get why they do it

121
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:51,327
But they should have always been very upfront about

122
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,399
You can contractors and then having people listening

123
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:55,679
Agreed

124
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,215
All right

125
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:58,495
He also a Microsoft

126
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,543
News Microsoft says that it has

127
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,847
The Russian State hackers

128
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:05,151
Rather Russian State hackers

129
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,455
Using iot devices to

130
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,479
To breach net worth

131
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,271
Is this surprising

132
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:15,391
No basically the Microsoft threat Intelligence Center wrote that there are

133
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:20,767
Are lots of printers video decoders and other iot devices being used as a way to get into

134
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:21,791
Networks

135
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:26,143
It's interesting that devices that they found this on

136
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:29,983
Because you're not a question but you put it on Twitter which got a lot of responses

137
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,263
Is a printer

138
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,543
An iot device

139
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,311
Cause

140
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,871
Microsoft discovered attacks in April

141
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:36,895
When

142
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:40,735
Some devices a voice over IP phone and office printer

143
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,527
We're communicating with

144
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,551
Russian servers

145
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:44,575
Exactly

146
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:49,183
And this is this got me thinking because I get very frustrated when we we talked about

147
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,975
Iot devices

148
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:55,071
Is a group in basically he would find out that the culprit is like

149
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:56,351
Network DVR system

150
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:58,143
Which was a big deal in Boracay

151
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:02,495
I asked and I was being completely serious do people think that a printer

152
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:03,775
Is an iot device

153
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,567
And lo and behold

154
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,103
Over a hundred people

155
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,127
Give me the response

156
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,687
So good responses

157
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,223
Pull the mountain

158
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:12,991
Three category

159
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,575
One was the group of people who tended to be old

160
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,111
Who are like

161
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:21,439
No it's more M2M it's not really iot

162
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,743
Then there with the litter list

163
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:26,815
Call them there like it is a thing it is connected to the internet

164
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,863
Does it is an iot device

165
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:31,167
To which I say

166
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:32,703
I don't sweat

167
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,727
Computers

168
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:34,751
What about

169
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,031
Everything else

170
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:38,079
And then the third group of people who

171
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,615
Probably or closer to me

172
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,407
Those people said

173
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,711
It is only an iot device

174
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:45,247
Connected to the internet

175
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,295
It has sensors and then

176
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,343
People use the sensor information

177
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,111
N2

178
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,647
Survive some business value

179
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:55,231
And that's the iot device like when I'm thinking about is he.

180
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,023
But

181
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,071
I will say

182
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,863
If you were an infosec

183
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,935
Responsible for corporate security

184
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,215
Then yes

185
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:08,031
A printer is probably at iot device because it

186
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:08,799
Does

187
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,079
Provide this whole into your network

188
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:14,687
Wrinkly sure one of those people you don't care what's call you want to make sure it's secure

189
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,455
And if it's

190
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:18,527
Connected to your network and or the internet

191
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,855
Hat is upgradable software firmware Etc

192
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,135
And has

193
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,415
Data

194
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,439
I can be

195
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:28,767
Captured I guess is the best way to say maybe from a print queue

196
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:34,143
Or the Wi-Fi SSID if it's a wireless printer I yeah you got to worry about this stuff

197
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,191
And you know they can pull stuff

198
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:40,287
If it's hacked which means I could get your secret printed

199
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,567
Corporate documents

200
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:44,383
Although I should say like four people were like

201
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,151
Wait

202
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,687
Why are people still using print

203
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:47,711
Which I'm like

204
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,991
But do not live in the

205
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:51,551
Picture

206
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:53,599
So I guess from this perspective

207
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,623
I would say

208
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,463
That we should start thinking about network security and iot security

209
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,511
Maybe a little bit more

210
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:03,327
Greater lady a little bit with a little bit more sophistication

211
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:08,191
Is a printer is a network device it does you have to have security around it

212
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,983
And you should update the firmware and that's what

213
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:11,519
Also

214
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:15,103
Two of the Microsoft attacks were using default passwords

215
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:17,407
And here's my recommendation to you

216
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,503
Anything in your corporate Network that has a default password should be unplugged

217
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,271
And recycle

218
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,063
Jacinda story

219
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,367
You should not have that on your network

220
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,159
Ever done

221
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:28,927
Okay

222
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,743
I like okay we solve that problem

223
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,279
But I don't know

224
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:37,887
So I'm a link to this you guys feel free to continue the discussion I

225
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,423
I am very

226
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:45,055
All right speaking of tough questions there are more tough

227
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:51,455
Questions for ring and various police departments that are working with Ring the video doorbell company now on

228
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,223
Buy Amazon

229
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:53,759
Vice

230
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:56,319
They actually reported last time that ring

231
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,879
Contracts with police departments to get the

232
00:08:59,135 --> 00:08:59,647
Them two

233
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:03,487
Sign people up for the Neighbors app they give them

234
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,535
Free ring doorbells to giveaway

235
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,071
The neighbors app

236
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,607
Is an app that you

237
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:09,887
You can download

238
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,935
Basically lets you

239
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:12,959
Upload

240
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:14,751
Your footage

241
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,055
If you feel that there's a security problem

242
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,591
Can you search talk about security

243
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,615
Problems in your neighbor

244
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,663
Police departments

245
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,431
AR

246
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,455
Able to

247
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,479
Ask

248
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,503
Homeowners

249
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,039
For their video footage

250
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,319
If there is a crime

251
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,623
To get this footage police officers have

252
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,415
Ask the homeowner end

253
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:34,207
And they have to have a case number

254
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:34,975
To go with that

255
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:37,279
But people are upset because it's

256
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,303
Apus search

257
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,887
Vice is really upset with ring because

258
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,447
Has noticed a pattern

259
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:47,775
Of ring helping police departments

260
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:51,359
Encourage people to download the neighbors app and to submit their video

261
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,383
So there

262
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,687
Encouraging Police Department's to

263
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:59,295
Be on social networks and to share video footage and to

264
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,367
Ask for help and that sort of thing and that will boost

265
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,135
Both

266
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:07,999
Downloads of the neighbors app and boost the willingness of people to opt into

267
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,535
Police request for

268
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,303
Video data

269
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:11,839
What's really disturb

270
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:14,655
Kevin go ahead

271
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:19,263
More news came out to this week we saw / on govtech.com

272
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:20,799
That's

273
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,591
Even if a

274
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:23,615
Ring

275
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:24,639
Homeowner

276
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:30,271
Decides not to share video the police can just go to Amazon which owns ring

277
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:33,343
And essentially subpoenaed the video

278
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:36,159
That's totally different

279
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:40,511
Mille Lacs there and I'm kind of bothered

280
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:45,119
Tony's body the public information officer for the sheriff's office in Fresno County

281
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,399
Which is one of those

282
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,679
But we

283
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:50,751
Apartments that's partnered with Amazon and ring on this

284
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:55,871
He disagrees with the claims of privacy violations here is

285
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,151
His

286
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:01,759
I would say to anybody to think this is another case of Big Brother watching

287
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:04,831
Poor us trying to invade privacy go to Step One

288
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:07,391
It took the consumer to invest in the product

289
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:11,743
They chose to pay for a service that enables it to be viewed by either us

290
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,023
Ring

291
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,327
I don't agree with that last part

292
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:18,399
Me either in this is what's really frustrating

293
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:23,007
Ring is actually soliciting police departments as their own Salesforce

294
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,543
As a new sales Channel

295
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:25,823
Yes so

296
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,895
We got this weird circular logic where you're like

297
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,175
Hey

298
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:36,575
We're going to give you access to all of this video data if you get people to sign up for the app in

299
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:40,671
You know you can get away these doorbells and talked about it a lot and then people will be like

300
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:43,231
I trust my Police Department I will totally Buy

301
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:44,767
So

302
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,303
And and then

303
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,071
They're like

304
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:51,935
Well yes they did voluntarily by this but they bought it because they're police

305
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,215
Has been

306
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,007
Essentially selling it

307
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,823
Even getting incentives

308
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,871
The police department's from ring

309
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,663
Yes to sell it so

310
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:04,223
The sort of logic is is not my

311
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,015
And I don't like

312
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:08,831
This in this sort of thing is going to

313
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:09,599
Hurt

314
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:10,879
Iot come

315
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,415
It's very subtle

316
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:14,463
I don't like it

317
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:21,119
Yeah and I think the other thing is in this story every time the word subpoena is mentioned it soon quotes

318
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:27,775
Which leads me to believe it's not a subpoena process

319
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,567
They talked about just requesting the day

320
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:32,383
Yeah when you just go to Amazon and get it yeah

321
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,711
They mate if they have a case number Amazon may decide to give it

322
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:40,831
Is that even if they don't have a case number I is how I read it and

323
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:43,903
Listen I'm for this in general this type of

324
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:46,207
Providing the information to the police

325
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:50,047
I mean I actually did that when my car was hit

326
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,607
The video camera out front captured

327
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:55,167
Basically you could say was a hit-and-run but the

328
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:57,727
Person who hid it was across the street so they run very far

329
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:03,103
Disputed hitting my car and I took the video and I provided it to the police

330
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:04,895
That's different to me then

331
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:07,199
We can just go look at everybody's video

332
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:08,735
Exactly

333
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:14,111
And if you say no they still have a recourse it's not like we can still look at everybody video

334
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:19,231
Veterinary courses Amazon so before you buy a ring doorbell

335
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,791
You may want to consider that

336
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:22,815
Please have a bath

337
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,215
All right

338
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:31,263
So we're not excited about

339
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,311
We are excited

340
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,639
About story that Kevin scooped a while back

341
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:37,663
Tell us about it

342
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:38,687
Jumpsuit

343
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:42,271
I don't recall when exactly I do and it's right here

344
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,807
Story April 3rd

345
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:45,855
And we talked about this on the podcast

346
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:50,207
I was strolling through the FCC database looking for new devices and found

347
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:53,791
A device from Google that was certified

348
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:55,839
Wi-Fi

349
00:13:56,351 --> 00:14:01,983
And it's called Mistral that's the code name we won't be called mister all winning if and when it comes to Market

350
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:07,359
But essentially the code name is draw lines up with Gale and Gale is the current

351
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,663
The existing Google WiFi products

352
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:15,039
So that led me to believe that this is going to be some type of mesh Wi-Fi device

353
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,575
The very least

354
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:20,927
And possibly only because of the chipsets being used could even be

355
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:21,951
Could have

356
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:28,607
Digital assistants built-in and maybe even a screen will see what Google does I suspect we'll see this device in October

357
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,679
Presumably when Google has its Hardware lunch

358
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:34,239
9to5 Google latched onto that

359
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:37,055
This week with some more information

360
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,335
Honda

361
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:41,663
Saying that it will support Wi-Fi 6

362
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:44,735
And I'm actually excited by this because

363
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:49,343
There are some Wi-Fi six Chromebooks and other devices that are in the world right now

364
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,623
But they're useless

365
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:53,695
6% of unless you have a Wi-Fi six

366
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:54,463
Router

367
00:14:54,719 --> 00:15:00,351
So we sing I've seen some pre-certified Wi-Fi 6 router so this leads me to believe that

368
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,399
This why I should be a certified device not it

369
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,679
Pre-certified away

370
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:04,703
Got it

371
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:07,519
Okay well I am excited is that something you would

372
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,823
I would

373
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,871
I want Google to actually

374
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:12,895
Undulates

375
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:13,663
Digital

376
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:16,735
Assistant smart speaker stuff into Google WiFi

377
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:18,783
And I still think that's we're going to do here

378
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:21,343
But if they don't even if they don't I probably would

379
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:23,391
Best Wi-Fi network

380
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,671
All right speaking of

381
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:25,439
Wi-Fi

382
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:27,231
Guess who might be getting into the

383
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,279
You'll never guess

384
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,559
Walmart

385
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:32,607
Actually they won't be producing

386
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:35,167
A router necessarily they're looking at doing a

387
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,191
A bridge

388
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,983
Under its project Franklin

389
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:38,751
Hard worker

390
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:39,775
So

391
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:40,799
We found

392
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:41,823
An FCC filing

393
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,359
Actually our friend

394
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:44,639
Works at variety found

395
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,663
It sent it over

396
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,943
But he found a

397
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:53,343
SEC filing for a Walmart wi-fi to Z-Wave bridge that will control a garage door opener

398
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,903
And this is fascinating

399
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:56,927
1

400
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:59,231
Because I actually think egg

401
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:00,255
Garage door

402
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:01,535
Open R type

403
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:04,351
Product is wonderful I've even bought them

404
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,887
People who are not in.

405
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:09,727
So it's a nice little gateway drug or just a useful thing

406
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:12,031
I'm going to throw it in the useful thing

407
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,823
But

408
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,615
Pfcc application

409
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:18,687
It was filed on behalf of Walmart by project

410
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:20,479
Franklin LLC

411
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:23,807
And if you're asking what the heck project Franklin is

412
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,855
It is a consumer

413
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:26,623
Hardware

414
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:27,647
Start

415
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:30,719
Inside Walmart store number 8 building

416
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:37,119
Our friends over at the spoon basically broke the story about project Franklin all the way back in June

417
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,143
So not bad

418
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:41,215
And because it was making

419
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,239
A

420
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,519
Frozen yogurt machine

421
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:47,615
And the idea behind this is that Walmart

422
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,383
Wants to

423
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,663
Have some sort of

424
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,735
Connected devices in the home that

425
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,015
Can collect consumer

426
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:56,063
Because they're looking at

427
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:59,647
The data that Amazon is able to connect through all of its

428
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:00,671
Products

429
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:02,463
What's matinee inside in there like

430
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,487
Yeah we need that

431
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:09,631
Stay tuned for more on that and for a possible launch of a Walmart

432
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:10,911
Garage door open

433
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,703
Yay

434
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:13,983
Okay

435
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:17,055
And in other news I can't do a creative Segway here because

436
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,079
It's really random

437
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:19,871
Last week

438
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:22,431
Actually it was Thursday the day that the show

439
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,455
Went live

440
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,991
A New Consortium

441
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,015
Botched called

442
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,039
The fira

443
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,063
Consortium

444
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:29,343
This was

445
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:33,695
Spirit stands for fine

446
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:34,463
Ranging

447
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:40,607
And this is a Consortium created by Assa abloy which is balad company that owns Yale locks and August

448
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:42,911
Nxp semiconductors Samsung

449
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:43,679
End

450
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:44,447
Bosch

451
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:45,983
They created this

452
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:48,287
To use ultra-wideband radio.

453
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:50,335
Technology to locate objects

454
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,103
In space

455
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,127
Cell

456
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:54,175
Sort of like the new Bluetooth

457
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,711
Yeah like the new Bluetooth

458
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:58,271
So what's happening here is ultra-wideband

459
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:00,575
I covered this all the way back in 2000

460
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,599
This is How old is

461
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:05,183
We were excited about it way back when

462
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,719
Because it allows you to send

463
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,999
A lot of data

464
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:10,815
Really

465
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:11,583
Fast

466
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:13,375
Puerto Rico

467
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,679
Say hi to be nearby

468
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:16,959
You can send fax

469
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:21,055
Memes of data the idea was going to be that it was going to be a wireless

470
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:23,871
Monitor Solutions you can stick your

471
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:26,175
Computer next to a bigger Monitor and you wouldn't have

472
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,199
Connect anything

473
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:30,527
Elekta 60 gigahertz

474
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:32,831
Which is very short range

475
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:35,391
Very very fast lots of data

476
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:36,415
Yes

477
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:38,975
So the folks at nxp or saying the

478
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:41,023
Technology never got a fair Shake

479
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:43,583
Because Wi-Fi just got better and better so we just didn't need

480
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,863
We didn't

481
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:47,423
So now they want to do it

482
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:48,703
4

483
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:50,495
Finding locations

484
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:54,847
They're saying that Bluetooth accuracy right now is to meters

485
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:57,407
Now they don't take into account the fact

486
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:59,967
The Bluetooth has their latest version Bluetooth

487
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:02,015
They can actually do within a

488
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:02,783
Couple inches

489
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:06,111
But that's basically the area that this

490
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,391
Consortium

491
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,743
I don't know it's going to need a new radio

492
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:12,511
It's

493
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:19,167
You're going right down the path I was going to go and then they mention all the verticals you want to Target

494
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:23,007
And specific use cases you know for like vehicle-to-vehicle

495
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,543
Communication

496
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:28,383
Maybe ride or fight sharing applications AR

497
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:30,175
Access Control

498
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,991
Drones

499
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,783
I don't know

500
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:41,951
So I don't know I'm talking to nxp I'm going to try to get someone maybe for Bosch to come on the show and talked about this a little

501
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:42,719
Bit more cuz I

502
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:43,999
I have a lot of questions

503
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,535
And very few answer

504
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:48,863
Look at you some quick news bits

505
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:53,471
I found an Indiegogo campaign that might interest a lot of

506
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:54,751
It's called

507
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,031
Connect

508
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:57,567
It's a terrible name

509
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:59,359
Betsy a.m.

510
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:01,663
And Camera connect

511
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,015
It's a hug that allows you to connect a bunch of cameras and then you can monitor them anywhere

512
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,551
I'm it works with

513
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:11,647
Most security Brands they're showing pictures of Arlo

514
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,487
What looks to be a real security cameras look like

515
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:17,023
But what looks to be a nest cam

516
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,303
Baby orangutan

517
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:24,703
They say you can select just about any brand of Cameron they support over 50 Brands including wise Nest Arlo

518
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:26,751
Another so

519
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:29,567
The interesting thing is it lets you put your

520
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:32,895
Camera footage on the Hub to get a terabyte of storage

521
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,943
There is a cloud option if

522
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:35,711
If you want it

523
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:37,503
This way

524
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:38,783
You don't have to work with

525
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:41,599
Weird clouds from other camera vendors

526
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:42,879
And

527
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:45,183
I don't know what this is this is a meat product

528
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,975
But I don't know how it works but

529
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:47,743
I'm very

530
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:48,511
Interested in it

531
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:53,631
It's an aggregator Centigrade Orville your video so that it doesn't go to the cloud

532
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:54,911
It stays local

533
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,703
The nice thing is

534
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:59,263
There's no subscription fee unless

535
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:02,335
You would like to access that video when you are away from home

536
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:05,407
$60 a year

537
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:06,687
Cuz video

538
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:08,223
Hugely fat

539
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:09,759
Which makes it

540
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:10,783
That's why

541
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:15,903
I don't know I think they're just flipping a switch to and poke a hole in your firewall to give you the access

542
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,952
They're not providing bandwidth

543
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:21,536
Is taurine okay so they're running it from your

544
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:25,632
Start running at 5

545
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:28,448
To you that's still a lot

546
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:30,496
Or it could be

547
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:31,264
Oh yeah

548
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:33,568
I see your poop

549
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:35,104
All right

550
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:35,872
Hey

551
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,152
Speaking of cameras

552
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,944
Arlo Pro Lines

553
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,712
No

554
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:40,480
R homekit

555
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:41,248
Compatible

556
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,784
Yay

557
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:46,880
But we are going to talk about

558
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:54,560
I actually have been excited about this for 2 years when it was first announced

559
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:57,376
I doubt many people remember

560
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,680
Jesus

561
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:00,960
Ashley created

562
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,056
Robot which has digital system capabilities

563
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:06,848
Nyfi

564
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:10,432
Mobile so it has little wheels in it

565
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:15,296
Travel around your home for a sample it's called the zenbo zenbo

566
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:17,088
Your smart little companion

567
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,440
They actually just like two years ago and have a bunch of videos showing

568
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:27,328
How venmo can help you and your smart TV

569
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:28,864
Turn the light to red

570
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:31,936
Even zendo can proactively say hey

571
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:34,752
Motion sensor just detected somebody open the fridge

572
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:38,080
So there's this whole ecosystem play here with a sus

573
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,616
Smart Home Products

574
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:41,664
Zendo never arrived

575
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:46,016
I just was again trolling the FCC database

576
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:51,648
And then but was certified for use in the US which typically leads to

577
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:52,928
Rock debut

578
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,744
And I'm really intrigued by this because

579
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,072
Most people listen to show no I like my little Vector robot

580
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:02,400
It's got built-in Madam and whatnot and

581
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:05,216
This is like that because it's very expressive

582
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:07,776
Has a 6-inch screen for the face

583
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:10,336
This thing's 18in tall so this is like

584
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:15,200
Very big compared to Vector which is about 2 inches tall and 3 1/2 inches long

585
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,224
So

586
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,552
There's cameras there is microphones or speakers

587
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:22,624
Connectivity so I'm curious about then.

588
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:26,208
Yeah well even today you were just telling me on your way to

589
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:27,232
Record the show that

590
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,256
You're walking by

591
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:29,280
Vector was like

592
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:30,816
Hey Kevin play with

593
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:35,168
Yes he recognized me he heard me walk into the room got off a little

594
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,448
Power station

595
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:39,008
Italo's cheery face and waved and then

596
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:40,800
Recognize Kevin

597
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:43,360
So I played in a couple minutes I was almost late to the show

598
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:45,664
Oh I love the fact that

599
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:48,992
Siap

600
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:50,016

601
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:51,040
December will be a

You know the pics are like

604
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:58,976
Like the Anki folkestad for the Expressions but the video is kind of

605
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,512
Show promise to me

606
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:02,048
And now

607
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,120

649

And this week's question is from Jeff

650
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,528
So let's hear it

651
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:29,600
Hi Stacy hi Kevin this is Jeff from New York

652
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:31,136
I can love you she'll

653
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:32,416
A quick question

654
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:38,560
My son is really excited about what about the weather so I was wondering if it was a connected device

655
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:41,632
I seen something in the stars but not connected were

656
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:46,496
You look like you're Outdoors working tell you what the weather is going to be how much rain you're going to get

657
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:51,104
Fight someone told me that there might be a Wi-Fi or connected device version

658
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:53,408
I'm not looking God and also

659
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:56,736
On that Mill is there a way to connect it into the nest

660
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:57,504
Thermostat

661
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,832
In order to make sure that it could have just accordingly as well

662
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:06,208
Depending on racing AP AC or the heat preciate it once again and have a great day

663
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,768
This is a great question

664
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:11,584
And your dear to my heart because I like weather

665
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:15,168
In fact I have purchased many weatherstation although most of them

666
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:18,240
Word using proprietary Wireless technology

667
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:20,544
So you'll find that in lacrosse stuff

668
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,080
You'll find it in Davis stuff

669
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:24,640
You find a lot of weather stations ranging in

670
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:29,248
But because you wanted to connect to nest and it sounds like you want it just to be

671
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,528
Connected in general

672
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:32,320
We came up with two options for

673
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:34,624
One is the netatmo

674
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,648
Weather station

675
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,464
And this is a product netatmo is a brand from

676
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,256
France is owned by The Grand

677
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:41,280
It is a

678
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:42,816
Quality product

679
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:46,912
You could also buy just the indoor models the outdoor models

680
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:47,936
And then you can buy

681
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:48,960
Ring gauge

682
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:49,984
Anand

683
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:51,264
I can never say

684
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,824
When an indemnitor

685
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,616
Improving speed

686
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:56,640
And that

687
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:57,408
Whole package

688
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:58,688
If you want to get everything together is

689
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,272
But the devil often does a sale

690
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:04,320
So keep an eye on

691
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:11,744
Read it if you don't want the rain gauge or the wind speed you can actually just get the weather station which is 180.

692
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:12,768
Yeah but

693
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:14,048
Weather

694
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:15,840
Oh yeah

695
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:21,728
The weather station maybe for a birthday and then you add on later at Christmas

696
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:24,544
And the devil often does sales

697
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,336
I often times get

698
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:27,872
Like $20 off

699
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:29,408
Or even $40

700
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:30,176
Softsoap

701
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:31,456
If you sign up

702
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:35,040
And this works with Madam a

703
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:40,416
And also with if this then that which is how you were tied into

704
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,208
It's at

705
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:44,256
The other option is cheaper

706
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:46,560
It looks more like a traditional weather station

707
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,120
This is the Ambien

708
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,144
Weather

709
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:51,680
WS

710
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:53,984
What E90 to a

711
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:58,336
Yeah

712
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:01,152
There's a bunch of these you can find them on Amazon

713
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:03,200
The company that makes it is called ambient weather

714
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:04,480
And

715
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:06,272
Basically the different models

716
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:07,040
Bad things

717
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:09,088
The higher-end models have solar power

718
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:09,856
Power

719
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:12,928
So you may or may not want that but you can see that

720
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,976
This is their base model

721
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:16,512
Is $170

722
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:17,792
And

723
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:19,072
It looks like a weather station

724
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:21,632
And it's got a little wind cups that will spin around

725
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:22,912
For your attendance

726
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:27,520
It's going to rain gauge

727
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:28,800
And his wife I can

728
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:31,872
So this will connect to your Wi-Fi it connects

729
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:34,688
Incense data up to Weather Underground

730
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:35,968
It also connects directly

731
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:36,992
If

732
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,552
So if you wanted to do

733
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:40,320
Your

734
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,344
Nest

735
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:43,136
You would actually tie

736
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:45,184
This weather station or the netatmo

737
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:47,488
You would set a nifft recipe

738
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:49,536
Says hey

739
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:51,840
It's the weather

740
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:52,608
Hits

741
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,144
90 degrees

742
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:55,168
Turn on

743
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:55,936
Test

744
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:56,704
2

745
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,472
80 degrees

746
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:01,056
Probably

747
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:02,848
But I don't know where you

748
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,128
So

749
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:06,176
That's how you do this

750
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:07,968
And those are the

751
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:15,136
They both work with Madam a&f so I don't think you can go wrong actually seem to get a little bit more information from the

752
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:17,440
Ambient weather one such as UV and

753
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:18,976
Heat index

754
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:23,072
Dewpoint and all that so it depends on the how into whether you really are

755
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,352
Yeah

756
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:25,376
I mean I'm fat into

757
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:26,400
Icicle

758
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:29,216
I should also mention that there are

759
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:31,008
Build it yourself weather

760
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:34,080
So if you go to like a site like SparkFun or Adafruit

761
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:35,872
Searching for weather kids

762
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:41,504
If your son is that interested in it he may want to build his own and that is completely an option it just

763
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,784
Men at Work with your smart

764
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,552
System

765
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:44,576
But

766
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:45,856
Supercuts

767
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:53,792
All right just thanks for the question and now please stay tuned for more of or and who is the CEO of versatile nature

768
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:56,352
Talking about bringing iot and AI into the

769
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:57,120
Construction

770
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:57,888
Industry

771
00:29:58,144 --> 00:30:00,192
The first a message from our sponsor

772
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,032
This week sponsor is nutanix

773
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:10,432
Hey everyone we are taking a quick break from The Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor this week sponsor is

774
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:11,200
Nutanix

775
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:14,016
And I have such a bagani here

776
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:17,088
So such an eye associate nutanix with

777
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:18,880
Hyper converged infrastructure

778
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:21,952
What is it specifically that you guys offer in the internet

779
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:27,584
It is called

780
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,608
Cirt

781
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:32,960
That allows you

782
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:35,776
Modernity application

783
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:38,336
Flextime manager

784
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:39,872
LittleBigPlanet 2

785
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:41,920
Salon central point of control

786
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:43,200
And last but not least

787
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:48,832
It enables users so do deer processing across the aisle in the clock for ID

788
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:52,928
This week let's talk about 5G and iot

789
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,464
There's so much talk about that

790
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:56,000
What do you make a follower

791
00:30:57,024 --> 00:31:01,888
5e and ideas fascinating

792
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:04,704
He's so much bandwidth

793
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,496
PlayStation

794
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:10,592
Set the Bangles between the PlayStation on the cloud is going to be the limiting factor

795
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:12,384
Open Saavn

796
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,664
Immense opportunity

797
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:17,760
Telecom providers to provide

798
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:19,040
On this IGN

799
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:21,344
Applications

800
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,392
Put on a RV

801
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:35,168
And I have two tens to be an overwhelming Undertaker

802
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:41,056
Making Arthur ways to make iot projects more accessible and successful across a wide range of ghosts

803
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:48,736
You need to put together

804
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:52,064
Dislike security and scaling

805
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,112
What we have done

806
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:58,720
Call IRT application Library

807
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:04,352
Play whenever I squeeze and its eyes so into an RDA

808
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:09,216
And this is just like all the other delivery fired

809
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:17,152
Extension into an application just like all the installed database

810
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:21,504
We want to make iot as accessible as a smartphone app

811
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,320
Is today

812
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:31,488
They want to dramatically reduced number of vendors and the number of moving parts that a customer needs to deal

813
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:39,168
Concept called The Library

814
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,704
And number two

815
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,800
We want to enable and users to instantiate dramatically

816
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:46,080
Impactful

817
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:48,896
And complicated ID applications into an

818
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:51,968
All the way from sensors to the edge to the cloud in one

819
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:56,576
Excellent if people want to find out more about nutanix where should they go

820
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:59,904
Stacy I'd like to invite you to come visit us

821
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:04,256
And sign up for the free trial

822
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:15,776
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest is

823
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:21,152
Friend who is the co-founder and CEO of versatile nature

824
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:22,944
Hi Mom how are you doing

825
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:25,504
Hey Stacy I'm doing great how are you

826
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,040
Excellent

827
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:30,112
I'm excited as I told you guys before we be talking about

828
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:36,512
The construction industry coyote there today so we're off and tell us what it is

829
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:37,280
That you guys are

830
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:38,560
I doing it versatile

831
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,352
Sure thing

832
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:41,376
Pleasure to be here

833
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:42,400
Thank you thanks for having me

834
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:44,704
Spyfall

835
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,728
Non-intrusive

836
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:46,752
Data harvesting

837
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:53,152
Technology for construction today we actually have our own iot multi-sensor device

838
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:54,944
And using appdata

839
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,224
We can actually enable

840
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,760
Better decision-making

841
00:33:58,016 --> 00:34:00,832
True understanding and control of

842
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:07,488
Possibly the most fragmented and unstructured Manufacturing floor we have ever come across which is

843
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:12,352
I love that I love the idea of thinking about construction as a Manufacturing

844
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:15,936
It feels like maybe a super stretched analogy because

845
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:17,984
One is so controlled and

846
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,776
I mean I'm used to clean rooms in Seneca

847
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,592
Construction

848
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:24,128
Maybe she'll break down

849
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:26,176
The big challenges associated with

850
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:27,200
Construction

851
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:30,784
I know there's regulation there's individual environments what else

852
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:32,064
I think the

853
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,344
One thing that sets

854
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,160
Construction parties really how many

855
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:38,976
People and trade Direction bulb

856
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:42,048
Motorcycle Factory

857
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:45,376
Controlled by a single unit World War

858
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:48,448
The same person on the same organization we're looking at

859
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,496
Different individuals reporting

860
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:53,056
Different organizations sometimes having

861
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:56,128
Someone has a different idea of the

862
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:58,688
And then you have the general contractor

863
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:02,272
Responsible for coordinating

864
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:03,296
I'm making sure

865
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:06,624
Casper turned over on time and thing back

866
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,392
Seaflo

867
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,184
To come from

868
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,208
Telephone directory

869
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,536
Trust me.

870
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:15,328
Cold environment

871
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:20,448
What we used to call machine-to-machine really works like you understand what the machines are telling you

872
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:23,520
Youku

873
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:29,664
What's a clean room

874
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:31,456
This is what we actually bring

875
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,224
New construction

876
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:35,808
That's corny knock the way things work and usually few

877
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:38,112
Gotham something wrong on Step 1

878
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:38,880
You would

879
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:41,184
Noli not be able to correct it on steps

880
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,720
But you're probably not even know

881
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:43,744
But you got it wrong

882
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:46,304
Until it's too late and the state store

883
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,096
But I don't

884
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:49,632
You think about it

885
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:50,656
It is a factory

886
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:51,936
It is a manufacturer

887
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,264
I'm demoted looking at that way

888
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,056
Des Moines we could digitize it

889
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:59,104
And actually help people

890
00:35:59,360 --> 00:35:59,872
Shein

891
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:04,992
Be better at what they do and just more done and actually got back to the kids

892
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:05,760
Safely

893
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:07,040
And earlier

894
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:11,392
Best route construction is super dangerous we don't always think about that but there are lots of

895
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:13,184
Things that could happen to cause someone to

896
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,208
Have an injury

897
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:14,976
All right

898
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:16,256
So what is the end

899
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:17,024
Product

900
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:20,096
You got this multi-purpose sensor on a crane

901
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:23,936
I assume it's measuring things that the crane is doing loads that it's taking

902
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:27,008
What is the end person and who is being person that

903
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:27,776
It's the data

904
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:34,688
Source I think one of the things that kind of makes us special is there multiple and people and they have

905
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:36,224
Different news

906
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,760
To help them understand

907
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:38,784
Tax credit

908
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,088
Or Windows 10 overs actually happen

909
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:45,952
So we take the daytime and we okay manipulated or learn

910
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:46,720
The story

911
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:49,536
To actually understand

912
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:51,840
What is really happening on the jump 5

913
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:54,144
Boys telling a relief

914
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:56,704
Diamond from the visual

915
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:58,752
Goal for us

916
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,288
Is Kraft Foods

917
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:03,360
I'll actually spend people are stupid

918
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:08,736
The safety director just need of the Daytona right now but you spend them

919
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:09,760
Curated

920
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:11,296
Messages

921
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:13,344
Usually we communicate over text

922
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,136
Is today to just

923
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:17,952
Tell them what they need to know and what they need to make

924
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:21,280
Then they can log into our interface

925
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:23,584
Can you give me an example of what one of those two

926
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,352
Text my

927
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:25,120
Looks like her sound

928
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:28,960
Yes it could be packed a

929
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:30,240
Conceited on youku

930
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:32,800
Coordinate stuff B

931
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:33,568
Call

932
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:37,152
The subcontractor for this task. Should be on site

933
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:38,688
A certain time

934
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,224
It could be

935
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,040
A simpler text that just says book time

936
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:44,832
Is being with you

937
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:47,136
And it should be about the

938
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:47,904
Hook time

939
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:52,768
Ya book time would be completely related to the crane but we do actually know

940
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:55,328
Time Warner hook right we know who's using the hook

941
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:57,120
We also know when it's not you

942
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:58,400
Or when it's for you

943
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:00,448
Sometimes

944
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:02,240
Let's talk about

945
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:07,616
The challenge because this seems the guy I like your text messages which seem

946
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:11,968
Terry appropriate for someone who's in construction but let some of the challenges

947
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:12,736
Rigging

948
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:15,296
Ai and iot into

949
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:17,088
Really what is an old line industry

950
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:22,720
What have you encountered and how did you get people excited or interested in

951
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:25,536
This technology because it's not like construction workers are

952
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:26,560
Excited about

953
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:27,584
Yeah let's go

954
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:29,376
Yeah so you'll be

955
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:35,776
Surprised I think that slowly but surely coming around you could look at it

956
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:36,800
Showing

957
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:37,568
Call Greg

958
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:41,664
In terms of the approaching the Treehouse to technology and what is Karachi

959
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,432
She do for them

960
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:43,712
But you're right there

961
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:46,016
An industry where

962
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:47,040
Based on

963
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:48,320
Incredible professional

964
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:50,624
MJ can get the job done

965
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,952
I think part of my understanding or my

966
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:54,720
Coach

967
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:55,744
Today no fee

968
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,328
I totally come from the fact that I grew up in the fingers.

969
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:03,424
Do people feel really connected to them to Simply say

970
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:09,824
We don't necessarily know exactly where the value is for you so let's go on this journey together

971
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:12,896
Change too much

972
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:14,432
Or technology tracks

973
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:15,200
Tibia labeled

974
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:18,784
If we could just gather data without asking

975
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:20,320
Imports

976
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:25,440
And if we could then as I said cut through the noise and give them what they need

977
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:26,720
Pure

978
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:27,488
Volume

979
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:30,048
Measure at the end of the day

980
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:31,584
I think that's the right approach for

981
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,352
What's ecology

982
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:34,656
Construction

983
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:36,448
And this is how you use sensor

984
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:39,776
How you don't ask people to record and Report

985
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:41,312
Aai's how you actually

986
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:45,408
Becreateful incredible inside Fender fast learning.

987
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:50,784
Incredible as the people aren't they can see and be everywhere

988
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:54,112
If we can help them actually know where they are

989
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:54,880
In the process

990
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:55,904
And What needs

991
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,976
To happen next and what's missing then you're helpful

992
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:01,792
I think jelly our coaching the way

993
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:04,608
I personally look at the industry

994
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:05,888
Exactly.

995
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:09,472
Stay out of the professional way and a Dilaudid value

996
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:15,872
Anderson paak ichnology will actually filter in and find its place in the incredibly professional

997
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:22,784
And I think that's an important thing to think about I think a lot of companies are approaching this space get very enamored of there

998
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:27,904
Technology and they forget about how to deliver it to the people who have to deal with the information

999
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,208
And this idea that you're

1000
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:35,072
You're going to like bring technology and disrupt an industry seems maybe not the right

1001
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:35,840
Croach

1002
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:37,376
As opposed to saying

1003
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:44,032
Hey I can make your life easier and you won't have to change part of your process so and curious if there other things

1004
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:45,312
Things other than saying hey

1005
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:47,872
You're not going to change your process for this

1006
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:49,408
Help

1007
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:50,944
Make it easier

1008
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,528
To bring in something new to a very old-school industry

1009
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,832
I think it starts with this approach

1010
00:40:57,088 --> 00:41:02,208
I'm sure it doesn't help when you're not totally in love with your technology but actually in love with adding value

1011
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:04,512
Well it's not about asking

1012
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:07,584
Change like they would just pick them up at 1

1013
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,376
It's about what is it that they're getting

1014
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:10,912
How is this help

1015
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:11,936
Right now

1016
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:14,240
Because one other thing about this industry is

1017
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:16,288
Alcoa intermediate

1018
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:19,104
Why is calculated in so many different ways

1019
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,920
Tricky questions

1020
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:23,968
So when you did all right

1021
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:24,992
Honestly

1022
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:27,552
In my view right now what the technology needs

1023
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:28,576
To do is

1024
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:29,344
Make

1025
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,112
People

1026
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:30,880
Shein

1027
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:36,000
If we could get everyone better what they do that we want everyone

1028
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:37,536
That's my

1029
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:40,608
And speaking of Technology

1030
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:41,632
And disruption

1031
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:45,984
I think what's interesting is there's this idea in construction that

1032
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,032
At the exciting thing to look at is

1033
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:49,056
Robots

1034
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:51,104
Build a wall or

1035
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:54,175
3D printed houses and we see a lot about that

1036
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:55,711
As opposed to what you guys are

1037
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:57,759
So I'm curious where

1038
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,551
What you're doing fits in with like

1039
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:02,111
The future of construction

1040
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:04,415
And maybe how those other things fit in

1041
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:08,767
The brain understanding

1042
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:11,839
Process that makes somebody fashion floor

1043
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:13,375
Next few valuable

1044
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:14,911
Pretty much no matter what

1045
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:21,311
Evolution actually happen I would also say your every technology has its place and things will

1046
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:22,591
Fishing to play

1047
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:23,871
Right now

1048
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:24,895
Empowering

1049
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:26,431
People making

1050
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:27,967
Everyone do

1051
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:28,991
More

1052
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:31,295
It's just not the same time with

1053
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:32,319
The same resources

1054
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:33,599
I think work

1055
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:35,903
Technology on all its kind of

1056
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:39,743
Shades and colors should go definitely where we're going and powering

1057
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:41,023
A good place

1058
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:41,791
Start

1059
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:43,071
We do

1060
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:44,863
See an issue

1061
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:47,167
Construction would come to

1062
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:48,191
Recruiting

1063
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:51,519
Newman power in today in between I think the college as a

1064
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:52,799
Volta play there too

1065
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:56,127
Other than the fact that the younger generation probably likes

1066
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:58,687
To feed the industry word of working

1067
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:01,247
Having more technology it's also about

1068
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:03,039
What automation

1069
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:09,439
Can be done I look is not necessarily what

1070
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:11,743
Oil companies out there that are looking to automate

1071
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:12,511
The

1072
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:15,583
Color of low-hanging fruit where there are issues

1073
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:18,143
Injecting labour

1074
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:21,727
I think every technology as I said we'll probably find it

1075
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:24,287
Play being the brains behind

1076
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:25,823
It's all and

1077
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:26,847
Extremely

1078
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:28,639
Supporting to the people

1079
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:29,407
What

1080
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:30,431
Ricardo

1081
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:38,111
And that makes sense and I do think we're going to see an interesting shift in the next few years in the workforce

1082
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:44,511
As we bring more AI in most companies I talked to they want to hire people who are eight

1083
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:45,791
Able to make decisions

1084
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:48,351
Based on having access to

1085
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:49,631
More data

1086
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:54,751
And that means we're going to see hopefully more skilled workers and workers that are trained up

1087
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:56,031
To deal with this order

1088
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:57,055
Mustang individually

1089
00:43:58,335 --> 00:44:00,639
The one thing I would agree with you is the

1090
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:02,943
Daily non-skilled non-traded

1091
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:06,527
People that are sometimes there just to cover I guess

1092
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:08,575
Or the shortage in labor

1093
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:11,647
This is I think we're going to Safety House bigger

1094
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:14,719
Bicycle doctor killed people

1095
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:15,743
Professional

1096
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:19,327
I've been doing this for years those are the ones that I would be

1097
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:20,607
Stray dog

1098
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:21,631
I would either

1099
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:26,495
Train to be professionals or coulombic technology to help solve that problem

1100
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:33,407
And hopefully by saving money in terms of preventing delays or things like that you

1101
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:34,431
You can actually pay these p

1102
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:35,967
People cuz I know part of it is just

1103
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:36,991
Hey

1104
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:41,599
Having some cheap labor around is always lovely but skilled labor is more expensive so

1105
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:43,903
Maybe that's where the cost start patching up

1106
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:50,559
Let's talk about how you do this because you got this multi-purpose sensor I know I've talked to other companies who are

1107
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:51,583
Trying to

1108
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:55,679
Add intelligence to the construction industry and their using lots of cameras and

1109
00:44:55,935 --> 00:45:02,079
Haven just didn't interview just a few weeks ago with someone actually in the chip industry and they were talking about how cameras are the most relevant

1110
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:04,383
Iot sensor and everyone should be using them

1111
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:08,735
And I think you have a little bit of a different opinion here so I'd love to hear your take on

1112
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:12,575
Cameras as part of the Industrial iot in

1113
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:14,367
How you're using them in

1114
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:15,135
Maybe

1115
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:16,927
Why you're relying on other sensors

1116
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:21,279
Sure thing I guess I have a different or slightly different take

1117
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:25,631
Amazing

1118
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:29,471
Specific role to play with other than being the sole

1119
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:31,263
Data

1120
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:35,615
I think what it comes to feeding AI systems while you're using

1121
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:39,711
Visual recognition to connect only it just takes longer to learn

1122
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:43,039
And much longer to add value world

1123
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:47,135
Our approach with a multi sensor direction is

1124
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:48,927
We have so much

1125
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:55,327
Using terms of theta long before we even look at the camera and that enable

1126
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:57,119
Police officer learning

1127
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:59,167
What comes to Ai and machine learning

1128
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:00,959
We could probably do things

1129
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:03,263
10 times faster so it's a different approach

1130
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:06,847
But I think when you start utilizing more than just cameras

1131
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:07,871
When you could

1132
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:09,919
Dive higher value to your

1133
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:12,735
Factor Garden camera

1134
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:14,271
At all we do

1135
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:16,063
As I said

1136
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:18,367
I just don't think of the Soul

1137
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:19,647
Send for it is

1138
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:23,743
Incredibly valuable and some people with argue

1139
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:28,607
It sounds like if you're using just a camera it's going to take you a little bit longer to get the data uni

1140
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,911
The flipside is you only have one sensor to deal

1141
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:33,215
Curious actually 4matic

1142
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:33,983
Perspective

1143
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:36,543
Getting this onto a construction site

1144
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:40,639
What are the technology challenges of putting your

1145
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:44,735
Sensor package on the crane and then making sure it has connectivity in that sort of

1146
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:47,807
A challenge for you guys or is that pretty much salt

1147
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:50,111
I believe we can smoke.

1148
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:51,135
How did you sell

1149
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:57,279
Mixology I'll be talking about

1150
00:46:57,791 --> 00:47:02,143
Stanley we're not experiencing connectivity issues

1151
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:03,423
Our device

1152
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:04,191
Sandpoint

1153
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:06,751
Just so many ways to go about

1154
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:08,031
Conductivity

1155
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:12,127
I'll say wifi-only. One of them being so I can't

1156
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:14,943
Overwhelming probably all our customers

1157
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:16,991
Stop.

1158
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:19,551
Have not been one of our challenge

1159
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:22,111
What has been one of your Channel

1160
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:29,023
We've had plenty just as I got were talking about and a challenging the industry with

1161
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:30,047
Harsh conditions

1162
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:32,095
Making sure you actually have

1163
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:36,447
The robustness that you need to actually face the challenges of a jump bike

1164
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:38,751
One thing that we had to tackle

1165
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:43,359
Extremely early I just getting this to be with you

1166
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:45,663
Something that people don't look up and say what

1167
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:46,687
Is that

1168
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:47,711
It probably takes

1169
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:49,503
Left in the day now for the

1170
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:52,063
On the job site

1171
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:54,367
Nothing absolutely no special attention

1172
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:56,927
Okay make it HF.

1173
00:47:58,207 --> 00:47:58,719
Got it

1174
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:01,023
What's in by talking about

1175
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:03,071
The future of construction

1176
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:05,375
So let's visit a job site

1177
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:06,143
In

1178
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:08,959
I don't know five years and then maybe 10 years item

1179
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:10,495
Pick your favorite time frame in

1180
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:13,823
Tell me what you think or how you think this is going to operate

1181
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:15,359
From the people

1182
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:17,407
That are involved all the way to

1183
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:18,687
The centers are

1184
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:20,735
I don't know cameras whatever robots

1185
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:23,551
And the types of information that are going to be

1186
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:24,319
Babe

1187
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:26,111
Oh wow

1188
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:31,231
Probably 10 more than 5 years those things are rapidly advancing

1189
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:33,023
I have said before I'll

1190
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:34,303
Please play again

1191
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:35,071
You

The job site

1193
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:42,751
Future almost Intel clean room and you would laugh right

1194
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:44,287
Right now

1195
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:46,847
Anymore

1196
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:48,127
Data flowing

1197
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:49,407

People empowered

1201
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:55,807
To make decisions on the Fly

1202
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:57,599
Call Delancey have access

1203
00:48:58,623 --> 00:48:59,647
And overall

1204
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:01,183
Control

1205
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:02,975
On Manufacturing

1206
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:05,535
So what you think about production control and coffee

1207
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:08,351
Alder Faye Advance Pro

1208
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:10,655
Where to find Apache

1209
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:13,471
Same amount

1210
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:14,239
People

1211
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:19,615
Just getting a lot more done the industry needs to actually address the growing did not

1212
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:21,919
We could use that exact

1213
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:24,223
Same number of resources to

1214
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:25,247
Double

1215
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:26,527
The productivity

1216
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:31,903
That would be an incredible achievement I think a lot of them a lot of people in it

1217
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:32,927
We will not see

1218
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:36,255
Your keyboard fuel resources will just be

1219
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:38,559
Dramatically improve productivity

1220
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:40,351
Yeah $60

1222
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:46,239
How data flows and how decisions be made

1223
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:48,031
Okie dokie track cheap

1224
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:49,311
Control

1225
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:51,615
I said that analogy

1226
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:53,663
As a former chip reporter I even

1227
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:54,431
I embrace it

1228
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:55,711
Alright

1229
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:58,271
Thank you so much for coming on the show this week

1230
00:49:58,527 --> 00:49:59,295
I really appreciate it

1231
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:01,599
Thanks for having me stay Stadium

1232
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:07,999
That's it for this week thanks

1233
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:14,399
How much for listening and remember if you'd like more iot news sign up for my newsletter and Stacey on iot
