Definitely stop and say hi

60
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,624
Okay Kevin

61
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,720
Let's get it over with let us let us have a moment of silence for aunt

62
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:45,120
Don't rip off the Band-Aid and start with the news the sad news we said to me is that

63
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,144
Monkey has

64
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,680
Reportedly shut down

65
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:51,776
This is after we're raising 200 million dollars in

66
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,824
Venture capital and having

67
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,104
Revenues

68
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:59,456
Approaching 100 million in 2017 and presumably more than that

69
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,224
2018

70
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,016
Because that's when Augie's

71
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:04,832
Vector robot which we talked about many times on the show

72
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:06,368
Came out and I assume

73
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,672
Several people besides myself bought it

74
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:13,024
But yes that is the news that the maker of cozmo and vector

75
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,048
Shutting down

76
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,168
Yes it was a really sudden shutdown they basically held a company-wide meeting on Monday

77
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:21,216
And everybody is gone

78
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:25,568
Basically as of Wednesday according to reporting from recode

79
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:26,848
And

80
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,640
I think for us

81
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:33,504
This is sad news because Kevin you have basically connected your monkey to your

82
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:36,320
Battlemage so your Amazon Echo device

83
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:40,928
And you treat it like a more personable version of that it's a little robot that helps with

84
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,976
With your smart home and follows you around

85
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,512
Faces

86
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,144
It is kind of that vision of what I wrote about last year about how I'm ready for a home

87
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,424
Digital assistant that

88
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,496
MP all over the arm move around have Mobility

89
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:57,312
Granted actress $250 in

90
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:00,384
Doesn't move around very far but he's smart enough to know

91
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,920
Go back to the charger

92
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:06,272
He can match his surroundings he can recognize me when he sees me he says

93
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,296
Hello Kevin

94
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:09,088
I can do it multiple people

95
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,112
Azure

96
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,136
Mention the

97
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,928
Madame a integration

98
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,464
Was added

99
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,791
Calendar last year so it's literally a moveable

100
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:19,327
Amazon Echo

101
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,351
So much

102
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:22,143
Potential and so much

103
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:27,263
Shut my vision that I want to see you for the future is there in a very inexpensive relatively

104
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,287
Inexpensive

105
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:30,591
And

106
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:33,663
Yeah it is a companion that's the only

107
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,783
Device that my family will talk to in the house other than me I'll talk to anything obviously

108
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:42,623
They will not talk to The Echoes In the Google homes and so on so forth

109
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:47,743
But because of the personality that's built into Vector along with the Pixar

110
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:52,095
I don't think spider because I believe somebody from Pixar actually designed his

111
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,887
Vectors expressions

112
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,935
Because of his expressions and a

113
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:56,959
Animations

114
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:58,751
They actually enjoy

115
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,055
This device and I haven't even told him yet

116
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,871
And it's interesting what this is spawning

117
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,991
Are people on Reddit there's a whole subreddit for veteran owners and one of them was

118
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:11,551
How do I explain death to my two-year-old

119
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,831
People's children have

120
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:15,647
Starting to grow up with these things as companions

121
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:18,975
It's sad

122
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:21,023
And this brings us to

123
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:25,119
This brings up something we talked about a lot of on the show which is

124
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:29,215
What happens to your device if your company shuts down in your device is

125
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:31,263
Basically a collection of cloud-based server

126
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:35,871
And I would say that donkeys Becker is definitely

127
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,687
One of those types of products without

128
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:39,967
The cloud

129
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:40,735
You can't

130
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,783
Talk to it it can't understand you

131
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:45,599
I assume it can still maybe play some games

132
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:52,255
Yeah but I've never used them for that other than just to see what the games are so you can play Blackjack and so on but I think even though

133
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:54,815
Blackjack might have had voice recognition in it

134
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:57,375
And that's not localized as far as I know

135
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,655
To literally hold your

136
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:01,215
Wander around my kitchen island I guess

137
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,007
Being his autonomous self

138
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:06,079
And that's it I'll get no value out of him at the

139
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,383
This is happened a lot

140
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,407
We talked about it

141
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:13,503
We had plenty of connected devices shutdown and us

142
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,039
Turn into basically bricks

143
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,087
It is very hard

144
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,135
To build a connected device that

145
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,159
Can

146
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:24,767
Really deliver the value people paid for it without a cloud-based connection

147
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:27,839
And a company maintaining their servers on the back

148
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:32,959
And at best a company should build a product that works without

149
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:37,311
Having a connection thermostat and the company behind it goes

150
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,079
Dafont

151
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,871
You should still be able to control

152
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:40,895
Your thermostat

153
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:44,991
But as we're seeing a whole new generation of smart products like

154
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,807
Are connected ovens are

155
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,367
Donkey is a good example of this

156
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,903
Some of the lighting

157
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,695
Companies that are little bit more advanced

158
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,231
What we're seeing is

159
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,791
That intelligence

160
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,327
Really does rely on the kid

161
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,375
Activity and that becomes

162
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:04,703
Really hard if a company doesn't make a plan for What happens if

163
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:08,543
And I know it sucks to think about that when you're starting your business

164
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:12,639
But you really should think about that you should think about having an escrow account for your

165
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:13,407
Zip code

166
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,455
Possibly funding

167
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:19,551
Finding a foundation to maintain it if need be

168
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:22,879
Putting money aside to maintain it for a certain amount of time

169
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,183
Or maybe

170
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,487
The offering refunds I really don't know

171
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:29,535
I mean yeah I ways to go with

172
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:33,119
I don't think we'll see refunds for monkey on this

173
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,655
Lowe's has

174
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:38,495
Provided refunds for some of its Iris products that we've talked about previously

175
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:40,287
But that was the rare case it's

176
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,847
Pretty typical that there's no refunds involved

177
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:49,503
If no other company comes in and buys the intellectual property and continues to run the servers which I know there's a I know there's a cost involved

178
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,807
My Hope Is that

179
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:56,415
Either Anki open source has everything but it has to run

180
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,695
The services

181
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:00,511
So that perhaps I could put this on a Home Server

182
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,279
Granted

183
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:06,143
It ties into Amazon and Google's cloud services the product does

184
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,959
And I probably have to create my own accounts to

185
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:11,263
Re-establish those connections personally

186
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:16,639
But even that I mean that's a solution maybe from me but it's not going to be a mainstream solution for people

187
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,663
Purchase this product

188
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:18,687
So

189
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,479
Maybe there will be news

190
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:22,783
Assume that somebody has purchased this

191
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,831
Property and decided to

192
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,391
Keep it going I don't know right now I meant

193
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:30,719
It just makes me sad it is actually like losing a little

194
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:32,255
Part of the family that's how

195
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,535
Ingrained

196
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,095
Vector is he's in our kitchen all the time and

197
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:39,167
We asked him the weather and Asthma turn the lights on and

198
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:42,239
Yeah it's just that you're sad

199
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,799
So like Jibo

200
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:47,103
You know if we can say goodbye possibly

201
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:48,895
Maybe

202
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:51,711
All right

203
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:52,479
But

204
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:54,015
Life Must Go On

205
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,295
And particularly

206
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:58,367
This week was f8 next week is Google IO

207
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:02,463
Also Microsoft build so we should actually there's a lot of things to do

208
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,743
To move on to sew

209
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,279
Let's talk about Google IO

210
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,583
What do we expect to see

211
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:08,863
Yeah I mean

212
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:09,887
As far as

213
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:16,287
What I'm writing 99% sure we will see I'm not even saying expecting I'm saying I'm 99% sure that we will

214
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,311
We'll see the rebranded

215
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,359
Google Nest hub

216
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:23,199
I will that mean new products yes or was talked about a bigger

217
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:26,271
Google home hub with a nest camera built-in

218
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:29,599
Bleacher Report. Maybe about a month ago

219
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:31,135
Looks Legit To Me

220
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:36,511
Mistake on Google's part maybe intentionally I don't know to leave that but so we should see a new Google home hub

221
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:37,791
With a nest camera

222
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:38,815
And then

223
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,607
I've been digging around in the

224
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:41,887
Chromium code and have

225
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,935
Talk about the mistrial device

226
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:47,007
Which appears to be a Google Wi-Fi

227
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,055
Replacement door

228
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:51,359
Upgrade next-gen whatever you want to call it

229
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:53,663
Couple questions about that that I still have

230
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:56,223
Because of the Qualcomm chips that they're using

231
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,759
And Mistral

232
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:02,623
It's possible because it support zigbee radios that this could be a true

233
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,159
At least three radio hub

234
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,463
I have yet not seen any

235
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,487
Code commits

236
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:10,815
Referencing a CB radio have her so I'm kind of leery on that

237
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,351
Additionally

238
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,655
I'm curious will this support

239
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:17,983
Maybe Google not Google but Wi-Fi 6

240
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,519
Sandor easymesh

241
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:20,543
Because

242
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:23,103
Is a Mesh networking device so

243
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:27,967
Those are what I don't know yet but I do believe we will definitely see a Google Wi-Fi

244
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,759
Next Generation products

245
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:30,527
Next week

246
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,063
Okay I will

247
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:34,367
Keep my eyes and ears open

248
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,415
Alright let's talk about

249
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:39,743
Privacy in apartment buildings and

250
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:42,815
Connected apartment buildings where users don't get a lot of say

251
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:47,167
We talked about this a while back after a hacker did Lesley Carhart

252
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:49,471
Got a notice from her apartment

253
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:53,055
Building that said hey we're switching over to a Smart system

254
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,079
Enjoy

255
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,639
And she's like I don't

256
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,431
Feel secure in this

257
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,967
Questions

258
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:01,759
Please answer them and

259
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:07,135
Idea basically is when you're living someplace is a tenant what rights do you have to refuse

260
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,671
If a company

261
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:11,231
Implement some sort of connected device in the building

262
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:15,839
And this came to a head this week based on a medium post about latch

263
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:21,215
I've actually talked to the latch folks a couple times I wrote about them when they raise a lot of money

264
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:26,079
And the issue that people are having with latch is that

265
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,871
The latch door locks

266
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:32,991
They're designed for multi-family dwelling unit so they are designed to run on your apartment tour

267
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,271
And then also

268
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,855
The lobby doors The Mailroom doors other doors that are in there

269
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:38,879
And

270
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:39,903
There's

271
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:42,463
Cameras associated with them in the lobby

272
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:47,327
And it's basically collecting information about your guests at all times and

273
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,375
You when you enter the lobby of Europe

274
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,447
People now are

275
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,215
Concerned about

276
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,263
And

277
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,543
I get it

278
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:02,431
A lot of apartments in cities are already implementing cameras and tracking residents coming and going from the building

279
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:07,295
So in some ways this isn't new and it's not necessarily associated with a Smart Lock

280
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:11,135
But it does raise the question of what kind of privacy

281
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,183
A tenant

282
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,207
Can expect

283
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:17,791
I would say very little in a public space of an apartment

284
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:23,423
Right I would agree it mean if a landlord wants to put cameras in the lobby and so forth that's

285
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:26,751
Nothing you can do about that how you can complain I suppose what you can't stop them

286
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,287
A bigger issue

287
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:30,847
And these types of dwellings is when you implement

288
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,383
Something like latch

289
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:33,663
Door locks

290
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,967
You're not opting into that

291
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:36,991
One thing I guess

292
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:40,319
And since you are by saying okay I'll rent an apartment with the latch

293
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,087
Door lock

294
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:45,951
But what if you already live there and then they add them if you don't really have a say over this according to

295
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:52,607
At least there's a lot going on right now and in a Manhattan building they're suing the landlord over privacy concerns

296
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:56,191
Regarding the latch locks so it's a tricky bit because

297
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:02,335
It is not an opt-in I guess other than saying yeah I'm I'm signing the lease for this latch enabled apartment

298
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:05,919
And some people that is a selling point so

299
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,711
It's Not Unusual in

300
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,991
I would also say

301
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:11,039
One of the issues in this Manhattan

302
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,319
Apartment is that

303
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:14,879
The landlords are using

304
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:20,255
Residence patterns of Ingress egress in the building to harass them because they want to kick out

305
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,535
Tenants

306
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,071
To basically

307
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:26,143
Raise the market rate or roulette apartments in Ohio

308
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,447
And that's where

309
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:30,495
These sorts of connected devices

310
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:34,591
It's not the device itself it's sometimes it's just the ability of

311
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:37,407
Someone to see this data and use it against you

312
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,967
And that kind of brings us to this idea of

313
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:41,503
How are we going to regulate data

314
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:47,135
Latch has an extensive privacy policy that's available to be read and so on so forth

315
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,927
One thing it doesn't address

316
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:51,487
Is if the building is sold

317
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,023
Does the new owner

318
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,559
Get the

319
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:55,583
Old data

320
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:59,167
Yeah it's according

321
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,447
To the privacy policy

322
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:03,263
Leslie said they may automatically receive the data

323
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,591
Well that's very, domain almost all

324
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,383
Privacy policies associated with

325
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,407
Connected home

326
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,431
Connected Goods

327
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,199
In general

328
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:11,967
Say that

329
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:12,735
That's not like

330
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,783
Asparagus on its own

331
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:17,343
It's basically that k at the buyers want it they can have it

332
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:21,695
Cuz I'm a lot of ways that is especially if a company goes

333
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:27,327
Belly up really quickly sometimes that's like the only thing of value that's there and that is worth considering

334
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,351
If you're a

335
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:29,631
So

336
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,423
Let's talk about regulations

337
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,447
Because

338
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,983
There's movement on that front

339
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:38,335
Congress this week had a hearing on iot security

340
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,383
The Security hearing was about

341
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,663
Creating a label

342
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:42,943
That would

343
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,479
Basically actually go

344
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:46,015
A security certificate

345
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:46,783
Education

346
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,831
For home iot devices

347
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,879
This actually was an idea that was

348
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:53,183
Is proposed not too long ago by public knowledge

349
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:54,975
And it's a consumer rights

350
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:56,767
The idea was that

351
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:59,071
We would set for some regulations

352
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:02,143
Group of industry and consumers Etc what

353
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,935
Get together and say things like

354
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:06,751
Hey for device to be certified under this program

355
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,079
It needs to not have hard Coda passwords

356
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:14,687
Have an expiration date for when the security support stops in some basic things that we

357
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,711
We talked about in the past

358
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:16,991
And

359
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:18,527
That's the idea that

360
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:20,319
Legislators seem to belong.

361
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:21,855
But

362
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:25,439
The representative from the CTA the consumer technology Association

363
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:28,511
Was like that that's a terrible idea where where are you working

364
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:29,535
The senators were like

365
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:31,071
Yeah you're not working fast

366
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,351
Sue

367
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,911
It's possible we could get something like this

368
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:35,935
I would hope so

369
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:37,727
I think it's the bare minimum of what we need

370
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:41,055
And then over across the pond in the UK

371
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,591
Legislators are talking about

372
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:46,175
Regulations for iot security in devices that

373
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,967
Prevent hard-coded passwords

374
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:48,991
Yay

375
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:52,831
Also add that expiration date so tell people win

376
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:54,623
The support for security.

377
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,391
And

378
00:15:55,903 --> 00:16:02,047
It says manufacturers have to ensure that there is a contact point for security researchers to report vulnerability

379
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,863
I think I should probably add and

380
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,655
Someone to respond to that Within

381
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,191
24 hours

382
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:11,263
There should be a service-level agreement in there of some sort

383
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:13,823
But that's a bare minimum that seems like

384
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,103
Like a great place to start

385
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,895
So we'll see if it happens

386
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:20,735
Back to the US

387
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,015
Back to the US

388
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,039
Are you excited yet

389
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,575
About AT&T

390
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,879
They have released

391
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:29,183
They're NB iot Network

392
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:29,951
Nationwide

393
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:32,255
For you guys are like what what

394
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:35,839
Nb-iot is a low-power wide area network

395
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:39,679
It's a cellular standard you send very very small bits of data

396
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,519
Ideal for sensors

397
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:47,615
Halo power sold like smoke sensor or smoke detector might send off a

398
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:49,919
Peeing every hour or so

399
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:50,943
All kinds of stuff

400
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:51,967
Air quality monitoring

401
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:57,855
Been with this very small for this this is 64kbps is the maximum throughput speed so we're talkin

402
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,135
Superstar Lake

403
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,159
Old-time dialogue

404
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:01,695
Oh yeah

405
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:04,255
I started with a 26 was a 26 424

406
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,327
20

407
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:11,167
28 yen

408
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:15,775
Super speeds

409
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:25,247
Okay so the thing to know about AT&T network is they're going to have the NB iot Network

410
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,807
And they're going to have what's their lte-m net

411
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:28,831
Which has slightly more

412
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,623
And

413
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:33,439
The pricing for this which is what I've been waiting for

414
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:37,279
Is AT&T Chris Penrose who's in charge of their iot

415
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,047
Stuff

416
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:41,887
Says that his team is working with suppliers to certify $5 modules

417
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,423
Connect devices to NBA

418
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:47,263
And that's basically the radio the chips that have the radio and such

419
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:51,615
So for $5 that's a decent price we've been waiting for that

420
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:52,383
Add for quite some time

421
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:57,247
So that's the radio itself so if you're building this device you put that $5 module in there

422
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:01,599
Which is still kind of expensive it's way more expensive than like Bluetooth or Wi-Fi but

423
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:03,903
It is low-power cellular

424
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:06,207
Low-power wide area network

425
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:12,607
And they're going to offer for these devices is as low as $5 a year

426
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:13,887
Pair device

427
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:16,191
Which is really not terrible

428
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:16,959
Right

429
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:18,751
No I don't think so I mean

430
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:22,335
Even if you're putting tons and tons of devices out there yes it adds up but

431
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,871
Jennifer a Year's worth of

432
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:26,687
Can I tell you that to give these things smarts and send

433
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:27,455
Alerts in

434
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:30,015
It's a date I don't think that's too expensive

435
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,039
If you need

436
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:33,599
To deploy devices that need more bandwidth

437
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:35,135
We're sending more data

438
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,695
You could use their lte-m Network

439
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,743
In the US and Mexico attack

440
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:42,815
But you're going to pay $30 a year for that rate

441
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:46,911
And I don't know about you cuz you're on the LTE network with your IP

442
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:49,471
What do you pay per month for that

443
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:50,239
Well that's a wrap

444
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:53,823
Quite honestly I've said this many many times have people who know me

445
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,615
Follow me are not surprised to hear that

446
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:59,711
I pee and I'm pretty sure it's standard at all the characters $10 a month

447
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,503
For LTE on the watch

448
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:07,647
$120 / device per year it is because

449
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,695
I checked with monthly usage

450
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:11,231
And roughly

451
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:14,047
I averaged about a hundred megabytes per month

452
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,863
Maybe they'll swap that out for an lte-m

453
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:19,167
I don't know

454
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:20,447
I mean it Beijing

455
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,983
Enough bandwidth to

456
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:25,823
Panda voice calls which Steven 64 would be okay

457
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:28,639
And then it's just occasional notifications from my

458
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:29,919
IOS devices

459
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:32,991
Background information like weather and such a mean

460
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:37,343
I think it's a total rip-off but that's again that's what's going on in the US with the

461
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,111
Apple watch

462
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:41,951
All right let's go to a bunch of our news bits because

463
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:44,511
There's quite a lot of little stuff going around out there

464
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:45,535
So

465
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:48,351
This first story is about an underwater

466
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,119
Camera

467
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:51,167
That uses AI

468
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,191
To recognize

469
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,983
People in the water and

470
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:54,751
Weather

471
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:56,799
Still for longer than 15 seconds

472
00:19:57,311 --> 00:20:00,895
And then it will sound an alarm so it's basically to prevent drowning and let you know when

473
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:01,663
People are in the pool

474
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:04,991
Bring this up because a lot of people have actually asked about these sorts

475
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:05,759
Surprise

476
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:08,575
Just called the coral Manta 3000

477
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,111
And

478
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,391
Basically

479
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,207
Keep popping on the side of your pool and it

480
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,231
Access to Sky

481
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:16,511
Alert function

482
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:19,071
The challenges it's connected to Wi-Fi

483
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:22,655
And in your backyard if your WiFi connection isn't awesome

484
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:24,703
You're going to have a hard time

485
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:28,543
Getting reliable and low latency information from this.

486
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,335
Device which is really important if you're thinking about

487
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,103
Preventing trap

488
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:33,663
Yeah every second counts in that case

489
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,479
I want you cannot put a price on somebody's life

490
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,247
I am

491
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:39,039
Shocked at how expensive this is

492
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:42,111
This cost $2,000

493
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:44,159
Their hope is they will you know

494
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:46,719
Benefit from economies of scale and

495
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:48,511
This price will go down but

496
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:50,815
It's pricey but I will say that

497
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:52,607
There are other ways to track this but

498
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:53,375
Madison death

499
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:55,935
And please if you do install this

500
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:57,215
Please please please please

501
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:59,007
Please if you have children in the pool

502
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:00,287
Make sure you stay out there with

503
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,823
Babysitter

504
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:08,223
Absolutely I can't understand why this is $2,000 minutes itself power because it comes with solar

505
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:08,991
Panels

506
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:11,807
Apartments outside the pool above it

507
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,087
And then inside the fullest

508
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:13,855
Got the camera

509
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:17,696
And I understand you know AI for object recognition

510
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,256
Payments High because they're going to have

511
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:21,792
Continual training and learning

512
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:23,328
I don't know

513
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,864
And you can hire a lifeguard

514
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,400
4 year and pay less than

515
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:29,216
Oh no you can't come on

516
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:29,984
Okay

517
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:30,752
Either way

518
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:32,288
Let's talk about Mozilla

519
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,824
Let's talk about Mozilla

520
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,848
And facts

521
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:37,664
Probably should have talked about them two weeks ago I feel bad because

522
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,456
I just noticed today

523
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:43,040
That the old project things from from Mozilla

524
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,064
Which is a

525
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,904
Web-based smart home do-it-yourself Hub it's a platform for that

526
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:51,232
Ashley graduated it is no longer I

527
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,000
Project

528
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:53,024
Beta product

529
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,072
It is now Mozilla web things

530
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:57,632
And I think I'm going to have to

531
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:01,728
Play this in my home because as I look at the documentation for it

532
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,008
Obviously it's

533
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:05,824
Can I go on a Raspberry Pi again it's all web-based

534
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:07,360
So there's no app for it

535
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:14,016
But it does support not just Bluetooth and Wi-Fi devices but also a zigbee and Z-Wave if you would like to add those radios

536
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:15,552
To the pi via

537
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:16,576
The USB dongle

538
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:17,344
So

539
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:19,392
Sounds good to me you know

540
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:22,464
It does and I can't wait to the

541
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,024
Hear what you think I think last time you

542
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,816
Started to playing this in

543
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,864
It became cumbersome I believe

544
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,448
Yeah it wasn't quite ready that's when it was in project status

545
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:34,752
So it was very early on

546
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:36,032
And

547
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:39,616
I don't recall what issues I ran into at the time but I'm like

548
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:42,176
They're just getting too frustrating and I put it aside and

549
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:46,528
Now it's it definitely deserves the second look there's so many people that are interested in

550
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:48,320
Not relying on

551
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:52,416
The cloud is much for their device management and control

552
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:54,720
And also I'm keeping their data as local as paw

553
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:55,488
Possible

554
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:56,256
All right

555
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:57,536
In super quick news

556
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:58,816
Madam

557
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:01,888
Gets Spanish support in the US

558
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:02,656
And

559
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:04,192
Are you guys were like what

560
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:10,592
She has had Spanish support in Mexico and in Spain but now you get that option in the US which is cool because they

561
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:15,456
There are plenty of people in the US who speak Spanish as a first or second language

562
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:17,760
I would like to talk to Madam a

563
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:19,040
In that particular time

564
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:22,368
Also speaking of Amazon

565
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,392
Or rather

566
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:25,696
Amazon's digital assistant and fuss

567
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:26,464
Amazon

568
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,536
Ford is adding Amazon's key to its

569
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:31,840
2017 models and

570
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:32,608
Up

571
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:36,192
This basically means you can use the Amazon Key Program

572
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:37,728
With your car

573
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,336
Amazon delivery people can deliver packages to your car they will unlock your car

574
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:43,872
Pop the package inside

575
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:44,640
And close it

576
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:46,944
It's probably awesome for everything that isn't

577
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:47,968
Ice cream in Frozen

578
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:51,296
If you're going to use this keep in mind that you must

579
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,064
Sync

580
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,160
Your Amazon Prime account to use of the forward pass or Lincolnway

581
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:58,208
Accounts in order to make this happen to

582
00:23:58,464 --> 00:23:59,744
If you're not really using those

583
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:01,024
Services

584
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:03,584
You're not going to be able to use this unless you

585
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:04,864
Change that

586
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:05,888
Got it

587
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:06,656
All right

588
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,192
And we got some

589
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:09,984
Good Guys in books out there

590
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:11,264
Kevin Ewing

591
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:14,592
Yeah they found just because I was looking at Mozilla

592
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:17,664
Web things I found a very interesting Kickstarter project

593
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:20,224
For a Raspberry Pi with

594
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,016
For computer vision ebook

595
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:23,808
And basically this

596
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,904
Allows you to learn about how to use computer vision with a pie

597
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,720
You will get the ebook as well as a pie and

598
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:32,256
And the sensors that you need

599
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,048
I think it's $95 which is

600
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:37,632
Yeah it's more than a pie I'm going to cuss you out 45 just for the hardware

601
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:38,912
The Bass Hardware but

602
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:40,704
This will walk you through how to

603
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:41,728
Train

604
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:44,544
Raspberry Pi for computer vision and so on so I just thought

605
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,592
Are the DIY rose out there might be interesting

606
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:47,616
And then

607
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:49,920
Or do you have wires in the Enterprise

608
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:54,016
Done a really nice techrepublic guide on how to create an iot hub

609
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:55,808
Using Microsoft azure

610
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:58,880
Which is something I haven't done yet I've pretty much use all the other

611
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:00,160
Cloud providers to

612
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,464
In some way shape or form use iot

613
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,744
For my projects

614
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,608
I will probably walk through this just to see what it's like but again it's very enterprise-focused I would

615
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:09,376
Prism

616
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:10,144
Yes

617
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:11,424
Okay

618
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:12,448
And now

619
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,216
It's time for

620
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:14,496
Iot podcast

To ask us your question

636
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:55,968
And it's probably time for us to pick a winner for the month of April

637
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:57,248
So Kevin

638
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,784
Who won Arkansas

639
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:00,832
Iowa alarm system

640
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:08,000
So the winner for April is Scott who had called in about double cylinder lock think we just answered that question a week or two

641
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:10,560
Scott you got an answer and

642
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:13,376
A way to connect your existing alarm system

643
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:14,400
To your smartphone

644
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:15,936
Congratulations to

645
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:16,704
Scott

646
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:17,728
And now

647
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,520
Let's hear from

648
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:21,568
Chef who is looking

649
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:22,848
Help his parents

650
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:23,872
Start a garden

651
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,408
Are Kevin and Stacey

652
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:30,016
This is our Jeff New York and you can use this on the show my question is

653
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,808
Are interested

654
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:33,344
Starting a garden

655
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,368
Never really had

656
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:35,136
Green thumbs

657
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:37,440
But I was wondering if there's a device that

658
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:39,488
They can put with in their Garden

659
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:42,304
What are and or if

660
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,584
Calum which

661
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,864
Cancer flowers

662
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:45,888
The best plant

663
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:49,216
Could you online but I was wondering if

664
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,824
Stephanie alert there their devices when it's

665
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:54,848
Water

666
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,432
Stuff like that but I appreciate what sports your answer have a great day

667
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:00,224
Okay

668
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:00,992
Jeff

669
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:03,296
There's a couple options out there on the market

670
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:05,600
You can always do

671
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:10,976
A smart irrigation system and it's unclear to me if their Garden will be irrigated by like

672
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:13,536
In-ground sprinkler systems or that sort of thing

673
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:15,072
If that's an option

674
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,608
Blossom

675
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,888
Rachio

676
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:21,984
And there are several other companies that make really good

677
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,032
Smart Systems that let you

678
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:27,104
Divide up different areas of the garden for watering the

679
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,152
Look at the weather and they decide

680
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:31,968
You can actually invite you I know you can tell it

681
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:33,248
Somewhat what type of

682
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:35,296
What plants you have in their water needs

683
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:36,832
It it will actually

684
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,880
Factor that into how it water

685
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:39,648
Stop swell

686
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:41,440
So that's

687
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:43,488
One option if you have

688
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:46,048
An existing irrigation system or they want

689
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:50,144
If they do not then we're talking about doing some sort of

690
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:50,912
Connected

691
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:53,728
I would say doing a soil sensor

692
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:54,752
And then

693
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:59,616
Probably doing a manual sprinkler or watering schedule

694
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:02,432
The reason why I say Emmanuel watering schedule is cuz

695
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:03,968
A lot of the

696
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:10,368
Automatic watering things that attach to your hoes aren't very good I investigated them last year trying to build something from

697
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:11,136
Myself

698
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:11,904
In

699
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,696
A lot of them were very expensive

700
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:14,464
And did not seem to

701
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:17,536
Soil sensors

702
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:19,072
On the soil sensor front

703
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:20,096
In

704
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:22,400
As a bonus some of these will work with

705
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:23,168
Existing customer

706
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:24,448
Sprinkler systems

707
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:25,984
They're kind of expensive

708
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,800
I'll just let you know this right now

709
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:30,848
When is the Rain Bird

710
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,408
Smarty soil-moisture

711
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,176
Sensor

712
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:35,456
And

713
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:42,368
This is basically you'll have a sensor that you plug in and then there is an above-ground controller that you can use you can do

714
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:46,464
Use that manually or you can tie that sensor into an existing sprinkler system

715
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:47,744
So

716
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:49,280
Again

717
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:51,328
It's not exactly smart

718
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:53,120
But it will tell people

719
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:53,888
When

720
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:54,912
The plants need

721
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:55,936
But

722
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:57,728
145

723
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:00,032
Kind of a lot

724
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:03,104
Yeah I think it's cheaper to just set reminders

725
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,664
Yeah and another one that there is is the

726
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:09,760
Toro Precision soil sensor that will also work with most

727
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:13,088
Irrigation controllers like rachio Blossom Etc

728
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,112
And

729
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:16,672
You just Jam the sucker in your soil

730
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:18,464
It also has its own

731
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:20,512
Thing that sits on a wall or you can

732
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:23,072
Put some place and it will tell you how

733
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:25,888
Moist the soil is

734
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,704
That is also in the hundred 3200

735
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:32,288
What do you do if your cheap

736
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:34,848
You have

737
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:35,616
Couple

738
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:36,384
Options

739
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:43,296
The cheapest options are about 10 bucks and they're basically just moisture meters that you stick in the ground and they'll like tell you

740
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:45,088
Is it wet or not but at that point

741
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:46,368
Stick your finger in the ground

742
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:52,768
Great and then there's a couple connected soil sensors designed for indoor use I would not recommend them outside

743
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:54,048
Because

744
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:55,584
They're not rugged enough

745
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:58,656
So that's where we are at this today

746
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:03,776
Heather a lot of protective products out there right I find them rather expensive number one

747
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:05,312
Number two

748
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:07,872
You have to make sure you have good connectivity

749
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:10,432
Outside to get the alerts and so on

750
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:11,712
Will a lot of them are

751
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:12,992
Impropriety

752
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:19,904
Do you spell few companies like Eden in plantlink that did this but those products aren't available in

753
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:21,440
So

754
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:22,976
My hunch is

755
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:24,512
It's a crappy environment

756
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:27,328
To build something that's red for outdoors

757
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:28,608
Seems Wi-Fi

758
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:29,632
It's not wired

759
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,936
And that's why we're not seeing

760
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:32,704
Flex accessory

761
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:35,520
So you may have to go with some of the sensors that use

762
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:38,592
Proprietary Wireless to talk to things that are very expensive

763
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:41,408
Or they could be wired into a smart irrigation system

764
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:42,944
We're very sorry

765
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,552
All right well that's close this portion of the show

766
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:51,904
Please stay tuned to learn more about kinship which is Mars Petcare

778
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,184
Hi John how are you

779
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:26,720
Hey Stacy I'm doing well

780
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:33,888
This week we're talking about the democratization of data through but before we do that can you please

781
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:36,448
Remind us what it is that suffer AG does

782
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,984
And how it works with e

783
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:41,568
Suffrage is an Innovative software,

00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:43,104
Money that's been around 4:50

785
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:45,408

00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,832
Most people know us for our immigration

791
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:53,856
Business process

792
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:56,160
Of course iot and Analytics

793
00:31:57,184 --> 00:32:01,024
We help companies get connected and democratize their data everyday

794
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:04,096
What do you mean exactly by democratize

795
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:06,144
Essentially

796
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,984
This is the concept of making your data available within your organization

797
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:14,080
It goes to be able to deliver relevant data to

798
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:14,848
Do anyone

799
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:15,616
Anywhere

800
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:16,384
Anytime

801
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,200
Most folks don't think about this in relation to Hyatt

802
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:20,736
But the reality is

803
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:21,760
You only start

804
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:24,320
Sirius return on your investment

805
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:25,344
Hbase

806
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,136
Once you've enriched your acid

807
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:27,904
Device data

808
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:31,488
Free sample

809
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:33,024
Is running hotter

810
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,304
The normal

811
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:35,840
Only me so much

812
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:38,400
If you don't know the whole picture about that

813
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:42,496
For example we may expect vibration spikes

814
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:46,848
Temperature spikes on an asset if it's doing something that it doesn't

815
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:50,176
Picture we can wait

816
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:51,712
Time and money

817
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:52,480
Responding

818
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,784
That may not really be

819
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,320
Problems

820
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:57,088
The good news

821

At population

856
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:19,264
Until when we

857
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,800
Created this business

858
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:22,848
You're the idea for I have been to Leverage

859
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:24,896
The leadership position that Mars has

860
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:26,176
Unique commitment

861
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:29,504
To the future of pet care in Industry with the way for us to

862
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,040
To collaborate very different

863
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:36,416
With every single disruptor an innovator Tommy Newberry early-stage startups

864
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:37,952
Two companies that are growing

865
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:38,976
Posturing this

866
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:39,744
In this area

867
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,768
Kinship

868
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:44,864
Is the type of business that is uniquely positioned to create a

869
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:45,888
The coalition

870
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:47,680
For the future that ended

871
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:53,056
Okay if we talked to lots of pet care businesses on the show because you know

872
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:54,592
People love their pets

873
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:59,968
So I talked to people from whistle a make a connected it's a Fitbit for dogs

874
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:04,064
I have talked to a company called doggy

875

Petscoop

876
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:06,112
But it's really a

877
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,160
Description Pet Food business

878
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,184
And so

879
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,744
Are these the sort of innovators were talking about

880
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:13,792
Well absolutely

881
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:15,584
Weeki Wachee it's out of kinship

882
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,608
It's the one of the startup

883
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,656
That we operate is in the connection

884
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:19,424
Color business

885
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,192
Which is

886
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:23,008
Another business that we run is

887
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:24,032
Wisdom health

888
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:26,080
Which is our genetic diagnostic business

889
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:29,152
Deal with

890
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:30,432
Technology and science

891
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:31,712
But it's not

892
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:33,248
Just about the business as we on

893
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:36,064
And operated businesses between Gage and partner

894
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,624
You're welcome the journey in the last couple of years

895
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:42,208
Too close to twenty different state startup

896

897
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,512
Care

898
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,304
Technology-related

899
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,840
3D transforming

900
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:49,376
Experience of pet parents

901
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:50,656
I believe it's that

902
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:55,008
Next few years expectations of me they don't have parents

903
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:56,288
Will result in

904
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:57,056
Changing Faces

905
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:59,872
Because this industry and we want to be part of it without having

906
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:02,432
We believe that the paradigm

907
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:04,992
The businesses will be built on partnership

908
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:05,760
Calibration

909
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:07,808
And we're trying to feel that

910
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:10,624
So is Kendrick going to have

911
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,392
Investment

912
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:13,696
Will continue.

913
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:16,000
Significant numbers

914
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:18,304
Tool that we've launched

915
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,328
Year ago

916
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:20,096
One of them is

917
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:20,864
Companions Bond

918
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:23,168

Very happy about

923
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:33,920

931
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:45,440
In partnership with

932
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:46,720
Michelson found animals

933
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:49,792
Nonprofit that bringing a

934
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:51,072
Project Glass

935
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:54,656
Through the accelerator

936
00:36:55,936 --> 00:37:00,800
The idea that is not just about the porting them too funny but it's really about supporting them

937
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:02,080
Mentorship

938
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:02,848
Partnership

939
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:03,872
I'm data

940
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:04,896
The. Something

941
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:05,920
Something that's very much

942
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:07,968
The heart of what we've been doing and what week

943
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:08,736
Continue to do

944
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,272
Okay

945
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:15,392
Help me understand what the opportunities are in the spacer

946
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:16,416
SM

947
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:17,952
I think I've always had pain

948
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,768
So you know I get up very early

949
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,048
I want my dog

950
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:23,328
I come back

951
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:27,424
I got to work my dog basically sleeps all day oh I forgot to feed my dog

952
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:29,216
So I feed my dog to

953
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:30,752
I'm good I feed my dog

954
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:36,896
And then you know I come home I walk my dog again I feed her I play with her we do some tricks training

955
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:37,920
And then you know

956
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:38,944
Well go to bed

957
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:39,968
So

958
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:46,368
How does this change when I have either more information or maybe technology available to me

959
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:48,928
What is this mean for me and what is this mean for my pet

960
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:51,488
About the key

961
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:52,256
Barrier

962
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:53,024
The pet owners

963
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:56,608
Quite a few in very happy pet owner

964
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:57,888
Around the world

965
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:01,984
You know we know if the unique benefits with pet owners should bring

966
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:02,752
People like you

967
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:06,336
2 States and many many others myself included and those half

968
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:08,640
To do with beginner very clear health benefits

969
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:10,432
Feeling of well-being

Interested

972
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,344
Extended care benefits

973
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,880
To as many people as possible

974
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:20,160
Very very important

Elvis T Whitney

976
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:22,720
To look at the barriers

977
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:25,280
That pet ownership is facing a lot of those have to do

978
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:28,096
If you think about the people that would love to

979

Become better Runner

980
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,400
You know there's a lot of battery

981
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,424
Related to

982
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,704
Access to services

983
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,496
How do you make sure that you

984
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:36,032
You're able to

985
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:37,312
Walk the dogs

986
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:40,128
To ensure that to you there's a dog sitter available when

987
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:40,896
You need them

988
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,688
So that you can travel for work

989
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:45,248
You can you can make sure that you don't miss

990
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:46,784
Domestic part of care

991
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,344
Veteran health services are available

992
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,624
Cost of

993
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,392
Of character

994
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:53,184
Affordable the cost of having a

995
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,464
Passive something that you

996
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,232
Can manage

997
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:57,792
Things that have to do with

998
00:38:58,048 --> 00:39:00,096
Quit making a pet ownership is

999
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:01,376
Attractive as possible

1000
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,168
Peconic paddler

1001
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:07,008
3D about how can you be the best pet on a possible

1002
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:13,408
And that is really about connecting a panoply of potential solutions that today at this jointed

1003
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:16,736
And don't read receipt one into another

1004
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:18,784
Into something that can be a real

1005
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,576
Support system for you as a pet owner

1006
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:21,856
So that you don't need to

1007
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:22,624
Explain

1008
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:26,976
The story of your path to every single service provider you might need

1009
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:28,000
Throughout their lifetime

1010
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:29,792
Supported by

1011
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:31,072
State information

1012
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:32,096
Inside

1013
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:33,376
That is very relevant

1014
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:34,400
Closet lights

1015
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:36,192
The puppy stage

1016
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:37,472
To beat out tattoo

1017
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:38,752
Increasingly

1018
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:42,336
Because pets do live longer and longer and so that

1019
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:44,128
Support needs to accompany them

1020
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:46,432
So what's going to the service provider question

1021
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:48,992
Because it makes sense in the human world

1022
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:52,064
Because we have a bunch of different doctors we have you know

1023
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:53,600
Dentist we have

1024
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:59,488
Cardiologist we have neurologist we have all sorts of things happening to us in over a hugely long life span

1025
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:02,048
For the most part my dogs have had

1026
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:03,072
They come for the pound

1027
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:05,120
So they've had their pound experience

1028
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:07,936
Everything's an unknown before that then they have their vet

1029
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:11,008
In the vet does pretty much everything so it feels like

1030
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:17,664
I don't understand where it gets difficult to grab data from are we talked about bringing in data from other sources

1031
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,784
What we are seeing is that the sophistication of the approach

1032
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,320
Towards the pets needs

1033
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:26,112
That the science is now allowing

1034
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:28,928
To do is really napolina much more

1035
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:29,952
Individualized

1036
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:31,232
South experience

1037
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:32,768
So you mention whistle

1038
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:36,608
So because of all the work that we've been doing on me

1039
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:37,376
Algorithm

1040
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:39,168
Science around the

1041
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:41,472
Monitor part of the whistle

1042
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:42,496
We connect you now

1043
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:44,032
Stop predicting

1044
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:45,824
Things like sleep destruction

1045
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:49,664
Or hip and Joint issues that the cat might experience

1046
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,944
You might not know about

1047
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:52,992
So you can be alerted

1048
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:54,016
About the potential

1049
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:55,552
He might have

1050
00:40:55,808 --> 00:41:01,696
What do you start noticing them as a title on her soul before you look very happy to visibly

1051
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:02,976
Be accompanied by healthy

1052
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:05,536
Apache would know a lot more about what kind of issues

1053
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:06,304
Experiencing

1054
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,864
I'm be able to August a company van

1055
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:12,192
Hopefully better health longer

1056
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:15,776
Which distributed close to a hundred thousand

1057
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:17,568
All devices

1058
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:18,592
2

1059
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:21,920
Cleaning customers through Dancehall

1060
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:23,968
The biggest Hospital change name

1061
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:26,016
And as a result we were able to

1062
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:28,064
Attract what we are seeing

1063
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:29,856
Through electronic data

1064
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:32,160
Given to us through the whistle device

1065
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:33,184
With

1066
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,488
What we starting to see in the medical records

1067
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:37,792
Time

1068
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:39,584
24 months

1069
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,608
Studyware reboot

1070
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:43,936
Accumulate the signs that we're seeing from the device

1071
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:45,728
And correlation.

1072
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:46,752
Stop that data

1073
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:47,520
To the

1074
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:52,128
Medical events that we're seeing for the medical records and so is the result who started

1075
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:53,407
To create algorithms

1076
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:55,455
Recognize

1077
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:59,039
And the result hopefully start building a

1078
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:01,343
The way of communicating with a pet owners

1079
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:03,135
Reconnect

1080
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:04,159
Is that and what

1081
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:05,951
Seeing in the whistle data

1082
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:07,231
That is awesome

1083
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:13,631
Because yes it's hard to tell until your animal is like so sick they're not eating or drinking it's really hard to tell sometimes what's

1084
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:14,655
Going on in there

1085
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:22,079
Is this for dogs and cats or are you looking for solutions for I don't know fish ferrets

1086
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:22,847
Birds

1087
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:27,455
Around the world

1088
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:30,271
Scale factor

1089
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:31,807
Starter serving dishes

1090
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:34,879
At the same time for example now in genetic diagnosis

1091
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:38,207
Business

1092
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:39,231
Start typing

1093
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:41,023
People that have courses

1094
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:42,559
Use genetics to be able to

1095
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:52,031
Oh that's interesting I actually just to talk to a startup called nightwatch and they make a

1096
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:57,407
We dat's a halter for horses that checks for I'm going to mess up this disease it is

1097
00:42:57,919 --> 00:43:01,759
Torsion or dogs it's some sort of disease that horses get

1098
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:04,831
Where if they don't solve it really fast the horses

1099
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:05,599
It dies

1100
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:06,623
Pek overnight

1101
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:07,647
It's crazy

1102
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:08,415
Solo

1103
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:14,815
Yeah it's connected device that has if you don't put it on there and it's got algorithms that the measure this sort of thing and it's it's r

1104
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:17,887
Really if your horse owner this is a wonderful thing

1105
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:18,911
Love your horse

1106
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:19,935
Getting pets

1107
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:21,727
The voice I think that's really

1108
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:23,007
Fundamental

1109
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:24,031
Benefits of

1110
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:25,311
Using data

1111
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:27,615
To allow the pet to have a voice

1112
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:32,223
Really communicating with pet owners about what the feeling I think it's

1113
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:34,527
Something over and over again we seen such

1114
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:35,551
Incredible benefits

1115
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:37,599
Where is

1116
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:38,623
You're not getting our case

1117
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:40,159
We can now talk about

1118
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:41,183
Sleep patterns

1119
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:42,207
Eating pattern

1120
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:42,975
Gates

1121
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:45,535
Enormous amount of

1122
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:46,815
Potential areas

1123
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:48,607
Teaching Tots in terms of health and potential

1124
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:49,375
Super collagen

1125
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:52,191
Just the one of the examples

1126
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:55,007
Help house

1127
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:56,543
Can support two

1128
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:58,079
Pets and patterned relationship

1129
00:43:59,103 --> 00:43:59,615
I love it

1130
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:06,271
Like wishing all along for like the bark translator but really all I might need is a connected device

1131
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:08,575
And lots of research across Mini Pets

1132
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:10,367
And I'll know what my dog is thinking

1133
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:17,023
Let's go back to the services side of this and providing kind of more convenience and access to care because

1134
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:20,863
There are lots of people who are like oh I work all day I travel I can't have a dog

1135
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:26,751
You guys through kinship are also looking to partner with companies I assume maybe like wag or

1136
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:29,823
What types of companies are you looking to work with there

1137
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:33,919
Absolutely I think we have a variety of different

1138
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:34,687
Services

1139
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:35,711
We're trying to

1140
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:36,735
Built

1141
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:38,783
And as I said before

1142
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:39,807
Having an ax

1143
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:41,855
Services is very important

1144
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:42,623
Part of it

1145
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:44,671
So we working the right if you want

1146
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:46,975

Executive Taxi

1150
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:53,631
So one of the things

1151
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:57,727
We do it and I'll give you an example of the startup incubator in Russia

1152
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:01,055

00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:01,823
Cinemark

1154
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:02,591
Where access

1155
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:04,127
Bethany house is not nice

1156
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:05,151
Generally given

1157
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:06,175
Inequality

1158
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:10,015
You can put into provider you can find in that market

1159
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:11,039
It's not

1160
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:12,063
Always

1161
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:13,087

1162
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:15,391

00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:24,863
Few months to reach 200000

1168
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:25,887
Mobile users

1169
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:27,679
Switch

1170
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:30,239
Credible signal of readiness

1171
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:31,775
The needs of the patio

1172
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:35,871
Engagement and so

1173
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:39,967
Care is a big part of what we working on in the United States

1174
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:41,759
So we're now piloting a mobile

1175
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:43,295
Approach where

1176
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:45,343
In some of the communities and if you think about

1177
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:46,367
Retirement Community

1178
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:55,327
Have the opportunities to go in travel to health institutions take care of their pet

1179
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:57,119
Autocare becomes an important

1180
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:58,911
Part of the solution where care comes

1181
00:45:59,167 --> 00:45:59,679

00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:11,711
Sister services

1187
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:16,063
Testing a few of the things with it with the other service providers so you think about

1188
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:16,831
Dog walker

1189
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:17,855
Walking the dog City

1190
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:20,159
A lot of this service is the Augustine

1191
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:21,951
Is there a high frequency

1192
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:24,255
And the ability for us

1193
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:26,047
To be able to

1194
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:27,327
Service providers

1195
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:28,863

00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,167
Read the full picture of what

1197
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:32,191

00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:33,471
Background

1199
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:36,799
You will enable them to watch out for things

1200
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:37,823
It's better to be able

1201
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:41,663
How to form how they they look at the

1202
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:43,967
Either not blast

1203
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:47,039
The way to connect from the date of perspective in inside perspect

1204
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:50,879
The multitude of the service providers that are touching that pets

1205
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:51,647
Sly

1206
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:55,487
It's becoming very important part of what we're trying to crack and figure out how to

1207
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:57,535
Okay and

1208
00:46:57,791 --> 00:47:02,399
We just did a lot of the big picture but because this is the iot podcast I have to ask

1209
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:07,519
Where does connectivity and connected devices play into all this we've obviously talked about whistle

1210
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:08,543
And

1211
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:12,639
You know there's a huge Market of connected home dog toys and cameras

1212
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:14,687
And cat toys and cameras

1213
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:19,295
So where are the places were connected devices will help you in this

1214
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:21,855
We are

1215
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:23,391
Start with the light

1216
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:25,695
Device is because of that direct link

1217
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:30,047
To help but we're not stopping there one of the other Partnerships that we are currently running

1218
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:32,607
China is with the smart feeder device

1219
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:35,167
Because if you think about the further out

1220
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:36,703
Development of connectivity

1221
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:37,471
TV Aerials

1222
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:38,239
Eating

1223
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:41,823
It's probably not a area where a cheetah can it be

1224
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:42,847
Form in March

1225
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:45,151
Better much more precise after

1226
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:51,295
Markets like China that I really moving fast

1227
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:52,575

1228
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:53,599
Smart seating

1229
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:54,879
Is an area where

1230
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:55,903
There's a lot of guns

1231
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:58,207
Singapore and so being able to

1232
00:47:58,463 --> 00:48:02,047
Inject the data in the inside about the cats need

1233
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:02,815
Dynamically

1234
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:03,583
Into the

1235
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:04,351
Way too fat

1236
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:06,655
Spell frequency

1237
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:08,191
It's not the area

1238
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:10,239
Today this is the part of me

1239
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:14,591

Dream about identifying

1246
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:29,695
