00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:50,944
Privacy and

00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:51,968
Security laws

20
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,504
Coming from the government

21
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,784
4 connected devices

22
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:58,368

The first

31
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:12,960
A message from one of ours

32
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:15,264
This week sponsor is

33
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,032
Chocolate

That's a UK

40
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,704
Let

41
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,984
Dot IO

42
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:50,336
Okay Kevin let's start with the biggest news which

43
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:51,616
Just probably

44
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:52,384
Oh

45
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,408
You think Google

46
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:57,760
I think it is we have to talk about that cuz I'm still reeling from the event

47
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:00,320
As of yesterday I need coffee

48
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:02,112
Yasso

49
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:03,392
3 things are an ounce

50
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:05,184
To really don't

51
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,720
Concern our audience

52
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:11,840
But the one thing that does is what we already knew was coming or at least what we expected based on leaks

53
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:16,448
The Google home hub which you can already order for 100

54
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:17,472
$49

55
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:21,312
It is a smart display similar to the Lenovo and

56
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:22,336
JBL

57
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,104
Companion products

58
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:27,200
That aren't they are Google Hardware partner so they're all using Android things

59
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:29,504
This is a little different it's

60
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,112
Cheaper than those which is interesting but I think I understand why now that I've

61
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:36,160
Actually seen and use the device

62
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,440
Super starters

63
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:40,000
It's hard to tell in the pictures

64
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,536
But it is a very

65
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:42,816
Small device

66
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,864
It's a 7-inch display

67
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,192
You can hold the base of it in your hand quite easily

68
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,216
It's just

69
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,008
Really I think you're towards

70
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,544
Being a smart

71
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,872
Controlling device with a little bit of media

72
00:02:56,128 --> 00:03:02,272
And I say that because the screen is not as big as the Lenovo for example of the 10-inch Lenovo with a 1080p 10 inch

73
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,808
Screen this is 7 in

74
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,600
And they're giving

75
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:07,648
Dating Google is giving you

76
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,440
Three months of YouTube

77
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,208
Premium

78
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:11,488
With this device

79
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:15,072
If you purchase it not YouTube TV which is actually what I use

80
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,608
Mysmartice play for

81
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,888
Quite a bit so

82
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,960
You can certainly you know use this device

83
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:24,800
For media but it is really all about the new home View

84
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:28,640
And that is going to be coming to the other smart displays I'm explain what that is

85
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:31,712
At any point in time you can just walk up at the display

86
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:33,504
Of course you can control your home devices

87
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,088
Cuz my voice but if you slide down from the top you get a brand new

88
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:41,440
Homeview which shows you what's going on in the room you're currently and such as

89
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,464
What temperature brass

90
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,256
Mustang with sensors you have installed

91
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,280
Your lighting

92
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,072
Situation at the moment etcetera

93
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:47,840
And then you

94
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:49,888
Controls to everything else in the house as well

95
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:50,912
Oh my gosh

96
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,728
Everything old is New Again

97
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:58,592
So basically they've reinvented the fancy touchscreen the wall base touch screens that

98
00:03:58,848 --> 00:03:59,360
Like high-end

99
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,176
Yeah it is since they really have

100
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:02,944
They really have

101
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,712
And

102
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:06,272
It basically aggravates it gets rid of all those

103
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:10,368
External apps you might be using which you can still use for all your devices but

104
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:14,976
It just aggravates everything in one spot which is already done in the home mobile app

105
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:15,744
But now it's

106
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,071
A little easier on the eye and it's little more intuitive because

107
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:23,935
You have pretty much everything you want to see where you are at the right time in one spot

108
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:26,239
Okay so it's kind of like home OS

109
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:29,055
Switch is the Apple homekit version of this

110
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,615
In a sense I would say yes

111
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:32,639
A little more

112
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,407
Text to Lynette

113
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,175
Because

114
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:36,479
If I'm using the home app

115
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,527
On my iPhone 4 sample

116
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,319
It's not going to say you know

117
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,343
What the lights

118
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:43,135
State is in the room I'm in

119
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:46,463
It'll show with the light state for every light in the house and home

120
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,487
Got it

121
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,279
So

122
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,559
So that

123
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:53,631
Feature will be coming to the old

124
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:56,959
Smart displays they're not that old but the Lenovo in the JBL

125
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:58,239
Additionally it's a big

126
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:04,127
Interaction of rather interface with Google Assistant of course it will show your routines if you want

127
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:06,431
And it you can even program the routine standings

128
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,223
Include the display in those routines

129
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:14,623
So your good morning routine could of course show you news weather Etc appointments whatever he will automatic

130
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,159
Dim at night

131
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:18,975
Good night and you don't even need to set a routine for that if I

132
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:25,375
Google touted this ambient EQ which is a light sensor and basically they're going to smartly reduce the

133
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:31,775
The brightness Depending on time of day and if you're not in the room it's not going to do that because there's no sensor to show

134
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,847
Show motion which the other ones actually do have

135
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:41,247
I walk in my room to Lenovo smart display actually brightens up but will Google says it to trying to reduce the billboard effect and what they

136
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:45,599
I mean is they don't want your eye drawn to a bright rectangle

137
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,391
In the room when you walk in

138
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,183
They want you to look at this device

139
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:52,511
When you want to look at it when you need to look at it so

140
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:57,375
That makes a lot of sense it's but again it's a fancy ambient light sensor implementation

141
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,167
That

142
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,703
Someone else

143
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,727
Let me ask you

144
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,263
Because there's a lot

145
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,543
2009

146
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:07,871
Oh does it have any radios like zigbee or Z-Wave I know that

147
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,407
We love those in our home hub

148
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:14,271
We love those two and unfortunately no I say unfortunately for us

149
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:19,135
A lot of mainstream people who have not invested in zbr Z-Wave devices

150
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:25,535
Don't care because you're not missing anything so there's no new radios with Bluetooth 5.0 and 802 11

151
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:28,863
AC wifi both 2.4 and 5 gigahertz

152
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,887
Okay

153
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:30,911
That's good on the Wi-Fi

154
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:34,751
Is it Hey Kevin is it Wi-Fi for Wi-Fi

155
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:38,847
Yeah I didn't go there

156
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:39,871
Is it really

157
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:43,455
What is 11 AC is going to be named

158
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,015
Now I'm totally lost.

159
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:48,063
Okay

160
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,623
Pictures of you guys who miss last week show that they did

161
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,647
The Wi-Fi Alliance

162
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,439
Instant credit

163
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,719
Read my hand

164
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,815
Okay so then the big question is

165
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,351
You said that you've got

166
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,887
Yours and I have mine

167
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:02,911
So would you buy this

168
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,727
I would not from me

169
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:09,055
And that is because I like the immersive media

170
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,847
Experience provided by the larger

171
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,127
Lenovo smart display

172
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,151
So

173
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:13,919
If

174
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:17,503
You're all in on say homekit obviously this is not for you

175
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,063
You're all in on Madam and The Echoes

176
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,647
This isn't going to do much for either unless you plan to switch

177
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:29,279
Show away from mad at me because by and large most of the same devices are supported on both of those platforms

178
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:32,351
I will confess that I actually have a better experience on madam

179
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,119
Hey

180
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:36,959
Despite the fact that I'm a heavy Google Apps and Android user

181
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:40,031
Because Google Apps actually

182
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,871
Works on madhumeha but because of my weird account issues

183
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,151
It doesn't work

184
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:45,919
On

185
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:46,943
The Google devices

186
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,759
Continuing frustration so I'm like

187
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,295
Google I love you but no

188
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,367
Yeah obviously if you have a g Suite account

189
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:56,159
As opposed to regular Google account

190
00:07:56,415 --> 00:08:01,023
Yeah you're going to run into that issue time and time again with your phones and Google assistant general Shore

191
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,303
What about the

192
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,351
And so that's

193
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:10,751
That's what I was going to bring up because this is one thing you can't get with your second Echo Show for example so I think

194
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,799
You have the nest doorbell ring

195
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:13,823
I do

196
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,359
Okay as do I

197
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:19,199
And you know you can certainly go into the app today and look at

198
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,735
See who's at the front door at 7.

199
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:24,831
But when somebody rings the doorbell today you literally have to

200
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,135
Tell a display or device to

201
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,415
To show who's out there

202
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,695
What they did here is

203
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:32,767
Is Google integrated with Nest so that any time

204
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:35,071
Somebody Rings Your Nest doorbell

205
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:37,375
The video stream will immediately

206
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:39,167
Pop up unannounced

207
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:41,215
If you want to do anything or say anything

208
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:43,263
It just pops up on the Google home hub

209
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,383
And then you can have a two-way conversation or if you don't want to talk to the person there's some pre-canned

210
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,151
Responses

211
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:51,967
So you can just say sorry not interested tap that little

212
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:52,991
You don't have to say anything

213
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,783
I can just tap the sorry we're not interested in

214
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,575
That's what it will say to whoever's out there

215
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,111
Does it say in your voice tube

216
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:00,159
Yes you. Don't record it

217
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,951
You don't

218
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,743
We are at entry

219
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,327
Yeah Google does the voices in

220
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,631
I color I think right so

221
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:12,959
Cyan for me would say sorry not interested

222
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,263
We're not even going

223
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,287
Okay

224
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,823
So I feel like

225
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:18,591
I know

226
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,127
If I should buy this or not

227
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,151
That's good

228
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,687
And I will say

229
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:24,991
For people interested in seeing the nest

230
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:27,039
If you have Nest gear Nest cameras

231
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:30,111
Google has been pretty shy about sharing the camera base

232
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,903
Rest apis with other partners

233
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:32,671
So

234
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:33,695
You may never

235
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:38,559
I'm not not anything I know for a fact but I will say that people

236
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:41,119
Are companies out there that would love access to that

237
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,399
But they don't get it

238
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,191
And this may become like a

239
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,215
Competitive advantage

240
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:45,983
Google

241
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:52,639
If I would agree with that and I don't know anything either but I suspect you're right I think this is a platform play for Google and

242
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:55,455
I mean if you spend 3.2 billion on Nest I would imagine

243
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,735
That makes a lot of sense

244
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:03,903
I'm one other quick thing only because this relates to something else that was announced yesterday

245
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:09,279
For those who use the or will use the Google home hub or any other smart display for photos

246
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,047
Because integrates

247
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:13,375
Is Google photos and you can just view albums all day long on the devices

248
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:16,447
They have added a live albums

249
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:20,031
And using their search smart so you can say I want to see pictures of

250
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,335
Nor my dog or Beano

251
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,871
My wife my husband whatever

252
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:24,895
It will search

253
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:29,503
Do your photos and create a live album and show those on the display of the Google home hub

254
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,295
As you add more photos

255
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:33,087
Of that person or pet

256
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:36,671
Not to the album it will automatically add them to that album

257
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,719
For you for the Google home hub which I thought was

258
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:41,023
It's cool though that's lovely

259
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:41,791
Yes

260
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,839
And as it relates to something else

261
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:44,863
That's sort of related

262
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,143
Not quite our audience

263
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,935
The pixel 3XL

264
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,727
Has a new pixel stand

265
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,519
Twitches a wireless stand

266
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:53,823
To charge your pixel 3 or 3XL

267
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,615
When you put the phone on the

268
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:58,943
Charger it can show you photo albums

269
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,991
Also on the phone

270
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:03,039
And will show you the nest

271
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,575
Camera from the doorbell

272
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:09,695
When that phone is sitting there so kind of beans on mini smart display with very limited functionality

273
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:11,743
That's kind of cool knots it

274
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:14,303
Well actually I don't ring my phone everywhere in the house

275
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,327
So that might be

276
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,863
Fix for me if I were going to buy

277
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:19,935
Can I get a software update for my original

278
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,727
Cancel my pixel 2

279
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:26,335
I don't know about that I think they're telling us as a pixel 3

280
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:28,639
Function a pox on their people

281
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:30,687
Well

282
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,455
Let's

283
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,223
Move actually

284
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:34,015
Before we move on be on Google

285
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:36,319
There's there's one of the thing GE announced

286
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:39,391
Some smart light bulbs the C by GE

287
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,159
Lights

288
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:42,463
I'm just going to say this straight

289
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:46,303
GE has the world's most confusing connected lightbulb strategy

290
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,071
See I have ever

291
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:49,375
They have branded this

292
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:53,471
These light I have owned a variation of the GE connected lights

293
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,775
That we're not great at all

294
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:59,615
And then they went out and they rebranded or lunch new light

295
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:00,895
That were

296
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,175
Pakistan

297
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:04,479
Circadian rhythms are Auto tuning

298
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:09,343
According to the day and they had it a night version that you were night bulb and a daytime bulb

299
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:13,951
So the idea was you would put like the night bulb in your bedside table in the daytime bold maybe at you

300
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,231
Your desk and

301
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,255
I thought that was

302
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:18,303
You saying strange as well

303
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,071
Now

304
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,863
And that was under the sea brand

305
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:23,167
Letter c as in Charlie

306
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,191
Yes

307
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,471
And so now they have

308
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,239
The

309
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:27,263
Google C

310
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,591
So these new

311
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:31,615
Google

312
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:33,407
See lights are Bluetooth Bass

313
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,431
Much like there

314
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,199
Prettiest

315
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:37,247
And I

316
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:39,551
They audit at me when you screw them in

317
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,855
The Inn you have a Google

318
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,135
Home hub

319
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:45,439
They're going to automatically be detected

320
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:48,511
I'm not sure what the network authentication process is if

321
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:51,839
It's like a barcode if it's some sort of weird handshake

322
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:52,607
But

323
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:59,007
These are getting these sorts of automatic Discovery are becoming more common Amazon actually showed a lot of that

324
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,543
Shut off last month

325
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:01,567
@its

326
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,847
Fun exciting

327
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:05,663
We lunch 70 things in one day kind of event

328
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:08,223
But I'm still not keen on Bluetooth Baseline

329
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:10,527
I know Bluetooth mesh makes this better

330
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,807
I still

331
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:14,367
Yeah I still remember like being able to be like

332
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:17,951
Walk downstairs and suddenly losing the ability to control my lights and that was

333
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:18,975
Sake

334
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,767
So I'm curious about this one

335
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:26,655
Yeah I'm curious to I mean this is all and this kind of goes with the theme of yesterday's event with the Google home hub

336
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:31,263
Although these work with any Google home product and I'm a mini etcetera it's all about simplicity

337
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,799
And that's

338
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:37,663
Southpaw for mainstream people who are just getting started in this morning we're having on started it also

339
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:43,039
That's what they're going for here literally you plug these in and then just go to the Google home app and they say

340
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,575
And start controlling that's it

341
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:45,855
So I think that

342
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:48,415
That's great I'm curious as you are about

343
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:51,743
You know the implementation of that from a security standpoint I don't

344
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:58,143
Think you're scanning anything we could do it in the plug these in and powder them up but Google has a Google has my wife I could

345
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:02,495
Maybe they're running tests on anyway I did send them an email and

346
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:04,287
We'll try to figure that out for you guys cuz

347
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:08,127
That's how dedicated we are to the nitty-gritty of these Marton

348
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:08,895
Also

349
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,175
Related

350
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:10,943
To Google

351
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,247
This is a story that I wrote last week

352
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,551
I've been working on this for a little while but

353
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,599
How does a little bit

354
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:19,903
I have been hearing from Smart Home

355
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:20,927
Device makers

356
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,463
That Walmart

357
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:24,255
If you wanted to be sold in Walmart

358
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,791
You needed to have

359
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:26,815
Support

360
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,887
And if you had only met him a support

361
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,679
Can I come back when you can support Google

362
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,471
And talk to her

363
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:35,519
Six different people they all confirm this

364
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,543
Walmart

365
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,823
Still has not gotten back

366
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,591
Test me on this

367
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:39,359
Kind of losing her

368
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,663
But in a baby

369
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:42,687
Maybe

370
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:47,295
And the other thing is that was Universal was it if you support Madam a

371
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,063
That's fine

372
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,599
But don't emphasize that

373
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:52,159
Need to put that on the side of the box or the back of the box

374
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:54,207
And then I talked to some other people

375
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:57,791
Who said that they were actually encouraged to move their operation

376
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:00,863
Off of AWS Amazon web service

377
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,911
And they were also encouraged

378
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:04,959
To not use a smart

379
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:05,983
Home hub

380
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,543
And in this make sense

381
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:11,871
Is anywhere talk about Simplicity or talk about normal people

382
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:15,967
That's kind of I think the theme of this year would be the normalization of

383
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:16,735
The Smart Home

384
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:17,503
Not

385
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,271
Like 4

386
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:24,927
Like my mom and dad are not like all the smart home is normal but it's prepping it to become normal so making it so normal people

387
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:25,695
Can adopt

388
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,487
That is a big strides

389
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:30,303
And closing the loop on this

390
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:31,839
About the normal fee

391
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:35,935
Normal people don't know or care about zigbee and Z-Wave

392
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:40,031
But normal people pretty much know about Bluetooth and WiFi and I think that's

393
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,311
Really worried there's

394
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,615
Getting rid of the Hub that's coming from

395
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:46,431
Keeping the products simpler and using those two radios

396
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:51,295
Yeah and that makes sense. I think there will always be room in a market

397
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,575
For the foreseeable

398
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:54,367
Future Percocet B&C way

399
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,135
It's just

400
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,671
That's like your leveling up

401
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:01,535
Alright while we're on this topic of simplicity

402
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:04,351
Amazon release the new software update

403
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,887
Four battle

404
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:06,911
And

405
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,191
I downloaded it

406
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:10,239
I always have the worst experience

407
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,007
With my

408
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,031
Madame Mao

409
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,055
I'll be honest

410
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:17,151
Even actually what I had the Amazon guy over to like

411
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:19,455
Hit my house basically see what he said

412
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:22,015
Is like gosh your app run so slowly

413
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,295
I think it's because I have

414
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,063
A lot

415
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,087
Devices

416
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:26,367
But

417
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:28,415
What do you think

418
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:35,071
Yeah I updated it on my phone and it's actually kind of similar to what Google's going for with their home

419
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:41,471
Review on the Google home hub it's more of an aggregator of here's all your devices here's all your groups and rooms you can even

420
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,775
To see what skills you have in your smart home

421
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:47,103
I like it so far it's visually very pleasing to me

422
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,639
I often find these apps to Beatrice

423
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,919
Kind of fairy

424
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:50,687
Bright

425
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:55,039
And this is a very low-key relaxing pestilli color I don't know if I

426
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,319
If you saw the same but

427
00:16:56,831 --> 00:17:00,671
It was the first thing that jumped out at me quite honestly and then everything's very well-organized I think

428
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:01,439
Yes it's like

429
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:03,487
Dark blue and then they it's a

430
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:06,303
Brighter blue but it's not like a super bright blue it's very

431
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,863
Just chill seafoam green or nice

432
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:09,887
Purple

433
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:13,983
So are ya at the color palette did actually job is like

434
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:14,751
Oh that's a little

435
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:20,639
Weird alright it actually kind of felt a little old-fashioned it reminded me of color palettes I saw on smart-home things back in like

436
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:21,919
2013

437
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:22,687
I think Peak

438
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,223
Which was Best Buys

439
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:25,247
Smart home hub

440
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,783
Had a similar color palette

441
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:31,135
I am talking about color palettes let's talk about grouping

442
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:35,231
Cuz I said that's important with this at the groupies

443
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,255
What is happening

444
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:41,887
This is an area where Amazon has always excelled they let you put you can have as many groups as you want

445
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,679
I have about half a dozen

446
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:44,703
Which might be

447
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:49,567
Bring so slow and I put I have a Christmas grouping I have a downstairs grouping I

448
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,335
Groupings for me

449
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,103
My rooms

450
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:51,871
And

451
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:56,991
Here's a pro tip for you guys because I recently had a hue light bulb just go offline

452
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:58,015
I don't know why

453
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,039
You just happened

454
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:02,879
So I had to delete that bulb and then re-add it

455
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:03,903
And

456
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:05,951
I re-added it in the hue

457
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:06,719
App

458
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:08,767
Got to do that

459
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,047
And then I had to

460
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:12,351
Delete the old bald from the Amazon

461
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,375
Echo app

462
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,399
And then

463
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:16,191
Put the new one into

464
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,215
Groups

465
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:19,263
I realize that I had had it

466
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,543
Living room

467
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:21,823
Group

468
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,103
But then when I

469
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:26,687
Created my downstairs group in which is all of my lights downstairs

470
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,223
Instead of

471
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:28,991
Adding

472
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,527
The room group

473
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:31,551
To that

474
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:34,111
Teen I'd added two things individually

475
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:36,159
This is too convoluted for everyone

476
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:42,559
Are we following this hence the Simplicity Factor everybody's going for these days

477
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,095
So the point is

478
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:47,423
You can add things to a routine you get out of group

479
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:48,703
To your routine

480
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:49,983
So

481
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:52,031
From now on I'm treating like

482
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:54,591
Hey that's the living room group and now I'm just putting that hoe

483
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:55,871
Croup into my room

484
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,663
So I went back and read it on my

485
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,455
Around that beat

486
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,223
Cuz

487
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:03,295
If something happens you can just swap one thing out in

488
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:04,831
Right

489
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:11,231
And that makes sense from a contextual standpoint because let's say you have a movie night routine in the living room everything in

490
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:14,047
Living room is going to be affecting or most everything

491
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:20,447
The lights perhaps my dim the TV might come on the Fire TV Etc perhaps even have a connected speaker system

492
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:24,031
That fires up and then turns everything to say Netflix so

493
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:26,591
That makes sense you can just do everything at once with a group

494
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:27,871
You think is worth it

495
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:31,199
Netflix movie night or Amazon Prime movie night

496
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:33,247
I actually have had this debate in my

497
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,599
House beside our movie night

498
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:42,207
Yeah I'm okay with picking and choosing from my TV screen what I

499
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:44,255
What service I want to watch and we have like

500
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:46,815
Three or four of them sick I'm right there with you but

501
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:48,607
Yeah we bounced around its

502
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:49,887
Buy show for us

503
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:51,679
Let It Go stay

504
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:57,055
Related before we get off at topic

505
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,591
Google's

506
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:00,127
Omeprazole so updated

507
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:02,175
And if you want a peek

508
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:08,063
At what the hungry looks like on the Hub if the same cohesive interface on the new Google home app

509
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:13,183
And I really like what's been done here in fact I like it better than the Mad MAF refresh

510
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:15,999
Okay yeah you know I like it is brighter it's got

511
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:18,303
Lovely things I love being able to like

512
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,071
Turn the light on

513
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:20,863
Make it brighter make it dimmer

514
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,911
Change the color like all of that is really

515
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:23,935
Very nice

516
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:25,471
Simple simple

517
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:26,495
Simple again

518
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:28,799
So I do Wonder though is that

519
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:32,639
Again is that a function of the Google Engineers coming up with that or is that

520
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:36,223
Four devices that are little weird or off that might not be in there

521
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:38,271
Do you get to pick your own or how does that work

522
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:39,807
How did those visual elements

523
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:40,575
Transfer over

524
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:48,255
Who did Ryan yeah with a manufacturer has some say what they're EPI and so on I presume that Google knows that

525
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:54,143
Yeah this is it maybe a tunable bulb and therefore we need this interface my guess is they know the attributes somehow

526
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,423
3D apis

527
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:00,031
To dynamically show the correct control but I don't have a ton of those

528
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:00,799
Unique

529
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:02,847
Idevices so I couldn't say for sure

530
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:05,151
Well I am still traveling but

531
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:08,479
After this week I will be home and I'll go check that out I'll be like

532
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:11,039
Here's my weird connected device what do you think it is

533
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:14,623
Cuz I really think Amazon Nails it when they talked about having

534
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:16,159
Yeah mon

535
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:18,464
Range and on-off

536
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,792
Toggle I think that's a really good way to start thinking about these things

537
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:23,584
On off Circle

538
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,888
Range is volume maybe it's

539
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:27,168
Lighting colors

540
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:30,240
And then mode is anything specific to a device like

541
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:32,032
In lights it might be a scene

542
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:35,104
In a washing machine that might be permanent press clothes

543
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,640
Okay

544
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:40,480
Before we get started talking about everything else because there's a

545
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:43,040
Whole lot more including spark Kitchen in Facebook

546
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:43,808

And that is way too long

585
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,616
There's no mechanism

586
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:15,968

You can go to our website at cognizant.com

621
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:56,064
Okay

622
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:58,112
We have almost exhausted

623
00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,904
Smart Home Smart displays but

624
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,184
Not

625
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:01,952
Quite

626
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,512
Big news

627
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:07,840
And I'm going to say something that underlies the need for trust

628
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:09,120
Lost in the space

629
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:10,656
Is Facebook launch

630
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:13,728
Display that has a

631
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:16,800
The camera that tracks you and you can call people on it

632
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:17,568
And

633
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:19,360
I don't know why

634
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:23,200
And it has an assistant integration to

635
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:24,736
Does

636
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:26,784
Triple would you be

637
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,344
Let me think about

638
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:30,880
Not at all

639
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:32,416
I'm kidding I'm not even thinking

640
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:33,184
Not at all

641
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,280
Basically this is the new portal from Facebook which is the

642
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:39,584
Cassius we talkin about a

643
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,400
Some type of smart device from them for quite some time it's

644
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:48,544
Again similar to say smart display or nekoshou but it's a little bit more limited in that

645
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,336
It's really meant for

646
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:51,360
Video call

647
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:53,408
So obviously there's a camera on here

648
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,688
And I think that's going to be

649
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:56,224
The biggest challenge for Facebook

650
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,760
Who already has

651
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:01,856
I say probably one of the least trusted large companies with personal information

652
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:04,928
This this is what trips me out people still ask

653
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:05,696
They're like

654
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:06,464
Hey

655
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,560
You know how when you talk about something and then you get an ad for it on Facebook

656
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:12,096
I didn't think it on your phone

657
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:12,864
In this case

658
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:14,656
Again

659
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:17,216
So if you can imagine you know that

660
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:18,752
Put in your house

661
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:19,776
I mean

662
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,056
Right

663
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:25,152
Not with Facebook I mean I wouldn't say no one's not go

664
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:26,688
Do it but I

665
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:28,224
Fewer people are going to do it

666
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,808
With them versus with Amazon or Google in my opinion

667
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,088
Shoe department

668
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:35,136
Why did they release the

669
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:40,256
I am not sure quite honestly because it is really limited it mean yes it is

670
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:44,608
It's got to be always listening because there is a matinee integration and they're going to add a Google integration

671
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:45,376
The future

672
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:47,424
It doesn't even it's not like you can use

673
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:51,776
Facebook Messenger to talk to people Center April literally just a video.

674
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:53,312
Type device

675
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:55,360
With an always listening assistant

676
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:56,896
And it's not cheap either

677
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:01,760
It's 199 for the 10-inch display and 350

678
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:03,808
For a 15.6 in

679
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:08,416
Display that rotates from portrait to landscape I mean it's like a big old slab of a tablet

680
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:09,952
Santander

681
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:11,488
Yeah telepresence

682
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:12,512
From Facebook

683
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:13,280
You know

684
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:15,328
All your corporate and family secrets

685
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:16,096
Xposed

686
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:17,888
And

687
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:20,704
And on the product page they have you know

688
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,728
Here's the

689
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:23,776
All the features and privacy is on the pig

690
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:30,432
I just don't need it asked us for phone numbers for two-factor authentication and then

691
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:31,712
Used that phone

692
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:34,272
For this is not a cup

693
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:38,112
But I don't honestly know I mean I feel like in the media we

694
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:38,880
Dog and face

695
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:39,648
A lot

696
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:40,672
We see this

697
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:44,000
I don't actually know how many normal like truly normal

698
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:49,888
We're outside this world they I feel like they have a bag distrust but they may not understand the actual

699
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:52,704
You know is it evil it's certainly Machiavellian

700
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,496
Facebook

701
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:59,616
Yeah that's it there's a trust issue because of what they've done with data and then got basically caught doing

702
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:05,760
To their credit I mean they are trying here from a privacy standpoint there saying you can completely disable the camera microphone with a single

703
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:09,088
Or you can block the camera lens with the provider camera cover

704
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:12,672
So there's that then they also say they don't listen to view or keep

705
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:13,952
Your video calls

706
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:16,512
Everything stays between you and the person you've talked

707
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:21,120
The smart camera uses AI that runs locally not on their servers

708
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:24,704
Am I smart camera this is actually pretty cool tack it follows

709
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:30,336
People basically original around the room keeps them in focus and so on so that's nice I like that

710
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:34,432
But they don't use facial recognition or identify who you are so so they say

711
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:38,272
And are they only send the voice commands to their servers after you say the hot word

712
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:40,320
Which is a portal

713
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,880
I didn't tell you.

714
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:47,232
But I see why they need to do that they have to do something on mobile right

715
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:52,608
They had to do some soap couple years back they were all in on mobile because people were like a ghost

716
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:53,376
What's the weather

717
00:28:54,144 --> 00:29:00,032
So if you think about we're moving to a world without screens or that we don't look at the screens or utilize the screens are pockets

718
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:02,592
It does become important to have

719
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:04,384
Communication or

720
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:05,920
A way into

721
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:11,808
The home in four people are going to spend time trying to think again connect which is what their fundamental mission is

722
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:21,280
Sure. And I get it too because they missed the boat in terms of mobile they actually tried to do a quote-unquote Facebook phone with h

723
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:23,072
HTC and that totally bombed

724
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,400
And now they're trying to do the Facebook portal in

725
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,448
Before it gets too late

726
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:30,752
So I get it too but I can tell you

727
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:32,032
No way will I buy one

728
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:32,800
Not

729
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,384
So outside

730
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,152
Crazy

731
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:38,176
Facebook screens

732
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:40,224
I am going to tell you about the number

733
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:40,992
The Enquirer

734
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:43,808
Redible number of screens I saw at

735
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:48,160
The smart Kitchen Summit so every year since don't need screens

736
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,952
Like your kitchen

737
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:52,256
Could actually end up with more screens than

738
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:56,096
Like an editing any other room in the house

739
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:57,376
So

740
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:59,936
This Is It event this is the fourth year that this event happen

741
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:01,728
And I love going to it because

742
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,264
But you know I love to cook I love song

743
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:08,384
And food there is always food there delicious food I actually ate

744
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,664
3D printed

745
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,944
Dragon fruit

746
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,480
Juice

747
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,272
How do I go

748
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:17,856
Juicy gummy I don't even know it was 3D printed liquids which was

749
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:18,880
Bonkers

750
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,184
You are not going to buy this

751
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:25,536
3D printed beef jerky

752
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:26,816
No that's not a liquid

753
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:27,840
Time

754
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:29,632
Sprite imagine 3D printed

755
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:30,400
Sprite YouTube

756
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:32,704
Okay we're not talking about that

757
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,496
Weird thing about screens everywhere

758
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:36,800
So I saw a smart

759
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:37,568
Cookshop

760
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:38,336
Where

761
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:39,360
It was a cooktop

762
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:40,640
Glass kind of

763
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:41,920
Cooktop induction

764
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:42,944
Kitchen range I'm assuming

765
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,224
And it had a TV in it

766
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,528
So like why you were cooking you can look down and

767
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,856
Things happen it was actually also a touchscreen which

768
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:52,160
I'm just going to go out on a limb here and say

769
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:55,232
Maybe not a great idea to combine your cooktop and range

770
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:56,000
Everything

771
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:57,536
Together in a touch screen

772
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,888
It happened no but I could see watching you know afternoon cooking shows

773
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:05,472
The next following along cooking right there and just doing what they're doing

774
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:06,496
Just avoiding

775
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:08,544
Yes

776
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,312
Yes

777
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:13,664
So that is one place where you might one day or you have the option where you could have asked

778
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:18,016
The other is if you look up from your cooktop you'll have a vent

779
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:19,552
Right most homes have event

780
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:21,344
Range hood range hood

781
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:22,368
Also

782
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,904
GE was showing off

783
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:25,952
This was a huge scream like

784
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:26,976
Like 20 in

785
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:28,256
It was very large

786
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,792
Cover the whole range hood

787
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:32,352
And the range hood had a camera in so you

788
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:33,376
Gazebo

789
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:38,496
Had a camera on the top of the thing so it could like look at you and get

790
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:42,592
Your kitchen view but it also had a camera underneath the range hood also

791
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:43,360
Got whatever you

792
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:49,760
You're cooking and it was it had the full internet they were showing but I thought that was really interesting mostly it was

793
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:51,296
Is an Android Base thing so there was

794
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:52,320
Google Duo

795
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:56,160
Calling my mom on Duo and being like Mom is this Austin yet

796
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:57,696
What consistency

797
00:31:58,464 --> 00:31:58,976
That would be really

798
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:02,560
I could see something similar used in restaurants

799
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:04,864
Yeah between the cokes in the head

800
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,936
Jefferson and maybe the head waiter Etc

801
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:13,056
Yeah if you could get actually some AI in there and be like hey there's plenty of sear on that steak flip it

802
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,592
You know friends that like that could be

803
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:19,456
So that was another screen and then there was the everyone's favorite the refrigerator

804
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:21,504
And then

805
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:24,064
There's all these smart devices I mean

806
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,904
The Lenovo tablet and the Echo Show are basically like

807
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,928
The kitchen TV

808
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:29,952
My house

809
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:30,720
So

810
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:33,024
Ayo Kevin I felt kind of exhausted by

811
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:34,048
All the screens

812
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:36,352
Expensive good Lord

813
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:37,376
Sure

814
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:40,192
So that was that was one thing and it would it felt like

815
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:43,264
In this makes sense because then the kitchen voices

816
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,032
Awesome

817
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:45,568
Because your hands are there

818
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:50,176
Right you're like oh I can tell things but you're also like if you're going to follow rest beard anything

819
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,456
Do I actually want to

820
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,504
Yeah I kind of

821
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,832
Like the idea of the projector approach

822
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:58,624
As opposed to this because

823
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,648
You couldn't

824
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:05,792
Moving navigate with gestures not touch anything you know or you if you did touch like your countertop cuz

825
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:12,192
Maybe the recipe video is being shot on your countertop it's okay that countertops going to get messy anyway I would not want like Grease

826
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:13,984
Busy fingers all over a touchscreen device

827
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:15,520
Yes and

828
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:19,616
I actually asked some people about projection and they were not keen on it

829
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,152
I was really bummed about that cuz

830
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:23,712
Bosch actually showed her off at Eva and

831
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:24,736
In the kitchen

832
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:25,760
I actually think

833
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:26,784
Projectors

834
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,344
Is a there more economical they don't break as much

835
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,696
GE showed off his like little vents to keep the grease off your range hood but

836
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:34,976
Is anyone who's ever

837
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:37,536
Like how to clean the range hood that sucker is like a

838
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:38,304
The Greaseman

839
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:39,840
I want a camera or

840
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:41,120
Beautiful screen there

841
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:47,264
No I would love to see somebody basically create a projector for almost like a can light and overhead light

842
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,312
For my kitchen island for example

843
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:51,616
Yeah or just even I mean

844
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:53,920
There are many projectors that you could just

845
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:55,968
Pop on the top of a

846
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:58,784
Girl for a couple or like a Madam a speaker

847
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,552
Pitztal

848
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:02,368
But yeah we'll see so that was

849
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:05,184
Kind of the big takeaway they also had Wireless

850
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:05,952
Power

851
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:06,976
Howard

852
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:08,256
Counters item

853
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:13,376
We've got of Wireless power standard

854
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:14,144
Finally it's

855
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:14,912
The cheese stands

856
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,240
It's the same standard we use you know to charge our phones

857
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:19,008
Now

858
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:24,384
They're doing a high-powered version of that standard to power things like blenders or food processors

859
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,664
Or I don't know

860
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:27,200
Coffee grinders whatever

861
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:27,968
Kitchen appliance

862
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,504
George Foreman grills

863
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:32,576
So what they're showing off is

864
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:34,112
This bills into account

865
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:38,976
And it is kind of neat cuz they'll just they had a special Phillips and higher are making

866
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:40,768
Appliances for this right now

867
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,560
They just pulled out like a Phillips

868
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:44,096
Chopper

869
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:45,632
Stuck it on there.

870
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,448
Ezra like whoa

871
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:50,752
Record

872
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:51,520
Nopor

873
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:52,800
Look model cord

874
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:54,848
So that actually was

875
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:58,688
Kennedy I would like that basically your whole food prep

876
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:02,784
Space can also be up top you know you're not limits very specific cook

877
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,552
Spots

878
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:05,344
So wake me I haven't even told people

879
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:07,392
Oh no they have that

880
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:08,672
So they have that

881
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:09,696
Oh yeah

882
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:11,232
So I want that again

883
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:13,536
Wireless charging is induction which

884
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:14,560
Anyone who's like

885
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:16,608
Better high-end kitchen induction

886
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:17,376
Pop song

887
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:18,400
All the rage

888
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:19,936
You do need a special pan

889
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:21,728
So they done two things

890
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:26,848
In the future it would be possible with the right kind of counter-service and pan

891
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,384
Actually just put

892
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,408
Pain on the couch

893
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:30,176
Countertop

894
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:31,200
It would heat up

895
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,224
You could just

896
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:32,992
On your counter

897
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:35,040
What they're showing off now

898
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:36,064
Is a

899
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,600
It's like a coaster looking devices

900
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:39,136
1 inch thick device

901
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:40,672
And it has the

902
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,232
The circle on it so you know where to put your pan

903
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:47,584
But yeah so you just popped out anywhere on your counter where it has this

904
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,352
Higher

905
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,120
Wattage

906
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:50,656
Power Inn

907
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:51,680
You can cook

908
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:52,704
Crazy

909
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:54,240
It's bananas

910
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:57,056
So I was kind of keen on this I thought it was neat

911
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:57,824
I don't

912
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,360
See it happening

913
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:05,248
For another five or six having the standards not even be finalized till the middle of next year but

914
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,528
I'll keep an eye on that

915
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:11,648
Considering how long it's taking the QI standard to evolve and become the de facto

916
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:14,208
Which is you were talking at least 10 years

917
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:16,768
But I would agree with you would probably a half a decade outfit

918
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:18,560
Real accommodations here

919
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:22,144
Which is a bummer alright a couple other things I saw there that were

920
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:22,912
Worth mention

921
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:23,936
1

922
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:25,472
You're going to see this in the newsletter youku

923
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:26,240
Daiso

924
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:28,032
Sign up for the newsletter if you don't but

925
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:29,312
Thought of you asked me about this

926
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:30,080
Robot

927
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:31,616
Cooking device called the rotimatic

928
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:33,408
It makes Roshes

929
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,176
Switches a

930
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:35,712
South Asian flatbread

931
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:37,504
And it also makes tortillas

932
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,040
Or pizza dough

933
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:40,320
So this is a

934
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:42,112
This is a $1,000 real

935
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:44,416
That sits in your kitchen

936
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:45,696
It's fairly large

937
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:46,976
Yeah it's pretty large

938
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:49,280
But you just put all the ingredients on topping

939
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,096
Mix a little ball of dough

940
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:54,144
Bruise around a whole bunch in it

941
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,448
Makes it go down into this cavity and

942
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:57,472
Squishies at Platt

943
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:58,496
And then

944
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,568
Cough up which is important rotis

945
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:02,336
And then it

946
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:03,104
Fix it

947
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:03,872
And

948
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:06,176
Slide it out like a printer fits like a printer tray

949
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:08,736
Your life

950
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:10,272
Down the chute

951
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:11,552
Set out of paper

952
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:12,576
Richie gym

953
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:13,600
Roti Jam

954
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,136
So I would say

955
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:16,416
They sold forty

956
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:22,304
I know and they don't even sell it in India they sell it only in the US UK and

957
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,072
Arts of Asia

958
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:27,168
Yeah check that out because the video is

959
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:29,728
Pretty freaking phenomenal and the companies

960
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,776
Been doing this a long time it took a lot after

961
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,312
And then

962
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:35,104
The June oven Kevin's in my favorite

963
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:42,272
Damn didn't update the ties them into Whole Foods all of a sudden to the Whole Foods right now and you're doing oven which might be

964
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:43,040
President marketing

965
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:44,064
Decide

966
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:45,600
But it will bake

967
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:50,976
The 365 brand pizzas there's some sweet potato Puffs there's all kinds of things

968
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:52,000
That you can just

969
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:53,536
Click the button and it automatically has

970
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:54,560
Settings

971
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:59,936
I eat it's a little clunky cuz it's kind of a long list you go through I don't know how automated

972
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:04,800
This could be I mean if I'd be better if you could scan a barcode or if it actually recognized the things but

973
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:08,384
How would it know that it's a 365 brand of frozen pizza one

974
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:12,992
So yeah barcode scanning I guess I don't know

975
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:13,760
Will they don't have

976
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:14,528
Have a way to scan the

977
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:18,624
I don't even

978
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:24,256
On my watch I have it on my phone

979
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:31,680
You're not here but I like to know who's doing what in my house when I'm not there I'll be out running at night and all of a sudden so many fires at the junior like

980
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:33,216
Really see it on my watch

981
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,032
Who's making a cake in there

982
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:36,800
Hey

983
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:41,664
Sometimes they make stuff and I come home and everything's cleaned up in the food is like missing gone like

984
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,688
I didn't get any

985
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:45,248
Yeah I got got to keep an eye on that

986
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:46,528
COK

987
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:47,808
Yes June

988
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:48,576
The oven for

989
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:49,856
Controlling parents everywhere

990
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:56,512
All right so those were two things I saw there that were pretty cool I also ate food from the Brava oven it is another

991
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:58,304
Late

992
00:38:58,816 --> 00:38:59,840
Crazy eye color

993
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:02,144
So no heat

994
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,168
Comes off of it

995
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,448
You know the light is

996
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:08,800
Do not know I get that yes but like

997
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:14,176
When were using our June oven like you can feel some heat it's pretty well insulated but you can still feel some heat

998
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:15,200
I just wonder if

999
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:17,248
It's any different from an outside

1000
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:18,016
Experience

1001
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:20,320
Oh I didn't touch the oven

1002
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:21,856
So I don't know I'm so

1003
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:23,136
That is okay

1004
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:26,208
I texted you know that I'm good you nice

1005
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:29,280
Okay we're going to move right along for a minute

1006
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:31,328
Caressing his oven

1007
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,352
2

1008
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:34,144
A story in the New York Times

1009
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,424
Which is a column

1010
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,704
By Farhad manjoo

1011
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:37,728
About

1012
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:38,752
The iot

1013
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:39,776
And

1014
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:41,568
I took away two things for this

1015
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:42,592
1

1016
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:43,360
I felt like

1017
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:45,152
He is a good barometer of where

1018
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:45,920
The rest of the

1019
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:50,528
Yes right and I was kind of surprised that people were like just coming around to the fact that

1020
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:51,808
People want to come put

1021
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:52,576
Computer center

1022
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:53,344
Everything internet

1023
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,392
Go to the Internet cuz I feel like we've been talking about that

1024
00:39:56,416 --> 00:40:00,000
We have but we're nitzsche friends

1025
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:03,328
There is a radical technologists in that regard

1026
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:07,936
Wow I've never been in The Fringe radical Technologies category I feel like

1027
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:09,216
But

1028
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:09,984
Finally

1029
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:11,008
I guess

1030
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:13,056
He's talking to people about

1031
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:16,896
Privacy and security and so he talked to Bruce

1032
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:17,920
Schneier who

1033
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:19,200
You know every year

1034
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:24,576
We don't we get some mainstream publication talking to him and realizing that this is a really bad idea to

1035
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:28,672
To put computers and everything and connected to the internet without any sort of

1036
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,976
So I'm hopeful

1037
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:34,304
In light of the Privacy hearings that are going on now

1038
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:36,608
And in light of this particular

1039
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:38,144
Column that we might

1040
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:38,912
Almost

1041
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:42,240
Be to the point where we can get some privacy and some

1042
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:45,312
Cyber security standards around connected devices

1043
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,336
That are legit

1044
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:48,640
Especially since California

1045
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:50,176
Did just pass their law

1046
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:51,968
So I don't know what do you think Kevin

1047
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:58,880
Yeah I mean in an ideal world and I know this is going to happen but in an Ideal World all the big companies involved here

1048
00:40:59,136 --> 00:40:59,904
Are we get together

1049
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,440
And say we need to work on the

1050
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:02,208
Together

1051
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:03,232
Because it's a problem

1052
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:05,280
For all of us the issue there is

1053
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:08,608
They want the data of course so they want if they don't

1054
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:10,400
Necessarily want all these

1055
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:12,448
Regulations and controls in place

1056
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:17,312
But again in an Ideal World I would like to see them do this as opposed to what

1057
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:19,872
Expect will happen if the government

1058
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:21,664
What governments will try and do this

1059
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:23,200
And they will do it

1060
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:25,760
Probably wrong and they won't take too long to do it

1061
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:28,832
So I'm actually worried that the government will work with these guys

1062
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:30,880
And they will do two things one

1063
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:33,952
They will just Outsource the writing of this legislation.

1064
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,000
Facebook and Google and Amazon

1065
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:37,536
And I'll fight it out amongst themselves

1066
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:39,072
And we'll get something but

1067
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:39,840
Not much as

1068
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:46,496
And I'm worried that they'll leave out like whole swathes of Industry where data is being collected

1069
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:48,288
And used in ways that are

1070
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:49,568
A little disconcerting

1071
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:50,592
So do you know

1072
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:53,151
Tell me about Dayton Burgers they won't think about right

1073
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:54,431
Hey John Hancock

1074
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:56,479
Spell pricing Insurance based on

1075
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:58,783
The data should we check that data is actually a

1076
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:00,063
Accurate mean something

1077
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,855
Actuarially

1078
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:02,879
Effectiveness

1079
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:03,647
That I don't know

1080
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:05,183
I think you are

1081
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:06,719
Your fears are valid

1082
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:12,351
I would love to see you and I don't know what the official name of the group is that consumer protection group

1083
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:18,751
Who's working with consumer reports and the

1084
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:20,031
Open technology

1085
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,055
Initiative oti

1086
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:23,615
And they are actually trying to create

1087
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:25,407
Some rules around this so

1088
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:26,943
Stay tuned for more on that

1089
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:28,735
Cuz I'm going to be talking to them

1090
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:31,039
About where that's heading and what we need

1091
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:32,831
Feel free to like

1092
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:33,855
Share your opinions on

1093

Good Lord

1094
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:37,439
It would be

1095
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:40,255
New laws are bad but having the wrong law

1096
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:42,047
When training a terrible loss

1097
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:42,815
Apetamin works

1098
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:43,839
Camille Garcia

1099

Let us move to this week

1125
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:34,783
Question

1126
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:36,831
Who is this from

1127
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:38,623
Ryan

1128
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:40,159
I guess rhinestone

1129
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:41,439
Murrieta California

1130
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:43,999
In addition to Smart doorbell

1131
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:44,767
I'd like to add

1132
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:45,791
Alzheimer's

1133
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:49,119
Health Access to power outlets isn't going

1134
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:53,471
Shout out those cameras

1135
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:54,495
Inside the home

1136
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:57,823
Any products that could help converts a light socket

1137
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:00,127
Thank you for the show

1138
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:04,223
Orion this is a really good question and it's also

1139
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:06,271
It's mostly good cuz it's really easy to answer

1140
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:09,087
On the security front

1141
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:10,367
Security camera front

1142
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:12,671
There are the Arlo cameras which you can

1143
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:15,231
Purchase and there are two versions

1144
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:16,767
About more than

1145
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:19,583
Persian chicken be looking for the wire free ones

1146
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:21,119
And they haven't

1147
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:24,703
Cheaper one that is battery powered I'm not going to recommend you go with that

1148
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:27,263
I recommend you go with the more expensive one

1149
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:28,287
That has a ring

1150
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:29,311
Rechargeable battery

1151
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:32,639
And the reason why is because the batteries on this thing run out like

1152
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:35,711
But there

1153
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:37,247
Good cameras there weather

1154
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:38,271
Weathersafe

1155
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:39,295
There

1156
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:41,343
I don't know what else to say about them

1157
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:43,391
If you don't want to do that and

1158
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:44,927
You want to stay in the same ecosystem

1159
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:48,767
My advice to you is going to be ring because they have their stick up cams

1160
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:50,815
That they have wireless ones

1161
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:52,863
But they also have a doorbell

1162
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:56,191
The two doorbells actually the older model and then a newer model

1163
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:57,983
That is battery powered so

1164
00:44:58,239 --> 00:44:59,263
You don't have to actually

1165
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:00,031
Wire it

1166
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:06,943
Raise the video doorbell the old one is $99 and the new video doorbell 2 is 199

1167
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:09,247
That has a quick-release battery which is nice

1168
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:10,015
Yes

1169
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:13,343
I do like those quick-release batteries and you can buy extra batteries in

1170
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:15,903
Just leave them charging and just swap them out

1171
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:17,183
Which is what I think peep

1172
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:18,463
So

1173
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:22,815
Those are your two like those are the two most pet adoptions I've tried all of

1174
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:24,095
That you're in

1175
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:25,119
It's pretty good

1176
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:28,191
Weather pretty good it's really good that means the ring is quality doorbell

1177
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:30,751
So if you have a front door that

1178
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:32,031
Get some sunlight

1179
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:35,871
Ring even sells a solar trickle charger for the video doorbell 2

1180
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:37,663
Hell yeah and for the cameras

1181
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:41,247
Oh yes I forgot about that solar panel

1182
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:42,527
I had that in my

1183
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:44,319
Part of my review kit but I never tried it

1184
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:46,111
Cuz yeah it's $50

1185
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:49,439
To add that it kind of fits around the entire base of the

1186
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:52,767
Video doorbell 2 and then there's a little solar panels on the top of it

1187
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:56,863
So there you go so good options for you Ryan or anybody else who's looking

1188
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:57,631
Looking for

1189
00:45:57,887 --> 00:45:58,399
Wireless

1190
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:00,191
Cameras outside your house

1191
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:01,215
N wireless store

1192
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:05,567
And we actually do get that question for a little time because a lot of people don't have

1193
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:10,431
Power to run for these or maybe there's no Outlet nearby or you don't want to have

1194
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:11,711
Chord

1195
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:13,759
Yeah right next to your front door for example

1196
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,575
Text your doorbell or camera whatever it is so

1197
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:19,647
It's a great question and we do get this one a lot I will say

1198
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:21,439
This is important for your wireless

1199
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:23,487
It might be thrilling

1200
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:27,327
To be like oh my God I could totally stick this up in a tree or someplace crazy

1201
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:29,119
Which is actually what I did with

1202
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:30,143
My first Arlo

1203
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:32,447
And then when the batteries ran out after like a month

1204
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:33,215
And a half I was

1205
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:38,847
So consider access to batteries

1206
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:39,871
When you're placing

1207
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:41,151
That's my

1208
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:42,175
Big word of advice

1209
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:43,455
Okay

1210
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:44,223
