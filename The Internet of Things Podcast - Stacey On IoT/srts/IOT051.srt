We're to talk about that on the show so this week's show we're going to talk about

10
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:36,608
What Apple didn't announce

11
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:37,376
With its

00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:38,400

00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:39,680
Weird to talk about

Retail and selling the smart home and we're also going to talk about cool kitchen devices that we saw at South by

15
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,360
And we may even get into

00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:49,408

19
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,272

22
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:58,624
Laura

00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,648
A low-power

24
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,184
Wireless area.

25
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:02,720
So stay tuned

26
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:03,488
It's going to be off

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,024
Okay Mike

28
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:05,792
Taking it off

29
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:06,816
Apple

30
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:09,376
Monday new smaller iPad

31
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:10,400
Smaller iPhone

32
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:11,424
No homekit

33
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,192
Were you surprised

34
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,472
I wasn't

35
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:15,520
I mean I think the last big

36
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:19,872
Apple shindig that had conference they mentioned it once in almost in passing

37
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,176
And I knew from coming

38
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:24,992
The previews are going to be about mobile devices and so

39
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:26,272
I didn't even TuneIn

40
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:27,296
Cuz at this point

41
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:29,344
I'm not expecting homekit news

42
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,392
So I wasn't surprised it didn't announce homekit news

43
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:35,232
Man I'm really disappointed mean if you were betting on homekit

44
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:39,072
It feels like we should be a little further along or am I just going to crazy

45
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:43,936
Well think back a year ago coming out of Cs last year

46
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:46,496
It felt like the story of the year

47
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:47,776
4 smart on this going to be

48
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:48,800
Homekit

49
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:50,080
There's so much excitement

50
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:53,920
A lot of companies were really a lot of startups for investing Alder

51
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,712
Development hours in Oak get in

52
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:56,992
The year went by

53
00:01:57,248 --> 00:02:01,088
It was it was fairly disappointing cuz there's a lack of news things move very slowly

54
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,368
And so

55
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,136
I think

56
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:06,208
I went to the energy Industries moved on but a lot of startups

57
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:07,232
Who were betting

58
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:09,024
I don't get a year ago

59
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:11,072
Have turn all of their resources elsewhere

60
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:11,840
For this point

61
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,376
They're turning the resources to

62
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:16,704
She Who Shall Not Be Named the Amazon Echo its

63
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,472
It seems like

64
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,288
Of all the smartphone platform set feels like

65
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:21,824
Where I'm seeing

66
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,872
The most kind of traction

67
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:26,176
I agree I mean the reality is

68
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:30,016
To roll out a hunka device is a little more involved in integration with

69
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:30,784
Amazon

70
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:34,624
Echo as simple as more of a software integration you do cloud-to-cloud with

71
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,416
Homekit it actually involves

72
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:37,440
Hardware near me

73
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,720
Balls of chips o

74
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:41,280
And if you're waiting for Apple to give you the green light

75
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:45,888
On that thing you're going to be trouble you can have a lot of money stuck in inventory

76
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,984
That isn't available ship so I see why companies moving on

77
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:53,312
Man so can apple come back from this do you think

78
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:56,384
It's Apple so you can't right now blog

79
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,664
Mom I think that

80
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:59,456
You know if they decide

81
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:00,992
Serious about this

82
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:02,272
Yeah I mean

83
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:04,320
It's funny I was talking to someone

84
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:07,904
Could meet some folks from Apple they said something to the effect like

85
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,440
Wow homekit

86
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:11,488
So you guys are really into the smart home and

87
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:12,768
I think the response was like

88
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,840
Well we're not really into the smart home so

89
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,376
It just feels like

90
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:19,424
There it was almost I bring this before

91
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:25,824
It feels like it's going to head for them they basically wanted their toe in the water to say hey were going to do something here in for bookmarking this

92
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,616
But they haven't really

93
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:31,712
Taking it too seriously and I think quite frankly it was more complicated than they thought I think

94
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:33,504
It's what's up with a rollout

95
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,064
Like a new accessory or new

96
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,088
Interface like

97
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,440
You know that dinner is about to do a smart on platform I think it's Walmart, catechism

98
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:43,488
Ecosystem have to juggle

99
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,024
Right and

100
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,816
The way they're going about it with

101
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:50,400
Security efforts and then having profiles for each individual device that

102
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,960
Built up and then certified is

103
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:53,728
Pretty

104
00:03:54,240 --> 00:04:00,384
That's pretty laborious both for apple and for the people who are going through the companies that are going to be home kits or

105
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,152
Daiso

106
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:06,272
Yeah I get it and see no just speaking of someone who's trying to make things work in her own house

107
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:09,088
You don't need things to play nicely together is not

108
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,672
It's not easy maybe we won't see this and maybe I should give up

109
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:18,303
Don't give up me to the credit I think that you know we should say that

110
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,095
Good for them for considering

111
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:23,679
Security and making out like that the number one priority cuz I think that's

112
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:25,983
Really it's first and foremost thing in their mind

113
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:26,751
That is so

114
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,543
I think that's probably why

115
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,847
A big reason why the movie Sully so I bought that

116
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:31,871
But also

117
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:32,895
You know seems like

118
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:34,175
Then she's moving on all of it

119
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:38,015
Yeah and they require a hardware that require an mfi search

120
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,039
Certified ship so

121
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,575
If your Hardware isn't

122
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,599
Going to be built with that

123
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,135
Then

124
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,439
You're never going to be

125
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:47,231
That device is never going to be home

126
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:48,511
So

127
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,583
All right moving on to

128
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:57,727
New things in retail when I was at South by I actually sat on a panel with someone from beta and I kicked myself

129
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:58,751
For not

130
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,799
Because the week before I was in Palo Alto

131
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:03,359
And I didn't go into the store

132
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:06,175
So for listeners who are like what the heck

133
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,455
This is beta

134
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,015
80

135
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:14,367
And it's a new kind of retail Concepts that

136
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:17,183
Shows off the connected devices

137
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,999
Before you buy them and they don't actually care if you buy them there

138
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:22,047
It's really all about the data for the

139
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:24,095
Mike you said you had written a bit about them

140
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,119
Yeah it is

141
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,399
Beta I believe it

142
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,423
A lowercase b

143
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:29,471
Please don't don't put a capital B on their Stacy

144
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:35,103
I always have trouble writing when I start them with the

145
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:36,895
But

146
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:37,919
I

147
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:41,247
Hammer and about them that you know the way they pitch the service is

148
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:43,551
Retail as a service so they basically

149
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:47,391
Biking it to it like a cloud where you basically can rent

150
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:50,207
Capacity in the form of shelf space

151
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,511
What I like about that is it's much

152
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:53,791
It's a showroom concept

153
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:54,815
So you can

154
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:55,583
Beastly

155
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:59,167
Take a product put it on the store shelves they don't only Midori

156
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:02,495
And say you're a big company or small company you want to see if you

157
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:05,055
Your company or your product is resonating with consumers

158
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:09,663
You can base it put it in beta and see how consumers react to it cuz they've invested a lot into

159
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,199
In the store

160
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,479
Engagement Analytics

161
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:13,247
So you can

162
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:16,831
Shopkins how much time consumers are spending in front of your device

163
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:19,903
I think that you did a blog post or an infographic

164
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,719
Or I can award at Israel Oscar

165
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:24,511
Can Oscars

166
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:28,607
Awarding the most engaging smart on products or more smart devices

167
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:32,959
Until they have really fine-tune analytics around how many time

168
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:35,775
Time people are spending with the price if you think it's really important in

169
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,567
It's a different kind of concept

170
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:40,383
Compared to regular retail which I don't think they get that detail

171
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,663
So I think it's

172
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,967
Victor Nutra Scott up for the iot age

173
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,015
Yeah a lot of the so

174
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,831
Kind of some of the things that are little bit different

175
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:51,647
From talking to the guy from beta

176
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:58,559
Ido if you wanted to do an order with Like Home Depot or Lowe's or another big box retailer

177
00:06:59,071 --> 00:06:59,583
You know

178
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:02,655
You will sit they ask you for a set amount of product so

179
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:04,959
How many units and it's usually quite a bit

180
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:06,495
And you ship it to them

181
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:07,519
And then

182
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:12,895
You actually don't have any sense of how it's doing as a manufacturer unless you like

183
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:15,199
Wander around all the stores and check out

184
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,479
Which is empty which is

185
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:20,063
Which cells are full that you don't get a lot of that data from the retailer

186
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:25,695
And the beta model is that you will get a lot of data it's not the same kind of data cuz

187
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:27,231
Betta isn't is concerned

188
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:27,999
But actually selling

189
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:28,767
Through

190
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:29,535
But

191
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:30,815
If your

192
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,631
If you've got a product that's kind of young

193
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,399
And you're like

194
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:36,959
Hey people are clicking on your video

195
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:39,263
But then they're just walking away and

196
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,567
Where they walk away in the middle of your video

197
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,359
You know that you was not properly

198
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,639
Only done well right

199
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,687
That people never pick up your device

200
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,479
You don't those kind of things are

201
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:49,759
Kind of really interesting

202
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:54,111
I will see if there correlated to higher sales or not I think that's still to be proven

203
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:58,463
Yeah I love what they're doing a mean one of the other things are requires that

204
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:03,071
The Product Company spend time in the store training their salespeople cuz

205
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,863
Unite no we go to the lake

206
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,143
Angelo's we go to

207
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:09,727
Some of these other stores big box retailers

208
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,775
A representative on the floor by the connect

209
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:14,079
They don't know what they're talking about but

210
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:17,407
Bouillabaisse reindeers make sure everyone on the show four is almost like someone

211
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,687
At a Genius Bar

212
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,991
And then Apple Store like really knows the product

213
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,271
I think that's

214
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:23,551
Really important

215
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:27,135
Cuz these products are so different and they require so much consumer education

216
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,927
Another thought I have is

217
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:33,279
I think this is going to be really interesting if the expanded footprint Beyond Silicon Valley

218
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,559
Impertinent

219
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,351
Yeah I mean

220
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:42,751
We all know if there's a better Google Engineers going in there that's a lot of a different than someone going in the middle Cleveland or or

221
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:45,823
Your Miami so I would be really interested to see how this

222
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:50,175
Scales as they moved to different geographies and I think it be hugely valuable to get data

223
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,967
From different cities

224
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:53,759
Around different products cuz I

225
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,807
You know something on Research I do

226
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,087
People react differently

227
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,879
Caprock stiffening what region they're from

228
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,159
Cuz I bring a lot of

229
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:03,743
Baggage depending on where they're from and they're kind of a lot of

230
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:07,071
The ways to think about products probably shaped by the way they're from

231
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:09,887
So I think it'll be interesting to see how they expand this outward

232
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,423
Yeah and this is

233
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:16,543
This is kind of in contrast to Target has their Smart Home store which I did pop my head into

234
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,079
Just to see what was there

235
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:21,407
Which is bear lab space for showing off Connect

236
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,431
Attitude products in

237
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,503
Their vision is all about showing how these products work

238
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,271
Together

239
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,551
The beta vision is just

240
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,831
The products individually

241
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:33,183
So I don't know if you have any thoughts on that the beta guy was like you know

242
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:36,255
I don't think people are really that's too big of a sail to be like

243
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,791
Hey this is going to work with this and this

244
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:39,327
The song

245
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,607
Play together

246
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:44,191
He's like you know people just want a one-off device for the most part today

247
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,519
So he he's like I don't think

248
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,847
Well I think they're different things I think

249
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,127
IPod idea

250
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,407
Showing consumers

251
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:55,455
Scenes and how things work together

252
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:58,527
Around consecrated use cases like in a baby's room

253
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:01,087
Waikiki tonight teens time to go to bed hers baby

254
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:03,135
But will you bring up Target

255
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:07,743
I just want to mention the secret of project that was in the news a couple weeks ago

256
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,791
Call Project goldfish

257
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:13,631
It's a secret project headed up by a guy named West Stringfellow

258
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:17,215
Have you heard about that Stacy

259
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:19,263
Heads down focused on some other stuff

260
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:20,543
Between now and then so

261
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,567
What is Project fi

262
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:26,687
Free which publication first broke I think it's movie twice or maybe actually Mini

263
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,711
Minnesota

264
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,479
Newspaper

265
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:29,759
It was discovered

266
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,551
Via a job posting on the

267
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,087
I'm a Target website

268
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:36,927
Or at a head of engineering sent you a CTL for a

269
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,463
Prodigal prodigal fish

270
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,999
The description was

271
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:42,559
Around the park was they wanted to reinvent retail

272
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,095
And use technology

273
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,631
Did you bring new experiences in

274
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,423
New products to Market

275
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,191
And

276
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,727
Is based in Silicon Valley

277
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,775
And it makes me wonder if there may be

278
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:55,615
Taking some of the things or warning in this lab which we talked about the connector

279
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:57,663
They're home store and maybe

280
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:01,759
Taking some other things maybe they're taking some contest from what they're seeing a betta who knows

281
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:04,575
It just will be interesting to see what they do is

282
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,879
It's a curious thing to look at each check it out

283
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:10,719
I am checking it out right now so yes I see West Stringfellow

284
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:11,999
Who is

285
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:14,047
Doing this it's pretty secretive

286
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,607
It came out while I was at South by so now I

287
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,679
Yeah there's not a lot of detail

288
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:25,055
That's looking at ways to streamline order fulfillment better manage inventory across all channels

289
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,335
That seems

290
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,639
I don't know I know that

291
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:30,943
Holiday season Target had been

292
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,479
Working on

293
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,271
Ways to manage inventory so

294
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:39,135
It's sometimes with ship items from the stores as opposed to from the

295
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:42,207
Warehouses to meet kind of demand

296
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:45,023
Especially if things weren't selling well in an area

297
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,559
But that is pretty in a

298
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:49,375
Yeah and

299
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:53,215
So it was also West repos one of their entrepreneurs in Residence

300
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,519
Another on Frontier residence

301
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,055
There is nothing called

302
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,847
Future future collab

303
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,639
Which is being put on by

304
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:03,711
Panda Adventure back by Target and audio

305
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:06,015
About Reinventing the food ecosystem

306
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,039
And that was

307
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,831
Being shepherded by another

308
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:10,879
Afternoon residence from Target to

309
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:17,279
It's interesting to see the stuff they're doing there they're trying to reinvent the food system another trying to create a new franchise with in Target

310
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,047
Targeted at

311
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,839
Recreating retail innocence

312
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:21,887
So pretty

313
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:22,911
I can't wait

314
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,959
OK in speaking of food

315
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:26,239
And food Tech

316
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:27,519
At South by Southwest

317
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:32,127
I ran into some cool companies and I thought of you because I went to your smart Kitchen Summit

318
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:34,431
Last November and it was awesome

319
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,479
And I saw a lot of these guys here

320
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:40,831
Size of Southwest that I've seen at the Smart Kitchen Summit such as teforia

321
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,903
Which makes the connected teapot for

322
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,695
Got it sells for an ungodly amount of money

323
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:49,023
I think it was pre-order for $700 at

324
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,559
MSRP is like

325
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,839
$1,400

326
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,631
Did you happen to eat

327
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,679
I did have some tea and

328
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:58,751
She made me green tea because I told her I didn't like green

329
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,799
She's like you will like the screen t

330
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:02,847
Like that green tea

331
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:07,967
If we did not hit did not turn me into a Believer I could tell it was different than the other green tea but

332
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:08,735
Yeah I wasn't

333
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:12,063
Truly honest was not sold

334
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,111
Are you seoul

335
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:14,879
Do you have one

336
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,159
It's a lot of money

337
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,695
So I probably won't buy one

338
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:19,231
I do have a

339
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:19,999
PECO

340
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:24,095
Brewberry Appliance coming soon I think they were there as well so I'm excited about that

341
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,887
I'm excited to brew my own beer cuz

342
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,423
I can see paint fabric

343
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,447
Preparing machine

344
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,471
I like beer

345
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:33,311
800 dollars for coffee maker that is not cam

346
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:34,847
So

347
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,127
I am totally fine

348
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,151
Spending a lot

349
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:37,919
And something that I really

350
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,295
Jacob Bernoulli

351
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:46,367
I was going to say speaking of alcohol

352
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,391
A company that

353
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:53,023
I was super pumped about this listeners of the show know that I am

354
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:56,351
Was there there a company that makes

355
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,887
These bottles

356
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:00,959
Toppers East Bluetooth powered bottle stoppers for your bar

357
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:01,983
And

358
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:06,847
In conjunction with an app you basically look up the cocktail you're trying to make so

359
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,895
Example that used with a sidecar

360
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,687
So you use cognac

361
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,991
In orange liqueur like a Grand Marnier or something

362
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:14,015
Lemon juice

363
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:14,783
So

364
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:20,671
I would have these Bernoulli bottle caps on top of my bottle of Cognac and on top of my bottle of Grand Marnier

365
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:21,695
And

366
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:24,511
Basically when I start pouring it

367
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,303
The app will tell the bottle cap

368
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:27,839
When to stop pouring

369
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,119
And then

370
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,143
It would be done

371
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,703
And then I picked up the other one and

372
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:34,495
It would be like I was she's got the

373
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:35,775
Grand Marnier

374
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:41,407
And I pour it and then the bottle cap stops the flow of liquid when I got however many ounces I think it's a

375
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,455
121 Conner a show there

376
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:48,063
I was just like yes this is awesome and it was eight of these bottle caps for

377
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,087
$300

378
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:50,111
But they won't ship

379
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:52,927
For a while they said the end of the year which I always add

380
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,463
Three months to

381
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:56,511
Yeah it's a different approach to

382
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:58,047
Common automated or smart bar

383
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:04,447
I mean another one to be the one from perfect company which they're also at the Summer Wars more descale ProScan like the Dropkick

384
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:07,263
Kitchen

385
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,543
In the Paso

386
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:09,567
Just tickets

387
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:14,687
It's a different approach I like the idea and I actually see commercial applications for the Bernoulli

388
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:19,295
ABC would love this because you couldn't have a heavy pour on your

389
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,831
You don't see all your alcohol with

390
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,903
Oh yeah you can also monitor how much liquor your

391
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:29,279
You're playing like if you're if you're trying to monitor how much alcohol is coming out like that might be like one way to do it

392
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:31,327
And make sure you get the Perfect Pour every time

393
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,887
Although I would say

394
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,679
My thoughts on this are kind

395
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,471
Conflicted because

396
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,775
I've use the cocktail function on the drop

397
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,567
Scale which is like the perfect

398
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:42,847
Do they have another

399
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,127
Perfect bacon

400
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,407
Pink Drink

401
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,431
Perfect drink

402
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:49,247
A perfect drink actually just do the deal with absolute

403
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,271
Sparta

404
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,295
To make better cocktails

405
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,063
Anyway

406
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:54,879
I kind of like the idea of doing

407
00:15:56,415 --> 00:16:00,511
Scale approach because if you want to make your cocktails and batch and then bulk you can

408
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:03,071
Kind of adjust the recipe in a way that I'm not sure you

409
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:03,839
You could do with

410
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:05,631
Bratayley house I haven't played with it

411
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,423
And I think

412
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,471
Pictures are way better than the massive

413
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:12,287
Robot bartending kind of machines that you

414
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,823
Keep cut your liquor into

415
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:14,847
And then

416
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:17,407
You program that basically the drinks are

417
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:19,199
It's like oh I got the following six

418
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,991
In a bottles in the back of

419
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,271
Here's what I can make

420
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,879
Yeah they drink robots are interesting

421
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:28,927
Did you try the Keurig kold

422
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:31,231
Cat CSI had a cocktail

423
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:35,071
Made For Me by the Kirkwood I left you that is pretty good that's obviously

424
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,095
They're mixing

425
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,375
It is a pond a system

426
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:38,655
Mixing like a

427
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,959
Margarita mix into a

428
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:41,983
Some liquor but

429
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:45,567
There's lots of different ways I think bars becoming interesting as we applied technology to it

430
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:48,895
Final news element for us is Bosch

431
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:51,199
Which is the Robert Bosch company in Germany

432
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:53,759
You guys maybe like what

433
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:57,087
But they've actually done a lot of really cool stuff with Kinect

434
00:16:57,343 --> 00:17:00,671
Two containers connected industry they call it industrie 4.0

435
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:02,719
All the German company Siemens

436
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:06,047
Bosch they're all like industry for a where I live

437
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:06,815
We are Manufacturing

438
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,351
My sensors

439
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:13,983
Bosch earlier this month they had their connection world event and they launched an iot cloud

440
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,263
Compete with

441
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:18,847
Looks like Kayla IBM's iot Cloud Amazon.

442
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:19,615
Pcloud

443
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,151
Azure has their eye on

444
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,455
So worth noting

445
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:26,015
Because Bob has such a play in

446
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:29,087
Automotive check-in sensors in manufacturing

447
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,879
Also because by golly

448
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,927
Who would have iot cloud

449
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,975
Take the GED

450
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:36,767
Of Europe you know they've been

451
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,047
Eating their own dog food

452
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:43,935
Could run iot for notices 2000-2018 they start requiring companies to get that expertise in house

453
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,215
And the other

454
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:47,519
Crater like these European Union wide

455
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:51,359
Charging networks with auto recharging all the stuff where they use iot technology

456
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:53,151
Looks like they're basically commercializing

457
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:56,479
I want what they've been warning or the past few years into their own cloud

458
00:17:56,735 --> 00:18:02,879
Yeah and Bayliss we are spending 548 million dollars on Innovation and connected stuff

459
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,159
Which

460
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,951
Is maybe a lot

461
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:12,351
You're like what

462
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,119
So

463
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,679
It's a no less than 1% of their actual Revenue

464
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,447
But still

465
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,983
I'm not going to stop at it be

466
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:18,751
Because

467
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:21,823
They're clearly big Believers in the technology

468
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:25,663
We should I pay attention to them I don't know

469
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:30,271
That's it for this week show and less Mikey

470
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,807
You got anything else you want to share

471
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,855
Now this is been a lot of fun

472
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:34,879
I'm glad to catch up with

473
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:38,463
Yeah it's been used to work together

474
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:42,303
Always followed him because he's such a smart home expert

475
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:46,143
Smart home show iTunes

476
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:48,703
And he does a lot of stuff with the connected kitchen

477
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:49,471
Which

478
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:50,495
I love so

479
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,287
Yeah we're having another event

480
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,823
This year what happened in October

481
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:54,591
Okay

482
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:55,615
I know where I'm going to be

483
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:56,383
Is in Seattle

484
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,663
Yes you're coming out

485
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:58,687
I am there

486
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:00,991
Okay

487
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:06,367
So stay tuned because next up is Daniel Conrad the CEO of beat networks and we going to talk about

488
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,391
1

489
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:10,719
How hard it was for him to actually get into building a network

490
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:11,999
Or that he was building a

491
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:13,023
Connected speaker

492
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:19,679
So entrepreneurs listen up and then to we're going to learn about Laura which is one of the low-power wireless area Networks

493
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:21,471
Yay

494
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:32,223
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast I have your host Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest

495
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,503
Is Daniel Conrad

496
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:34,527
Who is the

497
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:36,831
Co-founder and CEO of BP

498
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:37,599
Networks

499
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:39,647
Hey Stacy

500
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:42,207
I am super excited to have because

501
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:45,279
We are going to talk about low power Wireless

502
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:49,119
Area networks which is so hard to say about your

503
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,143
Torturous Journey

504
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,191
Torturous

505
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:52,959
Torturous

506
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,031
Maybe I'll find it

507
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:57,823
Cruise

508
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:02,687
From any entrepreneur is the journey is a bit torque rest so I'll take it

509
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:04,479
Okay alright so

510
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:06,271
Google first started

511
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:08,575
It wasn't deep networks it was just beep

512
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:09,855
Correct

513
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:11,391
Okay and so

514
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:14,207
You may remember beef is this tiny beautiful

515
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,231
Basically

516
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:17,023
Wifi-connected speaker

517
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:17,791
And

518
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:21,375
Now it doesn't exist or it exists for

519
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:24,959
For a couple customers who bought it but Daniels you want to tell us what happened

520
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:32,127
Sure you are motivation throughout the history theater around like what is going to be the next

521
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:33,919
Platform

522
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:35,455
Transition that we see

523
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:37,759
And ever really excited up packet

524
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:40,063
The computers are a few bucks now

525
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,343
And they can be put inside of it

526
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:47,743
And what

527
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:49,791
First incarnation of

528
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:52,863
Deep was to take the functionality of Sonos

529
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,399
Put it on a check

530
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,447
And then

531
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:58,495
Bake that into

532
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:00,543
Every speaker that isn't Sonos

533
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,311
In the world

534
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,847
What's that connect everything

535
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:05,663
So it's kind of like we're going to be

536
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,711
The other speakers

537
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:10,015
What's first shot across the bow was the

538
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:14,367
Nexus line instead of the reference design which is this

539
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,903
The Shining

540
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,952
Copper on dial

541
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,144
Simultaneous

542
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:29,984
Music streaming is one of the most difficult things that you can do online

543
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:34,336
For any

544
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:35,360
Problems with it

545
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:36,896
Really really low

546
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,944
Virginia Russian music

547
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,712
You want to

548
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,760
You want to throw that thing out the window

549
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:47,392
Interesting technically challenging project

550
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,952
The problem was Ben Larkin

551
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,744
In a while we're working

552
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,280
Apple and Google

553
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:56,352
Amazon removing A Space Odyssey

554
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:58,656
You know the goal wasn't just to be

555
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:02,240
Computers

556
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:07,104
And speakers typically have microphones and to move in the direction where

557
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:09,664
In multiple rooms of the house you have a difference

558
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:11,456
Facing west

559
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:15,808
That are with with Chromecast

560
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:20,928
Google News aggressively into the space with Amazon moving into voice

561
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:25,024
It was pretty clear that the market opportunity for us is going away

562
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,048
So

563
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,072
We ended up

564
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,352
Having a sunset

565
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:30,912
Doctors

566
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:32,192
Give me

567
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:35,776
Couple of years into developing a shipping product

568
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:37,824
How many dollars investors money

569
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,104
When is the bad Andre

570
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:41,664
That was the other day

571
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,944
So that were

572
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,272
Really sad to see us go

573
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:49,600
Is this reality was able to build a large

574
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:52,416
Music streaming product

575
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:54,464
We're going to need to go in a different direction

576
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:57,280
So that has got to be

577
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:04,192
Tough how did your investors driving did your investors tell you this did you guys just wake up one day and realize it like

578
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:07,008
How did you both come to this realization and then how

579
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,544
Did you communicate it

580
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:09,568
2

581
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,848
Your masters

582
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,128
Customers in

583
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:13,408
To your employees

584
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:16,992
Realizations don't ever really happen overnight

585
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:23,392
Build over time and then something clicks and you have a decision to make

586
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:28,000
Came from our own understanding the market we

587
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:30,048
Do it better than anyone

588
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:33,376
Face the reality that

589
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:37,472
With a team are size trying to go up against Giants who

590
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:39,776
We're willing to lose money on every device

591
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:45,920
And then try to push distribution and Partnerships with the love of Louie needs to be successful

592
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:47,200
Was

593
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:49,760
Not going to be the best use of the team that we assembled

594
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:51,296
So then you decided

595
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:52,832
Oh my gosh look

596
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:54,368
Let's do a low-power wide area network

597
00:23:55,136 --> 00:24:01,024
Not quite that simple recently Actiontec sometimes I sent an email to my investor

598
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,560
And basically

599
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,352
Given the reasons that

600
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:06,400
We were going to pull off of music

601
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:11,520
Then we set ourselves a very tight timeline to explore other options

602
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:13,056
And

603
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:19,200
To find UniFirst a technical Direction I'm a business Direction and then to get the point where we thought

604
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:22,272
We were convinced that there would be the smallest

605
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:27,648
So we were familiar we are aware of

606
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:29,184
Somebody's radio technology

607
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:33,280
We heard the specs and we didn't believe him

608
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:34,304
Because

609
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:40,704
That's always the case of me radio technology we explored a few other things we are building drones here for a while

610
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,008
Define radios

611
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:43,776
As well

612
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:45,056
A few things

613
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:46,848
Eventually couldn't get

614
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:48,640
Lora radios

615
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:50,688
At the time that we start looking at this

616
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:55,040
So some books in Europe that had

617
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:57,600
Souderton chips out on board we got those

618
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:58,368
Shipt

619
00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,392
Over here

620
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,792
And I dropped one of my desk and started driving

621
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,840
We got about a mile away

622
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:10,144
And we're still getting signal through and we said

623
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:13,216
I think there's something here

624
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:14,496
Alright so

625
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:19,104
For the people who are not aware of the we've talked about it a couple times on the show Laura is

626
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:20,896
One type of radio

627
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:22,944
Technology for these low power

628
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,968
Wide area Networks

629
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:27,808
Others are put forth by sick Fox

630
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:28,832
There is

631
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:29,856
Ingenue

632
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,648
Which is doing

633
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,184
Completely different standard

634
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,000
And then there's also things like lte-m

635
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,888
So other standards and those are for the cellular

636
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:44,448
Maverick so basically there's a bunch of different ways

637
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:45,472
If you want to send

638
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:47,264
Very small amount of data

639
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:50,592
A certain distance usually a far distance

640
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:51,616
Away

641
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:53,408
This is what we're talking about doing

642
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:54,944
And so

643
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,224
To help people out

644
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:57,248
Why

645
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,272
Why do we need

646
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,600
So the first thing is

647
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:05,440
AR

648
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:08,512
We saw some the couches Wi-Fi reliability

649
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,608
That's complicated annoying

650
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,144
Cellular is

651
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:18,752
You just

652
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:22,848
You'll get a SIM card and stick it in and or or activate your device in

653
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:28,480
And you're good to go for you

654
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:29,504
But

655
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:31,808
Cellular has a limitation

656
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,088
The matter a lot

657
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:34,880
When you're talking about

658
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:38,208
Devices that don't need a lot of bandwidth that do need

659
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,744
To be battery powered

660
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,024
So you guys

661
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,048
Focused on

662
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,096
Basically sending small amounts of data

663
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:44,864
Step wooden

664
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,960
Consume battery power

665
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:49,728
Video

666
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,264
Is chyler Leigh

667
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,544
Cancel Google messaging

668
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:56,896
Or

669
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:57,920
Anything like that

670
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:02,272
It's complicated to build a wireless network so what are the challenges that you guys have to

671
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,552
To deal with cuz I'm thinking

672
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,880
You know in a traditional cellular network you got Tower sighting

673
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:07,904
You got to deal with

674
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,440
Multiple radios

675
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:10,720
Fourier

676
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:12,000
PlayStation speaker

677
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:14,304
If the client devices

678
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:20,192
Is all of that the same and then I guess we can talk about the authentication and billing cuz that's another big problem

679
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:21,216
So

680
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:24,288
It's easier for the developer but it's not easy for the network operator

681
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:25,056
Which is what you're trying

682
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,640
Kind of

683
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:30,176
I believe so

684
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:31,200
And I think that

685
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:33,248
Persistent

686
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,832
The benefits are you can get two years of battery life

687
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,368
On an implant device

688
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,136
And

689
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:42,720
You're not going to be able to do that was a lot

690
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:47,072
Or a number of different applications were actually installing sensors in

691
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:49,120
Warehouses right now

692
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:53,216
Last for 5 plus years into the installation

693
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:55,776
When I say installation I mean we just put them where we want them

694
00:27:56,032 --> 00:28:02,176
And the networks that are out

695
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:04,736
It's just like

696
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:07,808
Dissenters and don't think about it for 5 years

697
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,600
There are other things like

698
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:13,952
If you need productivity in an area that Verizon isn't

699
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:16,000
If you have an area that Verizon

700
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:18,048
Cover you never will

701
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:23,936
Get them to cover it right

702
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:26,752
Put a sensor that you pay a buckle up for

703
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:28,800
I'm in your Fielder

704
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:30,336
So there a couple things

705
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:31,616
There are few of these

706
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:32,896
Value areas

707
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,944
Taylor just doesn't work

708
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,504
And the reason that we have the standards

709
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,320
The developing things like

710
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:46,208
A bureau in all of the new coyote standard for cellular is because they recognized

711
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:47,744
And

712
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,536
They know that they need to get one

713
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,096
Questions when will they do it

714
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:53,632
Royalty ever really

715
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:56,192
Become a first-class citizen on cellular data

716
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:57,472
Smart Start

717
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,296
So the technology that we're building what we're focused on here

718
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:12,832
Deep Network

719
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:14,880
Is is about

720
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:18,464
Basically making not as easy as possible

721
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,280
As simple as possible

722
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:23,328
Either so that means

723
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,120
Maximizing the range

724
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:26,400
Small

725
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:27,680
Changes in

726
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:28,960
Range

727
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:30,496
Huge impact

728
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:31,776
On the number of

729
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:34,848
Powers that you need to cover an area like where

730
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:36,640
Working here in San Francisco

731
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:39,456
Weed in the early testing

732
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,480
About a mile range

733
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,296
Our current testing we're getting as much

734
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,088
Outdoors

735
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:48,160
This has been a very high interference environment

736
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,696
Out in

737
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:54,048
Rural areas New Egypt

738
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:01,728
Situation

739
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:02,752
Maricela

740
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:03,776
Wow

741
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:08,896
So yeah so this is

742
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:12,224
Unlicensed spectrum and yet they have better range than

743
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:17,344
Cellular Sales

744
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,112
Is

745
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:19,648
Crazy low power

746
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,672
Weave

747
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,488
You said between 1 kilobyte of data

748
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:25,280
Are kilobits per second to

749
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:28,864
300 kilobits per second but we haven't achieved that because that's

750
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:30,144
Really close

751
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:33,216
What are people doing with this in

752
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:35,520
One of my big issues

753
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:38,080
With these kind of low-power Wireless

754
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,616
Area networks is

755
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:42,688
I just have a hard time believing that someone who

756
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,736
Has connectivity is going to be like

757
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:45,504
Hey

758
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:47,552
We're good that's enough connectivity

759
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:50,112
I cool just sending this one piece of data over

760
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:51,648
Cuz usually people are like

761
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,952
In tennis one piece of data over

762
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:55,232
What if I want to send

763
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:56,768
Another sensor

764
00:30:57,024 --> 00:31:01,632
Or what if I want to send multiple pieces of data or maybe collect that data more times a day

765
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:02,912
How does that go

766
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:05,472
And I look at it the same way I

767
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:07,264
I think that what you just said is

768
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:10,848
Dr. orsi

769
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:14,688
I have a sensor the telling me what temperature it is in suddenly I

770
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:16,480
I need videos

771
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:19,040
I have one sensor

772
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:21,344
And I want Chad and I want 200

773
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,112
And so

774
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:25,440
Architecture that we're working with

775
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:30,560
The network Protocols are built on top of these radios are designed to scale on number of devices

776
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:32,608
Device

777
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:33,632
You get

778
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:35,168
Tens of thousands of devices

779
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:36,192
Connecting to a gateway

780
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:37,216
That's how we think

781
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:39,520
Now frequency

782
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:45,664
What's great is that when you can actually

783
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:47,200
We need the same thing.

784
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:49,760
Effectively

785
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:53,600
I just got just fill-in more gateways as we get to capacity so

786
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:58,464
And how do you think about the competing networks cuz you guys are building your network

787
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,768
The first net worth you have in San Francisco

788
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:03,328
Can you guys all coexist does that make sense

789
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:06,656
The technologies have different advantages

790
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:08,704
Sigfox

791
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:11,264
Is a very low data rate

792
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:13,056
Radio Sol

793
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:21,760
The Laura has has been more flexibility you can actually change the data rate and trade it also

794
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:26,368
Range and software function of the radio

795
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,160
And then in

796
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:31,488
Ingenue ingenu is working with her on

797
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:32,768
Critical Ops

798
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:35,840
Thailand house in the building on a network on it and

799
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:39,168
So if you end up with a different kind of ecosystem when you're

800
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,704
When you're doing that when the

801
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,752
The chips are available from the carrier

802
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:44,544
What kind of all

803
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,824
Apartments together

804
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:48,896
I think that there I have not

805
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:51,456
Got any testing with their technology I believe it's

806
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:53,504
For my understanding from

807
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,272
The way there

808
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:56,064
Describe it as entire throughput

809
00:32:56,576 --> 00:33:00,672
Operate on 2.4 Spectre witches or Wi-Fi is so their pluses and minus

810
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:01,696
SLAP 2

811
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:07,840
What's exciting is ever going to get a new kinds of networks that aren't cellular that have different structures we're going to get

812
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:11,680
A variety of competitors and we're building up its Network

813
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:17,056
So

814
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:18,592
It's not about

815
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:22,688
Being limited to the conductivity auctions we have today

816
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:26,528
Explosion of new opportunities and new ways to

817
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:27,552
Connect devices it

818
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:28,576
We're not available.

819
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:36,768
That's awesome

820
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:38,304
Digikey

821
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:40,096
What was crazy to me

822
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:43,168
Few companies in Silicon Valley

823
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,728
Are aware of or working on

824
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:47,520
The psychology because

825
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:51,360
So from your perspective if it's so easy to start up this network

826
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:53,920
And I can go out and buy these chips and

827
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:54,944
Volume

828
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,736
They're relatively inexpensive

829
00:33:56,992 --> 00:34:01,344
Your expertise what are you going to be selling what your business model and then what's your competitive advantage

830
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:09,280
The hardware you like that you know you by the chip in at Dunston masne and communicates the

831
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,560
Leslie Erin

832
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:11,328
And receive them

833
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,632
The network protocol that sits

834
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:17,472
Implemented

835
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:19,008
I'm in any

836
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:19,776
Like

837
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:21,056
Play open

838
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:21,824
What are

839
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:25,664
So we've done our own implementation of the network protocol is that

840
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:27,712
Radios

841
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:29,248
So then what do you sell

842
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:32,832
Since the day we have we are your date appointments

843
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:33,600
Sensor

844
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:35,392
Solutions.

845
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:41,536
Solutions like we Droppin hardware and give you a login to a. Where the shows your

846
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:43,072
Your data

847
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:46,400
For some customers that's what they're going to want

848
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:52,800
Four four other customers going to want it she said that so they might want to do

849
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:53,568
They might want

850
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:57,408
The Builder of sensor and use steroid hardware and just

851
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:59,200
Connecticut.

852
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:00,992
Are libraries to basically

853
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:02,016
Activity

854
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:04,064
Hard thing that were solving is

855
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,088
Getting

856
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,672
Where we see our value is doing

857
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:12,000
The hard work of conductivity making that really seamless

858
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:13,280
That was a long way of saying

859
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:14,304
Flexible

860
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:16,864
Start up

861
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:17,632
Figuring it out

862
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:20,192
That's the moron

863
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,472
We accept

864
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:23,008
On the show

865
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,032
Okay

866
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:26,080
So now we have a sense of why this matter

867
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:27,104
What's your doing

868
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,384
What Laura is

869
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:29,408
And

870
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:33,760
Possibly how you're going to make money and apparently a very passionate call to action for other people

871
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:35,296
This is great radio technology

872
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:37,600
You should look at it Daniel thank you so much

873
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:38,624
For coming on the show today

874
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:39,648
Thank you

875
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:40,672
I enjoyed it

876
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:41,440
What's good to catch up

877
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:47,840
Thank you so much for listening to this week's podcast will see you next week
