So this week we have a lot to talk about we have some

6
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:19,200
New Gear from August

00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:21,760
Connect

8
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:23,040
Really exciting stuff

9
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:23,808
From

10
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:24,832
What do we have

11
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:26,112
770

12
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:27,904
Company

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:28,928
Has been called the Apple

14
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:30,464
Home automation

15
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,744
And I have been

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,304
Playing around with my Apple homekit stuff

17
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,840
We're going to talk quite a bit about that

18
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:37,632
Because there's quite a bit to talk about

19
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:39,680
And I am dying to hear all that

20
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:42,752
Cuz homekit has been really slow to get going

21
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:44,544
So you want to do the news first

22
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,848
Where do the news really fast

23
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:48,128
I can wait a little longer

24
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:50,176
Alright so

25
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:50,944
For August

26
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:51,968
August

27
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:57,088
The Smart Lock Company it was designed with Yves Behar and and locks

28
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,112

29
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:03,488
On the inside and the outside of your door replaces your Bluetooth certified so

30
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:05,024
You just like walk up to it

31
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,072
It's pretty cool

32
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:09,376
I tried it Kevin have you tried it or seen it next

33
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:12,192
I have not and I would like to August

34
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:12,960
Is making

35
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:17,056
Three things so we're going to talk about three whole things August has a brand new lock out

36
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:17,824
Is home

37
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,592
Certified

38
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:19,872
That locks going to be on sale

39
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:20,896
229

40
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:24,224
It has a video doorbell that's going to be on sale and it's

41
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:24,992
Wired in

42
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:25,760
We're going to get to White

43
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:27,296
And

44
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:30,880
We mentioned this actually a couple shows ago because our buddy Dave.

45
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:31,648
Is so smart

46
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:33,184
Comes the FCC database

47
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:33,952
Agape

48
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:34,976
Keypad

49
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:36,512
It works with their lot

50
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:38,048
And that's going to be $79

51
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,608
And if upgraded their bridge if

52
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:41,632
If you want remote app

53
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:45,728
It's important you don't actually have to buy the bridge

54
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:46,496
If you don't want

55
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:48,544
Angie bought the video doorbell

56
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,080
Set up bridges for WiFi

57
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:52,128
Is Bluetooth only

58
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:55,200
But if you want WiFi access and you would want this if you want to

59
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:55,968
See like

60
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:57,504
If you want a remote control your life

61
00:01:58,784 --> 00:01:59,296
Control your life

62
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:00,064
What Bluetooth only

63
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,880
So if you want ad that Wi-Fi you got to get either the bridge

64
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:03,904
Or the video doorbell

65
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,928
Both of those things

66
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:05,696
Trinidad wife

67
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:11,328
I could also see another reason for wanting the Wi-Fi if you have a bigger house or you have a large yard in your Outback

68
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:12,608
Bluetooth might not cut it

69
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:14,656
Would you want to

70
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:15,680
Open your door from that

71
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:18,496
I might if it's a pizza guy and I'm out back with all my friends

72
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:19,776
OKC and that's

73
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,312
So that gets to the second

74
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:22,080
Things in August

75
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:25,152
These Partnerships is called August Act

76
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:27,200
In August whole goal

77
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,992
Cuz you can't just make smart locks

78
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:31,552
In this world you have to have like a Grand Vision to transfer

79
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:32,320
Farm Society

80
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:36,672
So all his Grand Vision is to Lake make you feel comfortable letting people inside your home

81
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:37,696
Pizza dude

82
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:38,976
Or the FedEx guy

83
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:43,584
Or like a whole plethora of San Francisco tech companies like

84
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,632
Postmate sir Alfred a rinse

85
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,168
All these companies

86
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:49,728
People in Middle America are like these companies and what do they do

87
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:52,288
Delivery services

88
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,056
Laundry service

89
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:54,336
Courier Service

90
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,616
Dresses

91
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:56,896
You can basically

92
00:02:57,152 --> 00:03:03,296
Tell ring your doorbell if you're like it's the Postmates guy they deliver anything

93
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:05,088
And you can just let them in your house

94
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:08,928
Give them that so you give them instant access with your August lock they can open the door

95
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:12,256
They can drop the costs are boss and then they leave and you

96
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,792
You can watch them go and then

97
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:14,560
Score

98
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:18,144
I got my cough syrup and I never had two egg get out of bed or maybe weren't even

99
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:24,800
Yeah I was just going to say this is the ultimate for lazy people because you not only are you so lazy you can't get cough syrup you have someone bring it to

100
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:27,616
You're too lazy to even open the door for Speed

101
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,920
Or maybe you're not

102
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,712
That maybe you're not well

103
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:33,248
Maybe you're not you're in bed

104
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,016
And that's why your

105
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,576
Right now actually said this is

106
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:40,672
By the time the stairs I'll be back but I'm on vacation right now in Florida and

107
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:42,720
I've had to I was on a roller coaster

108
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:43,488
Sister both times

109
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:44,768
This happened which is a shame

110
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,584
Because my doorbell my video doorbell

111
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:48,864
And

112
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,448
Afterwards I get the notice I was at the door so I couldn't actually talk to

113
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,472
While they were

114
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:58,592
Tell them to like leave it on the doorstep but like I got to FedEx packages sitting on my doorstep

115
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,384
Right now that I'm keeping an eye on

116
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,664
Using my video doorbell

117
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,224
It would have been really nice if I weren't on the roller coaster

118
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:07,040
And I had an August lock or some Smart Lock

119
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,064
I could let them

120
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:08,832
Access

121
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:09,600
I could be like

122
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,392
Hey actually just drop it

123
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:13,184
You know just open the door you got access

124
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,232
Just for like 5 minutes just open the door

125
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,256
Drop it inside

126
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,791
And I close the door and door lock

127
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,071
That would be amazing

128
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,095
But I was just

129
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:27,519
That would be cool refresh my memory the August lock this is the one that has batteries inside because

130
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:31,359
It has a mechanical mechanism to actually move the bolt

131
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:32,639
It does this fit

132
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,919
Over your dead body

133
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,967
This is not so there to kind of

134
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:36,735
Weather

135
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:41,855
The two kinds that I most commonly replacing are

136
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:44,415
You take your entire deadbolt lock mechanism

137
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:46,207
August is the other

138
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:47,999
Over the exist

139
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,071
So this is a little bit easier to install

140
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:53,375
Are people who are may be intimidated by take

141
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,143
Making a screwdriver

142
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,167
Screen door lock

143
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:57,983
Yeah I guess so it fits basically fits over

144
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:00,799
Well actually now I'm looking as you mentioned I went to their site

145
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,079
You still have to

146
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:07,455
Open up the the Depo mechanism from both sides of your door to install this

147
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:10,015
Yeah but it doesn't look complicated mean is not

148
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,551
Challenger install a deadbolt

149
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,319
No

150
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:16,415
No I have I have literally in back when we talked about homekit we're going to talk about

151
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:17,951
Installing yet another

152
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:21,279
So I install locks with

153
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,071
It is not

154
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,631
Yeah this looks this looks sad painless

155
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:26,655
It is very painful

156
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:28,191
When did they give you like

157
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:32,543
Did I think they give you everything you may need a screwdriver but I can't remember they may actually

158
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:34,847
I can't quite recall

159
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:41,247
Obviously I'm excited about the video part because that's what I need and really that's the only place on my door that I have

160
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:44,319
Room to actually put oneself

161
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,087
Video doorbell

162
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,391
And so the competitors here are going to

163
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:50,719
Ring ring just got money from Richard Branson

164
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,255
199 bucks

165
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,535
There's skybell

166
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,815
Also 199

167
00:05:56,095 --> 00:06:01,471
Vivint offers one and then later next year so 2016 we're going to have something from

168
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:02,495
Chamberlain

169
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:03,775
It's called the notify

170
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:07,871
So every single one of these is a little bit different I'm hoping to do a

171
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:10,431
Comparison chart I should also mention that you

172
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,711
Pre-order all of August

173
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,991
Krista as a

174
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,527
Actually now but

175
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:18,623
The stuff will ship over the next eight weeks so the doorbell is actually going to be the last

176
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,391
Bishop and ask

177
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:20,927
Mid December

178
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,487
So that's August

179
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:24,767
Weight limit one more time

180
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:29,375
Only only cuz I just noticed it on their blog as you were talking about it's obviously I'm very interested since the

181
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:30,399
Precise

182
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:35,263
I see that they have their Smart Lock integrated into the Xfinity home app

183
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:38,079
It now works with Nest cam as of October 1st

184
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:40,127
They have an Android app all new

185
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,431
And I was 9 support soap

186
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,991
This looks like a this is one of my Christmas wish

187
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:49,599
Oh yeah and I should actually say so the homekit version of the lock there's a version 1

188
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:50,879
That has been out for a while

189
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:53,183
That's actually 199 they're going to keep

190
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:55,231
Keep selling it there's a new version

191
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,511
Does homekit certified

192
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,047
It's 229

193
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:05,215
So you may be able to actually if you're not really interested in the homekit part go with the 229 there's some slight

194
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:06,495
Mechanical differences to

195
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:08,031
About it so you know

196
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:08,799
Keep that in mind

197
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,079
Soon as I get my video camera

198
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,103
The video cameras

199
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:11,871
Two separate things

200
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,919
So if you want the lock and the video camera

201
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,199
You're looking at like

202
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:15,967
$400

203
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,527
The video doorbell is

204
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:19,551
199

205
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,343
So you can you don't need lockplus

206
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:22,623
You could just get the video

207
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:26,719
This is true I just have to see what it looks like cuz all them been too wide for the

208
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:28,511
Wood paneling on my outside of my door

209
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:31,071
I have seen what it looks like but I don't have the actual

210
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,119
That's okay we'll figure it out

211
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,655
You was you will see on the website

212
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,959
Go to the website

213
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:38,239
Get thee to the website

214
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,263
Okay

215
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,031
So

216
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:45,151
Other news will go zip right through this Savant which is the apple of home automation

217
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:48,479
They did Steve Jobs

218
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:50,527
Castle

219
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:55,647
Hi and they actually went a little lower into like last year

220
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,927
And by lower end

221
00:07:59,231 --> 00:07:59,743
$200 /

222
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:00,767
Korean

223
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:01,535
Yeah

224
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,303
So

225
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:03,583
White Louis

226
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:08,191
They actually just teamed up with ammunition which is the Design Group that did

227
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:10,495
Beats headphones

228
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:11,775
EReader

229
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:16,895
This kind of comes together because the former CEO of Barnes & Noble is now.

230
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:17,919
CEO at savant

231
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,991
They have created a 499

232
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,527
Remote control

233
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:23,295
And

234
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:24,575
Tub unit

235
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:29,439
The actually looks pretty good and looks like it is going to compete with like the Logitech

236
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,719
Ultimate Harmony

237
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:31,743
Remote

238
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:32,511
And

239
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,047
I bring this up because

240
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:36,607
I said a lot of pretty good things about the Logitech

241
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,631
Gear

242
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,423
Which was kind of a hug for your hubs

243
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,215
And brought together all your abs

244
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:46,079
This is less a hub for your hubs but it does bring together all of your AV stuff

245
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,359
It kind of works with like

246
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:50,687
Your shoe lights and nests and other stuff and Saban is

247
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:52,735
Really good at the software behind

248
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:53,759
Home automation

249
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:56,831
So I haven't tried it yet but I want to try it

250
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:59,135
I'm going to try to get a review unit so I can try it

251
00:08:59,391 --> 00:08:59,903
Because

252
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,695
This looks really compelling but it also

253
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:05,279
It does end and you're actually the

254
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:09,631
Probably the target for this because you prefer not to use your phone for controlling things

255
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,935
You have a remote with us so

256
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,471
When she's a remote

257
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:14,495
And

258
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,775
I haven't fallen in love

259
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:16,543
With any of

260
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,847
I haven't fallen in love with Alexa

261
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,407
It's a good solution but I haven't

262
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:22,687
Loft

263
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:25,247
So and like

264
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,527
I have a Sonos

265
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:28,831
Shoes

266
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,111
Roku's I have

267
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,391
Add a lot of these devices

268
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:35,487
And my husband

269
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,279
His ears perk up with a v

270
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:38,559
Supposed to

271
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:43,167
Sure we'll see so that's the Savant stuff it's out

272
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:46,751
It's 499 you can pick it up on their website Best Buy

273
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:47,775
Magnolia

274
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:51,359
Yeah so now

275
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,383
Are we ready Kevin

276
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,663
Let's do it

277
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,687
Tomcat time

278
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,711
Who killed

279
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:56,479
All right

280
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:57,247
So

281
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,271
Deep breath

282
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,807
I tested

283
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:02,879
A couple things I tested the Lutron Bridge

284
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,159
I tested the

285
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,695
Schlage sense

286
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:07,999
Lock and I tested the Hue Bridge

287
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:12,095
Are the Hue Lights so those are my three homekit things I tested all of this

288
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,119
On an iPhone

289
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,399
Set

290
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,191
So there's a reason I'm telling you all this

291
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,239
That's part of town

292
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,895
When I install I'll give you the individual

293
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,687
Does the Hue Bridge

294
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:29,247
I don't know if I'm actually going to buy it that's the first thing

295
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:32,063
I mean I am going to buy it because

296
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,343
Reviewer and I feel like it's

297
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:34,367
Get better butt

298
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,135
Like

299
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,671
Comes very little into my

300
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:39,743
Like day-to-day life because you already worked with

301
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,535
My Amazon Echo I didn't

302
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,815
Find talking to

303
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:44,095
To Siri to be better than

304
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:44,863
In talking to

305
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,423
Talking to my echo

306
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,703
And that's because

307
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,471
I don't always

308
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,519
Around

309
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:53,823
Because Siri on my phone

310
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:54,591
Requires me to pay

311
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,383
With one exception

312
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:59,455
And that is if your phone is plugged in at the time

313
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:01,503
Yes but the new iPhones

314
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,039
SpaceX as the 6s

315
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,575
Plus do support

316
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,391
A phrase for her to be activated

317
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:09,695
When they are not plugged in you do have to

318
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:10,463
A train

319
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,231
Her

320
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:12,767
To recognize your voice

321
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:14,815
Yeah sure

322
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:20,703
If a train blah blah to recognize your voice which is actually good thing so that way Stacy you couldn't walk into a room and say hey blah blah

323
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,239
And have your husband

324
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,519
Phone start doing things

325
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:27,359
It's all individually pair to your voice which is a good thing

326
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:30,175
But I agree that the limitation on all of the other eye

327
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,991
And iPads and iPod Touches

328
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:36,319
The battery plugged in or obviously you can double press the button

329
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:39,135
Yo bring blah blah up

330
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,415
So here's the second one

331
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:43,231
What is a bit of a smart alec

332
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:44,511
So

333
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:45,279
Yes

334
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,047
The echo

335
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,071
Is actually

336
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:47,839
Pretty nice is

337
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:48,607
Is a robot in the

338
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,911
Hurts when I say

339
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:51,935
Turn on the lights

340
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,215
If she can't find the lights

341
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,751
She just goes to the

342
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,287
And you get that like the next

343
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:57,823
Or sometimes

344
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,359
She's like I can't discover the lights

345
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,151
Or she can she says

346
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,199
Now blah blah

347
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:05,247
Must give you some running commentary like

348
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:08,575
Some of the lights don't seem to be interested in turning on

349
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,647
Or I turned on some of the lights

350
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:12,671
The other lights

351
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,695
Art responding

352
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,999
I mean that's useful information

353
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,791
But I prefer the

354
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:20,863
The Amazon Echo for this

355
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:22,655
Cuz you don't find

356
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:23,679
Which lights aren't

357
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:30,079
See I didn't know because I haven't tested interesting well that's kind of yeah I guess you have to start walk around your house then to see what lights are

358
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,103
Which ones are not

359
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:31,871
Exactly

360
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:34,175
So I'm not

361
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,967
It would be interesting if she was like

362
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:37,503
These are the following

363
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,039
Aren't you know she called them out

364
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:43,391
But don't she just like that but everyone's apple is getting better

365
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,927
Contextual conversations

366
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:47,487
There and I wonder if they could add

367
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:51,327
A feature where you just continued conversation and say which lights are not active

368
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,375
And therefore she could then tell you

369
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,143
But I don't know.

370
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:56,703
Obviously it's not that possible yet

371
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:58,239
I did try to ask

372
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:02,335
You can't get a little bit like

373
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,103
You can't have

374
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:04,383
Conversation

375
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,919
She will initiate following

376
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:06,943
Crustaceans with

377
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:10,527
Did you meet this one and you can see

378
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,575
So that is helpful

379
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,343
Where is

380
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:15,135
The echo will just be like

381
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,415
Total energy

382
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,439
Oh it didn't work

383
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,975
Try again

384
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:19,743
Blac Chyna

385
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,279
Okay

386
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,303
So that's the

387
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:24,095
The Philips Hue kind of

388
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:28,447
Experience I will also say the Philips Hue Bridge does not work

389
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,727
The echo yet

390
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,263
That is something they know about

391
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,287
Working on

392
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,823
But it broke my bridge connection

393
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,103
My bridge connection broke

394
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,639
And it does not come back

395
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:39,199
Broken Bridges are bad works with Nest work

396
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:39,967
With this

397
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:41,503
Bread the Philips Hue Bridge

398
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,039
Status still going strong

399
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:45,087
When I

400
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,111
Initially

401
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,415
My wing connection to all of my lights

402
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:49,951
But there now back up

403
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:51,487
So I don't know what happened

404
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,255
But it's

405
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,327
Yeah and that is it

406
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,887
Myinstants in that integration

407
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:58,911
Are working

408
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,191
Finish up that make sense

409
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:05,311
As as someone who has so many Integrations I was like

410
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,847
Let's see what's still up after

411
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:13,247
If not the reason I said it should work is because that's all cloud-based as opposed to

412
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:18,623
Hardware in your Homebase United csat some temporary glitches say between you know when carbon

413
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,647
And something else

414
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:21,439
In the house but the cloud services

415
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:22,975
The wink

416
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:24,767
In Phillips is actually cloud-to-cloud

417
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:29,375
Turn on AWS

418
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,679
Okay so that was that

419
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,215
Now onto the next

420
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:35,263
So the Lutron stuff in my house

421
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,311
Once again

422
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:40,895
I love it all the time and the user experience there the Lutron app

423
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,687
Brings in my Nest just because

424
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,479
It does not bring in

425
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:46,527
Mike Hughes or anything else

426
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,295
So far

427
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:50,111
I believe it would work with the elegado

428
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:53,951
Stuff the homekit Elgato stop but I could not find a way to bring it

429
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,231
Houston

430
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:57,279
Nor could I bring in my Schlage

431
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,047
Sense

432
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,351
Keep that in mind

433
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:02,911
I thought this was all going to be one big platform that

434
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:03,679
Everything just

435
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:04,703
I thought so too

436
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:05,983
Just checking

437
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,287
The other thing to know about

438
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,055
The Hue Bridge

439
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,335
Is if your Lutron light

440
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,359
Are attached

441
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,383
To the Lutron

442
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,175
Bridge they can't be attached to your Wii

443
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,783
That's it that's all you got and

444
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:19,551
It works

445
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,599
Great everything works as

446
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:22,623
You can schedule you

447
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,391
Do all the things

448
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:28,255
I had no problem Siri recognized everything so I haven't

449
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,279
Water MC

450
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,303
What that was

451
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,071
Creative Zone

452
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,863
Upstairs at downstairs series

453
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:39,007
Cool with that and I put the Philips Hue Lights upstairs and downstairs as well and so when I told

454
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,543
Sear

455
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:43,103
Until your name I'm sorry y'all it's okay

456
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,175
Okay when I told her to turn my downstairs lights off

457
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,455
She turned off

458
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,735
My Lutron stuff

459
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:49,503
And

460
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,271
My Philips

461
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:51,807
So that was a win

462
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:54,623
Yes the only unifying factor I had there

463
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:56,415
Was Siri there was no app where I go

464
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,183
I could pull all that

465
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:00,511
So that was cool on the light in front

466
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:01,279
Because I had

467
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,559
1 Commandos like

468
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:03,839
Everybody your downstair

469
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,655
I would have brought the lock into

470
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,703
And the Schlage sense lock

471
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:09,727
Has keypad

472
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:10,495
It has

473
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:12,543
You know Bluetooth it works you

474
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,079
You can go and you can go out with your phone

475
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,359
Very nice

476
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,895
Having installed many locks

477
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,967
Serious about security

478
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,039
Oh yeah I mean I've installed a lot of Kwikset locks

479
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,319
Can I install the Kevo

480
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:27,391
Which is made by Kwikset like has a lot of

481
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:28,671
Much sturdier

482
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:30,975
Lot more screws to screw in in

483
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:31,999
I was very impressed

484
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,327
Kind of a side note but if you actually care about the

485
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,143
I don't know how

486
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,423
Installing more screws makes it

487
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:44,287
So the lock is good the app

488
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,311
Yep kind of

489
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:48,895
Was not as pretty as some of the other apps that I've worked with but you know

490
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:49,663
It works

491
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,687
You know what you're doing

492
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,711
Pikachu history

493
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,247
Knock it and lock it

494
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,551
There's not a lot you can ask for here

495
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:57,087
I could not figure out

496
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:57,855
Houghton

497
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:58,879
Siri will unlocked

498
00:16:59,135 --> 00:16:59,647
My daughter-in-law

499
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:04,255
Lock my door but I could not figure out how to tie it to anything else for like goodbye

500
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:06,559
I'm leaving turn off my lights LACMA

501
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,839
Right I tried

502
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:14,495
Well it could be that we were just really now seeing the first generations of the homekit devices and the plateau

503
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:16,543
Form I think apple is mainly focused on

504
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:22,687
Security of it and getting it to the certified chips into product Partners hands and so on

505
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:26,015
Usability wise I think it sounds like there's work to do

506
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,551
So I'd say we should give him some time

507
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,167
Lovely future

508
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,031
Homekit where when you add a device all you have to do is take a picture of a code on the box

509
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,055
Star on the device

510
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:51,615
So on the Philips Hue Bridge

511
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:56,479
It's on the back of the bridge on my lock it was on the instructions for the Locker on the back of the

512
00:17:56,991 --> 00:18:01,599
So keep your instructions for the lock cuz on the actual back of the lock you've already installed the lock and soda

513
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:02,623
You don't really want to

514
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:04,159
Uninstall it to take the picture

515
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,439
Add apps to net worth

516
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:08,767
But it's very easy to add devices to your

517
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:09,791
I will give

518
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,583
There is no like

519
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:13,887
Password is saying there's nothing like that

520
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:16,191
But the core problem of having

521
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,471
A bunch of apps

522
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:20,031
And having to work with all of those apps

523
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:21,823
I still had to add all these apps

524
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,359
Phone

525
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:27,199
Siri

526
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:30,015
Figure out geofencing and all these things that I wanted to do with them

527
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:32,575
And only then could I can

528
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:33,599
Control limited funk

529
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:34,367
Ocean ride

530
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:39,743
I have a question and you don't know the answer that's fine we can leave it as an open-ended question for now

531
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:44,863
Do you still have an Android phone and if so have you tried using it with any of these new homekit products

532
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,399
I do still have it

533
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:48,447
My iPhone is for work

534
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:49,983
So my day today phone is

535
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:52,031
I have not tried

536
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:56,383
Well actually it's oh the Hue Lights I use with the Android phone and it still works

537
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:58,431
So the bridge works both ways

538
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:03,039
I have not tried on the lot I can't see why they wouldn't work

539
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,575
My point though is

540
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:05,855
If you

541
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:07,647
Karnataka iOS

542
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:08,671
Household

543
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:10,463
You're adding homekit

544
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:14,047
People who don't have IOS won't be able to voice control things will have to use the app

545
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,631
Well right now that's true like I can't voice control

546
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:18,655
My lights anymore

547
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:20,191
That makes everyone

548
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,471
My husband is very sad

549
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,543
And he actually

550
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,311
Refers to you

551
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:26,335
The echo

552
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:27,359
Supposed to

553
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,127
And

554
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:30,175
That is my follow-up comment

555
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:33,247
I was going to say I know I said this before

556
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,551
I would love to see two things happen

557
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,855
When I said before I know for sure and that is

558
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,135
The Amazon

559
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,159
Echo app

560
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,183
It's not called

561
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:48,351
I don't know why on IOS and Android you cannot use that app and your phone which has a microphone to actually be a

562
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,631
Voice controller

563
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:50,655
For the echo

564
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,191
And if they could do that

565
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,471
And some of these

566
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:54,495
Hardware makers

567
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:56,287
Let make the hugs in the end

568
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:58,079
And so on could integrate

569
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:59,615
Alexa voice services

570
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:03,199
Which is freely available now from Amazon where you can end table them to be

571
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:04,223
Voice controlled

572
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:04,991
Tumi

573
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:07,039
There's your underlying interface

574
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:08,319
And it doesn't matter what

575
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:10,879
You know phone you're using at the time doesn't matter if you're

576
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:13,439
If you are Echo is not in the same room as you and so on

577
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,719
Problem solve

578
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:16,511
Exactly because you know

579
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:18,303
Some kid has some valuable thing

580
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:19,839
The security

581
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:23,167
All of that stuff course people would have to buy new stuff

582
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,703
I mean you're going to have to buy a new Gear with the

583
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:25,727
Kit Hardware

584
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:32,383
And it cost more and it cost more because of the hum compatibility

585
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,151
Addition

586
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:33,919
Right

587
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,991
It's secure

588
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:40,319
But if you added something like the

589
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,111
Services

590
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,903
What would happen is

591
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:50,303
Then you can control all of the stuff at once because right now I have broken rui for home in testing

592
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:52,863
Because I had to take my Lutron lights off

593
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:53,631
What the wink hub

594
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:54,399
Right

595
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,423
To put it on homekit

596
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,447
Which doesn't talk

597
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:58,751
And now they don't talk to anything else

598
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,055
At least when they're on wink they talk to other system

599
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:04,127
I had to take the bridge the Hue Lights

600
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:07,455
You know that whole Bridge broke my access to

601
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:08,223
The

602
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,247
Amazon Alexa

603
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,063
So now like

604
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,599
You know I think I tweeted a couple nights

605
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,135
Mexico High broke I spent

606
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:16,672
An hour fixing my lights

607
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:17,696
I finally just

608
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,464
We had to go back to school

609
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,256
So I

610
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:24,864
I'm going to take this off as soon as I can because it doesn't work for us

611
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,632
It's terrible

612
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:28,960
As I as a user experience and I'll have to put it back on eventually

613
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:31,520
Again but it is it is no bueno

614
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,848
It's early yet like I'm not reading it off but I'm

615
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:36,384
I'm suggesting that

616
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,176
It's not going to be is

617
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:40,480
Appealing to as many people as

618
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:43,040
As if it were more open I guess it's the best way to say it

619
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:48,416
And it's a broken interface as it stands right now

620
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:49,696
I mean

621
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:50,464
Even

622
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:51,488
Okay

623
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:53,280
That's where it's at

624
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:54,560
I will come back

625
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:56,352
Because you know there's more device

626
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:00,704
I'm going to try out cuz I know that there are Apple

627
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,032
Locations in devices that are supposed to bring these things together

628
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:05,056
I just don't

629
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:05,824
Have them

630
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,872
I have a purchase the right devices

631
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:11,456
It will it still early days like I said they're going to they're going to

632
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:14,528
Continue tweaking this and making a better make it more interactive with

633
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,088
Various apps and services so

634
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:23,488
I am willing to give him a little bit of a past but right now what I have today is working really done well for all of us here I just wish it was

635
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:24,512
Expanded to again

636
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:25,792
No smartphone apps

637
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:27,584
All right

638
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,352
Well

639
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:29,120
That's enough of that

640
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:30,656
So we will stay tuned

641
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:31,936
For our guest

642
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:32,704
Today's gas

643
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:33,728
Is

644
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:36,032
A professor from the University of Illinois

645
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:39,616
Who is going to talk to us about using drones in both

646
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:41,408
Farming but more

647
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,688
Typically a little closer to home

648
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,736
And helping our parents

649
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:47,552
And grandparents even Asian place

650
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:50,112
And making kind of warm and fuzzy drones that will

651
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:55,744
Deliver medicines and you know active kind of our friend for people as they age

652
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,024
So stay tuned for that

653
00:22:57,536 --> 00:23:03,680
Hey everyone this is feces

654
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:06,496
Higginbotham that I am back with the Internet of Things podcast

655
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:10,336
JB have an awesome guest it is nayyirah acumen

656
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:15,200
And she is with the University of Illinois and we are going to talk about a bunch of things

657
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:16,992
Warm-and-fuzzy drone

658
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:19,040
Drones on autopilot

659
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:19,808
And

660
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:20,576
Yeah

661
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:23,136
Analysis released basically two kinds

662
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:28,512
Making drones a little bit easier and more acceptable to a variety of people so

663
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:31,328
Thank you so much for coming on the podcast

664
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:33,632
Today angelface super having me

665
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:34,656
I am really excited

666
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:35,424
It's so

667
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:41,824
I originally reached out to you because I read about your research with helping people Asian place with the aid of

668
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,848
Robots

669
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:49,248
That were designed to be a little bit friendlier I think the idea is called Aspire and this is kind of some of your

670
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:51,552
Research would you like to talk a little bit about what that's

671
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:57,696
What about are you sure it's piyo stands for automation supporting prolong

672
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:00,512
Independence residence for the elderly

673
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:03,072
So this is an NSF funded project

674
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:05,376
This will give us the opportunity

675
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:08,448
To design robots without more friendlier

676
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,240
Acceptable by humans

677
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:13,312
Unbuyable but she'll be mean strong

678
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:14,592
Underground wallpaper

679
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:18,688
It can help us to develop a complete sophistic system

680
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:20,224
4 people aging gets

681
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,272
Play Project 8

682
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:24,064
Goodbye 2017

683
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,600
The population of boxing

684
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:27,392
Will docker

685
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:28,672
Which means that

686
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:30,976
The nursing homes of Assisted Living

687
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:31,744
Facility

688
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,792
Maybe understaffed

689
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:35,072
To support so many

690
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:35,840
Wypipo

691
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:37,632
And that's why we believe

692
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:39,680
Legends people have Technologies

693
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:43,520
To leave in their home longer independently

694
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:44,544
DevilDriver

695
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,312
Choose to

696
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,336
Stay at home

697
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:47,360
Then go to the store

698
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,128
Facilities

699
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:49,408
For example

700
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:51,456
Imagine a person who needs

701
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:54,528
Thule child for the medicine on a shell

702
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,064
And if he's hard

703
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,392
For somebody over 65 to do it alone

704
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:01,952
They can have a user-friendly tablet

705
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:06,560
IPhone with a push button launch a small drone

706
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:07,840
Fetch that message

707
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:10,144
Simpro Michelle delivery

708
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,168
To the person

709
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:12,704
Underground robot

710
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,240
So I really like this

711
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:15,008
Concept

712
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,288
Because you talked about

713
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:19,616
Kind of actual safety versus perceived safety

714
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:21,408
Intent of building out the system

715
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:27,808
I like the idea of fuzzy drones and making them kind of friendlier sometimes robots and drones

716
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:29,344
Look like the stuff of nightmares like

717
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:30,368
Scary

718
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,392
Scary scary

719
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:32,416
Yes

720
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:34,464
We are trying to distinguish

721
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,536
Between actual safety and procedure

722
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:43,936
What does it mean it means that people usually tend to be afraid of flying objects

723
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:46,240
While in reality they can be safe

724
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:49,568
So how to distinguish between actual sanctity

725
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:51,104
Proceed safe

726
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:54,432
12:30 fundamental questions I will project

727
00:25:54,688 --> 00:26:00,832
Is that an interdisciplinary school we have a psychology Professor on the team with her professor from you

728
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:01,600
Human factors

729
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:04,928
Computer science club all together helping God

730
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,512
Technology to develop the Next Generation

731
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:09,792
Aerial aerobics

732
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:11,328
Design

733
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:13,120
To look more friendlier

734
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,656
And be less scary

735
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:19,264
Virtual reality lab of universe

736
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:26,688
Where Google immerse agent people into a reality world

737
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:31,296
So that I'm with the help of the biometric acquisition system

738
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:33,600
Will be measuring their heart rate

739
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:38,464
Skin conductance a lot about the parameters to do psychology professors

740
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,000
Things that are important

741
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,280
To have it handy

742
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:42,816
To judge on people's

743
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:43,840
Conception

744
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:45,632
About the flying technology

745
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:51,520
In close proximity

746
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:56,128
Fly a drone I'm actually kind of Highly stressed because he's are pretty expensive machines

747
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,176
I mean even at $300 I'm like

748
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:00,736
It's going to fall from the sky and it's going to break

749
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:05,856
So what is controlling the the Drone to go pick up the medicine bottle for example of

750
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:07,136
What's it's probably not

751
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,672
You don't my mom or my dad

752
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:13,280
No they will be autonomous which means that summer Cruise button on your

753
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,840
Tablet or iPhone

754
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:19,936
The drawing will be launched automatically thanks to its autonomous

755
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:20,704
Compulsive

756
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:25,824
It will be launched autonomously from your pool spots on it will go

757
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:28,896
Deliver definition

758
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:30,176
So it's a piece of

759
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:31,712
Software that

760
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:36,320
Can be developed today and there a lot of flights today

761
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:40,416
We are just trying to make sure that we can get them

762
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:42,720
Differently for their use

763
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:43,488
Indomethacin

764
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,512
Environment

765
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:47,072
This is possible

766
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:48,096
First of all

767
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:49,632
I would I would like to

768
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:50,912
Kind of project

769
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:53,472
Enjoyed it today our parents

770
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:56,288
Are scared of blood

771
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:57,824
Flying next to them

772
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,640
By 2030 2035

773
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:04,480
Does the projected timeline it's me who is going to be

774
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:05,760
1665

775
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:07,040
And if I'm

776
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:09,600
They developing the technology in the law

777
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:16,000
Bennington 15-20 years most likely I won't be afraid to use it in my home

778
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:17,280
Okay so

779
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:21,120
I'm still trying to imagine these things flying kind of all around me

780
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:23,680
And I do find it a little disconcerting

781
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:26,752
Kind of walk me through a day in the life of

782
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:29,056
Someone who is aging-in-place in their home

783
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,592
Can I have this vision

784
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:32,896
I assume they're still someone who comes

785
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:34,944
I assume it's not totally isolated

786
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:35,968
I'm so

787
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:42,624
What time it is maybe I'm communicating with my robots in the drones are kind of acting as extension of hands or delivery

788
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,160
Before the robots I don't know but

789
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,696
What do you see

790
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:48,768
Your this is 20 years from now and you're sitting in your

791
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:51,072
Futuristic Barcalounger

792
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,120
What is what is life like

793
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:54,656
Marisol

794
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:58,496
I'm sure all of you remember the Cinderella costume with Cinderella

795
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:01,312
Helped by meissenburg to set up the house

796
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:03,360
Sosa's preparation for this

797
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,640
Fire project

798
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:08,224
Kind of related to that Cinderella

799
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:08,992
Cartoon

800
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:12,576
My students told me Cinderella could be held by my son

801
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:14,112
The bird then we can have it

802
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:16,928
As well have drones underground robot

803
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:17,952
Things to draw

804
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:19,488
The Cinderella movie

805
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:23,584
Imagine 20 years ago none of us had to sell

806
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,168
Today we'll have a few of those and we know how to operate them

807
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:27,936
Smoothly

808
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:30,240
And how much we can accomplish with the healthcare

809
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:31,008
The cell phone

810
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:31,776
And

811
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,312
Within the next

812
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:35,616
When to use the drones will be the self

813
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:38,176
Is the cell phones at today

814
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:42,784
The way I Envision is that first module Industrial Revolution

815
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,576
Using PlayStation 4

816
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:48,928
We'll have drones flying collecting data helping the farmers to take

817
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:52,256
Regarding prescription farming

818
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:54,048
So cold when they will be

819
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:55,328
Applying

820
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,424
Fertilizers that taking care of weave

821
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:03,008
I'm different types of issues that agriculturalists AC

822
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,544
This can help us

823
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:11,456
The technology into the hands of the farm as long as the farmer is using it

824
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:14,784
In his farm he will start using it in his backyard

825
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,320
People slowly gets used

826
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:18,624
To the idea of changing the drawer

827
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,648
2 something

828
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:21,952
Most friendliest brindle Mastiff

829
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:25,024
Why some people have to start to using

830
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:29,120
It's 11:36 in a research and understanding

831
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:31,168
I'm working with psychologist helps us

832
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,704
Stanford examples

833
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,984
How to design the

834
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,008
Passport

835
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:37,568
This'll be flying at home

836
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:39,104
Around obstacles

837
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,384
Golang test 12

838
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:43,456
Single perception check abilities

839
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:44,992
Seeing the void

840
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:45,760
Like YouTube

841
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:47,552
It should have a vision system

842
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:49,600
And old dad

843
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:50,880
Humble intelligence

844
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:51,904
That's going to be developed

845
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,928
Over the next ten

846
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,976
220 years to make them

847
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:57,536
Friends of people and not like

848
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:58,560
Karaoke

849
00:30:58,816 --> 00:30:59,328
Check the round

850
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,096
Okay

851
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:01,888
So you're saying that

852
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:03,424
But kind of the computer like

853
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,448
PC actually

854
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:06,752
Little beginning offices little transition

855
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:07,520
Gradually

856
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:08,544
To the home and then

857
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:11,360
Our pockets but

858
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:14,688
You know to a warm and friendly place where it's the first thing we

859
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:17,248
Turn 2 in the mornings and probably the last thing we

860
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:18,016
We deal with

861
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:18,784
Since we go to bed

862
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,088
So actually let's talk about Farms

863
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:23,392
Because you actually in addition to your research

864
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,160
Which

865
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:25,184
Itsfunneh

866
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:27,744
Cool I like the Cinderella reference

867
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,536
Two mice for my favorite part of that movie

868
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:30,560
Actually so

869
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:33,888
Let's go to your startup which is called intelinair

870
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:36,192
And you guys are kind of building

871
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:37,728
You call it a controller

872
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:39,264
And it sounds basically like

873
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,824
It's autopilot it's a better form of autopilot

874
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:47,712
For drones for commercial aircraft and even for highly automated mechanical systems

875
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:56,160
That's what I'm building a highly intelligent also intelligent husband's birthday

876
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,952
And intelligent

877
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:59,744
In air rights

878
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:06,144
The objective of it is to achieve actionable intelligence from Able information with recorded

879
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,192
So

880
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:10,240
Did Justin is to have a drawing

881
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,520
It can be automatic

882
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:15,360
How to clean lungs from an iPad or iPhone by a farmer

883
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:18,688
Farm in the mall Stockton

884
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:19,968
Collect

885
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:26,368
I mean take pictures collect information about the Weeds about the water damage and various issues

886
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,160
The farmer may be facing

887
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:31,488
Take real-time decisions about

888
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:34,816
The need for fertilizing.

889
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:36,864
Pesticides and other types of

890
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,424
Treatments that the farm meaning

891
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,704
Health Department

892
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:41,728
Implement

893
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:42,752
Decision

894
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:44,032
So we know that

895
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:49,664
9 million people are hungry every day are dying from Hunger everyday

896
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:52,992
To save the world to solve the Hungary

897
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:57,600
We need to bring advanced technology to large farm

898
00:32:57,856 --> 00:33:00,160
So that you know to have anyways

899
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:01,952
Otherwise

900
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:03,488
It would be impossible to

901
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:04,768
Feed the people

902
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,560
Which is the next 20 years

903
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:09,376
So I'll autopilot functionality

904
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:10,912
To give the farm

905
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:11,936
Butterfly

906
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:12,960
Consult

907
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:17,568
So that he flies easier Supply smoother he's not

908
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,872
Scared of unpredictable events

909
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:22,944
He can fly in high winds in inclement weather

910
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,480
How far away are we

911
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:26,016
Delivering a

912
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:26,784
Drone

913
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,576
That is so easy

914
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:32,160
I don't want to insult Farmers I'm like so easy to fly that farmer can do it her

915
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:34,464
Just power how far away are we

916
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,512
From delivering a drone that is

917
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:37,536
That capable

918
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:38,560
Into the hands of

919
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:40,608
I think only maybe

920
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:42,656
Google Toolbar very close

921
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:45,728
Launch their drawing

922
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:47,520
Skull

923
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:51,360
Purpose in the second or third quarter of nine

924
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:54,176
The other company

925
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:56,224
Names that have similar Solutions

926
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,504
Which Maybe

927
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,296
Partial information process

928
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:02,624
Right because when we are talking about

929
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:07,232
It would be capable of taking all the decisions

930
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:10,304
In real time do older in La cakes

931
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:13,888
This isn't a complex system to achieve that level of perfection

932
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,680
Have a complete system

933
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:17,216
It may take a few years

934
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:17,984
But

935
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:20,544
There are already two solutions

936
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:22,592
That address the problems

937
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:27,200
Possibly this may distinguish one or two weeks for example order

938
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:32,832
Be targeted for water damage Solutions I don't have everything on the top of my mind

939
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:34,368
How much would something like

940
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:35,136
That cost

941
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:36,160
OG ideas

942
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:38,464
To make it low cost and low coasters

943
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,512
Disposable in this is where the science

944
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:42,048
Take significant role

945
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:45,632
As a consultant acknowledges that can tells you to take any system

946
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:48,448
Blue loaded with all possible sensor

947
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:49,216
Making it

948
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:53,568
Super expensive so you can solve any problem in the most easiest way

949
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:59,712
Define to talk of lost cuz you my mom kids you're trying to make something accessible

950
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:03,808
To Farmer is an end-user you want to make it as cheap as pulse

951
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:06,880
There's a certain degree be on the way to Compton

952
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:09,440
Cheap because any of this advanced

953
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:13,024
Control guidance navigation just won't work.

954
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:13,792
Defensive

955
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:17,376
Performance level is required for old is Al Gore

956
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:23,776
To work but on the other hand and the sense of. Also getting cheaper and cheaper so we're hoping that

957
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:25,312
Eventually down the road

958
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:28,896
Technologist make cost around $500 or even less

959
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:32,480
Okay and so how much is it is it like $2,000 today is it

960
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:33,760
It like $5,000

961
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:38,112
Let's put it today today something for 5000

962
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:39,136
Can do quite a bit

963
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:42,208
I would imagine

964
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:44,256
Savages Enterprise to 500

965
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:45,280
Okay sounds

966
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:46,304
Alright
