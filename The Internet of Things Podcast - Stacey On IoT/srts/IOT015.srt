Hey everybody is Stacy haiduk

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,008
Bothell man

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,848
Kevin tofel and you are listening to The Internet of Things podcast

4
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:19,712
And this week we are going to be talking about the first thread chips coming on the market

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,528
Beauty connecting oil wells in the Gulf

6
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:23,808
And let's see

7
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:26,368
A brand new lighting project that I've got started

8
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:28,160
When did my house that you guys are going to love

9
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:29,696
It will have our guest

10
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:31,744
Who is Andrew Farah the CEO of

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,304
A company called density IO

12
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:36,096
Which is making a

13
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:37,120
People counting

14
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:40,704
So stay tuned for all of this and more

15
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:42,240
The Internet of Things podcast

16
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,824
Alright Kevin so how was your fourth of July

17
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:47,872
It was nice little

18
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:54,016
Quieter than usual for some reason to the neighbors decided not to light up things after 10:11 which is awesome

19
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:56,064
Really light up as in fireworks or light up

20
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,344
Set something on fire

21
00:00:58,112 --> 00:00:59,392
Of Noah stay away from

22
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:04,256
Setting things on fire here but know the fireworks yeah usually don't go till midnight or what not

23
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:07,584
Are two cats in the dog goes crazy and whatnot but

24
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,120
No it's nice and quiet

25
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:12,704
You know I was looking at the videos of people sticking fireworks on drones

26
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,472
Switch

27
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:14,240
You know

28
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:16,544
It's a bad idea

29
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,080
Don't it does destroy your

30
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:21,920
You know there's a lot of connected

31
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:22,944
Fireworks

32
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,968
Kind of things out there

33
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,784
I was trying to think of what I could do related to

34
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,552
Connected

35
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:29,088
Devices fireworks

36
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:33,952
The best I could come up with was like chromecasting some some YouTube videos of

37
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:35,232
Cool firework shows

38
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:41,376
Yeah I can't see many opportunities there I should have thought about I should have powered up the Drone and it has it

39
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:44,448
Capture on video the fireworks here in the neighborhood

40
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:46,240
I'm a relatively safe distances

41
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,520
Calorie content to look at

42
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:51,104
So that would have been cool alright so aerial view of fireworks

43
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,152
From a relatively safe

44
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:53,920
Distance

45
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:55,968
So yeah

46
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:59,808
I say readers but listeners let us know if you can come up with any cool

47
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:05,696
Connected angles for the 4th of July maybe next year we'll do something along that line

48
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:06,464
Reasonable

49
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:07,488
And then say

50
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,280
I was like from a safety

51
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,072
So

52
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:11,840
This week

53
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,632
We'll get started with some news bits

54
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,424
The Red Witch

55
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,984
For those of you guys who are unfamiliar with it which is

56
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,264
It's probably most of you

57
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:24,384
Thread is a new wireless protocol for the internet of things that nest

58
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,664
Silicon labs

59
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,456
Freescale and

60
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:30,784
Big Ass Fans and some other companies have come up with

61
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:34,368
It is basically, it's a Mesh networking standard

62
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,392
It's kind of like

63
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:37,184
Well it uses the same

64
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:39,488
Wireless layer is zigbee basically

65
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,024
And

66
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:47,424
That was going to introduce last year we've all been waiting to see what it's going to look like and what it's going to be like and

67
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:52,288
Creepy cat company that makes sippy chips that are in cable boxes

68
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:55,104
They've announced that they have a

69
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,920
Zigbee / thread compatible chip

70
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,456
That will be

71
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:00,736
Sibling

72
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,784
And will be coming out

73
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:04,064
In volume

74
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,856
Which means in large quantities

75
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:07,648
At the end of the third quarter

76
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,672
So

77
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:11,488
Sounds like we should start anticipating

78
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:12,768
Thread devices

79
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:13,536
Very soon

80
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:14,816
Well actually not very soon

81
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,608
By the end of the year because

82
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,144
The Silicon is finally coming out

83
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:24,288
Very cool you know it's funny that you bring this particular news bit up because over the weekend I was thinking

84
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:27,360
About Smart Homes and connectivity particular

85
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,384
And let you know what

86
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,176
I went around my house and we

87
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:33,248
I'm just going to say that we have way too many TVs in this house

88
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,064
That's the only issue entirely for another show but

89
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,880
Isn't going around in like all these things have Wi-Fi

90
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,672
Why could they not

91
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:43,744
Be like repeaters for my network and or

92
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,048
Contribute to a mesh Network for this morning

93
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,840
You know why not put these

94
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:50,656
Chips the zigbee chips and someone right in the TV is because

95
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:55,520
How many TVs do people have a man sure I'm not the only one that has you on multiple TVs in the house

96
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,312
I don't know I only have

97
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,384
But I know

98
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,152
Wechat

99
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,432
We're not like

100
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,736
Now that's a good thing

101
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,784
I only have three people in my

102
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:09,856
And you have like dogs cats chilled

103
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,136
I don't know

104
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:14,208
Are the kids all have their own TVs and then I'll be honest

105
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:18,815
The dog goes like to watch pets TV on FiOS but that doesn't mean to get this on TV

106
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,887
Poor poor abused puppy

107
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,935
So yeah that would be great

108
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,471
Except for Wi-Fi is not a mess

109
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,519
They don't have no no right

110
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,823
Wright would have to be an additional chip

111
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,359
Protocol one

112
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:33,919
Communication methods such as big bang what's red so

113
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,735
So for those of you guys who were like sitting here is still going

114
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,015
Stacy your explanation

115
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,039
The thread did nothing for

116
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,367
It's basically Wilkins

117
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,135
Repeat with

118
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,415
Zigbee and Z-Wave

119
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:50,559
It is a Mesh networking standard the key to it the two things that are most important and all that thread is its

120
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:51,839
Low power

121
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:55,167
It is mesh which means it communicates like

122
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:57,727
Point to point to point to point as opposed to Lake

123
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:01,311
Well that's a terrible description of him

124
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,103
Yes

125
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:05,407
Which device talks to one another

126
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,735
How's that as opposed to going

127
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:09,503
From one device

128
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:14,623
Listen to Kevin I can see it in my head

129
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,183
Directly

130
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,487
To the internet using IPv6

131
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:22,303
Allure power version of IPv6 but that's

132
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,327
That's really what

133
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,607
Importing those three things

134
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:25,887
And

135
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:29,983
Bluetooth actually is probably going to be but isn't yet the nearest

136
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:30,751
Competitor

137
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:31,519
The thread

138
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,311
And in the years ahead

139
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,359
That's what you're going to be looking for

140
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:40,991
Most companies who are building things for the smart home have already started referring to zigbee and Z-Wave

141
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:43,295
Escort Legacy Networks

142
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:47,391
And they're looking for thread and Bluetooth mesh

143
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:48,671
To become kind of

144
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:49,951
The next gen thing

145
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:54,047
There you go that's your little 411

146
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:58,911
And the thread standard isn't actually even finalized yet so I'm amazed that there's going to be silica

147
00:05:59,167 --> 00:05:59,679
And it's actually happy

148
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,447
But hey

149
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,495
That that happened with Wi-Fi

150
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,543
Why why not have it happened with

151
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:05,823
So

152
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,103
That's happening

153
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:12,479
Let's move on to other cool things little quick news brief is this week

154
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:13,247
Okapi

155
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:19,903
The ecobee3 that's homekit certified is actually selling an Apple Stores and on its website as of now

156
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,183
Today

157
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:24,255
That's worth noting because even though

158
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:29,119
Homekit devices record Encore announced last month or the month before actually this point

159
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,399
If it's July

160
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:32,447
Priori Kobe's are not home

161
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:35,519
Compatible we've established that I believe a few weeks ago right

162
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:39,103
Yes so if your ecobee cost 250 issues

163
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,639
249 99

164
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:43,455
That's your homekit certified ecobee look for it

165
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:47,807
But the cheaper 229 ecobee is probably not home

166
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:48,575
Get certified

167
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:51,391
So don't feel like you're getting a smoking hot deal

168
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,415
If you want

169
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,439
The home kitchen

170
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:55,487
Patient if you don't want this to homekit

171
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:56,511
The right ahead

172
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:58,559
So that

173
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,351
That's kind of worth noting

174
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:02,655
What's the other little news bits I'm trying to think

175
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:03,935
I got nothing

176
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,983
So we'll go straight into kind of

177
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:08,543
A topic that has been weighing on my

178
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:12,383
It actually have news related to its over so we can sort of

179
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,199
Do a less graceful Segway now that I

180
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:17,503
Messed it up utterly

181
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,271
But

182
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:20,831
BP the oil and gas company

183
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,367
You may have heard of them

184
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:28,767
They are connecting there oil wells so this is an industrial internet-of-things application day of

185
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:30,047
Signed a deal with

186
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,071
GE

187
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:33,119
To connect oil rigs

188
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,655
Instrumentation

189
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:36,447
Kenneth are doing it so they can

190
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,007
Real-time monitoring and

191
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,543
Basically

192
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:43,103
GE is going to connect

193
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:45,407
650

194
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:48,479
British Petroleum RBP swells

195
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:49,503
And

196
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,807
Is part of the first pilot project

197
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:56,927
And as part on each well R4 all 650 these Wells they're going to have about five

198
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,975
100000 sensors

199
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:02,047
And they're grabbing all the data they can

200
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,583
And they're going to update

201
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:06,143
From those centers every 15 seconds

202
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,679
So that's

203
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,215
4 times a minute

204
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,031
500000 sensors giving you

205
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:16,639
Half a million sensors giving you a lot of data 4 times a minute

206
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:20,479
It's mostly time series data so we'll think about things like

207
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:23,807
Temperature pressure inside the well so it's basically like

208
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:25,599
At this time temperature was X

209
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,903
Very small it's not Big Data

210
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:31,743
The total data that are thinking about is about 8 GB

211
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:37,119
It's a day so it's not huge but figuring out how to manage all that do something with it is kind of their neck

212
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:37,887
Next big challenge

213
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:39,935
They're probably

214
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:41,471
Have been monitoring certain

215
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:44,031
Aspects of the oil rigs for forever

216
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:49,919
Son wondering where's the value in it yet I'm not sure I see it but that doesn't mean it's not worth while for them to do

217
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:56,831
The curious to see what they come up with on this so what they have done in the past is they've had their own homegrown software

218
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:59,391
We're monitoring there oil wells for the past 10 years

219
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:01,951
What they're doing now is there

220
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:04,767
Basically doing more of it more often

221
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:12,191
They're doing a pilot project with 650 Wells but by the end of next year they'll have 4,000 Wells so all of their way

222
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:12,959
Wells connected

223
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,751
And the idea is

224
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,823
Make better decisions so

225
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,127
Maybe they'll see up in the

226
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:23,455
Off the coast of England and Norway

227
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:27,295
Pumping conditions are at this pressure

228
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:29,087
That's what you should strive for

229
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:33,183
So it'll help them make future decisions based on the historical data then

230
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,463
Yes and

231
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:37,535
Don't know how to react to things like in real-time like weather

232
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:38,815
So

233
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:39,583
You know

234
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,375
Is this like the best time

235
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,703
And I don't know what chemicals they use to live

236
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:46,751
Extract oil in house

237
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,311
But that you're not you're not a geophysics

238
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:52,127
Experteer I don't understand

239
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:58,783
She's a former geophysicist but I on the other hand

240
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:02,111
You weren't expecting that we're you Kevin

241
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:02,879
I was not

242
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,415
You got me on that one

243
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:08,255
So I think that's really fascinating because it is

244
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,863
I mean it's it's industrial use for the internet of things and we don't see a lot of

245
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:16,191
Use cases for that right now that people are really talking about

246
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,495
And I get a lot of

247
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:24,895
People who in this gets into my topic Dushore which is I got a lot of people who kind of downplay the value of the

248
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:26,431
The consumer Internet of Things

249
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,711
Enter telling me that

250
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:28,991
Stacy

251
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,527
Why are you so

252
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,575
Freaking worried about

253
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,623
The smart Homer why are you so

254
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,927
Hot on researchkit in

255
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,207
The consumer Internet of Things

256
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,487
Because

257
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,023
Industry is where matter

258
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:44,351
I don't agree with that one but

259
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,655
It matters in books that at just to be clear

260
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:47,679
Exactly

261
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:49,983
Play so well and I agree so

262
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:53,567
But I think it's worth a discussion because I think there is a lot

263
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:57,919
There's a lot of value to be had in the industrial internet-of-things and there's a lot

264
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:00,735
If you look at the internet of things as a marketing term

265
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:04,063
Right so I was wonderful podcast about the internet

266
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,343
Things right Kevin

267
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,111
Video

268
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,927
And you know you could argue that that's just a marketing term

269
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:11,487
First like this hot topic that everyone's talking about

270
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:15,327
But we're really talking about freeing up data

271
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,607
From all

272
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,911
Blocks of life that we haven't really

273
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:23,263
Had access to before so in BP's case it's the exact time

274
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:29,663
Temperature and pressure deep in the ocean for the oil wells and then again at the sensor in the ability to get that information

275
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,199
Every 15 seconds

276
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:33,503
And to do it basically really cheaply

277
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:34,783
So

278
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,343
When you have that what can you do with it

279
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:39,391
And that's really what the Internet of Things

280
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:40,927
In the same thing is

281
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:43,999
Premier solar panels that is also General

282
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:45,791
Zebra showing me

283
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:48,351
At what what day did you get with real-time data

284
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:52,703
So I have a system called in Layton it's a little web server that

285
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:58,079
Gets information from all 41 of my solar panels in real-time over the power lines

286
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:00,383
And I can find out

287
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,663
To the second

288
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:06,783
How much energy is being produced by each individual panel of the panels all together

289
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,831
I can find out.

290
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:11,647
Historical basis how much reproduce today

291
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:15,743
I can see what how the weather affected the panels at various points in time

292
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:18,303
I'm so basically all that production data

293
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,327
Steven

294
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:21,887
Just to take us all a step further say

295
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:23,167
Perhaps the best

296
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,983
Scenario for Internet of Things is the

297
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:29,055
Intersection of consumer and Industrial

298
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:32,127
So you take my solar panel data to see much I'm producing

299
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:36,479
You take the curb system which we looked at last week or you talked about last week that measures how much

300
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:39,807
Power is being consumed at the circuit breaker level

301
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,087
And perhaps the

302
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,391
Utility company can say hey we can

303
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,415
Better

304
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:49,535
Put our mix power out there for certain people who aren't using lot of power now and so on and so forth

305
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,303
So

306
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:53,375
You got to have the consumer of all with that or it just doesn't work

307
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,399
And that is

308
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,679
Exactly my

309
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:59,007
I think there's a lot of value in the near-term

310
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:02,079
For connecting devices inside man

311
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:02,847
Manufacturing up

312
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,127
Industrial app

313
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,175
Operations and using that data

314
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:10,783
Just to make your performance more efficient so like exactly what we're talking about BP in GED

315
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,343
I think

316
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,647
Long-term in big picture

317
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:18,207
Something like taking your solar panel data

318
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:20,511
And time that back to you

319
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,791
Production even

320
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,071
For these guys

321
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:25,887
Well we just had

322
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,703
I don't know 700 new houses come online

323
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:31,007
This area of the country

324
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:35,103
Maybe we don't need to produce as much or even send as much you know

325
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:35,871
There

326
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:38,175
Those are the kind of things that

327
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:42,783
Will be made possible and you can only do that with connected consumer device

328
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,063
Exactly

329
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,087
Exactly in fact

330
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:49,695
I was just thinking back to the curb day that you would show me right before the show because you got it installed now

331
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:51,743
You can see for example

332
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:54,047
Each individual client

333
00:13:54,303 --> 00:14:00,447
Practically how much power is using at various points in the day how much it cost etcetera you give that data to the electrical

334
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:03,263
Company and they can be monitoring saying you know what

335
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:07,359
You might want to go and replace this particular Appliance because

336
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:11,711
I can bet you at least 5 to 10 years old is not energy star etcetera

337
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:14,783
And now you've actually got a feedback loop that says hey consumer

338
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:20,927
By giving us this day to you can we can give you smarter purchase decisions to save you money

339
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:26,047
Exactly now I'm not going to talk about the curb just yet I'm actually going to wait probably another week or two so

340
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,071
Blisters

341
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:31,679
Hold up because I want to have this device to my house for a little bit longer and play with it and get

342
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,983
Can I have a little bit more used to it before I

343
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:36,287
Subject you to the thoughts on it

344
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:40,895
I spilled the beans I'm sorry

345
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,711
And then we'll talk about it a little bit

346
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:47,807
But yeah I'm actually excited because when I start reviewing gadgets I can actually

347
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:48,575
Start telling p

348
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,623
Hey by the way this actually

349
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:52,927
According to my data cost

350
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,999
$0.50 a week to run

351
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,023
Which

352
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,047
You might be like

353
00:14:59,071 --> 00:14:59,583
Okay

354
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:00,863
Yay

355
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:03,679
I don't care but what if something cost you know

356
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,471
What if I start looking at like

357
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:09,823
A bunch of you know connected cameras and one cost $5 a week

358
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,615
Iran versus the rest that are all

359
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:13,407
50 Cent

360
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:17,759
Or if you want to determine if it's worth the money to change out the lights in your house

361
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:22,367
Which is a great segue and we're going to

362
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:25,439
A Bissell Bissell actually brr

363
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,719
5 minutes

364
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,487
Review

365
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:29,535
So

366
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:31,327
Because I am obsessed

367
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:34,143
And with the Amazon Echo

368
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,423
Captain understatement

369
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,239
I have come by to my two favorite things

370
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,031
Into

371
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,591
Is Stacy

372
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:43,615
Lighting price

373
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,151
Voice activated lighting

374
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,431
Farragut

375
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,223
For those of you guys who don't

376
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,783
You can use the Amazon Echo

377
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:51,551
2

378
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:55,135
Control Philips Hue and WeMo products today

379
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:57,183
And I have

380
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:00,511
Had it controlling my Philips Hue Lights in my living room

381
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:04,351
But those who lights are $60 above for the

382
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,631
BR30

383
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,679
For the big BR30 flood light

384
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,775
But I have those globe lights throughout my house and I I just

385
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:13,567
I love being able to tell

386
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:14,847
The echo to turn off my

387
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:15,871
NetSpend

388
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:20,223
I've been waiting for Philips or

389
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:21,759
Anyone really

390
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,807
To produce a

391
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,367
That's white light

392
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:28,927
And connected that would work with the Philips Hue system

393
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:30,719
And I found one

394
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:32,767
It is the GE

395
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:37,119
Link light bulbs that were designed to work with the wink system

396
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:44,031
So the GE link lights you guys may be familiar cuz the a19 came on the scene at $15 a bull which is like

397
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:44,799
Freaking

398
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,335
Low and unheard-of

399
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:47,615
So the

400
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:49,151
BR30

401
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,687
Are actually

402
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:51,711
$20

403
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,527
They also have some par38 flood

404
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,319
That are

405
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,599
$25 Apple

406
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:00,415
All much cheaper than the Philips

407
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:06,047
All much cheaper than what I would assume would be about $30 for a white only

408
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,607
BR30 from Philips but that does not

409
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:15,007
I went out I bought six of those to replace all the current lights in my kitchen

410
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:16,287
And so that is

411
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,311
What does if you guys who

412
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:20,127
Are not great at math that's a hundred and twenty bucks

413
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:24,223
Witcher like holy moly Stacy all this for voice control

414
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,503
I will tell you

415
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:26,527
It works

416
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,343
The steps to making this work

417
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:30,879
Install the light bulbs

418
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,159
Turn him on

419
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,183
You

420
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:35,743
Go to the shoe app you search for new lights

421
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,559
If found all of mine no problem

422
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,095
And then

423
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,911
Once those are in there you can name them whatever you want

424
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,959
And then you go to

425
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:45,727
Your Echo

426
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:48,543
And you say Alexa discover new

427
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:49,567
Devices

428
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:52,639
And then you hit the button on your Philips Hue Bridge

429
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:59,039
And then Alexa discovers them then you group them however you want a group binding to both the kitchen setting and then I grouped all of my life

430
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:00,319
Accentuate downstairs

431
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:02,623
And then

432
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:03,903
Your business

433
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:04,927
That's all it takes

434
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:10,047
If that's that's pretty good that's a nice way to save some money but yet add the

435
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:14,143
Connected white bulbs here the link bulbs needed the wink

436
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:16,191
Cabin and RV label

437
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:22,847
They're so there's any bulbs that RHA 1.2 compliant which means they work with the huge cyst

438
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,127
Perfect

439
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,151
So

440
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,687
I tested it out

441
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:28,479
Before I actually had

442
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:29,759
And a night

443
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:31,295
Tensor normal-looking bulb

444
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:33,087
Hanging around so I tested out

445
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:33,855
Before I went outside

446
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:34,879
120 buck

447
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:37,695
Sure but

448
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:41,535
So let's talk about the cost because with the curb

449
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:45,119
I was able to see that I was spending $0.04 an hour

450
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:48,191
On the 6 incandescent lights that I had

451
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,471
Old school belts

452
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:50,495
Old school balls

453
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:57,151
And so that's not that much it's like $0.24 a day if you use them for 6 hours a day which is about what I would

454
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,199
So

455
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,223
Corte Madera

456
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:02,271
But now

457
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:04,575
My usage is actually gone to zero

458
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,111
It's not even

459
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:07,903
Not even a

460
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:11,231
So I actually thought that was pretty cool

461
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:13,535
And I add my cost analysis

462
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:15,071
It's going to take

463
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:17,375
If I assume 6 hours a day

464
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:19,935
The 365 days so every day of the year

465
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:22,239
It's like 88 bucks a year that I'm say

466
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:31,967
Pretty good and those and these are the bulbs that'll last me know 20 plus years I can take say 22.8 years based on 3 hours per day so

467
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,759
Even if you do 6ou

468
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:35,807
Half of that is 11.4 years so

469
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,087
They're going to be around forever

470
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:38,367
And

471
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,647
I can dim them

472
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:42,975
That's nice too

473
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:44,511
So all in all

474
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,047
I'm really satisfied

475
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:49,119
The only the minor quibble I will have in

476
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,167
People who are very design-conscious are going to

477
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,239
I don't know if you like this or not some people were probably like it

478
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:56,287
The GE Link light bulbs

479
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:58,591
Instead of having the opaque

480
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:01,407
Top to the light bulb frosted color

481
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,943
Frosted glass

482
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,479
They are totally

483
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:08,575
Clear they do look funky date they look a little funky I kind of like them

484
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:09,855
But

485
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:11,391
My husband is kind of like

486
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:14,207
It's like a modern-day Edison bulb

487
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,743
It is and

488
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:19,583
You know you can see the little spots for the LED when

489
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:20,351
If you look up

490
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:21,887
They're very bright

491
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:24,191
I'd like the light quality

492
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:28,031
Victim very well in cleanly there's no flickering

493
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,055
So

494
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:33,151
I'm really sold I'm really excited so if anyone else is sitting there going

495
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:37,759
Man I really want to talk to more lights in my house but I don't want to spend 60 bucks a bulb

496
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:39,551
You don't have to you don't have to

497
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:43,391
You can spend 15 for the normal a19 the wink bulb

498
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:47,487
You could spend 30 for the Philips a19 in white

499
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,023
Or you could spend

500
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:52,095
What tea and get the floods from the GE wink

501
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,631
What are the GE link

502
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:54,655
Line

503
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:58,495
And this may actually push me to get that Echo after all cuz I was kind of

504
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:04,383
Moaning about that the new price

505
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,711
You know what don't get the

506
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:12,831
I want to see Echo wait till it works with insteon and then maybe you'll install

507
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:16,159
I'll probably be moved by then

508
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,952
Better then I'll mail you the app

509
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,512
Oh there we go

510
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:21,536
I'll send you an egg

511
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:22,816
Siri

512
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:23,584
Laxatives

513
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:30,240
All right so stay tuned because my guest is Andrew Farah who is the CEO of

514
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:36,640
Density

515
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:42,528
Today we have our guest name is Andrew Farah he was the CEO of a company called density

516
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:44,064
Hey Andrew how you doing

517
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:45,856
Hey Stacy I'm doing really well

518
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:46,624
Awesome

519
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:47,904
I am

520
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:53,280
I think I'm doing well I think I might be coming down with something so towards the end of this if I start to get a little hallucinatory

521
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:54,560
You know listeners

522
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:55,328
That's what happened

523
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,168
Guide Me In

524
00:21:59,424 --> 00:21:59,936
Guide me back home

525
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:00,960
You got it

526
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:04,544
So density I think you guys are really interesting startup

527
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,824
Because you're basically

528
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:07,616
You're counting people

529
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:10,432
Inside public places is that a good way to think of it

530
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:14,272
Yeah we essentially are have people counter and an API

531
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:17,344
It's kind of that I think the simplest way to describe what density does

532
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:19,392
I'm going to I'm going to help you out a little bit

533
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:20,160
Because you

534
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,208
You guys offer a sensor that

535
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:24,256
Is placed on Doors

536
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:25,536
Restaurants

537
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:28,864
Public places any sort of building that has a door week

538
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,400
Papa density sensor on a

539
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:31,424
And then

540
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:32,960
That data

541
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:33,984
Basically

542
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:37,568
What essentially make that available so what we work with

543
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:39,104
We recently installed

544
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:40,640
Indoor frames

545
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:43,200
To measure bi-directional movement in real time

546
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:47,552
Typically will partner with another tech startup like a point-of-sale system

547
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:51,392
What does distribution to these cafes restaurants and bars already

548
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,952
And we'll install the hardware for free

549
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:56,512
And then we'll license the real time

550
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:59,328
Put traffic data back to that point of sale system more

551
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,632
Or directory like Yelp or Foursquare

552
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:02,400
I like

553
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:05,216
You guys so much because I'm a huge believer

554
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:07,008
That when we have

555
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,288
Access about

556
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:10,592
People in places we can do

557
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:13,664
Cool things like you guys launched a consumer Apple while back

558
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:17,760
It was like Hey are there too many people in this coffee shop or is now a good time to go

559
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:21,600
All the way up to hey is it a good time for me to go wait in line at the DMV

560
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:22,880
So

561
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:23,904
Excited

562
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:24,928
But

563
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:28,512
You have the score thesis when you guys were developing density

564
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:31,840
He had four points and I'd like you to talk about those four points really

565
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:33,888
Sure

566
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:36,448
We really want to see the movement across the entire city

567
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,312
I just kind of just started with our favorite coffee shop we just wanted to see how busy our favorite coffee shop was

568
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:43,104
And we thought there was already

569
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,640
Technology to solve the problem

570
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:47,456
And there wasn't so that quickly became

571
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:49,504
Well let's build something and then

572
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,088
It was well for your builder for this coffee shop why don't we build it for all of Tokyo

573
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,368
The problem with that is

574
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:57,440
In order to turn on Tokyo you have to figure out massive distribution

575
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,464
Intuit otherwise

576
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,744
Largely disconnected

577
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,512
Set up business

578
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:03,584
Cafes bars restaurants they don't all go to

579
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,912
Museums in or go to South by Southwest and then like adopt the ladies

580
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:08,192
Piece of software

581
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:09,472
So

582
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:12,288
This was a distribution problem as much as it was a

583
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,824
Hardware and

584
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,848
Signal processing

585
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:18,432
So instead of building a giant inside sales team

586
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,968
We essentially wanted to

587
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:22,272
Partner with companies who could do the distribution

588
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,808
On our behalf and we could help them

589
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,880
But in order to do distribution without public outcry

590
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:28,416
The system had to be

591
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,952
Real-time accurate

592
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:30,720
Anonymous

593
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:32,768
Cheap desert kind of r410a

594
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:37,632
It was too expensive it would be too hard to do distribution if it wasn't accurate the data wouldn't be relevant

595
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:39,424
And if it invaded someone's privacy

596
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,496
You know we we saw some some pretty interesting things happen

597
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:45,312
With Nordstrom and and they're pink

598
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:47,104
Euclid analytics provider

599
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,640
They're doing Mac address tracking

600
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:52,736
Consumer backlash and then the provider got ripped out of Nordstrom as a result

601
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:58,112
So we wanted to avoid that insofar people seem to be totally okay with an anonymous people counter

602
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:01,184
Sure I like the idea of an anonymous people count

603
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:03,744
And I'm kind of interested

604
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:06,048
It in this idea because

605
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:12,704
Do you think we are at a point given their like beacons are kind of coming into play so beacons are these Bluetooth

606
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,240
Choose kind of devices that

607
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:15,776
Retailers can put in

608
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:17,312
Their stores

609
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:19,104
The track people

610
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,896
Via an app on their phone

611
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:21,920
So

612
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:28,832
There's an argument to be made that if you install a Retailer's app on your phone your kind of opting into being trapped in the store

613
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:29,600
Buy pecans

614
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:30,880
Is that kind of a

615
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:33,440
Fair thing to do I know that's not what Nordstrom was doing

616
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:34,208
Euclid

617
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:36,512
So I think there's a couple things one is

618
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,048
Beacons are often

619
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:40,352
You know by virtue of downloading an application

620
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:41,888
And allowing Bluetooth

621
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:42,656
To work

622
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:44,960
On that phone or two notice begins

623
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:48,544
And then physically being in the store and leaving Bluetooth turned on

624
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,848
Those are all different points that you can

625
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:51,616
Opt out of the

626
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,408
I think the biggest concern

627
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,432
Right now

628
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:56,480
Tends to be in like the facial recognition

629
00:25:56,736 --> 00:26:00,832
Side of things and a little bit lesson to Beacon and that's just because I can't

630
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:02,880
Turn off or stop

631
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:08,768
A video camera from recognizing my face and turning That Into You No data that gets consumed or 2 better marketing

632
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:11,584
Oh you're jumping ahead CIA

633
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:19,008
If it's okay I was I was going to say our beacons preparing us for being tracked so getting us used to this idea

634
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:20,800
Retailers in

635
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:25,152
Maybe people who own stadiums are tracking Us in public places in even getting us

636
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:27,200
Used to this idea of getting

637
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:30,528
Like a coupon or some sort of digital good

638
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,088
In exchange for giving up our location

639
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:35,904
Yeah I think it's interesting because

640
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,952
103 in short Navy

641
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:39,232
But I

642
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:44,096
Really think that Bluetooth is still struggling boo two companies are still struggling to figure out

643
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,376
Like the Great

644
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:47,168
Killer context-aware app

645
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:50,752
When you look at the Bluetooth like Beacon Market

646
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:53,312
And the startups in companies that are involved in that it

647
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:55,872
It's very heavily advertising marketing

648
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:56,640
And

649
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:57,920
Retail dollars

650
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:01,248
Trying to drive coupons or discounts or whatever else.

651
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:03,296
Consumers to advertise to them better

652
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:05,600
And I assume

653
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:08,416
Amazing technology around the corner

654
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:12,256
Take a DNA but Bluetooth but I'm not quite sure that deacons have yet

655
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:13,536
Can I get on that

656
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:19,680
I don't I don't think coupons are red I mean do you have you hit head up Bluetooth coupon yet

657
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:20,960
I have not I mean

658
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:22,496
So I will confess

659
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:25,312
To everybody that I actually clip paper coupons

660
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:27,872
And still use them because it's

661
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:28,640
Easy and

662
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:34,784
My God sometimes it's like a whole dollar off when you're buying like toilet paper

663
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,088
Coyote

664
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:39,904
I am digitally Savvy but I'd like

665
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:40,928
My God

666
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:41,952
It's like funny

667
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:43,488
Right there for the taking

668
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:46,816
But yeah I guess I've use like a Starbucks app kind of

669
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:48,096
Coupon but none of the

670
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:49,120
Bluetooth related

671
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,144
Unzip Safari

672
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:52,192
They're asking too much

673
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,216
Quesadilla

674
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:53,984
42 little

675
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:55,008
So

676
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,288
Maybe that's

677
00:27:57,824 --> 00:28:00,640
I got an example of one that I wish existed

678
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:02,944
Whitney's China internet

679
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:04,992
I want around the world with

680
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:05,760
Your Bhajan

681
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:07,808
Pretty consistently and I live in San Francisco

682
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:12,416
I don't have a car so I'm doing grocery shopping or I'm going to a restaurant to get something to eat

683
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:14,720
Sometimes I encounter a television

684
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:16,000
That the community

685
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:17,792
Lake behind the bar behind

686
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:19,328
You know whoever serving

687
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,632
It'll be like a newscaster

688
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:24,448
Are you a sports game or something like that and I'm listening to NPR

689
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:28,544
On my phone and I would love for my phone to recognize

690
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,824
That TV

691
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:32,640
And to be able to tune in briefly to the audio

692
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:34,944
I think that's like so cool but

693
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,736
It's going to take a long time before

694
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:37,760
As possible

695
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:40,576
I'll see if delineated actually worked out we could be

696
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:42,368
We could be living in that world

697
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,416
What is DLNA

698
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:46,208
DLNA was actually a

699
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:47,488
It was a

700
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:52,352
Standard for communications between consumer electronics goods from back in like

701
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:53,888
The late 90s

702
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,168
And it was

703
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,704
Failure because

704
00:28:57,216 --> 00:29:03,360
Everyone implemented it their own way and know to DLNA devices work together the way they were supposed to and it was

705
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:04,896
Is a big sad thing

706
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:05,920
But

707
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:09,504
Basically the standard it just required everything to be a little too smart

708
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,272
And that was

709
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:11,040
Its downfall

710
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:12,064
So

711
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:14,624
But that's where things could have been enabled under

712
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:16,160
Fatso

713
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:19,488
Okay maybe we'll get all trying to do something like that.

714
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:20,768
That could possibly happen

715
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,304
Using like all play

716
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:23,584
Okay yeah

717
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:24,864
I like that idea though

718
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,424
That the free idea guys

719
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,216
Somebody take it build it

720
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:31,264
Do it so let's go back to

721
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:33,312
Kind of this idea of privacy

722
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:34,592
Because you brought up facial Rec

723
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:35,360
Recognition

724
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:38,944
That is probably outside of beacons in Wifi track

725
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:45,088
Facial recognition feels like very much the future and I'm talking to a lot of startups that are offering

726
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,160
Computer vision on a chip basically

727
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:51,488
To do facial recognition and people counting

728
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,024
For public places

729
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,584
And this is true this does kind of freak people out a little

730
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:57,888
But it also feels

731
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:58,912
Inevitable

732
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:00,192
It does feel inevitable

733
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:00,960
Also

734
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,520
So explain to me kind of how you guys might

735
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:04,288
Compete against

736
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:07,872
Well I'll kind of economy uses the most energy

737
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:10,176
Christine startup in that space I think it's placemeter

738
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:13,760
I believe you actually may have written an article about them recently

739
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:21,696
The vehicle company they just released a new sensor I think it's called a sensor but I'm pretty sure it's a video camera

740
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:23,488
Start of a small video camera

741
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:28,096
And then they do the computer vision processing directly on the device and then send up

742
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:31,680
The raw data which is definitely a good way to avoid

743
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:34,240
Some of the issues of ministering faces

744
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:35,776
I think the issue though is

745
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:39,104
It's going to be tough to install a video camera in

746
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:41,920
Millions of bars cafes and restaurants

747
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:43,456
Museums in otherwise

748
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:44,480
NN have

749
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:47,808
Users any be okay with the fact that their faces are are

750
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,344
Constantly being tracked

751
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:50,880
That said

752
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:53,184
There is a market difference between

753
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,792
Being tracked online and being tracked in the real world and we've seen legislation already

754
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:59,072
Start to move towards

755
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:04,448
Really not being okay with tracking people in the real world and I think he recently the

756
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:05,216
BFF

757
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:06,240
Orem

758
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:08,032
Some in a major

759
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:09,056
Consumer advocate

760
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:10,080
Walk out of talk

761
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:12,128
With some of the companies that are using

762
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:18,528
Facial recognition technology to to drive advertising you know what I'm talking about Stacy there were several companies

763
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:20,576
Was the effd

764
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:22,880
Center for democracy and a couple of other

765
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:26,208
Groups walked out of it was at the Department of Commerce

766
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:27,488
Was holding kind of

767
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:31,584
Talks for industry self-regulation about using facial recognition

768
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,352
Take action

769
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:37,728
Did walk out because the basically felt like the industry wasn't

770
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:39,008
They weren't considering any

771
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,568
Right and I think it's that kind of

772
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:42,848
Damn the torpedoes

773
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:46,176
Concept that is going to make it hard for the technology to take hold

774
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:51,808
I personally don't want my face to be stored by whole bunch of sensors I think the technology is probably inevitable but

775
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:54,368
I think it's going to be hard to turn into a consumer product

776
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,696
Very soon because most of the buyers of that data are

777
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:59,488
Another big retail there

778
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:03,072
Their day researchers their financial technology firms

779
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:03,840
And

780
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:06,144
Consumers don't like it when their data gets to

781
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,448
To go to the prophet Civ of some larger Corp

782
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:11,264
So inept that picks up an interesting question though

783
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,824
Cuz there's there's a couple things that are interesting about

784
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,384
Using video or facial recognition

785
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:17,664
1 is

786
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:19,200
Wow

787
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:23,296
Placemeter sells a video sensor and then they have their algorithms

788
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:24,832
Or a video camera

789
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:26,368
You could argue that

790
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:32,256
Their distribution which is one of the things you're struggling with her you're attempting to do or to

791
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:34,048
That's a terrible word

792
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:38,144
Cure attempting to optimize with

793
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:39,424
Using

794
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,192
Achieve

795
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:42,752
Real-time accurate an anonymous kind of

796
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:43,776
People counter

797
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:46,336
They're already able to do because

798
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:48,896
Video cameras are kind of everywhere

799
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:51,712
So if you could find a way to

800
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:52,992
Create like an algorithm

801
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,528
The process data

802
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:57,600
Maybe on the sensor light placemeter

803
00:32:57,856 --> 00:33:00,160
That's one place to do it but you could also do it

804
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:06,048
You know on premise or you can send it up to the cloud which would be a lot more bandwidth-intensive

805
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,864
Distribution could almost be taken care of for you

806
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:11,936
We're not at a point where things are open like that yet

807
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:14,240
That's also conceivable

808
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:18,336
Yeah I mean the infrastructure is certainly already there you have surveillance cameras in

809
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:21,408
The number of surveillance cameras that are in the United States is staggering

810
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,200
This point I think though

811
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:26,272
They initially began with just plug a sin

812
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:29,088
To when you're in techstars just plug it into your

813
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:32,160
You don't give us your feed your data feed

814
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:32,928
State UK

815
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:34,976
Video camera

816
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:40,096
Yeah and then also you can use like an Android phone and will pay you to put it in your window

817
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,632
But I think ultimately

818
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:45,216
It's going to be challenging to get really granular like in house

819
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:45,984
Data

820
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,520
And a lot easier to get

821
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:48,288
Like

822
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:49,568
City street data

823
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:51,360
I think you can make this point that

824
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:55,712
At some point the data inside of a room becomes a little bit more challenging to know

825
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:58,528
Which I think is kind of what we're focused on what we don't really

826
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,808
Count cars

827
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,112
Or people pedestrians walking pasta

828
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:05,184
The window dressing where we're more interested in capacity within a location

829
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:05,952
Until

830
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:06,720
But I don't know

831
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:08,256
I think there's room for both Technologies

832
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:11,840
I will also say though the market for a little bit different and thereafter

833
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:14,144
Larger retailers and researchers

834
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,192
And I think we're much more focused on

835
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:18,240
Distributions Tech startups

836
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:21,824
So let's talk about that because

837
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:25,152
I think in some of our previous conversations you

838
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:26,944
Kind of made a really good

839
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,480
Point that I think a lot of

840
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:32,064
Kind of connected device startups or Internet of Things startups

841
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:33,088
Miss

842
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,112
Witches

843
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:35,392
Your end audience

844
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:37,440
This isn't you're not selling a sensor

845
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:39,232
You're selling data

846
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,792
And in that changes your audience

847
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:42,560
Fundamental

848
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:45,376
Because the value you have isn't

849
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:47,424
Just for the singular restaurant

850
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,960
It's it's this platform play

851
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:52,288
When did you realize this

852
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:54,336
Did you did you know this going in

853
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,640
How does that change what your how you look at your

854
00:34:57,408 --> 00:35:00,480
If we could at least this consumer at we just wanted people to see how busy

855
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:02,016
Another favorite places were

856
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:08,160
And we immediately. Calls asking for Innokin can I implement this technology Within

857
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:09,696
Our network of locations

858
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:11,488
And we must have had

859
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:12,512
Ken serious

860
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:14,816
Technology companies reach out and say

861
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:16,608
This could really improve

862
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,424
Are Baseline data to compare sales data

863
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:24,544
Too or to better understand or predict foot traffic in the future or to handle Staffing

864
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:26,592
Automate discounts

865
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:27,872
I mean it was

866
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:28,896
All over the place

867
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:32,480
So we decided to essentially Focus all of our distribution through

868
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:35,296
Other people that are data could be more useful to

869
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:41,952
Ultimately consumer application is only as good as the number of eyes that interact with it or the number of transactions that consumers

870
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:42,720
You through it

871
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:44,768
Ultimately we want that to be free

872
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:45,792
So

873
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:51,680
It seemed to make much more sense to be able to have one conversation with the head of product to the startup that has 5000 Plus locations

874
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:53,984
Get a green light knob sudden have

875
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,824
She was pipeline places in to be relevant to allow more consumers

876
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,616
And I think the last one that I would say is

877
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:01,152
The hardware can't matter

878
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:02,944
And we have to be agnostic to the hardware

879
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:07,552
And I think that that was unique to us mostly because we never built Hardware before

880
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:11,904
We weren't like experts at video surveillance and facial recognition software or

881
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:13,696
That type of of learning

882
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:19,328
So it was essentially like what is the cheapest way we can get a sensor into a door and this is it

883
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:20,352
And it's infrared

884
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,912
Is infrared distance sensors

885
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:23,680
Yes

886
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:24,960
We measure

887
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:26,752
Simply spikes in voltage

888
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:31,104
Then we look for shapes that help us determine whether or not it's an entrance or an exit

889
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:32,896
And so

890
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:35,968
Your sensors cost how much to put on the door today

891
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,248
Cost us

892
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:39,296
Yes in Swedish

893
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:41,856
Since we bear the burden of the hardware there

894
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:42,880
About sub

895
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:44,672
Sub $40 at this point

896
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:45,952
Congratulations

897
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:46,720
All right

898
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:48,512
And they should go lower

899
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:51,584
Yeah I really like him to be a $25 or less

900
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,936
And then installing them is that a big deal or is that just like

901
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:57,472
Double-sided tape gun

902
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,032
Yeah well we actually

903
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:01,824
Everything has been engineered to be

904
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:02,848
As

905
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:04,640
Fasting install as possible

906
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:05,920
But we run to a

907
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:06,944
To an outlet

908
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,504
Specifically so that it doesn't ever lose power

909
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,320
And I was about 15 minutes

910
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:13,600
But

911
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:17,440
A single person can do a whole bunch of installations very quickly

912
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:20,000
As long as they're not too far apart from one another so

913
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:23,072
I would say we start to make our money probably in

914
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:24,864
Interment 4 or so

915
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:27,680
That's better than the alarm company

916
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:31,008
I'm not sure what their their margins look like

917
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:32,800
Also this is

918
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:34,848
I should also say you know we charge

919
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,640
$25 / location

920
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:37,408
In 4 months

921
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,688
And

922
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:40,736
What I'm really excited about his once we have

923
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:44,064
Baseline data to then start doing interesting repackaging

924
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:48,928
Like what is the last two years of the financial district in San Francisco look like

925
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,464
Lingcod becomes really

926
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,232
Really cool.

927
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:54,560
That's true and then you could sell that Beyond just

928
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:58,912
Door custard-like the core customers like the merchants you can sell that too

929
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:00,960
Demographers to

930
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:03,264
Patisserie players

931
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:04,800
Gaso

932
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:06,848
That would be really exciting

933
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:07,872
And

934
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:09,152
Maybe then Google buys

935
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:15,808
Yeah I mean I think it's so interesting because I don't know what these larger companies are trying to accomplish but I think one of them

936
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:17,088
Points that you and I

937
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:18,624
Bounce around at one point was

938
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,696
We're just not going to wake up one day and sensors be everywhere

939
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:24,256
You have to figure out some kind of distribution in

940
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:25,024
Garza's

941
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:27,840
Is kind of straightforward but if it works

942
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:31,680
I think it'll on Earth all sorts of really interesting data about how cities get used

943
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:35,264
I think you're right and so I will look forward to you

944
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:38,080
I mean I can see you guys signing deals

945
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:41,664
Payment providers so a belly

946
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:43,200
A square

947
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:48,064
MasterCard any of those guys I know that you're talkin primarily to Tech startups but

948
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,600
You don't think big

949
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:52,160
Hopefully hopefully someone in a large payment process

950
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:55,744
Keyshia Cole

951
00:38:57,024 --> 00:39:00,352
I do think it's crucial to get data about where people are

952
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:01,632
Inside cities

953
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:04,192
Not just inside commercial establishment

954
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:05,216
Butt public

955
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:06,240
Establishment

956
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:07,008
Send

957
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:08,288
That's not going to happen

958
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:09,056
Until

959
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:11,616
You guys get much broader distribution

960
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:12,384
Because

961
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:16,224
Yeah I Miss Polly is not going to be like oh I really want better customer service

962
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:18,016
Sure

963
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,576
Maybe that's what I mean we've had

964
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:22,624
It certainly like universities have reached out

965
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,976
And inside you know we'd love to be able to provide this to our students we've had some interest from

966
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:29,536
City planners who work for like City governments

967
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:31,584
You are interested in putting it in public spaces

968
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,864
Larger

969
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:38,240
The top-tier financial institutions have reached out about some of their their marketing efforts to be able to see

970
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:39,264
Not just

971
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,312
Transaction when someone uses their

972
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:42,336
Visa or

973
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:43,360
MasterCard

974
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:46,176
But all of the physical for traffic that goes into location

975
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:47,456
So I think

976
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:50,528
You know if it works well it works the way that we like it too

977
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:52,576
Hopefully this will be integrated into

978
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:55,136
A lot of everyday companies that they you and I

979
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:56,672
Use Eno regularly

980
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:59,232
I hope so I really think this could be like

981
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,512
6 biggest waves

982
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:02,304
Oh thank you that would be

983
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,352
Spectacular we would love to be as big as Waze

984
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:08,448
See there you go all right what Andrew thanks so much for coming on the show I really appreciate it

985
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,008
Certainly certainly thanks so much for having me Stacy

986
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:17,408
Well that's it for this week show so I hope you come back for next week and thanks for listening
