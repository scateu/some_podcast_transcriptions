00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:13,056
Welcome to the special CS edition of The Internet of Things podcast

2
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:15,872
Brought to you by the open connectivity Foundation

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,992
Open connectivity Foundation is dedicated to ensuring secure interoperability for

4
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:25,344
Consumers businesses and industries by delivering a standard Communications

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,720
Platform abridging specification and open source implementation and a certification program

6
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:34,048
It allows devices to communicate regardless of form factor

7
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:35,328
Operating system

8
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:37,888
Service provider transport technology

9
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:38,656
Or

10
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:39,424
Ecosystem

11
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:44,032
At this year's CES The Internet of Things was the default setting

12
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:46,592
Booth after Booth featured sensors

13
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:49,664
Hubs or Randall devices that connected to the internet

14
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,712
Even among the major chip vendors

15
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:53,760
There were stations dedicated to

16
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:57,600
Retail and beacons Telehealth or 5G technology

17
00:00:58,112 --> 00:01:01,440
And the pig topic was how to connect more things to the internet

18
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:08,608
So with that in mind I interviewed all kinds of people on the show floor and in meetings along the strip to get a sense of where

19
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:10,912
The Internet of Things is headed and why it matters

20
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:13,984
Connectivity and power consumption were big

21
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,056
But so is the lingering concern about the viability of the

22
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:17,824
Consumer Market

23
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,592
For startups

24
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:20,384
Just a note for you guys

25
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:22,944
I know that Madame a and

26
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:24,992
Google home or everywhere

27
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:27,808
And that's the big story that most people took away

28
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:28,832
From the show

29
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:31,136
But I'm trying to go a little bit deeper

30
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:32,160
Cell

31
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:36,768
Let's kick off the show first with a focus on the consumer news in insights

32
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:37,792
Starting with Comcast

33
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,400
Comcast purchase stringify last year's one of the mini smart home deals that are

34
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:49,312
And now we know what they're going to do with it is Chris specialty EVP and chief product officer at the cable Giant

35
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,664
You guys are

36
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:56,224
Smart home automation for all

37
00:01:56,736 --> 00:02:00,576
That's a lot of our listeners

38
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:01,856
Stone In Love

39
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:05,184
So what exactly are you doing the stringify for your custom

40
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:10,560
So we we love stringify because they have a great number of adopters

41
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,632
Steeple relationship zip login

42
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:18,496
Taken

43
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:19,520
Paradoxes

44
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:20,800
Little Dalmatian system

45
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:22,848
Combined it with our own that we were building

46
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,296
Available

47
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:35,136
Initially for everybody with an ex by Kate we were Moss gateway to everybody

48
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:39,488
Eventually

49
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,792
Home automation making it just a layer in the home

50
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,632
So as a user what is this going to look like for me when it

51
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,168
Pops into my Comcast world

52
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,960
So imagine the system

53
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:54,080
Knows what you do everyday and Sons if you leave in the morning because you on the alarm system

54
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:56,640
You lock your door the camera sees you leave

55
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:58,688
What we can do is

56
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:07,392
Set up for you

57
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:12,512
And all for you that is a single sub is so that you never have to get any of that again it don't go through all those steps

58
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,584
So you're basically turning my 8 steps into one

59
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:19,424
Will send you a steps into one I'm making it simple to integrate

60
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,800
I'm not in the Comcast service area so what happened

61
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,080
Stringify for me

62
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:30,944
Are you still be able to use string find the Comcast Lobster you know to lose your stringify kind

63
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,736
An older great Services already provided

64
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,272
Alright thank you

65
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:41,952
Another consumer news Samsung spent CES expanding on his three-year-old Vision to make the Internet of Things Morrow

66
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:44,256
And it's doing this with SmartThings

67
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:46,304
A company that bought back in 2014

68
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:51,424
Samsung has Consolidated every consumer app from its dishwashers to it

69
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,472
TVs under the SmartThings app

70
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,776
So we talked to Alex Hawkinson

71
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,568
Who is the CEO of smart things

72
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,384
To find out more and what's next

73
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,152
For the smartphone

74
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,736
PS with Alex

75
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:08,576
Can send to your SmartThings and we are talking about

76
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:10,368
Because

77
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,392
In their Keynote

78
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,160
Everything was

79
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:12,928
SmartThings

80
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,720
And apparently

81
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,768
Samsung has now integrated

82
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:17,536
Everything

83
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,839
Talk to me about WhatsApp

84
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,887
Ask him sitting in the back

85
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,167
What's a queef

86
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:24,703
We reached a point where

87
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,471
With the

88
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,775
Consumer Internet of Things

89
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,567
Smart home going to the mass Market

90
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:30,591
End

91
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,895
You know you told me not to spend early adopter

92
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,431
Thomas oh

Devices all of its effort so Unified

97
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:44,159
SmartThings platform and what's awesome

98
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:46,463
It's still the same completely open

99
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:49,279
Completely open modeling stance that we've had

100
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,327
Enough for all time

101
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,863
As well so

102
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:55,167
Every new Samsung device will be connecting to

103
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:55,935
SmartThings

104
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,727
We also announced that

105
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,775

Screen and every play every device

108
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,407
The screen will not have one app

109
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,455
Control all these things and relax

110
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,551

This year was

115
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,719
Is the first year that we thought

116
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:19,999
The Internet of Things

117
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,047
The story of Cs

118
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,071
Which is all these device

119
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:24,607
Method

120
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:26,655
Standards War appears to be over

121
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:28,447
Yes we're talking about boys

122
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,727
What what is it

00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:30,495
Mean

124
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,775
Going forward

125
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,055
Now that we're like

126
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,335
Coyote

127
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:36,383
We get it it's going to be there

128
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:38,687
Internet of Things

129
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:39,711

So we have

132
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,295
We found it another

133
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,831
370 devices

134
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:47,391
That work with SmartThings now across all the top

135
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:48,415
Use cases

136
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,719
Smart home and otherwise in the source of working

137
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:55,583
More more lively in available more and more around the world so what's happening is

138
00:05:56,351 --> 00:06:00,959
Nelson opportunity for the developers and service providers the world to build over the top of the

139
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:01,983
So

140
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,007

00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,847
Ansible services unimproved

144
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:07,871
Lights everywhere

145
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,175
The gadgets

146
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:10,943
You connecting device

147
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,223
Future

148
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:12,991
Is about

149
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,039
Services you can buy over the top

150
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,319
Has recently

151
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,135
Last year a deal with ATT

152
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:22,463
Service provider

153
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,303
Talk to you about why they decided

154
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,863
Basically I'm smart

155
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,911
Cloud and what that means for them

156
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:31,935
The types of things they can

157
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:32,959
Their customer

158
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,543
Well you don't talk about it

159
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,823
Specifically in the

160
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,175
One of the top music

161
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:45,503
Has been answering the question are things okay at home

162
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,319
For safety and can

163
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,111
Convenience and all the other things then

164
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,391
ATT

165
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:55,487
You know they got their start as being maybe the biggest proprietary platform in that space

166
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,255
10

167
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,279
They found it at

168
00:06:57,535 --> 00:07:00,351
There's this revolution around internet-of-things the reward more device

169
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,399
The consumers wanted to use in their house

170
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,679
That could

171
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,447
Dissipated

172
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:09,567
Having a proprietary snap they couldn't integrate all the

173
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,383
I working with

174
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:14,943
Are open stamps they got to

175
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:16,223
Make it possible

176
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:17,759
Deliver

177
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,807
Professional monitoring with people

178
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,087
At a much lower cost

179
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,367
Without a contract

180
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,391
And you

181
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,159
All those

182
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:24,927
307

183
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:25,695
G+ device

184
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:28,255
Are things today

185
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:32,607
A better service for the consumers that's cheaper deliver higher margins all those different

186
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,399
It's bringing it up

187
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:37,215
All right it is a SmartThings Hub

188
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:39,519
User like a normal early adopter person

189
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,055
What should I expect from

190
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:41,823
You guys

191

You know what you see is

192
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:45,151
Why is farewell to the building

193
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,687
The platform for the level scale

194
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:49,247
Millions of tracks

195
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,015
Devices

196
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:50,783
Broadening

197
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:51,551
Program

198
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:53,343
You should expect is

199
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:54,623
Much

200
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:57,183
More Innovation higher spacepaste

201
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,975
Invasion of the course the next couple

202
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,255
You seen it

203
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:04,095
Point where more than 50000 Developers

204
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:04,863
Sign up for a new

205
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:05,887
Developer tools

206
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,167
This new app.

207
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,215
On every device with a

208
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:10,495
Screen

209
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:11,263
Innovating

210
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,055
New ways and create new interfaces

211
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,847
Does an apps that run on any

212
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:15,615
Of these devices

213
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,639
Around the world

214
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,431
And so I just think that that is

215
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,711
It's going to open up a new

216
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,503
A whole new space of

217
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,039
Mission by the developer

218
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,575
That'll make

219
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,111
Some awesome things happen

220
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:35,583
Let's take a quick break for message when they open connectivity Foundation

221
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:41,983
Alright Dave last year we heard for the open connectivity

222
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,007
Foundation

223
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:46,079
And it was after the merger with the all seeing Alliance

224
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,871
And I owe tivity was out

225
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:50,943
But then we didn't hear a lot from you guys in this last year

226
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:51,711
You're so

227
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:52,735
Where are you today

228
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:57,855
2017 was really a year for a say retrenching

229
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:04,511
And re-establishing the work that was underway in 2016 prior to the all seeing I'll join

230
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:06,815
Merger with the OIC

231
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:11,679
Perform the open connectivity Foundation we've been on a path to publish the first

232
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:15,775
Release of our specification and open source code through Teva t

233
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:22,175
And we had actually done that we were just in the process of getting some of the first implementation

234
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:25,247
When the murder occurred and to be honest post

235
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,783
Of the organization

236
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:29,343
Involved in the merger and the leadership said

237
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:32,159
Hey look slow down the work-in-progress

238
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:34,975
Let's take a look and make sure that we're bringing the best

239
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:37,023
Both of these organizations

240
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,839
New technologies and specifications to bear

241
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:40,863
EXO

242
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:43,679
Each of the respective groups underneath basically took

243
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,447
The time

244
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:49,567
And you know what may have seemed dormant to a lot of folks in Industry actually wasn't we were

245
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:53,919
Deep in the throes of going through reviewing the specs bring the best out

246
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:55,711
Reincorporating nose and

247
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,503
Quite honestly had a

248
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:02,367
Very effective results from that in the recent announcement in publication

249
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:05,183
Of the new specification to come out post-merger

250
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,743
Less known associate version 1.3

251
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:13,631
And with the corresponding release of the activity open source code

252
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,167
To go along with it

253
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:18,495
The results of the specification open source and surf

254
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,543
Application from the 1.3 effort

255
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:26,431
Has now resulted in products coming to Market and the first wave of rocf

256
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,711
Logo devices

257
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:38,207
For the final day consumer story I spoke with Ben Nader CEO of butterfly

258
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:38,975
About

259
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:41,279
Puma acquiring his smart camera

260
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:44,863
We discuss the deal the saturation in the camera Market

261
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:48,447
And what other consumer startups should look for in an acquisition partner

262
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:51,263
Because you're probably going to need

263
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:58,431
My name is Ben Nader and I am the founder of butterfly and now I am the GM for the butterfly product line

264
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:05,343
Great the first thing I noticed is that I have been saying butterfly wrong cuz I'm always like butterfly I

265
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:06,623
So

266
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,183
Saturnino you guys just got bought by Uma

267
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:13,535
Can you talk to me about the decision to sell your company and how that came about

268
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:18,655
Yes I I really think it was one of those situations that one plus one equal to 3

269
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:24,543
So we built this great product we put a lot of engineering and R&D into it I thought it was very differentiating

270
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:27,615
What woman had a really great

271
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:30,943
Security system but it was missing the camera piece

272
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:35,807
As well as they have a well-established brand name to have a big sales and marketing team

273
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:39,391
What are they wanted to grow butterfly name and Brandon get the product out there

274
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:41,695
Are we going to have a large sales and marketing team

275
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:46,303
Say what's a cat it was a great match it's like what I said one plus one equal three

276
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,327
IHOP

277
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,911
A lot of companies that build smart home devices in the last

278
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,447
Couple months of seoul

279
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:57,311
Because they found the market to be just really tough to be like differentiated and sell to Consumers

280
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:59,103
Was that your experience at all

281
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:05,247
You know that the camera Market was crowded but we were we were backed by some good to be seasoned

282
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:08,319
We had opportunity to continue and and raise more money

283
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:11,391
But I really appreciate it was to accelerate the sale

284
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:15,231
An accelerator Channel access to channel and sugar to the market

285
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,279
Various marketing and branding opportunities

286
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,047
We have

287
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,863
What will you do what advice would you give

288
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:21,631
Other

289
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:23,167
Connected devices

290
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,191
Smart home companies

291
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,727
Going into this year

292
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:29,311
Find this one plus one equal three

293
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:33,663
Find this visit just a marriage that one plus one can add something bigger

294
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:37,247
Lumineers is whole security complete Security System

295
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:43,647
As well as a bigger sales in China that day one that can attach to your company I'm be able to to groin

296
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,695
Awesome thank you thank you

297
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:49,279
And now let's move on to the Enterprise

298
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:56,191
CES is obviously about the consumer but people probably show floor from all Industries seeking the next big thing

299
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:01,055
I ran into a gentleman who worked in R&D at a Building Products Manufacturing

300
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:05,151
Explain what technologies might Inspire our future housing

301
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,455
I work for a building product manufacturer

302
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:09,503
Okay what are those guys do

303
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:10,783
I pretty

304
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:11,551
Zenni

305
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,575
I'm not anybody

306
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,111
Building products that are used in

307
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,391
Construction global

308
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,463
What are you doing at CVS what are you looking for

309
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:20,767
Well our team is a

310
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,559
Research and development group

311
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:26,655
Looking for emerging Technologies new could leverage for the building industry

312
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:29,471
Okay and it sounded like you were excited about the

313
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,495
Smart home stuff

314
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,799
Are like have you seen anything that

315
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,079
Caught your eye

316
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,103
Not yet

317
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:37,151
Only been here very short amount of time

318
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,431
Baidu

319
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,735
Anything that could be

320
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,271
Applicable to products

321
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:44,831
It weather is tracking materials or

322
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:47,903
Connected devices is something we're very interested in

323
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:48,927
Visualizing

324
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:51,999
Materials like augmented reality and virtual reality

325
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,279
Reading Plus right now

326
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:54,559
One of the things

327
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:59,167
Things that people are kind of talking to me about is the idea we're going to build our sensors into walls

328
00:13:59,423 --> 00:13:59,935
Which to me sounds

329
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:00,959
The same because power

330
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,495
Consumption and all this other stuff

331
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:05,567
Are those are the kind of far-fetched things you're thinking about

332
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,103
I think I'd say

333
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,127
Construction level heads

334
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,407
Intriguing to us because

335
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:12,479
It could add value to what we offer

336
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,015
If we have something that's smart and

337
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:16,063
Gives us Competitive Edge

338
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:18,879
Don't we know what it's looking for and why people want them

339
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:22,463
What are the big challenges for the Building Product manufacturing business

340
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,023
Disconnect

341
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,583
Between the manufacturer and the end-user

342
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:32,703
Because there are many Distributors and the contractors are not the same people as the people manufacturing the product

343
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:33,727
So

344
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,775
Our group is mainly made up of Architects

345
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:36,799
Who have

346
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:39,359
An overlapping to technology so we understand that

347
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,383
People specifying

348
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:43,455
Maybe not always the people that'll be occupying space

349
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:44,479
So

350
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:46,015
We have to understand the technology

351
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:47,039
She said that we can

352
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:49,855
But we're looking for

353
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,391
Awesome thank you

354
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,719
Construction was also an 8 Williams

355
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:58,047
Williams is an entrepreneur-in-residence at Kleiner

356
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,863
Who spoke with me about what he's thinking about

357
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:01,887
In Enterprise

358
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:02,911
Coyote

359
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,727
Any guess what are you excited about

360
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:12,639
Yeah this is my 13th straight show 13 years in a row and I'm excited about the evolution of connectivity

361
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:13,919
For the Enterprise

362
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:15,711
So things are really interesting to me

363
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:16,991
Number one would be

364
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:19,039
The idea of Transportation Logistics

365
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,599
Examples 35 billion dollars

366
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,391
Pharmaceuticals each year

367
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,415
Are lost

368
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,463
Stolen or broken during Transit

369
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:28,511
I think we could solve that issue using sense

370
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,815
Second thing is the idea of iot

371
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:32,351
Securities we talked about

372
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:33,887
Are utilities

373
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:35,679
Hisun Pharmaceuticals and other things

374
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:36,959
But have to be secure

375
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:38,495
Is a bunch of great companies are doing that

376
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:41,055
And lastly an industry where I think there's going to be a

377
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,847
Unmoor a Technologies Chinese

378
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:43,871
The show is construct

379
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,663
Can we look at making these

380
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,431
Construction site

381
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,199
Safer

382
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:48,479
It'll get better building Tech

383
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,247
Regency

384
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,783
Autonomous robots helping

385
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,063
Built some of these next generation

386
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:56,671
What are the main issues in the construction industry that you're looking at

387
00:15:57,695 --> 00:16:03,583
Yeah first thing if construction is been traditionally one of the bigger businesses and expansion

388
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,119
Tracks with the economy

389
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,423
We're seeing is the last 30 years

390
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,727
Process technology hasn't changed much

391
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:13,311
Tell me like Altair and others that are out there

392
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:15,103
They're actually adding sensors

393
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:17,407
Robotics another autonomy to the

394
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,175
Construction

395
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:22,783
So couple things first day is number one better quality so we looking like drywall finishing

396
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:26,879
Play something called level five how you can get to the best type of drywall finish

397
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:29,439
To make an office building with greater house

398
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,463
Second to safety

399
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:33,023
There's a company out of text are called killer Tech

400
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,303
Which is actually measuring

401
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,071
Things like

402
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:35,839
Humidity

403
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:39,423
And decibels Xterra make sure you're complying for OSHA

404
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,983
Flossing is just in terms of overall worker safety

405
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:46,591
Christina company that can allow worker to understand when they're using their back to live

406
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,127
So here she may have an issue

407
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,919
So what we'll see this year is the

408
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:53,759
Application of sensor Tech and other autonomy robotics

409
00:16:54,015 --> 00:17:00,159
2 Construction in a way to make better outcomes with more safety and ultimate try to bring some profitability into the

410
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,975
Once iot changes how we built

411
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:06,303
Can it also change how we access building

412
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:11,423
I met a few people thinking about using digital identities as a way to get into their office

413
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:14,495
Work may be in place if their social security number

414
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:16,031
Centos keep getting hacked

415
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,847
So I asked Todd Graves but Allegiant

416
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:23,199
About how iot can change access as well as what he's looking for

417
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:23,967
At the show

418
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:28,575
I'm taught Graves and I'm the senior vice president for engineering and Technology at Allegiant

419
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:31,391
Wow that is a big title okay

420
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:33,695
A lot of people are talking about why can't I use my

421
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:34,719
Digital identity

422
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,255
In the real world

423
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:39,327
What are the kind of challenges are things you have to think about when

424
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,351
People are asking that kind of

425
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:44,703
Well I mean first there's it's important to distinguish between identity and a credential

426
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:46,495
Right identity is something that you

427
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:48,031
Uniquely identifies you

428
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:50,335
In a my mind there's really only

429
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:53,407
2 today to robust forms of identity

430
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,199
There's government identity

431
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:55,967
So

432
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:59,039
Here in the US you've got a social security number

433
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:01,087
You probably got a driver's license

434
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:03,391
And maybe you got a passport and those are all

435
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:06,463
Uniquely identifiable to you very hard.

436
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:09,023
The fake so they are robust forms of identity

437
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:12,863
The second robust form of identity that's more private is the bank

438
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,679
But it ties back to government identity

439
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:19,519
You can't establish a bank account and get a credit card without a government ID

440
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:25,919
Online forms of identity unless you've used a credit card to establish it I would say is non robust

441
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:28,223
So I can set up a Google account

442
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:33,855
An Apple ID or establish a new Facebook account and call myself Joe Blow and there's really no

443
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:35,647
Cross-checking of that identity

444
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,695
So there's a really

445
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:44,095
Really radically different level of robustness between what we normally use for online identity and what we use as

446
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:48,447
Credential based identity in the world

447
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:53,567
So I'm probably not going to ditch my key card to my office anytime soon for my Facebook ID

448
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,639
Yes because if you think about an Enterprise

449
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:58,431
First day you show up at work

450
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:05,087
You fill out an I-9 form and you show the HR department a government ID and then they log you into the EHR system with

451
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:07,391
Something that ties back to your government identity

452
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,439
Mountain Enterprise could say

453
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:11,231
We're going to eat then tight

454
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:16,863
Your Facebook identity your Facebook login to that but they're always going to need to tie back what's in their system

455
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:20,191
To a robust form of government idea that's the law

456
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,983
But there are opportunities to

457
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,263
To tie

458
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:25,567
Your online identity with your Enterprise.

459
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:28,639
Okay and one more question for you since you were the CTO

460
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:29,919
At a very large

461
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:33,759
What are the technologies that you're looking for here at CES

462
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:36,063
I'm looking for conductivity

463
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,599
At low power

464
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,391
Because

465
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:40,927
The most critical devices

466
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:43,487
For us are battery-powered iot devices

467
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:45,023
Their security devices

468
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,559
And so yes it's

469
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:48,863
It's about power and reliable connectivity

470
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:55,007
Graves wasn't the only person thinking about connectivity

471
00:19:55,519 --> 00:20:01,663
After this message from our sponsor will talk to Two Fellas from John Deere who discussed 5G and how to train a machine

472
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:08,063
Need to learn when it's on the edge of an unreliable Network stated

473
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:12,159
Yes we've so far seen a couple products with the ocf sticker on it

474
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:14,463
What should we look for in the year ahead

475
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,231
From the group

476
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:21,631
When we first started ocf the vision was to have a horizontal standard that can work across a variety of different

477
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,399
How to use case

478
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:24,703
Including Smart Home in order to get

479
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,495
It's thing started to this be

480
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:32,639
The organization did have to focus until we chose smart home being one of the fastest-growing and most interesting areas

481
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:35,967
For a members in for the consumer Community alike

482
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:42,623
Until what you seen in the initial C yes introductions are things that are much more smart home Centric

483
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:43,647
But will

484
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:45,695
Definitely evolved and I think a big

485
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:49,279
Change in activity in 2018 will be the addition in the

486
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:50,303
Result of

487
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:56,191
Work that we have a new group focused on other verticals that expand Beyond this morning

488
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,471
I'm so for example

489
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:59,775
Batting over the

490
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:03,871
Over-the-top kind of services with iot for personal and digital

491
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:04,639
Care

492
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:11,039
Aging-in-place Solutions connected car connected home and the interoperability

493
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:14,623
And media and control and security sharing between those

494
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:17,696
Even spanning out into things like

495
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:19,232
Community Management

496
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:21,536
Smart Building Solutions

497
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:24,096
Smart cities acceptor so

498
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,632
Play the number of

499
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:27,424
Different Landing zones where

500
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,704
Millwork of us yeah

501
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,496
And the use of Iowa City

502
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:32,544
Will find its way into products

503
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,104
And services and by the way that also include software

504
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,688
So think now about having his community of ocf devices

505
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:41,760
And connected ecosystem that service providers

506
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:42,528
Can you

507
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:44,064
And developed application

508
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,600
To run from the cloud

509
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:47,136
And to be able to

510
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:49,696
Deploy deliver and monetized

511
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:56,096
These capabilities on top of these ocf connected devices

512
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:02,752
And now here's Wally Pelon Juan Sanchez from John Deere on edge architectures and

513
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:03,520
5G

514
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:07,104
Willie talk director of new technology of Blue River technology

515
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,128
Okay

516
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:09,152
You guys were recently

517
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:12,224
Play acquired by John Deere you do computer vision on

518
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,248
Farming equipment

519
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,296
You can detect weed is very exciting

520
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:20,160
Can you talk to me about what it takes to do the kind of machine learning you guys do

521
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:22,720
Basically it was the edge of a

522
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,512
Baby not awesome Network

523
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:27,072
Yes so we trained everything off

524
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:30,144
So we have dab carts that we start pushing through

525
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,680
Fields and relax

526
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:35,520
Thousands of images we haven't even labeled with Mechanical Turk

527
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:37,312
We then

528
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:39,360
Trainees networks on a GPU

529
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:40,896
The office

530
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:42,688
And then deploy the models out to the field

531
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,224
I'm weak and attacked

532
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:48,576
When those models are performing poorly or a low confidence

533
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:52,672
We prioritize that data for upload so that the network continuously

534
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,208
And

535
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,744
II

536
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:57,024
More

537
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,560
Different fields of exposed

538
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,328
The machine to the bat

539
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:01,888
So what happens is when I'm out

540
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:02,656
Farming

541
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:06,752
I spraying for weeds

542
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,544
Spraying for weeds

543
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,312
And

544
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:11,616
I've got your your your information

545
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:13,152
It's running through that and it's

546
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:16,224
I don't know what this is in your life

547
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:17,760
As a farmer do I have to

548
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:19,040
Do anything or is it just

549
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:20,064
Strictly yorkin

550
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,344
Computer is like oh

551
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:22,880
This date is super important

552
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:23,904
Let's do something with

553
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:24,928
When we get back to the

554
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,208
Garage

555
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:26,976
The barn

556
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:29,024
Extreme and say that guy

557
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:29,792
Safeway

558
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:31,072
Save the cotton

559
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:33,120
Machine

560
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:36,448
Rights if they drive it into a soybean field or corn field

561
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:37,728
Our network has not been performed

562
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:40,032
Do we need to build alert them and say hey

563
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:40,800
Something's wrong

564
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:43,360
Either you're a

565
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:45,152
Something is wrong

566
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,504
And then they can make a decision what they want to keep going or not

567
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,344
And then they can also upload the data that machine will automatically upload any low coffee

568
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,112
Prince data

569
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:56,160
To us we can assess it now in that case

570
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:00,256
In some cases

571
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,024
Hail damage

572
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:02,816
Which is

573
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:04,608
Actually looks quite different than regular car

574
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:08,448
We're going to

575
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,496
Take a bunch of these images off the machine

576
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:11,776
And train

577
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:12,800
What's on in the next days

578
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,896
Do you pull all data from every path eventually to the cloud

579
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:22,784
It depends when we are in the in the development process early in the development process yes and yes she's FedEx to get it all back at 6

580
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:23,808
Too much. Blood

581
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,112
Further down the road in the development process when

582
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:27,904
We start uploading the

583
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,696
Places where we're performing for aliens

584
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:32,000
Alright thank you

585
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:41,472
Julia Sanchez director John Deere Technology Innovation

586
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:48,384
What kind of connectivity environment and connectivity technology are you guys looking for precision

587
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:55,552
We certainly still recognized at rural areas suffer from connectivity so traditionally we've looked

588
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:57,344
That store and push architectures

589
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:03,744
Where we we don't always rely on constant productivity or high bandwidth connectivity we are constantly exploring

590
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:10,144
Low-power a broad range a type of solutions and then expecting things like 5G and Technology

591
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,168
Just like 5G

592
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:14,752
Will really help us redefine what real-time means for us

593
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:18,592
Real real time for us right now memes probably around 32nd

594
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,896
With 5G technology

595
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:23,456
It'll really redefine our store and push model

596
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:28,320
And really help us use the cloud in the true Real Time with say less than one second back in

597
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:31,392
You guys are actually great for 5G because

598
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:33,184
Spell their crops to get in the way of the

599
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:40,096
But that's right it is all the sudden it removes the the barriers that prevented the network companies from investing in that in

600
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:42,400
Awesome thank you

601
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:44,960
Again

602
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:48,288
I know we didn't talk about Madame a doll in the show

603
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,872
And that's supposed to because it's all anyone else who went covered

604
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,920
The rise of voice is important

605
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:56,224
But it's also an established interface right now

606
00:25:56,736 --> 00:26:00,064
Which brings me to one of the cooler things I saw at the show

607
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:06,720
So stay tuned for that after one final message from our sponsor

608
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:09,280
And Dave

609
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:10,816
Before we leave today

610
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:12,864
What are you most excited about

611
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:15,936
I think that we're really excited about it ocf

612
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:16,960
Is the fact that

613
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:20,544
Getting these devices now into the market that can

614
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:22,336
Discover each other in

615
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,872
Securely share data

616
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:25,664
Can create all kinds of

617
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,688
Possibilities

618
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:27,968
In terms of services and

619
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:28,736
Intelligence

620
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:30,528
And really building

621
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:32,064
Not only

622
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:33,856
Controllable home

623
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:36,672
But actually the truly smart autonomous

624
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:38,720
Home environment

625
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:40,512
And deliver the experience

626
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:43,584
Did you see on the shows and you hear on the radio

627
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:45,632
And finally will be able to

628
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:50,752
Bye and deploy and enjoy

629
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:58,176
Bosch showed off of men's projector that fit on the module less than half the size of a credit card

630
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,528
And that module can be embedded on a lamp or even an Amazon Echo

631
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:08,928
This man is projector can projected interactive touchscreen on any surface including our skin

632
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,744
A complete videos at 480p

633
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:15,328
Or 720p depending on how far away the projector is

634
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:18,912
So just imagine if you ask matinee to show you something

635
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:22,240
And your Echo projected the options on the table it was sitting on

636
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:25,824
And then you could use your finger to select whatever option you chose

637
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:29,664
I thought it was really cool and would love to see this embedded in

638
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,432
Devices

639
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,760
Visit the show notes for a link to the video I Shot

640
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:39,136
And thanks again to the open connectivity foundation for sponsoring the CES episode of the show

641
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:41,696
I hope it took you beyond the obvious story

642
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:43,232
Grace and offered you some insights

643
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:44,000
