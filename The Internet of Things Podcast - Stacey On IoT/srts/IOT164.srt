00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:11,776
Hey everyone welcome to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host

2
00:00:12,032 --> 00:00:12,544
Higginbotham

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,568
And your co-host

4
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:15,616
Kevin tofel

5
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:17,408
Awesome show for you today

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,736
We're going to be talking about the new easy mesh Wi-Fi standard

7
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:22,528
Six foxes brand new

8
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:24,832
3 as a service

9
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:26,624
Plus a crazy sensor

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,392
Borsuk box

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,440
We're also found a hob

12
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:32,256
That you're going to want to hear about because it allows for local

13
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:33,024
Control

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:33,792
In your house

15
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:34,560
Aunt

16
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:37,120
We got a bunch of little bits of news including

17
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:38,656
New lights from Philips

18
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:41,472
A cool intercom system for families

19
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:44,288
And data on who owns a smart home device

20
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:48,384
Kevin is going to share his opinion on the wyze camera V2

21
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,432
And he also got a Yale lock

22
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:52,736
So we can talk a little bit more about that

23
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:59,136
Our Guest this week is Chris Myers from Misty robotics this is a smart programmable robot ended

24
00:00:59,392 --> 00:00:59,904
Developers

25
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,208
And if I had the money I would totally buy one

26
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:06,304
Our sponsor this week is machineq

27
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,584
A Comcast service

28
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:09,632
And you can look forward to hearing from them

29
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:10,912
In the middle of the show

30
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:13,728
And now a message from one of our new sponsors

31
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:14,496
Bosch

32
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:21,152
Are you interested in all things iot the Bosch connected World blog covers a wide range of iot top

33
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:27,552
Topix from around the world such as industry 4.0 Mobility smart hold blockchain and

34
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:33,952
Agriculture Tech check out the blog at blog. Bosch - s i.com

35
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:39,328
For articles case studies interviews and more and I will say a lot of fees

36
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:45,728
Corporate blogs run promotional this one is what I actually read on a regular basis to see what's happening and what cool thing

37
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,776
Things people are doing so do go check it out

38
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:48,544
All right

39
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:49,568
Kevin

40
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:50,592
Big news of the week

41
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:52,128
Wi-Fi

42
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:56,992
The Wi-Fi Alliance has certified something called easymesh that is

43
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:02,880
Like the Easy-Bake Oven only it's an easy mesh Network which means your mesh networks will

44
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:04,416
All going forward

45
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,440
Work together

46
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:07,744
Regardless of brand or vendor

47
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,584
Yes and this is a big deal cuz right now if you buy it like an orbi

48
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,120
You had to buy the orbi

49
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:16,192
Main thing I can't remember the Colleton to orbi satellites

50
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:18,240
And you cannot like swap Outlet

51
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:20,800
Acer satellite to work with your orbi satellite

52
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:21,824
You know

53
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:25,920
Biscuits sad inhibits price competition

54
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:31,040
So now we have the ability for everything to work together which is actually something that Kevin and I

55
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,320
What about a really long

56
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:33,600
But

57
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:34,880
There's a fly

58
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,672
Attwifi

59
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:43,584
There is and that's because there really has been a standard for Mesh networking and it is

60
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,120
AAA 802.

61
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,400
11s

62
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:47,680
End

63
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:51,264
Current mesh networks either use some of it or

64
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:57,152
Create their own stuff and that's why things aren't you know compatible these days between say

65
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,688
Google wifi

66
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:02,272
Or be a Nero in a plume Etc so now with

67
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:04,064
Adoption of the standard

68
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:09,184
Turn the Wi-Fi Alliance you think this is great news and in theory it is

69
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,744
But I'm a little concerned because

70
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,144
I've seen some research from last year that says the global market Global spin on wireless mesh

71
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:24,544
Networking has already talked over 5 billion dollars and it's expected be about 11 billion by 2025

72
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:31,200
So there's a lot of non-compatible much stuff out there I don't see any information showing this

73
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,992
Stuff is all backwards compatible

74
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:39,648
So that means if you already have a mesh Network system I don't think you're going to be able to mix and match in the future without

75
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:46,048
At least upgrading your router and that's not something I think most people do on a regular basis and it's not like a smart light

76
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,584
A switch I mean that's

77
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:48,608
Yeah we all did it

78
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:49,376
Like 2 years ago

79
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,544
We did it before that freighter 211 you know AC or and whatever you might have chosen up a tie

80
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,384
Time a ex is coming that's going to be even faster which is great but

81
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,200
Honestly I don't see this as backwards compatible

82
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:06,784
And I sort of wonder what's the incentive for these companies to

83
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,624
Open up the walls and say yeah now will work with anybody here

84
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,160
I don't see the intended to that

85
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:18,559
It may be because of mesh has an important aspect of like a good smart home system and a lot of these companies are getting into those other

86
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,327
Other devices

87
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,351
It might also be

88
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,375
Pressure from

89
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,167
The isps which

90
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:24,191
For a while

91
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,471
Consumers

92
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:26,495
They went with

93
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,775
ISP routers

94
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:30,591
Incredible Never Their Eyes Pete gave them so maybe

95
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,895
They adopted this because they realize that that's

96
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:33,663
That's the way of the world

97
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:34,687
Going to go now

98
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:37,247
Baby the isps then adopt this

99
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:42,367
And for many people you're right that would be their new router that they the rent or buy

100
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:45,183
Directly and then compatibilities

101
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,719
Bonus I get that

102
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:51,583
So yeah if you wanted to sell an extra at like it I mean basically allows them to get into

103
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,631
Easier extender market for

104
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,167
Crappy wifi routers

105
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:55,935
But your eyes peep

106
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:04,639
I don't know why it just it sounded good when I saw the headline it didn't feel so good as I thought

107
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:06,431
Through I just I don't know

108
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,199
You know

109
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:14,623
I don't know I literally just replace a router actually so I mean it is rare but the only reason I did it was not to get faster speed

110
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,903
Need sorting like that

111
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:22,303
It was because it just happened to fall off a table and broke the antennas can be soldered and some pieces fell off and

112
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:26,399
Question the Integrity of it otherwise I'd still have this router that I bought in 24

113
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,447
But that the Google router

114
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:34,079
That was the original Google onhub which was software flash to become essentially a Google Wi-Fi unit

115
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:39,711
So yes and I replaced it with a Google Wi-Fi units now I have to Wi-Fi units instead of a non other than Wi-Fi

116
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:40,735
Cool

117
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,271
Speaking of network

118
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:45,087
Let's talk about a low-power wide area

119
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,623
So these are the

120
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:50,975
Big networks ethernet Works cover cities or big Regional areas

121
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:51,999
Countries possibly

122
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:56,095
There are two flavors are the unlicensed bands and then there are licensed

123
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:56,863
Bye

124
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,143
Those made by cellular

125
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,471
Pay for the other flavors of this our cat M1

126
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,775
And nb-iot

127
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:08,639
Now what we're going to be talking about is sick. Such as doing their own proprietary Network

128
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:09,919
In

129
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:10,943
Set

130
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,039
Six-axis launching a new sensor device called the sensit discovery

131
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:15,807
And

132
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:16,831
They

133
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:20,159
Not as part of this but a week ago also launched

134
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:20,927
A

135
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,975
Assuming they are calling connectivity as a

136
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:24,255
The service or cats

137
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:27,583
Please no one ever use the phrase inside

138
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:31,167
So basically all it is is there going to ship you

139
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:33,983
A base station a subox enable base station

140
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:37,311
If you want to try using their Network in your

141
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:40,383
Farm fields or perhaps your Warehouse

142
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:46,783
So it makes a ton of sense because they've been trying to cover the us but can't cover the whole us

143
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,623
Just randomly that takes billions of dollars so what they're doing is if you're like

144
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,927
Hey you know I really like the look of your network

145
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,207
But you don't have coverage area

146
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:54,975
How can I do this

147
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:55,743
Is there like

148
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:59,839
You know what if you got Ethernet or 3-g will send your base station you plug that right in

149
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,375
You are good to go

150
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:07,775
It's almost like the base stations that the carriers usted provide when you had poor cellular service in your home

151
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:13,151
You would connect that to your ethernet connection of your Wi-Fi and that Pam credit many cell area

152
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,967
That's it femtocell

153
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:19,807
Yes and this is actually what our spots are machineq also.

154
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:23,647
So in there doing a different version of a low-power wide area network they're doing Laurel

155
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,951
But they do say they're not working

156
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:30,815
But anyway this is going to be a common thing for getting these Networks

157
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,095
Spread out over

158
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:32,863
Some more places

159
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,143
Ton of sense

160
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,423
It's basically built it is

161
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:39,007
If you need it and Kevin do you want to talk about the sensitive I switch

162
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:40,031
Looks pretty cool

163
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:46,431
Yeah I like this it's a really small sensor weighs about 2 oz and it detects up to five different things temperature

164
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:49,503
Pictures of light motion humidity and vibration

165
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,807
Oh and also has magnets and it's easily

166
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,367
A door open close sensor for example

167
00:07:54,879 --> 00:08:00,255
And it just clicks all that data and sends it to you through the sick Fox network and then you can

168
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:06,655
Presumably do whatever it is you like me know what some animations or things like that or maybe just want to let you know stare at the day today that's up to you

169
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:09,215
I don't know how much this cost

170
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:12,287
You can sign up for it now it's kind of been in beta for a while

171
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:15,359
But yeah I like it's a nice little little sensor

172
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,663
Yes and presumably he'll need a

173
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,687
Sigfox Gateway

174
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:19,711
For this

175
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:22,783
Yeah I love to put this in my mailbox down the street

176
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,599
Well so this actually we weren't going to talk about this

177
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:26,367
This is not an issue

178
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,903
Some TV rating for the show notes

179
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:30,207
You guys but I just bought a device

180
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:34,815
Because I want to measure temperature and humidity at my daughter's classrooms cuz they're in a portable building

181
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,863
And she complains that it's too hot

182
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,655
Too stuffy and the school is like

183
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:40,191
I'm sure it's just find me tired

184
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:40,959
Air conditioning out there

185
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:43,007
So I decided Well is he

186
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:43,775
What it's really like

187
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:44,799
And

188
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:47,615
Look at you parent with the sensors in the Nevada

189
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:52,479
I know I'm not a helicopter parent heat triggers for migraines

190
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,247
Terrible

191
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,015
Anyway

192
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:57,855
So what happens is I was like Oh I thought I was going to actually

193
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:00,415
Sponsors the twilio

194
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,183
Sim

195
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,207
And actually just

196
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,999
Use that as a connection for

197
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,279
An Arduino that was going to

198
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,047
Sensors on a

199
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:08,607
Because I didn't think the school was going to let me

200
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:13,215
But the school said yeah you can come in on the Wi-Fi network that's totally fine

201
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:16,031
Now I just bought a $90

202
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:18,591
Was $90 on sale and aware glow

203
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,127
So aware makes a

204
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,151
Air quality

205
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:25,247
That's her that's $200 but the glow is like this night light

206
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,015
Outlet

207
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:30,111
Plus air quality sensor and that's only I think it retails for like

208
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,391
$105

209
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:33,183
So I bought that

210
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:37,791
It would have also worked for that there was a long way of telling you guys about this and

211
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:45,727
Just out of curiosity I still want to hear about it next week but it does I don't know why I'm not familiar with the device so

212
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:51,871
Because it's called glow is there any visual notification of with the

213
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,151
So

214
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,687
There's a night light component that

215
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,455
Turns on and off

216
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:57,247
Control it through Google home

217
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:59,807
And then there's also a light

218
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,343
On top that glows

219
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:04,159
Green yellow or red depending on the air quality

220
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:11,327
And I was just thinking it would be interesting for the kids to see the information you're going to get the data but it would be nice for them to see some

221
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,351
Wellness

222
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,119
Thread in the

223
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,143
Muscovite unplug it

224
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:17,983
Could you already have the data so

225
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,007
Problem solved

226
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:19,775
There we go

227
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,359
Your classrooms get an upgrade

228
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,895
So that's the sick Fox

229
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,711
This is I think really cool

230
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:34,111
Especially for a lot of our listeners who write in every week to complain about having their data in the cloud and there are a lot of

231
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:36,159
So this is a device

232
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:37,439
Cold habitat

233
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:40,511
H u b i t a t

234
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:45,631
And it's $159 Smart Hub one of the founders is actually

235
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:48,191
One of the guys who created the rules engine

236
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,215
Or SmartThings

237
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,263
So this is a

238
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,799
Device could have built

239
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:55,103
I have the SmartThings experience in mind

240
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:55,871
But

241
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:58,175
The owner controls it so

242
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,711
You plug this in

243
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:00,991
Extra devices

244
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:03,039
280 create the network and then

245
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,087
Data stays local

246
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,111
It doesn't go

247
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:06,879
Anywhere

248
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:09,439
And if you want to update or grab some

249
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,975
Maybe some new apps or

250
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:12,767
Something for your habitat

251
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,559
You pull it down at your request

252
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:21,215
I like this and I look into it a couple weeks ago as I was researching hubs and I should note that right

253
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:25,823
Right now I'm on the site actually down $215 in the US

254
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:30,431
Yeah it is the Hub or USB stick

255
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:33,759
Which includes zigbee and Z-Wave on ethernet cable

256
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:40,159
So yeah I kind of like the idea of this and I know a lot of our listeners will as well because of the local aspect

257
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:40,927
David

258
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,231
So for this hub

259
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,767
What's also cool is

260
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:48,863
While everything can be done locally it also can go out and talk to cloud-based

261
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:49,887
Applications

262
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:53,983
Which means it will work with Madam a witches are shorthand for

263
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,775
Amazon Echo digital assistant

264
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,567
We just want to set off yours

265
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:59,615
So it works with that it works

266
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,407
I believe with if

267
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,687
And

268
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,223
Things like your Lutron

269
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:05,503
Hub if you have that

270
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,295
Your Hue Bridge your Sonos is

271
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:10,879
And a bunch of other existing devices that you might have

272
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,439
So it's pretty cool I think

273
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:15,487
Yeah I love the fact that

274
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:19,327
Aside from the date and not going up to the cloud is your internet does go out

275
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:25,727
The still works 100% I mean it's cuz it's all local and your wife I obviously still going to be around noon.

276
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:31,615
Have to go do anything else with your internet or your network of the move files around but you still have everything working here

277
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:34,943
Yes and it works with a lot of the brands we talked about like lifx

278
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:35,711
Donkey

279
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:37,247
Schlage Samsung

280
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,015
Aerotek

281
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,039
Bosch

282
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:39,807
Sbarro

283
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,343
I don't see ecobee on here

284
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,391
And I don't see nest

285
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,927
Obey Ducey nanoleaf

286
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,999
Lots of products out there

287
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:50,559
That this will work with and where will be coming

288
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,327
All the time

289
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,863
As people build device driver

290
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:59,519
I was just going to say it you can build your own and absent device drivers with this and that reminds me of the candle

291
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:05,919
Fillers for SmartThings which has a pretty active community and I know you can just take SmartThings handlers but I wonder if

292
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,711
50 Brookside

293
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:11,807
OC so I wonder because the fibaro folks

294
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:15,135
They provide some device Handler stores ampleforth SmartThings

295
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:18,719
That you can download that's how you get your fibaro devices work with SmartThings

296
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,255
I wonder

297
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:24,863
Is there doing the same thing here in which case there's a lot of potential here

298
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:26,911
On the cheap

299
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,703
On the cheap so

300
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,519
If you guys are interested in that and I should warn you

301
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:38,175
They are very clear in saying that this is for people who really want to play with this stuff this is not yet for people who want

302
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:40,479
Something that they can set forget that's easy

303
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,759
So most of our peeps

304
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:42,783
So most of our people

305
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,063
I just want you to everybody

306
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,599
For the people who are like

307
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,879
And Kevin

308
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:49,695
I know you're excited but you did not love your smart

309
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,231
So I'm curious

310
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,559
But that wasn't

311
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,327
For the

312
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,119
It wasn't because I had a tanker

313
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:00,703
No I don't mind tinker and I love to Tinker Bell movie

314
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,495
But that wasn't it it just

315
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,519
Didn't Do It For Me

316
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:05,055
The Experience wasn't there for me

317
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,103
Well either Kevin or I will try this out

318
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:07,871
Will fight over

319
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:11,967
You can try it if you're going to buy me a misty 2 robot

320
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:15,295
Don't get ahead of yourself my friend

321
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:18,111
Those are a bit more expensive

322
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,647
Alright so

323
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:22,975
What are big exciting things this week let's talk about some of our smaller bits of news

324
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:23,743
Such as

325
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:26,303
I ran into this device that I thought was pretty cool

326
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:29,375
Republic Wireless which is a company that makes

327
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,167
Well the word

328
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:34,239
Cellular mvno I don't know what they're doing now but

329
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:37,055
They launched this device called the relay

330
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,359
And it's designed for kids

331
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,919
And basically it's a speaker with a button on it

332
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,455
When you press the button

333
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:44,735
It'll send a

334
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:49,343
Short voice message to your parents phone so I can get that message in SMS form

335
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:52,415
And I can respond via SMS in the device will read the message

336
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,439
Switch back to your kids

337
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,207
Or

338
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,231
If you have two of them

339
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:57,791
You can actually just have them set up as like a little

340
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:58,815
Intercom system

341
00:14:59,071 --> 00:14:59,583
Between the two

342
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,351
Which

343
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,887
I think it's really cool

344
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:05,727
We have actually used are Amazon Echo and Google homes as this

345
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:09,567
Kind of thing for talking to her daughter both when she's upstairs but also

346
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,591
When she is

347
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:15,455
At home and we're away from home and we just want to let chicken with her or she wants to check in with us

348
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:16,991
A single one will cost

349
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:18,783
$99 at tu casa

350
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:19,551
149

351
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,879
Ouch it is kind of pricey

352
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:26,719
But it's nice if you don't have a landline in but they sit me up

353
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,487
Home phone

354
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,279
Well

355
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:34,911
Yeah I mean it's but it's almost like an SMS CB radio to me it's not the voice

356
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:35,679
Device

357
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:36,959
That's true if you don't have

358
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:40,031
Fred I should say they do have a service fee

359
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,311
$5

360
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:44,127
Because this is this is basically like a cellular

361
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:49,247
Sure you know what this reminds me of an I don't know if you recall it to remember that Peak

362
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:51,295
The small email device

363
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,087
Did nothing but email

364
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,879
Yeah yeah yeah

365
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:58,719
I'm not I mean listen I don't have younger kids these days so

366
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:03,071
You're obviously not the Target customer and for people who are the Target customer

367
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,351
Okay I get it cuz

368
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,119
Probably aren't

369
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:08,447
A ton of great options in this space so I get it I do

370
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:09,727
You know you don't need

371
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:14,335
Every kid to have an iPhone 10 and paying you $46 a month if they're

372
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,871
6 years old we just need somebody

373
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:18,175
Some way to talk to them in their homes I get it

374
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,711
But I don't know

375
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:21,503
Okay Kevin's not spending the money

376
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,783
I don't know if you guys will

377
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,063
Synchronicity

378
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:29,439
Maybe you save your money for Misty or maybe you save it for this summer because I was talking with someone from

379
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,719
Philips Lighting

380
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:33,791
And they're going to launch a colored outdoor light this summer

381
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:37,631
So nothing more than that but I got very

382
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,167
Excited about color

383
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:39,935
Tunable

384
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,215
Outdoor capable

385
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:41,983
Philips Hue

386
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:44,287
Pothead

387
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:48,895
Then I was going to buy like a fire pit Meme and just get some colored bulbs to flicker like fire

388
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:49,919
Yes

389
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:50,943
Yes that is

390
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:51,711
Definitely

391
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:52,479
Cheaper solution

392
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:53,503
Fire pit

393
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,039
Nothing that is warm

394
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,063
But that would work

395
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:58,367
Alright Kevin you got some survey data

396
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,391
Just for those

397
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:03,487
Yes it's not a ton here but I just happened to see this

398
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:06,559
Infographic and survey from metova

399
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:12,447
They have survey people in the US and these numbers are kind of Staggering they say

400
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:18,847
From the survey respondents 90% over 90% of consumers in the US have a connected home device not

401
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:23,199
Resume playing like a router or something like that

402
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:29,599
Yeah I exactly although even the new Kindle tablet I just bought one has hands-free Madame a built-in to

403
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:35,487
Crazy speaking of Madame a the results from metova survey say that nearly 70%

404
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:39,839
Already have a voice control system such as Madame a 58%

405
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:44,959
Kuoni connect new device are concerned about how it may impact their privacy I would hope it be more than that

406
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:48,287
And 30% who do not have a connected home device

407
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,359
Currently do plan to make a purchase within the year

408
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,151
So these numbers

409
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,943
Sounded hire me except for the

410
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:59,295
Concern about privacy I thought that would be higher than 90% in the US have a connected home device

411
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:00,319
Okay

412
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:04,927
Exactly 30% of the 10%

413
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:05,695
12

414
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,743
Apparently growth is done there now we're just

415
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,023
Can I sell more connected device

416
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:12,095
And mesh Network routers

417
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,375
Here's how we're going to do it

418
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,911
Mattamy is coming to more stuff

419
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,447
This time TiVo

420
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:19,263
I never had a TiVo

421
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:20,799
Idea

422
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,591
I forgot about it but hey if you have one

423
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,359
Now you can control

424
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:28,479
Yep this is I was looking to see what you could actually do and it's pretty

425
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:34,879
Full feature mean you can skip commercials by voice with the TiVo skip mode you can launch apps change channels by name

426
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:35,647
Amber number

427
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:39,743
Course the regular controls of play resume pause fast forward rewind

428
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:43,839
So that you know this isn't just like turn on the TV this is a bunch of stuff

429
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:47,167
It is and if you would like to spend even more money

430
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,703
I'm connected devices

431
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:49,983
Arlo Netgear

432
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,775
Smart home brand is

433
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,055
Going into

434
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:55,359
Security lighting outdoor lighting for the home

435
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,383
So they already make

436
00:18:56,639 --> 00:19:02,527
Cameras both wired and wireless cameras for the home and I think they make a baby monitor it's adorable that has little bunny ears

437
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:03,551
Okay

438
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:05,087
Now they have lights

439
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,391
Also change colors

440
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:08,927
Holy mackerel

441
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,463
Not Justa Phillips

442
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:16,607
You can now buy outdoor Arlo lights these are security lights so you're probably going to have them on bright white most of the time

443
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:18,143
You know if you're being

444
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:19,167
You enjoy the stuff

445
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,703
Maybe you do something else

446
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:24,031
So you can buy the system which is

447
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:26,079
One camera plus a

448
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:27,871
Little converter Hub thing

449
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,663
It's a bridge or low bridge

450
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:30,431
If that's

451
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,271
I got a bridge to sell you

452
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:38,111
So yes a bridge 440 999

453
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:40,927
Or

454
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:41,951
You can buy two

455
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:43,231
For 249

456
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:44,767
That's a lot of

457
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:49,375
But this Compares with things like the ring floodlight cam

458
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:51,935
And I feel like there are other netatmo make

459
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,007
Is a present scam that also has a flood light on top of it

460
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:55,775
So

461
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:57,567
More options in the

462
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:58,847
Lighting the outside of your

463
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:06,015
They're very modern looking I couldn't get this past my HOA here unfortunately who still seems stuck in the 90s

464
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:11,135
I like the looks of them and their wireframing they have rechargeable batteries to it's kind of nice

465
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:11,903
Yes in

466
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,695
Is there anything like the cameras

467
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:17,023
There's so much fun because I got this magnetic Mount you just like

468
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:19,583
I'm stuck on this

469
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:20,607
It's

470
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:22,399
And they work with Madden may as well

471
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,167
Baidu

472
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:25,215
So in the bridge is a nice touch

473
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:26,495
Because beforehand

474
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:29,055
I had for my camera I have a massive

475
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:34,175
Bridge device that is plugged into my router and it's kind of large and cumbersome

476
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:34,943
So this looks

477
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:37,247
Smaller and cuter

478
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,783
Sadly it does not work

479
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,575
The Netgear routers do not

480
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:41,599
Interface with this

481
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:45,439
And now it's time

482
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:47,231
For another camera

483
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:55,167
Oh that's right yes the wyze cam version 2 I decided to put a camera in the back window of

484
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:57,727
Are townhouse I already have a front camera

485
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:02,847
With a nest indoor camera behind the window unfortunately I can't put cameras outside so I have to

486
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:04,639
Do with screens in my windows

487
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:06,431
That the cameras looks real but it's okay

488
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:08,223
20 bucks I mean

489
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:14,111
Long story short if you need a camera for 20 bucks you cannot go wrong with the new wyzecam

490
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:18,208
It's very similar to the old one it's got a matte finish on the outside instead of glossy

491
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:22,048
Otherwise it looks the same they upgraded the sensor inside

492
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:28,704
They have also added motion detection tagging so you always had motion detection which would tell the

493
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,824
Camera yes capture this video somebody's walking past whatever but now they actually show you in the app

494
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,848
Hernia video

495
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:36,128
A little yellow

496
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:36,896
Border

497
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:42,528
Where the motion is because maybe there multiple things moving and you need to know what's at the camera off you can do that

498
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:49,184
I did not test the SD card functionalities cuz I'm out of SD cards but just like the old version of the camera

499
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,024
You can keep all of your information local for that

500
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,864
Or you can use their Cloud which is actually run on AWS I found out

501
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,632
It's

502
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:02,240
14 days of history for free there's no subscription charge the twenty bucks does it that's it

503
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:08,640
I don't know you tried the original one do you recall if you could daisy-chain multiple ones on a single power cord

504
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:09,664
I don't think so

505
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,944
Cuz it's got to

506
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,992
You daisy chain amount of power

507
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,528
Strip

508
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:15,552
Can I come together

509
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:17,344
So what they did but this one

510
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,392
Is they have a micro USB port

511
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:22,976
For the power brick that comes with this you power to the micro USB slot

512
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:25,536
But there's also a full size USB port

513
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:27,072
And you can daisy chain

514
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:33,728
Through that up to two more cameras so one power cord can power all three cameras over USB

515
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:36,032
But I only bought once I didn't say that

516
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:40,640
That's actually kind of a neat feature and like you could create a little ring of security

517
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:41,408
I'll be looking at

518
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:44,480
Well you can call her ring security.

519
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:45,760
I couldn't have

520
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,576
Was literally talking about a ring

521
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:50,880
Security however

522
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:51,648
There are come

523
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:56,000
Yay wyzecam

524
00:22:56,256 --> 00:23:02,144
I really like the camera I think it's a great purchase for anyone who just wants to experiment with what you could do with camera

525
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,960
And they actually have added if this then that

526
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:05,984
Compatibility

527
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:11,616
So yay for that you can now use it till like if it triggers motion it could set off a light or

528
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:13,152
Alarm or

529
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:14,176
Something else

530
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:20,064
Whatever you could geofence with your phone and if this then that turn the lights came on when you leave for example

531
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:25,952
Yeah

532
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:28,000
I look for the good in every product

533
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:30,816
So you also bought something else

534
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,608
I'd love to hear your thoughts on

535
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,448
Yes I bought this

536
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:37,472
So

537
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:42,848
I bought what you talked about last week or the week before that was the nest X Yale lock

538
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:46,176
I already have a Smart Lock it's a Kwikset Z-Wave lock

539
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:48,480
In lovely brass thank-you HOA

540
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:51,808
But the motor was insanely loud on that thing

541
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:55,136
So I decided let me try this nest

542
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:56,928
Add wow it's like

543
00:23:57,184 --> 00:24:02,048
By comparison whisper-quiet it's so much quieter and yes you can hear the motor but it's so much quieter

544
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:07,168
Put another way the Kwikset was so loud that when the girls are watching TV they would pause

545
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:09,984
Weather watching because they couldn't hear the TV while the lock

546
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,008
Motor engaged

547
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,544
No problem now so

548
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:14,592
I know you had a hardware

549
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:19,200
Bad Hardware I guess multi Hardware Co descenders back you got a new one and twerking

550
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:24,576
I thought I did too because I put it in the door to call 20 minutes

551
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:26,368
And fired up and it says

552
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:29,440
Press the yellow button to your computer that's locked

553
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:34,048
And I did it and nothing happened on the touchpad

554
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:36,096
It happened to him miss you

555
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:43,264
Wouldn't know it was a legit issue I guess you could call it installer error I decided let me just make sure the key

556
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:47,104
Cable is fully seated because every one of these locks has a cable from the

557
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,408
Front keypad area to the back

558
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:55,808
Smart Serie the board and sure enough it was angled a little bit so obviously during the installation it came

559
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:56,576
Conceited

560
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:57,344
So I

561
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:03,744
Seated it receded it put everything back together and sure enough it works just fine so it's working great the girls are very happy

562
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,768
I'm happy

563
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:05,792
It's a beautiful

564
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,584
Even in brass

565
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,352
Yes

566
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:09,888
I guess I am bitter about that

567
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:12,704
Yeah it's really really nice it's very sleek

568
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:18,848
It's much nicer than in the Kwikset that I had and I feel like it's a little more robust of a lock as well

569
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:21,152
Yes that's it there higher-quality

570
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:25,504
Yes and I checked just for you guys who are like

571
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,088
Stacy it was that what happened to you I did check the cable see

572
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:31,136
The connection between my cable

573
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:32,160
3 *

574
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:38,304
I will note that when you're installing it should you buy this and install it it's not a crazy error to get because

575
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:40,096
Putting the cable into the lake

576
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:41,632
Like wire guys that they have

577
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:42,912
It's a little thick in it

578
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:43,936
Requires a little

579
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:47,776
Nothing around very easy for the cable to become a little bit

580
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:49,824
Disconnect it so you have to watch that when you're

581
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:55,712
Yep but it was an easy fix and I didn't have in the past the nest connect

582
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,856
Now you got that included with it because for two I thinks 27999 for the lock with the Kinect

583
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:04,416
It's 249 99 if you already have a Kinect

584
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:11,072
And I'm not a fan of hugs and bridges new extra ones anyway but this is unlike anything else that I have because it looks like a

585
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:17,472
Small module you just plug into an outlet in your nest products and it didn't even need to be plugged in for me to configure to my

586
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:18,240
My Wi-Fi network

587
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,032
Yeah

588
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:23,360
It's very nice I like it I like it alot so

589
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:27,712
I was also excited the very day I installed this that Yale announced

590
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:30,528
Support for Madame a voice unlocking

591
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:36,928
For their locks you could already lock your door with matinee on the Alaskan now you can also unlock and when you do that

592
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:37,696
Ask for you to

593
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:38,976
Recite your PIN code

594
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:42,048
So that way somebody can just shout hey unlock the door and let themselves in

595
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:47,168
But then my enthusiasm was temper because this is not for the nest which actually thought it was

596
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:49,216
It's only for their Usher locks

597
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:50,240
Oanda

598
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:51,776
Schlage also

599
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:53,312
I want to say last week or the week

600
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,080
The four

601
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:56,128
Also announced unlock features

602
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:56,896
4

603
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:57,664
Bear

604
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,432
Connect

605

Through anime

609
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:06,880
So same thing that you got out of pain and actually if you miss

610
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:09,184
State the pin more than three times its

611
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,208
Locks you out

612
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:12,000

Esther security measures there

614
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:18,656

00:27:56,032 --> 00:28:00,384
I recently received my connecting a long panel from ticks are elderly Kickstarter backer

632
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,992
I got my connect alarm panel I'm really happy with it cuz I can integrate my pre-wired alarm

633
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:11,392
What's my Samsung SmartThings Hub what are the things I did was I bought a bunch of cameras and put them around the house

634
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,416
But I really don't want them

635
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:18,304
According

636
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,608
When arms is away mode when I leave the house

637
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:24,448
Automatically turned on all those parts which is turned on on my cameras inside my house

638
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:26,240
In this recording on my alarm

639
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:30,848
I'm outside the house and then when I return home at all

640
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:37,248
The alarm disarmed itself and all my cameras turn off that way I have them going if anything happens when I'm away from the house but they're not recording

641
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:40,576
When I'm inside the house pretty cool

00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:43,392
And have a great day

644
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:48,512
Way to go Kyle for using the cheap wise cans to do something fun

And now

666
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:37,152
A message for this week sponsor hey everyone we are taking a break from The Internet of Things podcast for a message from Mars

667
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:43,552
Sponsor sponsor is machineq a Comcast service and I have Alex Crum here

668
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:46,368
Talk about machineq and some of its use cases

669
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:47,392
So Alex

670
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:50,208
Remind us one more time what is machine

671
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,024
Excuse enterprise-grade Network

672
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:59,424
Specifically deal for iot we're working with B2B and b2c iot solution providers to help

673
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:03,264
Then get their products faster the market by providing the network layer for them

674
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:04,544
So Alex

675
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,848
Who are machine keys end-users

676
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:09,152
First let's define what we mean by end-user

677
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:15,552
Machine Keys customers include iot solution providers who test and bundle art activity is part of their go tomorrow

678
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:19,136
Plants some have new devices are designed to be lower compliant

679
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:24,768
What others are actively converting cellular Z-Wave Wi-Fi zigbee devices to our Lord at work

680
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:27,072
Mission Q also sells connectivity

681
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:33,472
Directly to SMB mid-market and Enterprise businesses who need Laurel and iot network connectivity

682
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:35,776
To deploy their latest iot applications

683
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:38,336
These customers cross nearly all market segments

684
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:41,408
Agriculture industrial to retail and Beyond

685
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:45,760
Once an end-user then chooses one of our solution providers at

686
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:46,784
Is working of us

687
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,088
Recognizing machineq has

688
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:52,160
Many many different Services were being built upon this platform

689
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:54,464
Rather than having a bespoke

690
00:30:54,720 --> 00:31:00,864
RFP we're going to a contract manufacturer to help them out with their new use case they look to us in our portfolio of

691
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,168
Solutions that we can provide

692
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,472
XYZ as well

693
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:08,288
And as we continue to discuss on the show

694
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:10,336
Once they have this connectivity

695
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:14,432
That really enables them to do a lot more with their business can you give us an example of that

696
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:15,200
Yes

697
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:17,760
Pansophic is one of our solution providers

698
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:20,064
Who purchased connectivity from Comcast

699
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,136
What are there any Zara customers the New York Housing Authority

700
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:26,720
Has been deployed the pansophic solution using a machine to network

701
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:28,512
Pansophic first installed

702
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:32,352
The empty flash device for machineq which is a multi-use device

703
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:33,888
Current temperature humidity

704
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:34,912
Vibration

705
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:36,704
And other monitoring capabilities

706
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,520
The begin monitoring temperature humidity first

707
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:44,640
Dinosaurs adding air sensors to detect mold then they started adding Leak Detection sensors

708
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:49,248
Throughout the building as well we often find customers starting with one particular need

709
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:53,088
I've been learning on additional sensors and services as they grow

710
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:57,440
Most of our solution providers are certain single-threaded and they go in and

711
00:31:57,696 --> 00:32:01,280
Their end users ultimately one thing they've identified as a hero use case

712
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:05,632
So we say what's a temperature and humidity detection is East case number one

713
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:07,680
Once they're in there with our connectivity

714
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:09,216
Viennese are my comeback

715
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:09,984
2 then

716
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:15,616
Bose the landlord and say by the way I also need something for Pest Control to my building and it goes from there

717
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:18,688
Excellent alright Alex where can I go to find out more

718
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:19,456
About machine

719
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:22,272
Start of our website machineq. Com

720
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:25,344
Play some great white papers there including our latest on dense Network

721
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:26,624
In addition to that we

722
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,720
Tactical business conversion guides and network coverage details well

723
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:45,568
Welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your house Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest is Chris Meyer who is head

724
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:48,128
Developer experience atmosphere

725
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:48,896
Robotics

726
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:49,664
Hi Chris

727
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:51,200
Hey Stacy going to be here

728
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:52,992
So you guys are on the show

729
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:55,040
Settle cabins in my debate

730
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:56,576
Over robots in the Smart House

731
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:58,112
That's not true although you

732
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:59,136
Totally way it

733
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:01,952
Isaiah robot without arms

734
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:03,744
He wants to camera that he can talk to

735
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,512
Juvia

736
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:08,096
The framing of the debate

737
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:10,656
So what we're going to do first is have you talked to

738
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:12,192
What is Misty

739
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:15,776
Misty is our attempt to try to democratize

740
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:17,568
Robotics so we realized that

741
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:18,336
Robotics

742
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:19,872
Industry is still

743
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:22,176
So we're trying to give

744
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:24,224
People a robot that is sensory

745
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:29,344
Okay now you guys just launched the Misty there's a Kickstarter

746
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:30,624
I'll put that in

747
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:31,648
You guys

748
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,952
Give us the parameters of what is

749
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,768
What kind of robot

750
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:37,536
Talking about

751
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:42,144
Got it so Misty is a you know like I said sensor Rich robot that we're trying

752
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:44,192
Work so you don't have to No Control

753
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:45,472
Mechanical

754
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:51,104
So it's programmable via JavaScript and python

755
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:52,640
How would you describe me

756
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:53,664
She's cute

757
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,688
She's round

758
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:55,712
No hard edges

759
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:57,760
She has a track drive system and

760
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:00,064
3 degrees of freedom in the neck so I can do that

761
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,600
The role that had songs

762
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:02,624
Is really sweet really cute

763
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:04,928
And then a 4in

764
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:05,952
Orange LCD

765
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:06,976
Verizon

766
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,048
She looks kind of like Wall-E

767
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:10,816
With a little

768
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:14,400
Runs around

769
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:15,936
Tank treads

770
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:17,728
And

771
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:20,032
I think our actual spec is

772
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:21,824
27 meters per second to a fast

773
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:24,896
Okay in the vision is that this robot is

774
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:25,920
Roaming around

775
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:27,456
Holmes and maybe small office

776
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:28,480
Doing what

777
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:31,296
Well that's why we're trying to enable people to figure out

778
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:33,856
Everybody uses a computer differently than we know that every

779
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:35,648
Nobody's going to use and then wrap the robot different

780
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:39,744
So one of the things that I use mine for is it a wait in the foyer

781
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,280
If it recognizes myself

782
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:42,304
Or my wife

783
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,072
First

784
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:45,120
Then it'll play my Spotify playlist

785
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,144
But if she's there first

786
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:46,912
Play her Pandora

787
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,496
Goose I'd like a race to get in your front door that's exactly what

788
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:52,032
But it is trying to get off work early

789
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:56,128
Nice we have that in my house but it's for the air conditioning

790
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:57,408
Cold pack

791
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,200
So they're going a lot of

792
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:02,784
Smart home robotics

793
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,808
SmartThings

794
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:05,856
So what did you guys learn

795
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:06,880
From head of the previous

796
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:08,928
Experience at small things and I think somebody has

797
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:09,952
Spiro

798
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:12,000
That you're taking into this project

799
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,560
I know when the smart thing side

800
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:18,144
Trying to do something just developer focus and kind of

801
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,168
Programmable

802
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:19,936
You

803
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:23,264
Have a hard time putting that towards the consumer Market upfront

804
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,800
With maintaining the program

805
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:27,872
So with Missy what we're trying to do is really focus on

806
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:29,152
Developers and makers

807
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:30,688
A programmer's especially

808
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:31,968
For them first

809
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,528
When we figure out what those consumer applications are there

810
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:35,552
How did Misty

811
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:37,344
More consumer-friendly

812
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:39,904
Got it so guys this is not necessarily

813
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:40,672
The robot

814
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:41,440
You want to get to your

815
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:42,720
But it hasn't

816
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:44,768
Cool stuff so they showed me the robot it's got like a

817
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:47,584
This little backpack areas are in the back

818
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,608
Can load all kinds of stuff

819
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:52,960
You're talking actually about an Arduino and what are some things you hope

820
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:54,240
People try to do with this

821
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:55,776
Yashow because it's focused on

822
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:56,544
Program

823
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,824
The hardware store

824
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,152
So we haven't

825
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:01,920
Arduino backpack

826
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:02,688
It plugs in

827
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:03,456
To the back of the

828
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:08,064
And we also have open source connectors for the arms and antenna

829
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:09,600
AdSense

830
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:13,184
Route that all through your Arduino arrest

831
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:13,952
Berry pie

832
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:14,976
To make it accessible

833
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:18,048
If I want to add a barometric sensor

834
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:19,072
That was run

835
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:21,888
Through my Arduino and then take barometric sensor readings around

836
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:25,728
Hayden Ponder why you would want to be

837
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:27,520
Around your house by

838
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:29,568
12v temperature would be a better

839
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:31,104
Kids having a heat map of

840
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,896
Why my bedroom is always cold

841
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:34,176
Is a little bit more interesting

842
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:35,456
The barometric pressure

843
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:38,272
Got it okay this does make more sense

844
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:39,808
So

845
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:41,600
Let's talk about robots in general

846
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:43,648
Cuz we seen a lot of activity right now

847
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:44,928
Not just right now

848
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:47,232
Over the last few years in robots

849
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:48,512
You talked about it being

850
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:49,280
In its infancy

851
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:50,560
What do you mean by

852
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:53,632
We've been trying to crack robotics for

853
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,424
40 50 60 years

854
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:57,728
And there hasn't been a

855
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:58,496
Real

856
00:36:58,752 --> 00:36:59,264
Application

857
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,800
In the home or office

858
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:04,640
Utility base or single-purpose

859
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:08,736
But the problem is robotics today is people are continually building robots for a single purpose

860
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:10,784
Set the draw the parallel between

861
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,576
Computers in the 70s and 80s

862
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:14,368
People were in the garage is Belen

863
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:15,136
Computers

864
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:18,208
Opticians I can build a computer chips

865
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:19,744
This is where robotics

866
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,512
Is today that's why

867
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:23,072
What we saw with personal

868
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:24,608
Computers is once physical

869
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:25,632
Was invented

870
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:26,656
Then people started to have

871
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:27,936
Real use in

872
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:29,216
Office for

873
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:30,240
Cheaters you started

874
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:31,520
To see that awkward escalation

875
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:32,288
Adoption

876
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:33,568
So what we're trying to do

877
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:35,872
Do is make those things accessible

878
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:36,896
Thinking about what they

879
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:40,736
But instead of worrying about control system

880
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:43,552
Charging

881
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:44,576
That

882
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:45,344
If those things are

883
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,112
Given

884
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:47,136
What do I do with it

885
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:47,904
Indeed

886
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:48,928
What do I do with

887
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:51,488
Hands versus roaming 2

888
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,024
So where do you fall in Ark

889
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:55,584
Physical manipulation of objects is a

890
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:58,400
No problem so obviously is in

891
00:37:58,656 --> 00:37:59,424
Robotics company

892
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,704
Do you want to bite off of

893
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:01,728
We can swallow

894
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:05,312
So we made a deliberate effort to say okay let's not

895
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:06,080
Tackle physics

896
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:07,872
Frontlets start

897
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:08,896
Thinking about

898
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:11,200
How do you change the recipe

899
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:11,968
When you have something

900
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:12,736
It's physical

901
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:13,504
It's mobile

902
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:17,088
The same way that when your programming

903
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:18,112
Computer there's different

904
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:19,648
Do you consider when you programming

905
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:20,672
Mobile device

906
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:22,208
So those learnings with

907
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:22,976
Physicality

908
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:25,280
Duration of

909
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:27,072
Robotics so we want to start there

910
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:28,608
And then we have the ability

911
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:32,192
Grab things and say like hey that's a Red Bull can or that's no a balloon

912
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:33,216
That I can move those

913
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,264
That'll enhance

914
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,032
We've already latex

915
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:37,824
Okay so I should

916
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:40,128
Just give up for another 10 years on the robot

917
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:43,712
Well I mean there's laundry

918
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:46,784
Right right I'm not spending that kind of money for a single purpose

919
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,344
62 hours to full

920
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,368
Cycling shirts

921
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,904
Whatever their actual

922
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:55,232
True Okay so

923
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:56,768
Let's talk about some of the competition

924
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:57,792
Because we've had

925
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,072
Geebo

926
00:38:59,328 --> 00:38:59,840
Is the most famous

927
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:00,608
There's also

928
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:01,376
Curry

929
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:02,144
Now

930
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,936
Random robots running around

931
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:05,984
Do you think what happened with Jibo

932
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,520
It's going to hurt the market for what

933
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:08,544
Find offer

934
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,128
Is kind of a double-edged sword on one hand it's very clear that the

935
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:12,896
People wants

936
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:14,944
Robots in some sense I mean a raise

937
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,736
I have to go there actual dollar value was

938
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,784
It was a lot it was a lot

939
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,064
And then you know

940
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,088
3 years delayed

941
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:21,856
In the things that were

942
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:22,624
Kickstarter video

943
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:24,672
We are really hopeful to get to that point where

944
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:25,440
Everything

945
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,208
It was shown

946
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,232
Is possible

947
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:29,280
And what we realize with robotics

948
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:30,816
This is not a linear complexity

949
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:31,584
Scale

950
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,608
You can't add

951
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:33,376
Movement in

952
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:35,936
Physicality and then all these other subsystems

953
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:36,960
How to be like

954
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:38,496
3 *

955
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:39,264
More complicated

956
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:41,568
But it's actually

957
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:42,848
Factorial

958
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:46,944
We're very glad that she was in the space we love

959
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:48,992
But people

960
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:50,784
Call about some of the promises

961
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:52,832
Robotics Army

962
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:57,440
Yes so you guys speaking of promises you're doing the kickstarter and

963
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:58,720
You expect to ship some

964
00:39:59,232 --> 00:39:59,744
December

965
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:01,792
And it's not text

966
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:02,816
Kickstarter

967
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:04,096
It is a crowd

968
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:05,632
Campaign but we're going to

969
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:06,912
Build it regardless

970
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:08,960
I'm already hit our goal so

971
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,288
So let's talk about designing a robot

972
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:13,312
And the types of things

973
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:14,336
State you put in

974
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,640
Like you said before it's cute

975
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:17,408
Its or maybe ice

976
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:18,432
That is adorable

977
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:21,248
When

978
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:22,016
Designing it

979
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:24,064
How much do cuteness matter

980
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,112
Personality

981
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:29,184
So we realized it personality is

982
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:30,464
The long tail

983
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:32,000
When you start to have something that

984
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:32,768
People engage with

985
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:33,792
And meaningful in Rockwood

986
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:34,816
Has some of that

987
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:35,840
Characteristics

988
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:36,864
It really make it lovable

989
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:38,400
But that's going to be one of the

990
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,448
Sequel to the robot

991
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:41,984
In the short-term

992
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:44,288
It's really about programmability and getting

993
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:46,336
And itself to work and function

994
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:48,640
Auntie very difficult environment

995
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:49,408
Office

996
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:50,688
So when we came

997
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:52,224
The design we wanted to enable some

998
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,760
Flexibility and experimentation

999
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,112
And then figure out what are those elements

1000
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:58,880
Apps that make it

1001
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:00,160
Cute personal

1002
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:01,184
Personality

1003
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,512
Heavily and was

1004
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:05,536
We have three degrees of

1005
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:07,840
So instead of just

1006
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:10,656
You know up down left right we also have roll that is

1007
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:11,424
Spaetzle

1008
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:12,448
Oh yeah

1009
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,984
Is that your psychic

1010
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,288
Yeah yeah absolute

1011
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,848
And so this is such a powerful

1012
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:19,616
Motives

1013
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:20,384
Capability

1014
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:21,408
And then

1015
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:22,944
We put the with the screen

1016
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,480
Behind a lens

1017
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:25,504
Because we didn't want

1018
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,272
What we call tablet

1019
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:28,064
We don't want it to look like

1020
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,112
Droid phone

1021
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:32,160
Inside the robot that that adds like a

1022
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:32,928
Another layer of

1023
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,208
Not so much mystery

1024
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:34,976
Butt personality

1025
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:38,560
Tell me a cross

1026
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:39,584
Uncanny valley or

1027
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,632
Live on the other side of it in a cute way

1028
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:44,704
What about

1029
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:45,728
The nail room

1030
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:46,752
Trauma

1031
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:49,824
Did SoftBank ESV Alderaan Alder body

1032
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,895
Pepper robot

1033
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:53,919
Danny very much so

1034
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:54,687
Misty

1035
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:55,711
And its eyes

1036
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:56,991
The fact that it was aimed at develop

1037
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:57,759
Clippers

1038
00:41:58,783 --> 00:41:59,295
Are you guys

1039
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:00,063
Competitive

1040
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:02,111
I mean it's a different price

1041
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:03,391
If I recall

1042
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:05,439
When you have to fill out the application to get it

1043
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:06,975
And I believe there

1044
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:07,999
The more than seven

1045
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:12,351
And it's just it's just different it's multi-joint

1046
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:13,375
Scott legs

1047
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:14,143
Scott fingers

1048
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:15,935
It has the arms I'm

1049
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:17,471
Yes button

1050
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:18,495
Doesn't pick things up

1051
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:20,799
It does the Macarena

1052
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:22,079
Had it very true

1053
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:24,127
But it doesn't have I mean the differences

1054
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:25,919
Crosses doesn't have expressive eyes

1055
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:27,711
It is leg day

1056
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:29,503
They use a proprietary system

1057
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:30,527
Choreograph

1058
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:31,295
Which

1059
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:32,063
Is a little bit

1060
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:33,855
I'll leave it that

1061
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:36,671
We talked about earlier was that

1062
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:38,719
Programming a robot is not what people like

1063
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:41,023
So if I like bought this

1064
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:44,095
Versus like maybe another robot what was that experience

1065
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:44,863
Be like

1066
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:47,167
My role is that the head of developer

1067
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:50,239
Experience so I'm trying to mitigate that cognitive dissonance

1068
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:52,799
The way that you expect the programmer

1069
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:56,895
So Misty's Bergamo via JavaScript

1070
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:57,663
Python

1071
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:58,431
So

1072
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:01,247
And anybody that can build a website should be able to

1073
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:03,551
So you can do things

1074
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:05,855
Go to the

1075
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:06,879
The kitchen

1076
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:08,415
Name XY location

1077
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:10,719
Go there now

1078
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:12,511
The

1079
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:14,047
What do I do if I encounter an obstacle

1080
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:15,071
What happened

1081
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:16,095
And if I hear loud noise

1082
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:17,375
I can stop

1083
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:20,447
Or trying to make it as easy as possible

1084
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:21,471
For anybody

1085
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:24,287
Be able to do the things that you want to do without worrying about

1086
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:25,311
Lower level

1087
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:26,335
Programming

1088
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:28,383
What is it lower level programming

1089
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:31,711
For let's say that we take it out another Wheels

1090
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:33,503
If I wanted to say go to the

1091
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:35,039
What I have to do

1092
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:37,343
Without the subsystems I would have to

1093
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:38,367
Generate a map

1094
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:39,135
Do the path

1095
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:40,415
And then go down to

1096
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:41,183
Low level of

1097
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:45,023
Drive my Motors in a certain way to turn left turn right

1098
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:45,791
Avoid

1099
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:47,839
Build the entire system around

1100
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:49,887
To where

1101
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:52,191
For you

1102
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:54,239
So you can operate at the high level

1103
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:55,263
Go to Kitchen

1104
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:57,567
Without having to do all the stuff down

1105
00:43:58,335 --> 00:43:58,847
Do you like easy

1106
00:43:59,103 --> 00:43:59,871
Simplicity

1107
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:01,151
Okay so

1108
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:02,175
I have to ask you

1109
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:03,455
Throughout this because

1110
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:04,223
Apparently

1111
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:06,783
Okay

1112
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:09,343
I have to ask you because we had a conversation about

1113
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:10,111
Party

1114
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:10,879
And flatulence

1115
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:11,903
And robots

1116
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:12,671
So

1117
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:13,951
Why do robots fart

1118
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:17,023
Which is one of the things that makes robots

1119
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,303
Extremely personal

1120
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:19,327
Very very

1121
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:22,143
It's one of the things that the biological function

1122
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:25,215
Unexpected

1123
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:25,983
Lititz

1124
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:27,007
Really kind of funny

1125
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:28,031
I think it's one of the things that

1126
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:29,567
Eagle

1127
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:31,359
When you know the whole concept

1128
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:32,127
The robot

1129
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:33,919
The room waiting until you see an individual

1130
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:34,687
You'll make an apartment

1131
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:36,479
Leaving the room I think it's just

1132
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:37,503
Juvenile

1133
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:39,295
I would

1134
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:41,855
You're right okay and because kids finest

1135
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:43,903
Let's talk about kids

1136
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:44,671
Robotics

1137
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:46,463
It feels like we're in this

1138
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:47,743
Weird like

1139
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:51,071
What do we do how do we train them how to be around the robot so

1140
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:52,351
What are your thoughts there I don't know

1141
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:53,887
I have a 2 year old

1142
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:56,703
Yes I mean I personally think

1143
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:57,471
The robots are going

1144
00:44:58,495 --> 00:44:59,007
A very powerful

1145
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:00,287
Driver for

1146
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:02,079
People to live the life they

1147
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,639
Encouraging Behavior

1148
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:06,175
Moderated making

1149
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:07,455
Do your own awareness of how

1150
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:08,223
You live your life

1151
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:08,991
And then

1152
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:09,759
Being used

1153
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:12,063
So when it comes to kids getting them

1154
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:12,831
Familiar with it

1155
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:13,599
And then

1156
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:14,879
How they work

1157
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:16,415
Is going to be really

1158
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:17,695
What's the standard equation

1159
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:20,255
The program ability

1160
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:21,279
How to program

1161
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:25,119
Kids just behaving like total jerks

1162
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:27,935
And I don't know if your 2 year old is

1163
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:29,727
I'm sure he is a very nice person

1164
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:30,495
But

1165
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:31,519
How does he react

1166
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:32,287
Your robot

1167
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:34,079
Is he getting to the point where he's

1168
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:35,103
Using a door

1169
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:36,383
Taking it for granted

1170
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:38,687
Speak one of his first words exactly

1171
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:40,479
Robot so maybe I'm an outlier in a lot of

1172
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:42,527
It's more curiosity

1173
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:44,575
I know that every time that is sitting on and

1174
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:45,855
Messing with the Devil

1175
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:46,623
Wave at it

1176
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:47,903
Which is really adorable

1177
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:49,951
It does

1178
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:54,559
He hasn't my son hasn't been to

1179
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:57,119
I think in scenarios where there's

1180
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:57,887
Groups of people

1181
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:00,959
That there's going to be you know more about abuse

1182
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:02,751
You know you see the night sky in summer

1183
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:05,823
Stuff like that

1184
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:07,103
I think we're hoping is it summer

1185
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:07,871
The personality

1186
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:09,407
Will come through and see where it's like

1187
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:10,687
If you kick it we have it

1188
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:11,455
We have an IMU

1189
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:14,527
Detect when it's being Joselyn

1190
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:16,063
React

1191
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:17,343
Like out

1192
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:18,367
I whip my heart might break

1193
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:19,135
It's like

1194
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:20,159
IRobot

1195
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:22,463
Just like my dog

1196
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:24,511
Okay so I think this robot

1197
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:27,327
Cat roaming around my home

1198
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:30,655
But is that the wrong way to think about that or is that how you'd like to

1199
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:36,287
I mean that's kind of a difficult question because it depends on how you expect interact

1200
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:38,335
I like the idea of having some

1201
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:40,383
In the Bronx around be like hey Missy did I leave my

1202
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:42,431
David on her like he misses my dog

1203
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:44,991
That element of hellofresh

1204
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:47,551
Fascinating but I know

1205
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:48,319
People that have

1206
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:49,087
Large families

1207
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:51,391
Did the last they want another thing

1208
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:54,207
Quiet

1209
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:54,975
Might be

1210
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:55,999
More desirable to them

1211
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:59,583
Good cheap setting okay anything else you want to tell us about

1212
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:00,863
