00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:11,776
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your house

2
00:00:12,032 --> 00:00:12,800
Stacey Higginbotham

3
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:14,080
And this is your co-host

4
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:14,848
Kevin tofel

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,408
And we have a great show

6
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:18,944
For you I know I always say that

7
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:21,760
It is it is always great

8
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:23,296
It is fantastic

9
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:24,064
6o

10
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:25,600
We thought we kick it off with the

11
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:27,136
The story for the New York Times

12
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:27,904
Which is

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,976
Just how much power do your electronics use

14
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:32,000
Kodak put

15
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,560
And the answer is

16
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:35,328
A lot

17
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:36,352
Good question

18
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:38,144
Yes it's great

19
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:43,008
Kevin you said that you actually started deal out so the story is actually all about

20
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:44,288
Vampire power draw

21
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,336
Which was a big deal a couple

22
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:51,200
A couple years ago because of steady came out showing that your game consoles in your

23
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:52,480
Cable boxes

24
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:54,784
Just sucked power like there was no tomorrow

25
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:57,088
That does kind of

26
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,880
Version that we got here

27
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,416
The newest kind of

28
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:01,952
Twisting the story

29
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:02,976
Is

30
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:05,536
The burgeoning kind of smart devices

31
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:07,328
Because they're connected

32
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,704
Are always on because they got you no Wi-Fi connection they need to maintain and they need to send data back

33
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:16,032
They're also

34
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:20,128
You get that always listening kind of affecting that takes a small power draw to

35
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:21,664
So

36
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:26,528
Yeah the time study shows some actual power drains on devices where

37
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:32,672
Most people probably think while I'm not using my cable box about watching TV so it's not using any power but

38
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:38,304
Perfect example is the Samsung cable box and then not paying on Samsung this is pretty prevalent in the industry

39
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,840
They use a 26 Watts

40
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:41,632
The power when it's off

41
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:43,680
Turn phone off and not recording

42
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:46,752
When you're actually using it when you're watching TV

43
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:49,056
And recording something

44
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:51,616
Additional to watts of power so it's

45
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:52,896
Most of the power

46
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:53,920
Consumption

47
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:56,480
Is happening all the time with a device like that

48
00:01:56,992 --> 00:02:00,832
And as you said Stacy you got always on devices connected devices that

49
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:03,648
Many updates are there always listening or

50
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:06,464
In the case of cable box it's getting guide information which is

51
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,536
Just changing every 30 minutes as you know show cycle through

52
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:12,864
List of ads oven and I knew this a couple years back

53
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:19,776
It was a big meme about the whole vampire power Drano people finally started understanding that device

54
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:22,336
Isis use power even when they're cooling Court off

55
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:26,688
So the two ways you can deal with us one is it just obviously on plug

56
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:27,456
My device

57
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,736
But I took a more

58
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:32,320
And I guess I'll call it a technical approach anyway I can spend money I do

59
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:34,880
I bought these so-called smart strips

60
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:37,696
Which there power outlets in a Rossini Stacy

61
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:38,720
I have

62
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:39,744
Yeah

63
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:46,656
Oh okay I have one almost in every room of the house and I know that adds up and it yeah there's a cost-benefit analysis of

64
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:47,936
How much does electricity cost

65
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:50,752
Versus paying for these things still use less electricity

66
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,032
We won't get into the mat

67
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:52,800
Regardless

68
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:55,872
What disease do is they have a master Outlet

69
00:02:56,128 --> 00:03:02,016
And you plug in a a device into that and when that device is turned on like in my case

70
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,808
In my office right now

71
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,160
This iMac I'm using is the master device when I turn the iMac on

72
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:12,256
The smart strip says okay now we can let power flow to all the other Outlet

73
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:13,536
So

74
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:18,400
Other peripherals and they have connected that I wouldn't want draining power when the iMac is off

75
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,704
Now start using power as they should

76
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,240
When I shut my iMac off

77
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:25,568
The smart strip says no more power for anything else connected to this thing

78
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:28,128
There are some hot Outlets as well so you don't have to

79
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,920
We totally depend on a single device

80
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:33,760
Comes in handy for say living room situation

81
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:36,320
Your TV when your TV is on you can want

82
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:39,136
If your Blu-ray player your DVD player to your stereo

83
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:41,184
Your Apple TV

84
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,256
You want all those on as well when the TV is off you don't need those on

85
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:49,376
Suck my TV is my main device and the smart turn my family room for Snapple so

86
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:52,448
It kind of hopefully save me money in the long run

87
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:55,520
So I just looked at the 10 Outlet smart strip

88
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:57,312
On Amazon is

89
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,080
35

90
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:01,664
Wow it seems high compared to what I paid but

91
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,224
You know

92
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,272
Yeah there's a bunch of

93
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:08,576
So actually has one

94
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:10,624
Maybe slightly

95
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,928
Another option is just to have a

96
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:17,280
Straight up switch with an on-off outlet and then you can just turn those off

97
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:21,119
This one I like because it's little bit more automated

98
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:23,935
You don't have to actually reach behind something and be like

99
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,727
Now I want all my stuff

100
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:26,495
Exactly

101
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:30,335
It's okay to just happens you turn on the master device and

102
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,895
Advantages manage for yuan Roth

103
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,687
So in the other thing

104
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,271
That we talked about doing his I had installed a device called a curb

105
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:40,319
I actually had it installed by a certified doula

106
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,087
Electrician

107
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:44,159
I'm in my house that tracked my energy use

108
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,695
Buy Appliance

109
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:49,535
And that was really interesting cuz I saw what was sucking power all the time

110
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:54,399
I saw the impact from changing my incandescent to LED

111
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:57,471
And they have a couple of these kind of devices

112
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:58,751
And even a nap

113
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,287
So curb is a device

114
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,567
Anime

115
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:06,431
Quick ask your card gets installed at the circuit breaker level

116
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,223
So you have to have an electrician do it

117
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:08,991
Unless you were

118
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,271
Really really comfy

119
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,831
Barbara Stager

120
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:13,599
With your

121
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,159
Add your circuit box

122
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:19,743
Actually take the data from

123
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:20,511
Each

124
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,047
Individual circuit

125
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:24,863
They have a one 4:16 and I think one for 8

126
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,911
So you can actually see

127
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:29,215
Your air conditioning and how much that's using

128
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:29,983
Versus something

129
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:32,287
Actually two of those

130
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:38,431
There's also another device you can install in your circuit

131
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:39,967
Am I just make

132
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,575
Panel

133
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:48,671
The Box the rectangular thing with the switches

134
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:51,487
Switch off

135
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,535
So the device

136
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:57,631
Just call dinner Rio and that also installs there that doesn't actually

137
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,935
Deal with each individual breaker

138
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:03,519
It's for the whole box and it measures electricity consumption

139
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:06,591
I'm just going to call and fancier algorithms it's

140
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,359
Trying to detect

141
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:09,663
The patterns in various

142
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,711
Types of energy flows to tell you what's happen

143
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,503
So that's another thing

144
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,271
You can use

145
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,063
Overall energy consumption

146
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,855
Figure out what's sucking

147
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:22,207
I just got turned onto an app that will help you as well

148
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:25,279
It's called chai energy chai like the tea

149
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,327
It's a free app

150
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:33,727
And the way gets the data it actually reads in What's called the green button data which is the like this

151
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:37,567
Smart meter type information that's being fed to electricity providers

152
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:39,615
So why let them have all that information

153
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:42,175
Chai actually guess it the same way they get it

154
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:46,271
And shows you graphs and such on your phone of electricity usage

155
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:51,135
And gives you ways to save says maybe your AC is running more than should buy

156
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,927
Compare the average Etc

157
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:57,791
Unfortunate for me even though this does work on IOS and Android

158
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:01,119
My electricity provider is not yet participating in

159
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:04,191
Either getting the data or sharing the day that was chili

160
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,983
I can't say I've tested it

161
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:10,335
But I should also mention if you want to get the data I think on your own

162
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:13,407
They do so it's called the chai energy Pro

163
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:16,479
Which is a box don't know how much it cost

164
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:20,319
But it will actually read it directly from the smart meter

165
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,623
Itself as opposed to getting it

166
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:25,695
Through the electricity provider Alex it's only $50

167
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:27,999
The curb which I think

168
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:33,887
Expensive I don't know if it's that expensive but

169
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:35,679
I'm am looking at

170
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:43,103
While you're doing that the difference between the chai energy app and the trainer do pro as obviously there's Hardware buy with the pro

171
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:45,407
Chai energy app only get you

172
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:50,015
Once a day energy usage monitoring it's not constantly pinging and pulling and getting information

173
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,807
The pro Hardware device

174
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:54,111
Is real-time energy usage monitoring

175
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:57,439
You can even tag appliances so you can specifically say

176
00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:00,767
I don't know how much power the dishwasher uses and so on so forth so

177
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:04,095
Said some interesting intelligence

178
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:07,935
Yes and your Bo is $180

179
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:10,751
On Amazon plus you're going to need the electrician in

180
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:11,519
Install that

181
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:12,543
And

182
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:15,615
Curb it was hundreds so I don't remember how many hundreds

183
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,175
And it may vary by how many

184
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,479
Sensors you actually put into the breaker as well

185
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,271
It is $400

186
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:23,295
400

187
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,063
So that's the sick

188
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:25,599
Zones

189
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:26,367
So that's not

190
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,647
Crystal Tarot

191
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:28,927
But the 200 is the

192
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:29,951
The 2 pack for large

193
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:30,975
Looks like I have to

194
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,023
Yeah

195
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:37,887
I wonder how it would be actually interesting to compare this $50

196
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,935
Chai energy Pro

197
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:41,471
2 m solution

198
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:43,263
Just because the massive cost difference

199
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:46,079
And see that the data is

200
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:49,151
Any better more fine and so on a more expensive one

201
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:50,687
I will call them bingo

202
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:55,039
There we go right there also say that

203
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:56,319
Check how much your

204
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:58,111
Devices are consuming

205
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:02,719
With the WeMo Insight switch and actually there are a couple

206
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,487
Smart outlet

207
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,279
Let's I just happen to have a WeMo insight

208
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,047
Text Wichita

209
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:06,815
What does this

210
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,095
It also is

211
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,375
By the way

212
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,143
But

213
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:13,471
When you plug a device and you can see how much power

214
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,239
It's using

215
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,591
For a while but now

216
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,639
For next week show I'm going to plug

217
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:26,527
My echo and I'm going to plug a couple other kind of connected devices into this and I'll take some

218
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:30,111
Readings measurements and we'll we'll come back to this because

219
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:32,159
It sucks being a lot of money for electricity

220
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:37,023
The story says that about a quarter of residential home energy use

221
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,815
Tron from Vampire power

222
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:43,423
Sounds high but I mean I'm sure there are cases of that and I

223
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,191
Is there's a lot of cons

224
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:47,775
Yeah it adds up

225
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:48,543
Okay

226
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,823
So that's your grim

227
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:52,383
How much are spending on electricity

228
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,431
You're not even using it

229
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,551
Moving right along

230
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,575
We're going to talk about

231
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:01,599
Open

232
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,367
Thread

233
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:06,463
Wait wait is that like thread from nest

234
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:10,303
Except now it's open source and you can pull it down from

235
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,095
And

236
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:15,167
The catch it so there's a couple things

237
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,959
Cuz they catch

238
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:19,519
Before I get to the catch let's just stay with

239
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:20,799
This is

240
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:21,823
Basically

241
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,103
The thread

242
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,639
Protocol in

243
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:29,247
Prayers because you may not remember thread as a wireless protocol so it's like zigbee and Z-Wave

244
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:32,575
Except it is using the 802.

245
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:35,135
Oh man I hated seeing

246
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:40,255
So it's the same radio IEEE radio standard that should be uses

247
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,279
Except

248
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:43,071
Thread is both a mesh

249
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,631
And it's also IPv6 compatible

250
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:49,471
That means any device that uses thread can go straight to the internet

251
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,775
Itself without going through a hub

252
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:56,383
Friend so those are the things his nest Samsung silicon labs freescale

253
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:59,967
Bigassfans a couple other companies created this couple

254
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:00,735
How to say was

255
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:01,503
2 years ago now

256
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,551
Time flies when you're having fun and

257
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:06,879
They introduced a certification program last November

258
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:09,183
For this and kind of devices are coming out

259
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:09,951
So

260
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,487
What they've done now is there like

261
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,511
Hey

262
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,303
Momentum we got it

263
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:16,607
Let's open this up to the community

264
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,935
Your devices will still have to get certified

265
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:23,007
So basically what you're doing is you are

266
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,543
Able to download this

267
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:27,359
Work it into your devices but they are going to still have to

268
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,151
But if you want them to be

269
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:33,759
Which is slightly better I think from a financial standpoint cuz I think

270
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:38,111
Beforehand you had to pay to have access to the specs of

271
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:38,879
Thread

272
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,159
Yeah

273
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,951
So now I assume you

274
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:44,255
Don't you just need a paper certification

275
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,791
Bright I'm guessing that was a

276
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:46,559
The control thing

277
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:50,143
But this is good news because

278
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,447
Thread is actually a really useful

279
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:54,751
It's got a different kind of mash than the Bluetooth

280
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:55,775
Mesh

281
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:59,359
It can handle more devices basically is the bottom line

282
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:03,455
And it's a little bit more modern with the IPv6

283
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:08,319
Compared to say pee in the zigbee guys have actually done a really close alignment with

284
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,599
The thread group

285
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:10,623
So

286
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:14,719
Which is smart I think it's super smart so some zigbee devices

287
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:15,743
Will be

288
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,023
Thread compatible

289
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,583
The chipset is backwards compatible

290
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,631
You know what else is compatible

291
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:25,215
My onhub router which is a Google router

292
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:27,263
I'll have the thread compatible radio in it

293
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,591
Using it as far as I know

294
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:33,919
But maybe they will and now that this is open-source another peep

295
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:34,687
Download it

296
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:39,039
That would be cool don't forget to that next week which

297
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,575
I will not be here on the show

298
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,599
Because

299
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,647
I will be at Google IO

300
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,415
And I

301
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:50,559
I think there's something on the schedule or in the sandbox demonstration areas about open thread

302
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,327
There is

303
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:54,399
Maybe you'll get to see that

304
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:57,215
Next week show we're going to have yonko

305
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:59,007
Another word

306
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:01,311
Lake who actually is at CES Asia this week

307
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,335
And

308
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:04,639
We're going to have lots of fun on that so

309
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,407
Sneak peek

310
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,431
Okay next

311
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,199
Topic

312
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:07,967
What is RNA

313
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:08,735
Stop it Kevin

314
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:12,319
How about the Almond router then we got a question about that off

315
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:18,719
Couple weeks ago

316
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,559
What's up with that

317
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:25,375
I've seen all these new router kind of things happening in

318
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,399
Nothing from them

319
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,167
So

320
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:32,543
4 people who aren't aware of the Almond router is from a company called securifi it came out probably like

321
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,847
Two or three years ago actually with

322
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:41,247
The idea that the router is the hub for the smart home and they had all these radios at a zigbee I think they might have had a Z-Wave version

323
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:45,343
You don't think they were just chugging along but it was also pretty kind of

324
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,367
Easy interface

325
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:48,415
So Cut Above the modern routers that

326
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,767
Well they got a new router

327
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:56,351
Actually they call it a home wi-fi system

328
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,375
Abby Allman

329
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,143
3

330
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,727
And this may sound familiar to people this implementation I'll basically

331
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:08,127
It is a as you said it's a lot of the smart home stuff in there we'll talk about that in a minute but it's a router for your home available for pre-order

332
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,919
11999

333
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:12,223
Will retail for 149 99

334
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:17,087
You can get a bundle a pack of three of them with Mesh networking

335
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:20,415
For 299 Grand Prix motor and retails for 399

336
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:23,743
So obvious comparisons to the ear OST

337
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,535
Thank you

338
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:26,815
Obvious comparisons

339
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:27,583
To that

340
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,911
But what's different here I don't think those

341
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:35,775
Other products have physically radio inside nor do they have touch screens and

342
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,311
And so on so forth so

343
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,847
This is kind of interesting

344
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:44,223
In addition to the ziggurat inside you're like okay well maybe we're going to do with it

345
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:46,271
It actually and I've done the sound off

346
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:49,599
Three other routers the new one the Almond plus as well as

347
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:51,135
The Omen 2015

348
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,671
They all now work with

349
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,207
The Amazon Echo

350
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,999
So it's almost

351
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:58,815
Yeah it's interesting that they created a skill set

352
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:03,423
We talked about skills before this small program that you can enable on your Echo

353
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,959
Use voice commands

354
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:07,519
So what they've done here is they've

355
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:11,359
I must you like it if this then that approach we can create rules

356
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,639
Through the

357
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:14,687
Skillset and the Almond router

358
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:18,015
So there is ample as you know party scene where you could say

359
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:21,599
I won't say her name but tell almond to activate party scene

360
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:25,439
In which case the temperature goes down on your thermostat

361
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:29,023
The lights go down your music starts playing and so on so you could do

362
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,047
Multiple

363
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:30,815
Actions

364
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:32,351
With one voice command so

365
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:37,727
That is kind of cool for all of the Almond routers that I have to say I'm more interested in the

366
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,775
Newest one just because of the Mesh networking

367
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,055
Yeah me too

368
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:44,383
We want to talk about outside of the universe

369
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:49,503
Sandy crazy radio protocol universe is something a little bit more fun at the application layer

370
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:50,527
Apple

371
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,295
Homekit

372
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:52,831
Somak world

373
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:57,183
Published a story saying that we might with iOS 10

374
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,975
CA Unified

375
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:02,815
Which we call this like a software-based hub for homekit

376
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,095
And it would be called

377
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,375
Home now

378
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,399
With all Apple news

379
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:08,703
This could be changed at any point in time

380
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:10,751
So knowing this

381
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,031
It's a huge gap

382
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:18,687
Right now if you have a homekit certified device you can use the app that comes with your device so if you've got the

383
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,991
The eve sensors from Elgato

384
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:27,135
They've got an app but you have to download third-party apps to actually create scenes that might Bridge like

385
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:32,511
That you sensors with your Philips Hue Lights there's no like universal control there

386
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,839
And so basically this would be

387
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:39,935
I've still hearing things from the community about Apple

388
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,471
That make me feel like

389
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,775
This could still be a long time coming

390
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:46,079
This is good news

391
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,871
Especially for people who are

392
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:48,639
Still waiting

393
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:55,551
Yeah there was talk about this happening in iOS 9 obviously it didn't happen so maybe this is the time

394
00:16:55,807 --> 00:17:01,183
It kind of needs to happen I mean I'll be honest I'm sitting here and I'm looking at all this smart home

395
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,463
Apps that I have

396
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:05,279
Granted having root in a folder called home

397
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:09,119
So it's like okay at least they're all easily accessible in one place on my phone but

398
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,935
Some type of consolidation or centralized management

399
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,727
On the hand side or whatever

400
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:16,287
Just makes so much more sense I think and

401
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:21,663
Everybody was involved in the spaces working on their platforms to integrate the hardware and the

402
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,431
The functions

403
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:25,759
But I don't see any integration on the user interface

404
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:28,063
And that's really what I'd like to say

405
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:32,159
And you know there's there's a couple software programs out there

406
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,183
To do this

407
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,975
Actually work

408
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:35,999
Catso

409
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,791
Will keep you updated on that

410
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:39,839
It would be a nice thing to have

411
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:43,167
And then finally we have some Industrial iot

412
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,959
Iot world is this week

413
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:47,263
It happened to this week I guess in the

414
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:50,079
Magical time travel of the show so

415
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,895
The two biggest companies that came out this week with like

416
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:55,967
Basically internet-of-things divisions are Hitachi

417
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:56,991
Which is

418
00:17:57,247 --> 00:18:01,599
I talked to them about this already made five

419
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:02,879
Play 4 billion and stuff that we

420
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:05,695
We consider internet of things so what the heck

421
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:06,719
What's created division

422
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,279
With Itachi what they're doing is

423
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,303
They have pulled

424
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:13,119
Used to be there

425
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:13,887
Group with

426
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:18,495
Tahoe and stuff and they basically put that aside and said that group is going to be

427
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:19,263
Working

428
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,567
With all the different Hitachi divisions

429
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:25,407
And you know whatever you get to be these conglomerates it's pretty difficult

430
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,199
They have over 900

431
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:27,967
Hitachi company

432
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:32,063
It's ridiculous wow but they pulled it out until like 12 big groups

433
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:37,183
I'm so let's say they're there bullet train division wants to do some sort of iot based

434
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,719
Track management system

435
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:43,071
That division would actually work with this new iot division

436
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:49,471
To get get a real-time Data Insights maybe some cool algorithms they work very closely together to serve the cuss

437
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:52,799
TN customer though would work with the

438
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:54,079
Hitachi rail division

439
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:55,871
So basically

440
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,663
The way they set it up as Caesar

441
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,735
It's like an internal service provider to the division

442
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:05,599
Spear not going to be a customer of this company or division

443
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,927
Yes that's kind of how they

444
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:10,719
Is a notch

445
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:15,327
I'm in a lot of organizations which is you know

446
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:18,143
It just serves the whole company that was like

447
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,191
Cloud so

448
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,215
We'll see

449
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:24,287
Hitachi did as they created a platform called

450
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,055
Gumada

451
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:29,919
OU Mata

452
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:32,735
This is their iot platform effort

453
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,527
Schleich bluematrix

454
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:35,807
Is IBM's

455
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,855
Pot Farm effort Around The Internet of Things

456
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,951
And then moving on to HP

457
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,487
Who is also

458
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:45,023
Doing an iot

459
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,815
Kind of effort in platform

460
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:49,375
Hpe Universal

461
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,655
Platform which

462
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:56,799
Well it's interesting that I see the e in there after HP so it's

463
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:58,079
HP Enterprise

464
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:01,919
Oh yes I can't referred it because they split their Enterprise business with

465
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:02,687
Printing

466
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:06,527
The server the cloud computing all of that is

467
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,391
So yes

468
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:13,951
So basically

469
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,999
Again this is HP

470
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,047
Coming in

471
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,399
Against Amazon

472
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:24,191
IBM Microsoft

473
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,215
Everybody

474
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,263
Last week Honeywell

475
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:33,151
In everybody's got the same thing hey will take a lot of your data

476
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:35,455
Will format it to something that you

477
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,223
You can use

478
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:38,271
And we make it easy

479
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:39,807
It's interesting says almost

480
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:45,439
Then it's not just hpe that students it's almost like a big data play on IRT really

481
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:47,999
It is I mean that's that's what this is about

482
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:51,839
The differences that you'll want to look for in your platforms

483
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:53,375
There's a bunch

484
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:57,215
Everyone's calling it a platform in the platform is kind of like open it

485
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:59,007
Disguise any number of Shenzhen

486
00:20:59,263 --> 00:20:59,775
Emissions

487
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:02,079
With many of these

488
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:04,127
It's mostly a

489
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:06,687
Send your data to our cloud

490
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:10,015
And we will make it something that a web

491
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:13,599
Like a web service will turn it into something people in the web can access

492
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:18,976
Or it is send your stuff like connect your product to our cloud and we handle everything

493
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:22,304
Termite provisioning to making programs to handling data

494
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:26,144
It's really important that you make the distinction you understand what you really

495
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:28,192
You go with

496
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:29,216
The platform providers

497
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:30,240
It offers that

498
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:35,872
An impersonal note it's interesting to me because I look at the way the 41 solar panels on a roof

499
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,408
We have a small web server

500
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,712
Hardware box that's connected to

501
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,552
All the micro inverters and all the panels that data is fed from

502
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:45,600
The panels to the web server

503
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:48,160
And then that information is available

504
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:52,512
To me in a dashboard on the web and act freely available like I've actually share the link in the past

505
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:55,072
But I wonder if the company that I'm using

506
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:56,864
An outsourced at 2

507
00:21:57,376 --> 00:22:00,960
Someone liking hpe I mean obviously not HP since they just launched this but

508
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:02,496
We're doing it themselves

509
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:04,288
Most do it through AWS

510
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,312
Like

511
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:07,616
Probably 90% of the companies that aren't

512
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:08,640
Huge Enterprise

513
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:10,176
Do it through

514
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:11,456
Sure

515
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:15,040
And that makes total sense for scalability reliability and so when I'm wondering

516
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:16,320
Who did the actual

517
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:17,856
Coding for

518
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:21,440
Taking the data and presenting it and so was it worth it you know AWS

519
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:23,744
Didn't do that they probably host it

520
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,792
Yes okay so what's the name of your app

521
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:26,560
Maybe we can figure

522
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:28,608
Well it's Enphase energy

523
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:29,376
Ian

524
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:30,912
Phase

525
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:33,216
They're the ones who make them microinverters themselves

526
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:35,264
Which feed the data to their little

527
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,056
Enphase branded box

528
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:40,896
Okay well if anyone is out there

529
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:46,528
So many mysteries on this week's show

530
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:47,808
Have to come back for a year

531
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,088
Your power will have to

532
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:50,624
Detest some devices

533
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:54,464
And their power consumption L we went back awful Circle all the way around power

534
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:57,280
My head is spinning

535
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:02,400
It is Rich Brown

536
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:04,704
Who is the executive editor of CNET

537
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,008
CNET smart home and Appliance coverage

538
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:09,568
So we are going to talk about CNET Smart Home

539
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:15,968
That is very similar to mine except they got a bunch more people running it I think your guys are going to have fun

540
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:18,528
A lot of noise and hype surrounding the Internet of Things

541
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:22,368
Market everyday another company merges adding to the growing din

542
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:26,208
It's difficult to rise above the noise and position your company as a leader

543
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:30,048
Callisto is a leading marketing Communications agency and IRT

544
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:36,448
They successfully launched iot startups and turn them in a market leaders they positioned in combat companies in I

545
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:42,848
Providing unique messaging and campaigns that help them stand out is not leaders everything Kalisto does is sit

00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:15,360
Hey everyone this is

552
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:18,688
Stacey Higginbotham and we are back with the Internet of Things podcast

553
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,784
Today's guest is Rich Brown was an executive editor at CNET

554
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:25,088
How are you

555
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:28,416
I am great I am super excited to be talking to you because

556
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,696
Think you are in charge

557
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:31,232
Of possibly

558
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:33,280
What are the only homes that is

559
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:35,072
A smart or maybe smarter than mine

560
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:37,632
With like DIY kind of installed project

561
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:38,912
So

562
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,216
Yeah thank you

563
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:44,032
Sexy. I'm psyched about this we've been working on it

564
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:51,200
So let's let's have a house in Kentucky

565
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:53,248
I've got here about 3 years ago

566
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:55,296
And we hired a bunch of people

567
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:56,576
Launch

568
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:57,856
Are appliances

569
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:58,880
Smart home coverage

570
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:00,672
And this is before we even had the house

571
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:01,440
So

572
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:04,768
You before then we were testing all the stuff going around homes

573
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:05,792
Yeah

574
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:07,072
She likes the whole deal

575
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:09,120
Is that two years ago where

576
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:11,168
Wieser decided you know what we need

577
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:12,192
We need a real house

578
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:12,960
Judith bright

579
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:14,752
This is awesome because I've

580
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:15,776
Actually

581
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:18,080
Probably the last two years I realized

582
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:18,848
As

583
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:22,176
Connected appliances come out on the market it is impossible

584
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:23,712
To actually install

585
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:28,576
A washer and dryer

586
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:35,488
Swapping between refrigerators that's crazy so you guys are doing

587
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:41,376
We haven't done a lot of large appliances at the house for the reasons that you stayed for example we had said no

588
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:42,400
Countertops

589
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:43,168
To get in

590
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:44,704
The Samsung Wi-Fi ranges

591
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,008
The large Appliance

592
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:47,776
Testing

593
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:50,080
Pretty much stays out at the warehouse

594
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:51,104
A hole

595
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,128
Sort of climate

596
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,688
Controlled test chamber for each each category

597
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,528
Okay and why do you guys think it's so important to test these

598
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,808
In a house

599
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:00,832
Well

600
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:02,624
For us it's really about

601
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,160
Seeing how well

602
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,440
These devices work

603
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:06,976
Part of the Holy Ghost

604
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:10,048
Write me that if something says that it works with nest

605
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:12,352
We want to be able to see how it works with nest

606
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:14,656
And how well what's another product would say they work

607
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:17,216
I totally agree

608
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:19,520
Now you guys don't live in the house though

609
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:21,056
Actually lives there

610
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:22,336
That's right

611
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,616
Got it okay

612
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,224
Let's talk about what you discovered in the 10 months that you've been playing around with all this stuff

613
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,760
What are your favorite products

614
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,552
Call Manuel

615
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:32,832
Amazon Echo

616
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:33,856
Just meet our lives

617
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:34,624
Really easy

618
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,440
And it's good that it kind of

619
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:39,744
Matured when it bitter a really kind of

620
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,512
Brought on

621
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:41,536
A whole bunch of connected

622
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:45,376
Devices into its ecosystem when it did because that's right about when

623
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:47,424
The SmartThings Hub that we were using

624
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,192
Willie

625
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:50,240
Unfortunate

626
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:55,104
Okay so you like the echo on your thermostats I see that you did not go with

627
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,896
Traditional Nest you went with

628
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:58,176
My personal favorite

629
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:00,992
What was the thought process

630
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,808
Yet so we you know this is

631
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:05,600
The second one

632
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:06,880
Things in the house so we started out with

633
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:09,440
And I think it was when

634
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:11,488
Ecobee announce it's echoing

635
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:13,024
Integration

636
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,560
The punch that's only said

637
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:18,656
All right we're switching over we already were leaning towards ecobee because of the

638
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:19,936
Thermal sensor

639
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:20,960
They came in the Box

640
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:21,728
But you know

641
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:24,288
He said hey you know words

642
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:27,616
Ecobee and pulled ahead we're going to ecobee3 instead

643
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:29,920
Axanthic ancestor we have a 2 zone system

644
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:32,480
Also on the first floor we have ecobee

645
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:34,272
Hilltop Ford

646
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,552
Because there's some things we want

647
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:36,320
Try out there

648
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:39,136
And at this point with given that

649
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:41,696
That's why they added location-based tracking

650
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:42,464
For your phone

651
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,744
The recent update

652
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:45,024
The kind of

653
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:47,840
Home Depot

654
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:52,192
Comparable I have the same setup actually have a nest upstairs and you could be downstairs

655
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,496
And I would say

656
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,544
Cuz I don't carry the phone

657
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:57,568
With me

658
00:27:57,824 --> 00:28:00,128
I like having a sensor in

659
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,176
It just is in that room

660
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:03,712
I will to say though

661
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:09,088
All the other kind of temperature sensing devices that I've been adding to my house

662
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,880
They also talk to the nest

663
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:13,440
Kind of make the ecobee sensor a bit of a

664
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:15,744
That's true and that's

665
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,024
Partly why

666
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,840
We tried that out in upstairs in the master bedroom where we in

667
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:22,912
Installed a I swear the nest up there their generation

668
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:23,936
And we have

669
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:24,960
Big Ass Fans

670
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:26,240
I just want to say

671
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:28,032
Haiku ceiling fan

672
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,312
And then we saved

673
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,592
Keen smart vent

674
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:32,640
Up there in the master bedroom and in the kids

675
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:35,712
Oh my gosh tell me how this works I'm loving it

676
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,784
You know we really wanted to see what it was like to have the nest

677
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,064
Haiku fan

678
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,880
And Hakeem all working in his own soda

679
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:44,672
Really regulate temperature in

680
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:46,720
A little more precisely than you got juice

681
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:47,744
This is one thermostat

682
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,768
Tahoe floor

683
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,584
I'd say that I would feel better reporting an actor

684
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,376
Christine that if we had someone spend the night

685
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:55,424
With all that said not done yet

686
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:56,960
But that's

687
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:57,984
Hopefully we'll be able to

688
00:28:59,008 --> 00:28:59,520
But I

689
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:02,336
We go all in on that Netflix

690
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:08,736
Because

691
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:12,320
It's the optimization of algorithms that need to

692
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:16,672
Like once you get all these working together and I've discovered this in

693
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:18,464
Drinking any number of devices

694
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:20,256
It's nice in theory

695
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:26,656
Machine learning models that actually

696
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:29,216
Take into account all of these things

697
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:33,056
Maybe you'll get some of the Comfort but you won't get the Energy savings

698
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:36,384
Discovered in my own testing

699
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:38,688
I'm curious to see what you guys do

700
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:41,760
You know I really wish

701
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,552
This is one area where

702
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:45,856
Temperature are Appliance testing Warehouse

703
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:48,416
Traditional lab setup

704
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:50,208
It's here where we have

705
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:53,280
A small integrating Sphere for example to throw

706
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:55,072
Are LED bulbs anywhere we really do

707
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:57,632
You pretty rigorous color temperature testing all that stuff

708
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:58,656
What I really

709
00:29:58,912 --> 00:29:59,936
Wish we could do the house

710
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:02,240
We haven't done is just

711
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:03,264
Time and cost

712
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,544
And everything else prohibitive

713
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:08,128
Is that really really proper lab environment there was like

714
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:08,896
True climbing

715
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:10,176
Control where everything is

716
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:12,992
Temperature regulated air flow regulator and all that

717
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:17,344
I think for that reason I don't know if I'll ever really be comfortable reporting on energy force

718
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:21,696
Really help climate controls but

719
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:23,232
Jessica produce ballpark

720
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,256
Let's talk about

721
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:28,864
Your favorite light switch is the Belkin WeMo and your favorite security camera is the nest

722
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:31,424
And I am kind of curious

723
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,192
About

724
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:38,592
The WeMo because in the lights what did you like limited to only Bluetooth and Wi-Fi because I found the WeMo light switch to be

725
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:40,640
Not everything I hoped for in a

726
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:41,408
Connect a light switch

727
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:42,944
Driving

728
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,272
Tracker behind the WeMo switches that at work so she who shall not be named

729
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,296
That's why we don't duck

730
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:49,600
I know the history of

731
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:50,368
Frustration

732
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:51,136
Wi-Fi

733
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:54,208
Getting getting we must have set up on Wi-Fi I've experienced it

734
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:56,512
We've got to learn to live with it I guess

735
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:58,048
Yeah that was why we went

736
00:30:58,304 --> 00:30:58,816
We went

737
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:00,096
Which ones do you like

738
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:02,656
So I haven't found a Wi-Fi switch I like it

739
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:04,448
So my switches when I in

740
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:05,728
I put them in

741
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:07,264
Which is because I've got a wink

742
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,568
Steph

743
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,384
And that talks to the echo as well so

744
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:15,200
I would love to find a great Wi-Fi switches

745
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,736
A really common question I get

746
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:21,600
But we know it's just it doesn't of the features there's a new task called The Plum

747
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:23,392
Which is Wi-Fi

748
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:25,952
I don't know if they have a skill for the

749
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:31,584
So

750
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:33,120
You guys also

751
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:36,448
Just do a quick run down your favorite security camera

752
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:40,032
Torn between

753
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,824
Emma Chamberlain

754
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,896
Your vacuum is Bonito

755
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,968
I've got a room but it doesn't have Wi-Fi

756
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:51,296
Can you tell me why I would want

757
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:56,672
It's really what it does is it

758
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:57,696
Brings the remote

759
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:59,744
That might come with your vacuum on your phone

760
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,280
That's a primary thing

761
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:04,608
You know you can do scheduling you can manually drive it around

762
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:05,632
That

763
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:06,400
For us

764
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:08,192
Was probably secondary

765
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:11,264
What we like about that whenever the Roomba is that

766
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,288
It's a better vacuum

767
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:13,056
AR testing

768
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:16,640
In room clean quickly

769
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:17,920
That was really bad

770
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:18,688
Driving

771
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:22,528
Okay so those are kind of your main

772
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:23,296
Products

773
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:25,088
Are there things that you guys

774
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:26,368
Tested and thought

775
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:30,464
Hey this is pretty cool but it's such a niche case that no one would ever want this

776
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:38,656
Ashley Clark Thompson hair is

777
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:39,936
Does one of our smart

778
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:40,960
Kitchen testing

779
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:41,984
And

780
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,776
There's a thing called the pantelligent

781
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:45,056
Was she loves

782
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:46,336
Oh yes

783
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:47,360
But our readers

784
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:49,920
And Arduino she did a Facebook live session

785
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,992
And people are not into that thing

786
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:55,040
I don't think it's the

787
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:57,600
If your listeners are familiar it's connected

788
00:32:57,856 --> 00:33:00,416
Saucepan frypan essentially I had sense

789
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:01,952
The bottom of it has a Bluetooth

790
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:03,232
Receiver

791
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:05,024
And the handle and it can give you kind of

792
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:05,792
Precise

793
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:07,840
Instructions on as far as

794
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:09,376
What the heat of the pandas

795
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:10,912
If you put it on a

796
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:12,192
Stand-alone

797
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:16,544
Burner and plug it into a Wiimote switch it can actually control the temperature itself

798
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,824
And it's $200

799
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,616
Which I think

800
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:21,408
It's 199

801
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,736
Yeah there's one point of criticize

802
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:29,344
I don't know if you

803
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,880
Feel the same way but I'd heaven

804
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:32,416
Seen much

805
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:33,952
In the way of connecting

806
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:36,512
Devices that really make me excited that really sank like

807
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:42,400
I'm with you on this site again the one thing that I've asked for

808
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:43,424
A thousand times

809
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,960
What is a refrigerated crock pot

810
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:46,240
Because

811
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:49,056
And not think about it

812
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:53,152
I have a dream

813
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:55,456
Well okay

814
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:56,992
Meli Melo right

815
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:58,016
So I have

816
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:03,648
What day is it

817
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:04,928
It's not

818
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:10,048
Try to have an imaginary Crock-Pot

819
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,072
Concept

820
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,352
I think

821
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:15,424
Big promise with a connected kitchen is

822
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,192
The expertise

823
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:16,960
Second

824
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:19,008
Copper supplement so I really like

825
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:23,104
Like the concept behind intelligent I like the concept behind the June oven

826
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,920
But I don't know if people are going to really pay those prices for

827
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:26,688
Worcester

828
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:31,040
A fridge

829
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:32,832
It doesn't have a giant phone on the front

830
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:34,368
But actually has

831
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:36,160
A camera inside that takes

832
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:37,184
Pictures that says

833
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:41,536
But I can call up a picture of my last name

834
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:45,376
I should totally get milk

835
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:46,144
Annex

836
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,192
You know we have that straight drive timeout

837
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:51,520
The giant Samsung fridge

838
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:53,824
Guess that's what it's got the family Hub fridge

839
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:56,896
And there's the LG fridge that they showed off at CES where you

840
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:58,944
Knocked on it in the door went clear yes

841
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:02,784
Is that out

842
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,576
You know it's not my knowledge no

843
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:09,184
There's a whole world

844
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:11,232
I don't know

845
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,256
Pet stuff

846
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:14,816
Get connected baby stuff for I think we're going to do

847
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:16,864
Maggie's around right now

848
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,168
You know the Sleep Number bed thing with inter

849
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:22,240
Christine and I mentioned that earlier where we have my daughter spend the night

850
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:23,776
Yeah we can tell you

851
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:27,360
It's really expensive is a Sleep Number bed right now you can't even going in

852
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:29,152
With an extensive platform

853
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:31,200
They can tell you what you know basic

854
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:34,528
Sleeping pattern so I can play how long your kid was asleep how long

855
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:36,576
Playing around bed for whatever

856
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:40,416
This was a handy thing from there you can kind of gamify the bedtime routine

857
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:42,464
Where you can if you can get a little love

858
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:43,744
Yeah Rewards

859
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:45,536
If you lie

860
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:47,328
Go to bed on time you brush your teeth

861
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:48,096
Considered cetera

862
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:50,144
I think there's something there

863
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,168
But price

864
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:54,240
This is probably need to get a little more realistic I think the bedroom

865
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:56,288
Quotes about $2,000

866
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,640
Definitely not the most expensive but

867
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:01,664
Okay

868
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,432
So

869
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:04,224
Those are kind of some of the devices

870
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:04,992
End

871
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:09,344
What still needs work I mean we should spend a lot of time talking about interoperability

872
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:11,136
Siri is a huge

873
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:12,160
You know issue today

874
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:14,976
Are there other things

875
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:16,000
You're thinking of

876
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:18,048
Because we kind of cover those others to death

877
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,072
I think

878
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:20,608
That what I would

879
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:21,376
Really

880
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:22,400
Like to see

881
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:23,168
Is

882
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:24,960
We went with Echo

883
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:28,544
Largely because videos easy

884
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:33,408
You'll get a lot of automation with Echo as you know right now you can't it's not really designed for setting up

885
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,688
Seems our kind of

886
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:36,992
Kalmar Nation type stuff and

887
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:39,296
Anyway that made our lives easier but

888
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:41,344
What is really good at is

889
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,368
Multi-user

890
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:43,904
Better for worse

891
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:47,232
But you know anybody can walk in the room

892
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:49,024
With initial command

893
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:50,048
And it will respond

894
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,096
Not all the other systems

895
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,376
You got very well

896
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:57,216
So it's not a very Democratic set up in the house to have

897
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:58,752
SmartThings or

898
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:01,568
Wink I think of running everything you know

899
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:03,616
This one person is going to end up being the

900
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:06,176
The main control point and then everything else to run

901
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:08,224
Jordan Peterson our experience

902
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:09,760
I would love to see that

903
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:11,040
Work a little better

904
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:11,808
Without having

905
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:12,576
Lindsay Ellis

906
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:13,600
Guest account

907
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:16,416
Another crazy longest log into the NFL

908
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:17,696
Because it really is

909
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:18,464
Precinct

910
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:20,256
That's great what about

911
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:22,560
Getting things online just the ease-of-use

912
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:26,400
I mean I still feel like this isn't ready for the mainstream

913
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:28,704
The echo brings a Little Closer

914
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:31,776
Partly for reasons you said but also because there's no

915
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:32,800
Recipes

916
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:35,360
Scenes that you said it's it's pretty easy

917
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:37,664
Do you think this is at the mainstream yet

918
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,944
Are still early adopter

919
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:40,992
It's so early.

920
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:41,760
Yeah

921
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:47,136
Yeah I don't know if you agree but I sent to me it's it's yes you can have the pain of getting things online

922
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:53,792
I think an extent what kind of used to that at this point right in the USA with a lot of things around the house

923
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:58,400
Sign up for grocery put your email in there put a password in there would do that with a PlayStation

924
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:01,728
We do that with Nest Thermostat you know looks different sing with you

925
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:03,776
What's a lifesaver lock whatever

926
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:06,848
Depending on how it gets online but

927
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,152
The basics of that I don't think you're too bad I think

928
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:10,176
Where

929
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:13,760
The early adopter thing comes in is just a share my risk

930
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:14,784
Involved in

931
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,088
Buying into the smart home right now

932
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:17,856
You know

933
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:19,136
You got the revolve

934
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:19,904
Beds

935
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,952
Staples connect looks like it's almost dead

936
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:26,560
Wake was looking taxi there although I guess it's back on now or has them back on

937
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:29,632
Forgot sex

938
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,168
The standard-bearer

939
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:33,984
If I was going to try to out to the whole home

940
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:37,056
And that's a whole lot of money doing that all that volatility

941
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:38,848
Would really give me a lot

942
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:41,920
Got it so then what's the hope for the smartphone

943
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:42,944
There's been

944
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:47,552
How do you think this is going to

945
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:48,320
Play outside

946
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,088
Annies

947
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:50,880
Your guess is as good as mine

948
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:51,648
Suppose

949
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:52,928
Ever murdered anybody

950
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,512
You know I don't know that I would have predicted a lot of drama around nest

951
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:57,536
A year ago

952
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:58,304
But here we are

953
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,328
You know I think

954
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,376
There's a lot of enthusiasm around Echo

955
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:02,144
And that's the

956
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:03,680
I'm still

957
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:05,216
Fingers crossed that

958
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:07,776
It will eventually emerge as

959
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:09,824
Apply from the people are excited about

960
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:12,896
Doing

961
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:15,200
I'll take a side bed

962
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:16,224
Not how well

963
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:19,552
I'm very down on

964
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,856
I feel like apple bit off more than

965
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:27,232
And it's kind of trying to figure out how to think about the Smart Home

966
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:28,000
Because it's

967
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:29,280
It's base assumptions

968
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:31,584
It's not wrong just

969
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,120
They were too narrow is probably

970
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:34,656
The way to think about it I think

971
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:39,264
The most successful companies are going to be those with kind of an open and flexible mindset

972
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:41,312
And I think the way Apple

973
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:44,896
Controls things and that's a huge advantage to its user base

974
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:46,176
What kind of

975
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:47,456
Haunted in the smartphone

976
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:48,480
That's my take

977
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:52,320
That's why I'm willing to be wrong because I would love for

978
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:53,856
There to be a beautiful

979
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:56,160
Interface for the smart home I just don't

980
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:57,696
Think we're going to see it

981
00:39:58,464 --> 00:39:58,976
From Apple

982
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:00,256
At least not for a really low

983
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,560
I totally agree with

984
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:04,608
Open versus closed

985
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:06,656
Issues going on there that you mentioned

986
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:07,936
And I will be

987
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:11,008
Surprised

988
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,288
I really like this

989
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:13,824
Security story they have to tell

990
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:15,616
As far as

991
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:17,152
Certifying every devices

992
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:19,712
Comes in both on the hardware and software level

993
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,760
Fingers crossed there

994
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:24,576
Does if it does get get any traction I think it's

995
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:26,368
I'm hopeful anyway.

996
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:28,416
It lives up to its

997
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:30,720
Okay

998
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:32,000
Thank you so

999
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:33,536
