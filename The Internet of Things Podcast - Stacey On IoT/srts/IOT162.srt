00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:25,344
Facebook's plans for the smart

00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:27,392
Fitbit and Health Data

10
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:28,928
A new SmartThings Hub

11
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:30,208
A dead company

12
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:36,608
A company that is trying to be resurrected and plans in the UK

13
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:37,632
So

14
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:38,400
All this

15
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:39,424
Plus

16
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,984
Our Guest this week is going to be Chris Harrison

17
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:47,104
He's an assistant professor at Carnegie Mellon and he actually built a smart wall project

18
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:50,944
And he and I are talking about human-computer interactions

19
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:52,224
You're going to want to listen to

20
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:55,552
We'll also have a message from our sponsor machine

21
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:56,320
Cute

22
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:57,600
Comcast service

23
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:59,648
And what answer a question for

24
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:03,488
So let's get it on the road with a message

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,768
One of our sponsors

26
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:11,168
This week sponsor is twilio twilio programmable Wireless makes it easy for developers to program

27
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:17,568
Connectivity whether you're working with a few devices or thousands get connected fast using no shenanigans

28
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:23,968

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,024
Because I have a super secret

32
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:37,792
Coyote

33
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,352
You guys were here

34
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:49,056
We actually use twilio for the coyote voicemail I don't know if people realize that that's the back in service that we use not that cellular

35
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,336
Part that they're talking about but

36
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,128
We trust it

37
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,152
You can too

38
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,432
All right

39
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:55,712
Let us move

40
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:56,480
Ahead

41
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:59,808
Exciting news this week biggest news we thought

42
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,344
What is Amazon's stock

43
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,624
Maturity announcement

44
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,392
Which

45
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:05,184
As far as news goes was kind of

46
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:11,584
Not very exciting actually but we'll talk about it because it's worth talking about

47
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,144
Yes so last week Amazon said that they

48
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,168
Are going to

49
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:16,960
Provide smart home services

50
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:17,728
Insecurities

51
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:18,496
For users

52
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:21,056
And this fits with some of the purchases they've made

53
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:21,824
Plus

54
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,640
The fact that security is so far the best Gateway Inn

55
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,432
Just about anyone

56
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,712
What is

57
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:31,296
How to surprise about Amazon's thing is they're actually not doing any monitoring

58
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,832
They're basically Packaging

59
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:33,856
A bunch of devices

60
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:34,880
And they're going to install

61
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,464
Is this exciting

62
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,768
It is if you don't want to do like a DIY so

63
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,048
Is still

64
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:45,120
What I would think of it as a DIY system is just a DIY system

65
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:51,520
Cheapest option is a $240 option that includes an echo.

66
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:53,824
And some lady outside

67
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,872
And that's $240 for

68
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:58,688
It runs all the way to

69
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,712
Super smart

70
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:05,088
$140 and you're going to get a siren motion control contact sensors

71
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:06,368
Safety sensors

72
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,392
Cameras

73
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,160
A.

74
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,440
Video doorbell

75
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,208
An outdoor light

76
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,256
And a hug

77
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:13,280
Not

78
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:17,888
Not The Hobbit Amazon makes which is the Echo Plus

79
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:20,960
Yes so Kevin astutely noticed this

80
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:21,984
I'm glad she did

81
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:24,800
Instead of the Echo Plus which is the

82
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:25,568
Echo

83
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,360
Citic

84
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,408
Amazon sending people

85
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,176
A wink hub

86
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,968
The wink Hub 2

87
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:32,992
Which is Kevin's

88
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:36,832
Public choice in my Hub of choice for anyone who doesn't want to deal with

89
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:37,600
Complexity

90
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,136
It has a pretty basic setup

91
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:39,904
So

92
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,440
This is really weird

93
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,464
It is

94
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,768
It is really weird and you know what I got

95
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:49,376
Not trash but people when the Echo Plus Hub came out I said

96
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:55,776
Turn on starter for me because it has no Z-Wave radio just said Cindy Bluetooth and Wi-Fi obviously easy way Bastille

97
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:59,104
A big part of this market for many many reasons and

98
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:04,480
By doing this by going with a wink Hub 2 in all of the packages that include a hub

99
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:07,808
It just illustrates to me I'd want to say was right but

100
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,600
Amazon news

101
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:13,696
Easy way to steal important a lot of these products are Z-Wave products

102
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:18,303
Yeah when you look at the sensor Market you're looking usually to Seaway sensor or maybe

103
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,583
Azzip Pizza

104
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,631
But most of my sensors are actually see

105
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:24,447
So this again makes a ton of sense

106
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,215
Do you want all this stuff

107
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:25,983
To work your

108
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,287
And I also think

109
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,567
Maybe there

110
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:30,847
The goal is

111
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:31,615
Oh hey

112
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:34,431
Yeah it's super complicated to program all the stuff to work

113
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:36,223
Work together let's get an expert in

114
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,015
To do it and that's basically what Kevin and

115
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:42,367
And then you just tie it to an echo Dot

116
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:44,671
Which said you tell the customer you're like

117
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:45,439
Hey

118
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,207
If you say this

119
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:46,975
The following things

120
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:48,511
Set it all up

121
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:53,887
Couple weeks ago I had someone from Lennar on and they talked about how

122
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:54,655
They set up

123
00:04:55,423 --> 00:05:01,567
Be home with the Amazon Echo and all this smart stuff and they do it basically by sitting down with the family doing a Q&A ask

124
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,335
Asking them

125
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:04,127
What they like to do how they likes

126
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,151
Things to work

127
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:07,199
And then they basically program at forum

128
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,479
It's exactly

129
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:09,503
The model that

130
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,271
You have

131
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:12,575
As a it's a high-end when you're talking about

132
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:14,111
Like some of these Crestron and

133
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:17,183
Extend these big fancy system

134
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:23,839
Print it was also interesting to me that these are actual Amazon employees that will come to your home that they're not Contracting this out

135
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:26,143
So obviously they're making an investment there

136
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:29,727
To educate the employees on the Smart Home Market

137
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,775
And Brooke with customers directly

138
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:32,543
Yes

139
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,311
And that's awesome

140
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,079
Because

141
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:34,847
We need this

142
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,383
Most people are not going to be

143
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:38,943
Ryan's

144
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:41,247
And yeah and will hear later from heaven

145
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,575
He's involved in one of these projects

146
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:45,343
Right

147
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,391
I am one of those

148
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:53,279
Quick snow just because they are making or are using they being Amazon using the wink Hub 2

149
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:55,839
Underwood Amazon

150
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:57,375
Potentially acquire wink

151
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,399
You know

152
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,423
It's gone

153
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,823
2 startups quirky

154
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:06,591
It's too much

155
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:08,639
So when quirky went bankrupt they sold wing

156
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:11,199
The company owned by William

157
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:13,759
Add Flex

158
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:16,575
You're right I miss that right they sold it to flex

159
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:19,135
And then after about a year Flex was like

160
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:21,439
And so they sold it to the company owned by William

161
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,719
I will say

162
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:25,023
WIC hardware and software

163
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,047
It's really good

164
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:30,143
It really works well for most people so it would be a real shame

165
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:31,679
The market Lofts

166
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:38,591
True I mean even if they were to acquire a wink a minute doesn't mean you couldn't buy it and use it

167
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:40,895
With your Google home it's on so forth

168
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,967
I don't think it would go away in that regard

169
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:48,575
In fact I feel better if a company like an Amazon actually owned it because it's not like they're cloud

170
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:53,951
Center which provides lot of services it just kind of disappear mean that's their bread-and-butter right now so

171
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:56,767
I would actually feel better in a sense in that regard

172
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:59,071
When we recommend the wink

173
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:01,119
I often see questions

174
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,655
Listeners

175
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:04,703
And readers on the site saying

176
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:08,799
You know you guys were worried that it might disappear because been sold so many times

177
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:13,151
Yes and that's something that has reported your purchase decision but it hasn't gone away yet

178
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:13,919
So I

179
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,783
The wink Hub 2 for $99

180
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,063
Honest website

181
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,087
A couple other places

182
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,623
And oftentimes

183
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,903
I see this on sale for

184
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,439
70 years

185
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,999
Okay and other

186
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,023
Amazon news

00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,839
Who was the head of the

189
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,631
Madam a smart home

190
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,399
Project

191
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,423
Has left

192
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,727
And we had Charlie actually on the show a couple

193
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:44,639
He was fantastic because he's one of the only people who I've encountered to have more connected devices in there

194
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,663
Their house than I do

195
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,431
So

196
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,199
Always find it

197
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:47,967
Talk to him

198
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:49,247
He joined Amazon

199
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,783
In 2013 so far

200
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:51,551
5 years ago

201
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,087
And now he's leaving

202
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,879
Just to hang out

203
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,415
Sounds like

204
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:05,887
I mean the innocent personal blog post he was saying he just wants to take a serious break from work I can totally understand I mean Amazon

205
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:11,007
Has made huge strides in this market over the last five years Charlie obviously has a lot to do with that

206
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:16,639
He mentioned he's got a car restoration project that hasn't touched in 2 years he hasn't updated his smart home

207
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:18,175
Since 2001

208
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,479
So he said it start getting very crusty

209
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:25,855
So are you not some people are trying to read into this but I think it's exactly what he's saying he just needs a break

210
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,159
So thanks Charlie

211
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,439
For all that you've done

212
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,207
Connecting stuff

213
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:32,767
And I know that he has been very proactive

214
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,047
And reactive to

215
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,327
Requested

216
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,607
I've made to him

217
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,399
And try to ask him questions about

218
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,703
So I am sad

219
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:44,287
But maybe he's got more free time to talk to us now

220
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,567
I'll have him come out

221
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,847
Teak restify mysmart

222
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,919
Get a chance to Adelaide

223
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,223
Everything's changing

224
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:52,991
All the time

225
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,783
In the smart speaker Market

226
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,575
Facebook which is doing

227
00:08:57,343 --> 00:09:00,159
Basically said that they are going to take their smart speaker

228
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,975
That is going to include Emmet smart assistant

229
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:05,279
To International markets first

230
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,303
Or at least that's

231
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,583
What's CNBC

232
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:14,239
Yeah well we had reported or read reports of them postponing this smart speaker couple

233
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:16,287
Four weeks maybe in a few months ago

234
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:20,127
As a US base company sword made sense to launch it here

235
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:26,783
But with all of the brouhaha over Cambridge analytics and Facebook data and privacy

236
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:29,087
Wouldn't surprise me if they do this overseas first

237
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:33,439
Those people people outside the US have been less affected

238
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:35,743
At least in the headlines so

239
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,047
That was so far

240
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,071
So far

241
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:42,655
What I actually thought was interesting is I thought Project M

242
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,191
Which is Facebook's AI program

243
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:47,007
You guys may remember it because it was a chatbot

244
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,055
Just asked to do things it would have

245
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:49,823
Happened but it was

246
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:50,847
Both

247
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,383
AI plus actual

248
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:53,663
On the back end

249
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:54,687
In

250
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:56,479
It sounded they shut that down

251
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:57,759
The chatbot aspect

252
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:58,527
Shutdown

253
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,551
Because

254
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,831
It sounded like it wasn't

255
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:01,599
Scalable

256
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:03,135
And Facebook is all about scale

257
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,159
Thereto

258
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:07,743
So I thought it was interested that they're going to have a smart voice assistant

259
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,279
M and

260
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,047
That it's kind of

261
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,327
Part of that program

262
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,095
Although I

263
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,887
Doubt there would be a real person

264
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:14,655
On the back end

265
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:19,007
Because man if someone was like a real person on the back and listening to some of my Madam AR

266
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,287
Google request

267
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,847
And I would have a serious problem

268
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:28,735
Asking a chatbot to flip the switch on my lights and actually have somebody overseas were in

269
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:31,295
Imechanic Datacenter flip the switch yet

270
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:33,855
That would be

271
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:35,903
Everbilt

272
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,719
That's what we know about that

273
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:41,535
We'll see if that happens if you're an international market

274
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,071
One day you get a chance to buy

275
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:46,911
Let us know if you actually would I have to say that I wouldn't

276
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:55,103
I would do the same I've heard and this is just hearsay that Japan will be the lunch area

277
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:57,663
So

278
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,575
We have to bring up China all the time

279
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:08,671
Because to me it's just baffling and it also looks like the worst case scenario

280
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,439
For a lot of disk

281
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:10,719
Technology

282
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:11,999
Building

283
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,303
Maybe it's just a cultural difference but

284
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:17,887
China is now mining data directly from their workers

285
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:18,911
Prince

286
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:21,471
Caps on their heads to find out

287
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,751
How they're feeling

288
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:23,519
What

289
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,567
Yeah

290
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:31,711
Industry

291
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:34,527
To measure emotional responses to things

292
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:35,807
Things like tiredness

293
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:36,831
And there

294
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,623
Aggregating all this data to see

295
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,391
What they can see

296
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:41,183
Well it's sort of gay people

297
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:43,999
Approach they're using that information to say hey this

298
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:49,119
Employee is maybe overtired may not make the best decisions right now let's

299
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:55,263
Rotate this person out as a result of that it's no different than say industrial iot and a machine maybe the machine is going to

300
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,335
You could have a breakdown soon I don't mean the person would but

301
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,871
What's the best analogy I can come up with

302
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,407
So I get that but

303
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:03,711
Wow Chinese just going

304
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,991
All out with

305
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:06,527
Personal monitoring

306
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:12,927
I mean we talked about you know that smart cameras that capture jaywalkers and the points that you can earn by being

307
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:15,743
A good citizen based on your social media posts and

308
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:23,679
Yeah I mean if this is where we're headed I'm not so sure I wanted it's not a future I want to be a part of I don't think but

309
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:26,751
Wow in a while back I had someone

310
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:33,151
Talk about things like Fitbit data in HR so if your HR gives you a Fitbit for maybe health insurance

311
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,711
Some of the interesting use cases

312
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,735
Is the pop up from that

313
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:37,503
What is it

314
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,527
What happens

315
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,295
If

316
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:42,111
Your company can measure how well you slept less

317
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:45,951
And maybe they look in there like I was Stacy you only got 4 hours of sleep

318
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:46,719
This guy

319
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:47,743
Got six

320
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:48,767
We're going to let him have

321
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,583
Where is Maple Avenue

322
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,351
Maybe

323
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,375
It's not to say that

324
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,399
I should be penalized

325
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:59,007
So there's a lot of privacy implications yes obviously

326
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:04,127
This is happening in China but this is something that could conceivably come into play in your life

327
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,919
Or in the not-too-distant

328
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:08,479
Not my life and not today

329
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:13,599
I don't know Kevin I'm going to start monitoring tell him we can't record the show and tell

330
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,159
Dangerously

331
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:19,231
I'm wearing this ankle bracelet you sent me Stacy what's it for

332
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,047
Now

333
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,327
Basic news

334
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,607
Why do Jews this week

335
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:25,631
So first.

336
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:26,655
SmartThings

337
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,935
New Hub coming with

338
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,471
Thread support

339
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,239
Twitch

340
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:32,543
I actually was a little surprised by this because the

341
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,311
Older

342
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,847
Actually the SmartThings Hub 2

343
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:37,919
Has zigbee support in thread is basically

344
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,711
It's a slightly different variation

345
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:40,735
On the underlying

346
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:42,527
So

347
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:44,319
Basically you're talking about the same

348
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,343
Radio stand

349
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,671
It's the 802. 15. 4

350
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:49,695
Stack

351
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:50,719
Esso radio specs

352
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:52,767
So you take one of these in

353
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,303
Most of the newer

354
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:57,119
And probably chips from the least the last two years ago

355
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,399
R backwards

356
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,167
Compatible end

357
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,447
Can do a software update

358
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:02,495
Date to get ebooks CPM

359
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,847
So my hunch is the radio in the SmartThings to Hub

360
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:09,151
Wasn't capable of doing that because

361
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:11,199
This is why they need to launch a new one

362
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:13,759
I guess that makes sense to me because

363
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,551
The SmartThings Hub

364
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:17,087
2 does not

365
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,623
Support zigbee Pro

366
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:23,999
And I just wondered make that may have something to do with the radio of choice that they put in there which

367
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:26,559
Would potentially then cause a knot to have

368
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:27,839
Weave thread support

369
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:34,239
You know with a software update so we should probably mention this actually this information came from somebody on Twitter who is

370
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:36,031
Scouring the FCC database

371
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:38,591
And the SEC has tested a new

372
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:39,615
SmartThings Hub

373
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,151
Acrostics radio

374
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:46,271
Transmissions in Swansea horsefeathers new announcement of a SmartThings Hub a new one from Samsung but

375
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:49,343
Obviously one has been tested so therefore it is very likely coming

376
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:51,391
Looks a lot like the current one

377
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:55,487
Has a ethernet port on the back as well as a USB port and then

378
00:14:55,743 --> 00:15:00,863
All of the major radios inside so that's good it's not losing anything looks like it's only gaining something

379
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:06,239
Alright in other news smart luggage company is shutting down

380
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,263
And it's sold office

381
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,031
Technology

382
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,055
Travelpro

383
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,079
The reason

384
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,615
Because it has

385
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,639
Smart luggage

386
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:15,967
Has a battery for charging plus GPS

387
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:19,551
For tracking your luggage batteries are not removable

388
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,319
And

389
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,111
The airlines in December

390
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,391
Basically said you know what

391
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:28,767
We don't like the smart luggage it could blow up in our holds those Lithium-ion batteries are terrible so if you can't remove them

392
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,047
You can't carry this look

393
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:34,143
Yeah but does but so

394
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:39,007
Me and Mike so why would a company buy them when the current company Bruce mortgages

395
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:41,055
Redesign with removable batteries

396
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:45,407
My hunches bluesmart didn't have enough money to redesign I mean that's a pretty big project

397
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:49,759
Yes and so they decided to sell off they sold about 65000

398
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:53,599
And basically they're no longer honoring warranties on them

399
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:54,367
And

400
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,391
You're pretty much hosed

401
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,927
Say probably about the

402
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,975
IP for cheap just

403
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:02,815
In case they want to do some patents in case they wanted to launch their own smart

404
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:03,839
Luggage that

405
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:04,607
Doesn't have

406
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,399
A non-removable battery

407
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,423
Dessert

408
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,191
It's not uncommon

409
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:10,239
Bluesmart

410
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:13,567
Did have a lot of stuff they have the GPS tracking that weight sensors

411
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,871
Are the batteries for charging devices

412
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:17,919
Tulsa

413
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:18,687
Cool stuff

414
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:19,711
Too cool for us

415
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:21,759
That is blue smart

416
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:22,783
In other

417
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,063
Possibly dying

418
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:26,367
Whiting's

419
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,647
Has been sold back to it

420
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:28,671
Original founder

421
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:31,231
Bear with us as we explain what Whiting

422
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:32,767
Nokia

423
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,559
Brought whiting's turn it into a toy

424
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,839
We talked about this

425
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:38,143
A couple weeks ago on the show because we had

426
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,959
Heard that perhaps Google was going to buy

427
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:42,239
So this is

428
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:45,311
Baby monitor

429
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:48,895
Give me the flight tracker

430
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,431
I think I sleep stuff

431
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,735
Basically Nokia said

432
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,295
This isn't doing anything

433
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,063
Press

434
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:58,879
And so that the company's original co-founder and chairman

435
00:16:59,135 --> 00:16:59,647
Eric

436
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,415
Korea

437
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:01,951
Has now purchased it

438
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:05,023
And it's expected to close towards the end of June

439
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,303
So if you have the stuff

440
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,839
It's unclear

441
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:09,887
Sinclair

442
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,447
Yeah I'm sure

443
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:16,799
Eric Carrillo has made some good money on this because Nokia purchase this

444
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:19,615
Company for 204 million two years ago

445
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:21,151
Another selling it back

446
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,967
I'm sure he's getting it for a song at this point

447
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:27,551
I mean this is presumably

448
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,319
Sported

449
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,367
Maybe he's got some great ideas.

450
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:33,439
Come to fruition so we'll hope Google

451
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:37,791
They have rolled reviews for assistant actions and apps

452
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:45,471
Yeah this is new you if you go into the Google assistant on an Android phone cuz I tried it on iOS and did not

453
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,239
Not work for me

454
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:50,847
Put on Android phone if you search for an action or an app

455
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,895
Which they've already had that functionality

456
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:59,551
They've added the ability to submit reviews and even see reviews and I think this is great because you don't know

457
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:04,159
What you're adding to your smart home speaker until you actually install and use it

458
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:09,791
But if you can crowdsource review information and get an idea of you know what's worthwhile and what's not

459
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,351
That saves a lot of time and makes experience better so

460
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:15,935
I assume that the Google assistant app on iOS will get this

461
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:18,495
Very soon but for now if you hit the Explorer

462
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,543
Tab in Google assistant on Android

463
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,591
Do a search for any action or app

464
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:25,151
You will start seeing reviews

465
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:31,807
Because they just roll this out there aren't too many I didn't find any reviews but I've seen some online for people to dig around and found some

466
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:34,111
That's good you got to give it time to

467
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,391
To populate I presume

468
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:37,695
All right

469
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,463
And

470
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,999
Big news for zigbee

471
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:42,047
We're talking about how big Z-Wave still is

472
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:50,751
Yeah the zigbee alliance has been chosen for smart meter role as to every home in Gray

473
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:51,519
Great Britain

474
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:57,919
By 2020 so that has a big win for the sigelei folks I think this is great to have a standard protocol

475
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:58,687
Standardized

476
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:00,991
Smartphone meters and so on so

477
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:07,391
If you live in Great Britain you will be able to I assume purchase this maybe they install it through your power company.

478
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,415
Don't know how that all works

479
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:13,279
Alton in the UK but this is great for energy metering energy management

480
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:17,119
Their first outing increase savings for utilities and customers Etc

481
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:20,191
So again Big Win For The zigbee Alliance on this one

482
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,727
Yes And Hive witch

483
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:23,775
It was created by British gas is a smart home

484
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,823
So they offer it they started with

485
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:28,383
With a smart thermostat and they've moved into other products

486
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:29,919
There actually is

487
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:30,687
EBay system

488
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:31,455
So this makes

489
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,503
And Hive just by the

490
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:38,111
Okay and now

491
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:41,439
He's working or doing to opine on the state of the smart

492
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:43,487
I wrote something in my newsletter

493
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:45,023
Last week basically

494
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,303
The bottom line is I'm

495
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,327
In a smart home

496
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,863
Any further

497
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:49,887
Then I thought

498
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:55,263
We are still solving the same problems in 2018 that we had identified all the way back in 2012

499
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,031
2013

500
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:58,079
So things like a lack of standards

501
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:58,847
High-cost

502
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,383
Use cases

503
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:03,199
Blah blah blah

504
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:07,551
These are all still issues today and voices helped but it hasn't helped enough

505
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:08,575
And

506
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:09,343
Brinkley

507
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,111
Disappointed

508
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:13,183
That's that's the short too long didn't read version

509
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:13,951
Of my story

510
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,231
And Kevin

511
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:15,999
Is living this

512
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:19,071
Yeah I am right now because I'd miss on the last

513
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,607
Show that was going to switch back

514
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:22,399
From SmartThings to wink

515
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:27,775
And I started to make that migration thinking it should be pretty easy I had one before

516
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:31,871
No problem and even though I disconnected all of my devices

517
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:38,271
From the SmartThings Hub before I shut that up down instead of re-adding back to wink it's been a frustrating experience some of the device

518
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:43,391
Cesare still there just having problems linking back to wink at even reset some of them and it's

519
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:47,743
My bulbs in particular that I go to the reset process and depending on the bulb

520
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,535
It's you know what off

521
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:50,303
On

522
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,071
Sequence

523
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:54,655
You know anyone from a half-second to 3 seconds and so on so forth

524
00:20:54,911 --> 00:21:01,055
And the Wing Cap walkthrough that for each type of bulb you have I have some lightify bulbs that I have some Cree bulbs and some

525
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:07,455
Time three sets working sometimes it's not and that it's just so frustrating I literally to this day still have a couple bulbs

526
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:11,551
Are no longer smart they're just dumb bulbs because the reset process

527
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:12,831
Isn't resetting

528
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:15,391
You know and it's just really really frustrating and

529
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:16,672
Is it also have

530
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,000
Exodus

531
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:23,328
Particular ones are Cree bulbs but some of my other Cree bulbs are

532
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,096
Okay

533
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:27,424
So I don't know that it's a crazy thing I'm thinking it's more of a

534
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,960
More of a hub thing I don't know yet

535
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:30,752
I don't know and I got to figure it out

536
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:35,872
Additionally because everything was linked in the Amazon mattimeo app

537
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:40,480
And I told her we discover devices even though Ivory added these devices through wink

538
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:47,392
It's still showing the SmartThings implementations of them and saying hey this server is not connected or not responding like

539
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:49,696
Because that's not in place anymore

540
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:56,096
So I had to manually delete and figure out which ones are working which ones weren't in matamata and manually delete them and re-add them

541
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:58,912
It's just more hassle than it needs to be

542
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:04,544
It just it's just so frustrating you know makes me wonder how smart Amazon actually is by doing all this

543
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,128
Installation and configuration for you and me and if we have problems

544
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:11,456
I know you're I think you're going to talk about another problem you've been having lately

545
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:14,016
If we're having problems and we've been doing this for

546
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:14,784
Years

547
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:17,344
And maybe it's not us maybe it's the devices

548
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:20,160
Words I speak

549
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:22,720
Hahaha

550
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:23,744
Yes

551
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,120
You didn't take all the steps

552
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:30,144
Spring cleaning

553
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:33,984
You're going to do something crazy like

554
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:34,752
Like this

555
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:35,776
I would tell you

556
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:39,104
Do the formal uninstall of each device

557
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:40,384
First selfie

558
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,432
Disconnected formerly from your house

559
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:45,504
Actually I guess your first step should be unlinking

560
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,784
Your stuff from Amazon

561
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:48,576
Whichever or both

562
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,392
The formal uninstall

563
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,416
Of the device

564
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:53,440
From The Hub

565
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:54,720
Ben

566
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:56,000
Reset your hub

567
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,560
Delete everything

568
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,328
From Amazon

569
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:01,376
Even the existing stuff

570
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,144
It's still on there

571
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,168
And then

572
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:03,936
Slowly

573
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:04,704
Had it all back

574
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:07,776
Now if your lights do not reset to the hub

575
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,056
That is

576
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:11,872
The problem is the best way to do it without

577
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:14,688
Weird glitchy mistakes because

578
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:15,456
You're otherwise,

579
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:16,480
I'm sorry

580
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:19,040
And it takes it takes

581
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:20,064
It is not

582
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,344
It's a project

583
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:25,696
Which

584
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:28,512
I'm cursed so I went to install

585
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:29,536
Nest Yale

586
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:30,304
Smart Lock

587
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,608
And as part of that I was resetting

588
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:34,144
Everything on the Google

589
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:34,912
Home

590
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:35,680
Hub

591
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:36,960
In the Google home app

592
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:40,544
Because I wanted to die was trying to go Totally Google if I might

593
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,568
My house is much as I

594
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:45,152
And taking everything off Google home

595
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:47,200
And then putting it back on cosme

596
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:48,480
Some drama much like

597
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:49,504
Kevin head drama

598
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:52,064
And then I also had some struggles

599
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,624
Connecting my Nest by Hill lock

600
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:55,648
Yale by nest

601
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,464
Because the hardware side was not work

602
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:01,024
The end result was that I installed it

603
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:01,792
And

604
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:04,352
I never actually got the chance to add the app

605
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,888
Because

606
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,168
The touchpad never

607
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:09,472
Lit up and so I rechecked everything

608
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:10,752
I checked on my connections

609
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:12,800
Reset the device just in case

610
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:14,336
I changed out the batteries

611
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:16,640
In all the comment troubleshooting

612
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,432
And

613
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,200
It still didn't work

614
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:21,504
I spent an hour

615
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:23,296
Like 15 minutes on the phone with

616
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:25,088
Nest and they were finally like

617
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,392
Basically they told me to do all the things

618
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,536
And then they're like yeah I think this isn't a software issue is Hardware issue so we're going to send you over to you

619
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:35,072
And they sent me to you

620
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:36,096
Any I was like

621
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:38,144
Yeah that sounds like a hardware issue we're just going to

622
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:43,008
Has a long time to get a replacement what I will say is

623
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,032
This process did

624
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:46,080
It worked in the sense

625
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:48,384
Fitness had a warm transfer

626
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,152
To Gail

627
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:49,920
Which method

628
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:52,224
They handled my case seamlessly

629
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:53,248
From my perspective

630
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,272
When they transfer

631
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:56,832
And that is how these things should work

632
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:59,648
It's kind of unrealistic to expect Nesta

633
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:00,928
Dale's Hardware

634
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:02,976
Problems but it is totally realistic as a

635
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,512
Customer to say hey

636
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:06,048
I ended up at nest

637
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,608
Your job is to get me to yell without making my

638
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:09,888
My life miserable

639
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:10,656
It'll take a while

640
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:11,936
But that's customers

641
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:17,568
No that is the right process and I'm glad it worked out it's it's a shame it takes that long but I can understand

642
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:18,848
Why that is

643
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:25,248
In my situation I got to believe most people don't switch hubs nearly as often as we do so it maybe I'm whining

644
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:28,320
About a problem that nobody else has or will experience

645
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:31,392
No because it is hard like sometimes things break

646
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:37,536
And I have had to uninstall everything and put it over but I have had two I've had glitches

647
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:39,328
Where something stops working

648
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:44,960
Didn't work so I had to uninstall

649
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:45,984
And try to get them

650
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,264
Work with particular

651
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:49,056
And so

652
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:50,848
That's I think it's actually fairly calm

653
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,152
Sadly

654
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:55,456
All right and

655
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,224
Think about this

656
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,248
When you move

657
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:58,016
Holy cow

658
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:01,088
Or if you decide to replace all your bulbs just buy Smart Switch

659
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,624
And I leave them at the house

660
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:03,904
That's my advice to you

661
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,488
Now let's go to the iot podcast listener hotline

662
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:10,304
And good news

663
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:13,632
Continuing to support the hotline through the end of the year so

664
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,264
We are so glad be

665
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,056
Because I think it's actually real

666
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:23,360
I really appreciate that

667
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:26,432
So everybody go out and buy a Schlage lock

668
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:29,504
If you want to Schlage lock just go right

669
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,064
By 1 and if you want to see what they have to switch leg

670
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,344
. com to learn more

671
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,880
And we also today

672
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:40,512
How to announce a winner for our April drawing this is for a drawing for my old

673
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:41,536
Netatmo

674
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:42,304
Welcome

675
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:48,448
So this is the one that goes inside recognizes people and you record actually to an SD card so you don't ever have to send it

676
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:49,216
Cloud

677
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:50,496
I love this game

678
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:52,032
And now

679
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:52,800
Steve

680
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:54,336
Can love it too so Steve

681
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:55,616
You are a winner

682
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:56,384
And you're

683
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,920
Actually asking a question to

684
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:58,944
So

685
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,016
If you have a question for us give us a call at 5 1/2

686
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,040
63

687

And we will be happy

689
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:08,928
Or we will be happy

690
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:09,696
To tell you

691
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:10,720
We have no answer for

692
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,256
It could work both ways

693
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:13,536
To be honest

694
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:14,816
So let's hear from

695
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:15,584
Steve

696
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,864
Stacey and Kevin

697
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,400
My name is Steve and I

698
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:23,264
Trying to kill two birds with one stone and looking for a smart lock with a built-in camera

699
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,080
I have no desire for a smart doorbell am I currently out there

700
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:27,616
Really great for one anyway

701
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:30,432
I don't want to have to buy and install a separate outdoor smart

702
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:31,200
Camera eater

703
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:33,248
So far I've only found the gate

704
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:34,016
Smart Lock

705
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:35,552
Which was an Indiegogo

706
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:38,368
Some serious if you guys have any experience with that one

707
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:40,672
Or if there are any others I should know about

708
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:44,000
You're in the market already or possibly coming out down the road

709
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:45,024
Thanks so much

710
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,560
OC this is actually a

711
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:48,096
Tough one because cameras

712
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:50,912
Require wifi and wifi sucks battery is

713
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:54,240
Like nobody's business door locks usually

714
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:55,520
Their batteries are kind of a pain

715
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:56,800
How to change so

716
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:59,104
It's very tough to find some sort of door lock

717
00:27:59,360 --> 00:27:59,872
With a k

718
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,408
That being said

719
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,968
Kevin has found the closest thing possible

720
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:10,368
Well I did a bunch of research and unfortunately I came up with the exact same single option right now that's tea

721
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:13,696
Steve himself came up with and that is the gate Smart Lock which

722
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:16,000
Will cost $349

723
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:18,560
For the reason that you just mentioned battery life mainly

724
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:23,424
Nobody else that I can find is making a door lock with a camera in it and you know it

725
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,216
Technical challenge for sure

726
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:27,008
It's interesting the gate Smart Lock

727
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:28,288
Has a

728
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:31,360
Removable and rechargeable battery on the back of it

729
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:36,480
And you can even purchase a spare battery for $59 that recharges in 5 hours battery

730
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:40,064
Should last you about three months they say but that's

731
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:45,184
Probably going to depend on how much video streaming you actually do from your doorbell so

732
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,464
That's that's going to

733
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:48,000
Very true

734
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:55,936
Yeah that's actually very very true I see the same thing in my car which has a battery in it to run the Electric reels

735
00:28:56,448 --> 00:29:02,592
Yeah I don't know what other options are all right now and it's started on Indiegogo as Steve it said it is now available.

736
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:07,456
Directly from the company so I've even seen some Amazon reviews and need kind of there than many

737
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:10,016
And they've been a little bit all over the map one was

738
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:13,344
Terrible and two or three were good to excellent

739
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:20,000
I will save some people did not like the quality of the video itself and I should note it is a 720p video camera

740
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:22,560
So it's not a full HD video camera

741
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:24,352
That may be important to you may not

742
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:25,376
But

743
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:27,168
Right now looks like the gate is at

744
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:31,520
On the plus side you want a free camera

745
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:34,080
All right

746
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:36,128
Now stay tuned for our guest

747
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:40,736
This week's guest is Chris Harrison who is an assistant professor at Carnegie Mellon University

748
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:41,760
We're talking about

749
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:43,808
Human-computer interactions

750
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:46,368
We're talking about his smart wall project

751
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:47,648
About digital paper

752
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:49,184
So it's actually really cool

753
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:51,488
As a nerdy person who loves this stuff

754
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:52,768
And so hopefully you will do

755
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:59,168
A message from our sponsor for this week's Internet of Things podcast

756
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:03,776
Ask for a message from our sponsor this week sponsor is machine QA Comcast

757
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:05,312
And I have Alex

758
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:07,360
From the GM of machine

759
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:09,408
So let's just kick this off with

760
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:10,176
What is

761
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,760
I think he was Comcast enterprise-grade network

762
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:15,296
Specifically Belfry Mt

763
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:18,624
Wework of B2B and b2c use cases

764
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,904
You want to leverage our Network

765
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,976
So they can focus on building on the application for them

766
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:28,608
We also have a growing and robust portfolio Business Solutions and we're providing to and customers as well

767
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:32,192
In a lot of cases people looking for iot networks are looking for iot

768
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:34,752
Teen that works everywhere in minor

769
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:35,520
Comcast

770
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:36,288
You guys have

771
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,104
That is not everywhere

772
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:40,384
How are you guys

773
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,152
Handling

774
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:48,576
Public Announcement made regarding AR-15 City metropolitan area launch and we cover hundreds of cities within those areas

775
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:54,720
Any of the customers that are looking to us provide i a t e connectivity do have needs as you would imagine outside of

776
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:55,488
Trisha

777
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,768
So we've done is

778
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:58,816
Effectively allow them to either

779
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:00,608
Bring their own does login device

780
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:07,264
And I can connect back virtually to our Network and we end up managing these gateways for them in the field so whether it's in a farm

781
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:11,360
Garmin Iowa or it's a warehouse on place in Detroit we have clients who are

782
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:17,760
Point solutions for their end users in these locations where we might not have particular sort of coverage in that particular location

783
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:19,552
DirecTV On Demand service

784
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:22,112
Which allows us to Shipley's lorawan Gateway

785
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:28,256
The location they need able to sort of virtualizer network for them in places that are not in our quote-unquote traditional hook

786
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:32,864
Excellent and one of the customers that you guys recently announced was Victor which is a

787
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:33,888
Pest Control

788
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,936
So how are you working with Victor

789
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:37,216
Which I assume

790
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:40,288
Pass coverages a nationwide issue how are you working with them too

791
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,056
Create

792
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:42,336
Connected pestka

793
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:43,616
Did ISIS

794
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:49,248
Where will help Victor add additional access technology to some of their connected Pest Control devices

795
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:51,040
List case of low-power device

796
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:55,136
Which solves our problem for coverage in hard-to-reach locations like attics

797
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:56,160
Or basements

798
00:31:56,416 --> 00:32:01,024
In terms of making sure that their own footprint clearly in the places that we have built networking we pronounce

799
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:07,424
It's not a problem that works out well in other locations throughout the country were clearly they might need to have a need and we haven't built there just yet

800
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,240
Reside outside of footprint a couple

801
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:15,616
They're checking out shopping or Laurel and connected mousetrap with one of our machine Q lorawan Gateway

802
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:18,432
So we can drop ship them anywhere they want and make sure they can

803
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:22,016
Work cited work with it Solutions companies

804
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:25,856
Havanese low-power devices anywhere in the country

805
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:29,952
I need loyalty cranenetwork and that were provided by Comcast to support them

806
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:32,000
Awesome if you want to build a better Mouse

807
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:33,280
Or something else

808
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:34,048
Where should

809
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:35,328
People go to find out more

810
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:36,096
About machine

811
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:40,960
You can start our website at machine chew.com is some great white papers there

812
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:43,520
Including our latest on dense Network studies

813
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:44,800
Tactical business level

814
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:46,336
Aquatica Services info

815
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:51,200
A conversion guys are resources to help on machineq including network coverage details

816
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:55,040
And how you can get service both in and outside of the Comcast footprint

817
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:07,584
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest is

818
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:08,864
Chris Harrison

819
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:09,888
Who is an assistant

820
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:10,656
Professor

821
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:11,680
I Carnegie Mellon

822
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:12,704
Horse with human

823
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:13,984
Computer interaction

824
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:15,776
So hi Chris how are you

825
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:17,568
I'm good thanks

826
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,616
I am super excited so

827
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:22,944
Last week we actually talked in the show about one of your projects the smart wallet

828
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,224
And I want you to stay

829
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,016
Quickly remind everyone

830
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:27,040
What it is

831
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:27,808
With a smartwatch

832
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:30,112
Well we realized

833
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:36,000
About a year ago that there's no one thing that is truly ubiquitous in and home exhausted and pretty much every

834
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:37,280
Human environment

835
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:38,048
Waltz

836
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:39,072
And the slightest

837
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:40,352
Incredibles

838
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:46,752
Computing technology we really haven't transformed the wine of the walls of today we're not surprised that you know a Roman or Greek

839
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:49,312
Babylonian

840
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:51,616
2000 years until we decided

841
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:53,664
Advanced technology

842
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,688
Wanda's waffles

843
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:55,968
Smart

844
00:33:56,224 --> 00:34:01,088
Got it and the end result was basically creating capacitive touch capability and why

845
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:01,856
False if I'm

846
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:02,624
Couldn't really

847
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,392
Basically

848
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:05,952
Well that's one part of it actually actually the product of

849
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:08,512
Two things one is it let us add touch

850
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:12,352
We might be able to use them that's for that gesture

851
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:17,472
Bi-Lo

852
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:19,008
Contractility on a wall

853
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:20,800
Entire wall surface

854
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:25,408
By splitting up our hands up and down on any part of the Walk

855
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:26,176
I sent this

856
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:32,320
The second part of imbued walls will be his face the antennas or electrodes just like you would have on it

857
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:33,088
The smartphone

858
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:36,928
Is we also realize that they're really good at sensing

859
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:39,744
The electrical noise that comes off of appliance

860
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,536
So everything that runs on electric

861
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:43,328
I'd like a little tiny radio station

862
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:45,120
Your microwave or your laptop

863
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,656
TV lamp

864
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:49,728
Everything emits a little bit of this electromagnetic noise

865
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,776
Start poncelet just what they do

866
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:54,592
And we found that our walls what we documented that

867
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:56,896
Really good at picking up the signals

868
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:57,920
And so we can actually

869
00:34:58,176 --> 00:35:00,224
Has machine learning or artificial intelligence

870
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,016
Look at those signals next to gas

871
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:04,064
What things must be on in your alarm

872
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:07,392
Tell if your walls are not only fencing or touches but also what

873
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:12,256
Are you making dinner or is your TV on and we can feed that

874
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:13,536
2 smartest

875
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:15,584
Things like Alexa or Google home

876
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,120
Let you know what's going on around

877
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:18,144
Okay

878
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,680
Where can I get back to that Concept in a

879
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:21,984
But you also have a smart

880
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:24,288
Talk to me about what that is

881
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:28,384
Yeah so the lab is really keen on trying to bring in tractor

882
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,432
New object

883
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:36,832
Activity

884
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:39,648
Thermostat

885
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:41,952
True ubiquitous and be everywhere

886
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:44,512
And paper is another one of these ubiquitous mediums

887
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:45,792
It has no inherent

888
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:53,216
You can digitize it by taking a photo of it up with your smartphone

889
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:55,008
But it isn't really truly attractive

890
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:57,824
And part of the same reason why

891
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:01,408
Have not received and paper

892
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,688
And they're very low cost

893
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:07,808
Hey I can make you a smart wall but it going to cost $2000000 upgrade your home

894
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:09,856
You're the interactive sheet of paper

895
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:12,928
$100 for those are no longer wall

896
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:13,696
Respect

897
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:18,816
Something different

898
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:21,888
Become interactive abused and thought of in the same way

899
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:24,960
Smarter versions of themselves very low cost

900
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:27,008
Especially paper which we literally

901
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:29,056
Looking through out after single-use

902
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:33,920
Something to be surfaces

903
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:34,944
Lacoste effect

904
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,784
So cheap that you can put on everything and not really think twice about

905
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,856
So when I saw your video of this my first thought was actually

906
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:42,880
Not cost

907
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:43,648
Holy cow

908
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:45,696
This turns something that's recyclable

909
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:47,744
And everywhere in two

910
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,512
What

911
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:50,304
Is it environmentally feasible to do this

912
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:51,584
Wechat out

913
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,888
I really hope that we can still keep those properties

914
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:55,680
Because if we made a paper

915
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:57,216
Going to keep forever

916
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:58,496
Give Essentia dismayed

917
00:36:58,752 --> 00:36:59,520
And not very good either

918
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:01,568
So we want to talk about

919
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:02,336
Paper

920
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:04,128
Underpass recyclability

921
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,432
Using a single-use

922
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:08,224
You get this

923
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:10,528
Screen paper touch-sensitive paper

924
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:13,344
And you can write a little bit the Sharpie and you don't feel bad about

925
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:15,136
Well obviously there's

926
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:15,904
More

927
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:18,976
I would respect recyclability

928
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:20,256
Requited

929
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:21,024
Recycle

930
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,816
As a regular sheet of paper

931
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,912
We assume that there are ways to recycle things that have been laminated

932
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:29,472
Packaging products

933
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:32,544
But have the ability to be recycled

934
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,360
Processing facilities better than code in a very similar

935
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:36,896
So I think the reason

936
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:38,432
Certainly more work to be done

937
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:39,456
Would using this approach

938
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:40,736
Could be compatible with

939
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:43,808
Recycling process and below cost

940
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:46,112
That you would truly enjoy that after single-use

941
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,952
And this reminded me mostly of Livescribe which I don't know how

942
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:50,976
How old you are how long you been

943
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:53,536
In the world of tech but it used to be a journal

944
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:54,304
Or

945
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,120
Paper that you used in conjunction with a Kinect

946
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:59,424
Obviously this doesn't require special care

947
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,192
Active pen

948
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:00,960
So I'm guessing

949
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:02,240
The smarts there were more

950
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:03,008
Independent

951
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:07,104
Right to this really two main approaches that have been used to do

952
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,152
Digital paper attracts paper

953
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:14,784
One is going to have a special Booker volume that you clip something to and it'll track the pain with

954
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,064
Sensors that are operating

955
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:18,880
Another person

956
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:21,440
Have a smart pen that has a Centre a camera built in

957
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,000
Keep track where the pain is writing

958
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:26,048
Virtua back in that you digitize

959
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,072
Things like letters

960
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:30,144
So this approach is different

961
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,424
The paper itself

962
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,960
SO2 having cannabis

963
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:36,800
Post-it notes

964
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:37,568
Cardboard

965
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:39,360
Printer sheets and loose leaf

966
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:40,640
Anything could work with Ara

967
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:43,456
Especially printed

968
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:44,992
I don't think you work with just fingers

969
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:48,064
Do we actually have a demo that we have in our demo reel

970
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:52,416
Paper can be interesting

971
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:55,744
Something special like a camera

972
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:57,536
In order for it to work

973
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,632
It is different ways of attacking sprouts

974
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:06,240
Alright and going back to lift me out the most about this

975
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:08,032
Yes I think was this idea

976
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:10,848
I have in my mind that this picture of walls in it

977
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:11,872
Connected homework

978
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:17,760
Are connected offices being a place where you shoot a screen are you shoot information that can't be conveyed

979
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:18,784
Sia audio

980
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,856
Maybe by some sort of ambient light kind of happened

981
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:23,904
So more complicated pieces Amanda

982
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:24,672
Information

983
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:26,464
When I saw the wall I was like oh

984
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:31,584
That is a totally different thing to do with the wall so I'm curious why focus on touch there

985
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:33,632
Play with you could you screen

986
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:39,008
Obviously Tire technology into a projector screen and projector that static

987
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:40,800
We can actually have a b a touch-sensitive

988
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:44,640
Read on your wall

989
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:46,432
Aesthetically

990
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:50,016
Gables wallet

991
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:53,344
To have this

992
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,624
Seamless

993
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,952
Experience but we don't want to have to

994
00:39:58,208 --> 00:39:58,976
Badger hole

995
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:00,512
Smart environment look like it.

996
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:01,280
Have to be from like

997
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:02,048
23rd century

998
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:05,632
Like the notion of keeping your house looking like it is

999
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:07,424
And a technology being somewhat invisible

1000
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,960
And when you walk up to that wall I need

1001
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:15,616
An okapi ubiquitous capability

1002
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:19,456
Subscribe to that sort of notion that Mark Weiser

1003
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,880
And we definitely subscribe to that belief

1004
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:28,928
Walls are greatest while this will be kept

1005
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:29,952
Haven't replaced

1006
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:33,024
Something crazy we want them to still be walls but the impudent with x

1007
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:36,352
This is a nice polite way to do that

1008
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:37,888
We can remove a lot of

1009
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:39,936
Milo's of Iota

1010
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:42,496
Smart smart wall now

1011
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:44,288
It's very much taking an iot

1012
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:45,056
Computer

1013
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:46,848
And then sticking it to the wall

1014
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:49,408
Exclusive WOD South being the thing that smart

1015
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:52,480
I liked it hopefully it will come with incredibly dirt resistant

1016
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:53,248
Fingerprint

1017
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:56,064
Yes we're leaving after the pain song

1018
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:58,880
It's this all that's awesome

1019
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:00,928
Second

1020
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:01,952
So let's

1021
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:04,512
Getting to this broader idea

1022
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:06,816
They say it's your special HCI

1023
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:08,864
You've done some projects that also deal with

1024
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:09,888
Connectivity in the

1025
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:11,936
Peterson Twitter

1026
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:14,496
Places so as we put Computing everywhere

1027
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:16,288
One of the things that

1028
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:17,312
I've been thinking about

1029
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:18,848
Is how do we make them smarter

1030
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:19,872
And

1031
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:22,688
For that I feel like we're going to need a lot of innovation

1032
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:23,712
Around providing

1033
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:31,392
I would love to get your thoughts about what are especially in the home or in the office environment what are kind of good examples or what do you

1034
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:33,440
Think makes for good examples of context

1035
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:34,208
The computers can

1036
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:36,256
Used to identify people or died in

1037
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:37,024
My actions

1038
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,304
All those things

1039
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:43,680
And I think you could bring now these devices that we say you're smart are really quite dumb and I think it's important for us

1040
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:50,336
I think about technology

1041
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:52,128
Sitting on your kitchen counter

1042
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,175
I think like an Alexa or Google

1043
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:57,247
Apple homepod is sitting on your kitchen countertop

1044
00:41:57,503 --> 00:41:58,783
And they have no idea there in a

1045
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:00,063
Let alone

1046
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,087
What you're doing in this

1047
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:02,879
I have no idea

1048
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:07,999
I teleported you into my kitchen to tell when I blindfolded you

1049
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:10,303
Listen to The Sounds going on around you

1050
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:12,863
You called be able to identify that you're in a kitchen

1051
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:18,239
And you probably won't even get a frying on a pandora cuz clinking of

1052
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:20,031
Silverware I'm running a blender

1053
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,311
Instantly now

1054
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:23,359
If you're in a kitchen and probably will be going

1055
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:26,943
Do we know that the signals are there and you don't need to stick

1056
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:27,967
Camera

1057
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:28,991
Kitchen to be able to do that

1058
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:31,039
Understanding

1059
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:33,599
Selectivity and right now these devices

1060
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:34,367
Ignore that

1061
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:36,671
What this wall project is doing it

1062
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:39,487
Getting one extra piece of information while using sound

1063
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:42,303
Electronic

1064
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:45,375
Emissions are coming from electrical Appliance

1065
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:48,703
Interference Re Mi because electrically driven

1066
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:49,727
Motors and

1067
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:51,519
Pictures of all kind of appliances like

1068
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:54,335
The keypad on your microwave a little bit of this

1069
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:57,663
Being very nice large antennas

1070
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:59,967
And we just happen to have in our environment can pick those up

1071
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:02,527
Feeding that to a local

1072
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:03,295
Smart device

1073
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:05,343
Whatever for my baby

1074
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:08,159
What's going on

1075
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:11,743
Don't for me like the great examples and we've got to put one of these antennas

1076
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:16,863
We can actually monitor not only when the laundry machine was on

1077
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,143
But also what kind of psycho

1078
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:21,983
So that I can have to get a proactive alert saying hey Chris

1079
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:27,103
Your laundry is done do you want to put in the dryer so that to me right now

1080
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:29,407
Oh really practically engaged

1081
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:30,943
Example of theme

1082
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:32,223
Actually happened

1083
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:33,759
If these devices knew more about the

1084
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:34,527
Context

1085
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:39,647
Just talking about what's going on in the room that the devices

1086
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:43,231
I have spent a lot of time thinking about this focused on

1087
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:44,255
Who is in the room

1088
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:48,351
But do you think that really matters and then that gets into some private all of these getting

1089
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:51,167
The Privacy implications but maybe that gets into more privacy

1090
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:53,727
All these have to be I think

1091
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:55,775
Privacy is going to go with haddock

1092
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:59,359
Consider the same time if you can deliver value to people

1093
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:01,151
Privacy

1094
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:01,919
NBA

1095
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:12,927
Invasive device

1096
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:14,207
Really could be list

1097
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:15,231
Everything that we do

1098
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:17,279
I guess we happily carry them around

1099
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:19,071
Because we extract so much value

1100
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:20,863
Everything has to realize

1101
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:23,679
Let's get that.

1102
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:28,031
So I think through this

1103
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:31,359
Sota technology to be successful as they have to really deliver on.

1104
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:34,687
Iot is having a problem right now

1105
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:35,711
If people are

1106
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:37,247
Immodest

1107
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:38,015
But if not

1108
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:41,599
Monetary outlay

1109
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:45,183
Mia formulation correct

1110
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:46,207
In this case

1111
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:47,999
Yes we are we can probably talk

1112
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:49,279
People that we can track

1113
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:51,327
August Appliance used in Navy that would have

1114
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:57,727
Reveal things that are they are the kids watching too much TV are they spending too much time on their computer

1115
00:44:58,239 --> 00:44:59,519
It is complicated

1116
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:01,567
And the more information of a give you advice

1117
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:07,967
Okay and then let's talk about knowing who's in the home or who's in the

1118
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:10,527
What is the value there.

1119
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:11,295
Do you think we could

1120
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:12,319
Look around

1121
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:15,135
Azizam in the best examples

1122
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:16,927
I'm going to a ventrac

1123
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:21,279
Target

1124
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:23,071
In the same way that your Netflix account

1125
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:25,887
All the shows that you get 5 * 1 * 2

1126
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:27,423
Definition of collaborative

1127
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:28,447
Leverage

1128
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:29,215
The taste

1129
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:33,823
Millions of people that find people that are sort of like you it's recommended shows

1130
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:35,615
Spotify

1131
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:38,175
Everything you can imagine if you're asking

1132
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:39,455
What's a virtual assistant

1133
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:41,503
Recommend

1134
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:47,135
I'm some ingredients are interested in the gredients

1135
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:48,671
That you only search for spicy food

1136
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:49,951
Whatever it may be

1137
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:51,743
Anyconnect you recommend this practice

1138
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:55,327
It may get the wrong message

1139
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:59,679
The tailoring know what I want to hear the news that plays news that I'm interested

1140
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:00,703
Topix

1141
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:03,519
I know this means

1142
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:07,359
Examples of personalization

1143
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:08,895
A real human

1144
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:09,919
What do f

1145
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:11,711
Obviously like the way that I like Mike

1146
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:16,063
Right now most these devices are pretty agnostic

1147
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:17,343
Who's asking

1148
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:20,415
But that's amazing

1149
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:21,951
Hummus

1150
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:26,047
System versus a lot of machines right now they're all

1151
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:27,071
Depersonalize

1152
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:28,351
Raq-c we probably

1153
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:30,143
Are very close to having a personalized

1154
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:30,911
Experience

1155
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:34,239
Okay and then my next question is which do you think we'll get to

1156
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:37,055
First you think we'll have environmental contacts

1157
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:37,823
Or person

1158
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:40,127
Personalization this much

1159
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:45,503
Because we can use this answers that are already on these devices

1160
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:49,087
At least do those products I know already do person

1161
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:51,647
If I have two Google homes in my house right now

1162
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:53,183
The call Mom

1163
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:54,463
My mom

1164
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:57,279
Depersonalize again

1165
00:46:57,535 --> 00:46:58,303
But obviously

1166
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:01,631
Prince Among Us

1167
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:04,703
Environments are

1168
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:05,471
Tricky book

1169
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:11,615
It's hard to do with sounds alone although it is possible we're doing some research on that now, there's so many things that happen

1170
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:12,895
You know in homes

1171
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:14,943
It's hard to do that really really robust

1172
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:21,599
Personalizing itself

1173
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:22,879
But you need to work on

1174
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:25,183
Car and you start breaking the experience and

1175
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:26,207
Complain

1176
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:27,743
There's more work to be done

1177
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:29,535
Environmental knowledge and how to

1178
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:31,071
Glabrous that in a very use

1179
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:34,143
What is it

1180
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:35,423
That doesn't know that you're

1181
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:42,335
People haven't really been able to articulate

1182
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:44,127
Sure and I think

1183
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:45,919
Data camel tie back to personal preference

1184
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:47,967
It's like when I'm cooking I want no interruptions

1185
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:49,759
Right

1186
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:50,783
Other people

1187
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:52,831
I guess it's social it's fun

1188
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:53,599
Okay

1189
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:55,391
Let's talk about the next

1190
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:56,671
Areas of things that your

1191
00:47:57,695 --> 00:47:59,487
I meant so I run the lab at Carnegie Mellon

1192
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:01,791
And collectively we're working together

1193
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:03,071
To the Future

1194
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:06,911
Prototyping the future at science fiction

1195
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:08,959
Battlefield

1196
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:13,311
Technologies in Italy

1197
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:14,591
Put them in front of real people

1198
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:15,615
Actually

1199
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:16,895
Gator experience

1200
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:18,943
You can't just describe a technology

1201
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:20,479
Would you like

1202
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:25,855
More often. That sounds pretty cool so we like to build everything and everything you seen her videos is very much real

1203
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:27,135
And we run

1204
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:28,415
Standard

1205
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:30,463
And so on

1206
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:31,487
Looking at the cost

1207
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:35,839
How about these boys would be a minute facture excetera recyclability talked about before

1208
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:37,631
Could I think about all these issues

1209
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:38,399
Holistically

1210
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:39,167
Agreed

1211
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:40,959
So what else are you guys work

1212
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:44,031
Each of my PhD students has

1213
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:48,127
Collectively the lab is very much

1214
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:50,687
Technologies and machine learning

1215
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:53,247
And it turns out those are very powerful combination

1216
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:54,271
Because tuman

1217
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:55,039
Signals

1218
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:56,063
Our very best

1219
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:57,855
Like right now in this call

1220
00:48:58,111 --> 00:48:58,879
I am

1221
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:00,415
Moving my hands around

1222
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:03,999
Testicular move my hands when I speak

1223
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:09,119
And if I had smart devices in this room looking at me

1224
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:11,167
And they're trying to decide whether not to activate

1225
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:15,007
Brighter or dimmer whatever it has to make a judgment

1226
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:16,799
That's a very lofty signal

1227
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:18,847
0 or 1.

1228
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:20,383
Mouse click timeout not click

1229
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:22,687
It's somewhere in between and humans are really good

1230
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:23,967
Resolving an ambiguity

1231
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:24,991
Traditionally

1232
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:27,295
And machine learning is this

1233
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:28,319
Really powerful

1234
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:31,135
Perfectly well suited tool that we can resolve

1235
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:32,159
Very complex

1236
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:34,975
Innocent

1237
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:38,559
Statistically viable results we combined

1238
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:39,327
Sensor data

1239
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:40,607
And machine learning

1240
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:42,655
Build new and novel and crack

1241
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:44,959
In terms of new resources

1242
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:46,495
We are still doing a lot with

1243
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:47,263
On body

1244
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:49,823
Computing for the notion that we won't have small

1245
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:51,871
Computers that have big

1246
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:58,015
We have been with no screen potentially and things like projection or augmented reality to co-op

1247
00:49:58,271 --> 00:50:00,319
Space from the environment or even from the body

1248
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:03,135
A SmartWatch with that

1249
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:07,487
Pathetically tiny screen which means that you can't use it and then really kind of fundamental

1250
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:09,279
What happens that attractive experience

1251
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:10,559
Spilled Out on your body

1252
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:14,399
A computer which is many times larger than a knife

1253
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:16,703
Ultimate change

1254
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:18,751
Our point of view point on wearables

1255
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:27,711
Also there's another names red looking at you if we are going to have things like wearable sitting on her arm

1256
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:29,503
Just acting like

1257
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:30,271
Comma before that

1258
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:33,343
Voice Assistant speaker

1259
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:36,927
New ideas in the kitchen level of what you're doing in the kitchen

1260
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:38,719
In the same way I look at smartwatch

1261
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:40,767
Right there on the very end

1262
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:42,047
Position right there on your wrist

1263
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:44,095
I got to have no idea with your hands

1264
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:46,143
Arguing but seems like a huge mess.

1265
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:48,447
Theories of Technology

1266
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:54,591
Smartwatch knows not only what you're grabbing object

1267
00:50:56,127 --> 00:51:00,735
Together we can get this really rich context

1268
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:04,575
I like it although I'm not looking forward to the battle for my wall or

1269
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:06,111
Alright Chris

1270
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:07,903
Thank you so much for coming on

1271
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:15,839
That's it for this week thanks so much for listening and remember if you'd like more iot news

1272
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:19,679
Sign up for my newsletter and Stacey on iot

1273
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:23,519
Will see you next week
