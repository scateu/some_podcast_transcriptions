I am traveling this week so if there's any weird issues they're probably on my end

5
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:22,272
Especially any just general

6
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:23,040
Weirdness

7
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:23,808
So

8
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:25,856
Let's get this party started

9
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:27,392
This week we are going to

10
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:30,464
To cover some great stuff such as the Philips Hue bulbs

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,488
Were they hacked

12
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:32,512
Buy drones

13
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:36,096

14
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:39,680
Nest is appliances we got thread

00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:41,216
Going Enterprise

16
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:44,544
We have some cool products to review and talk about

17
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,640
And we also are going to just scare the pants right off

18
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:51,968
With the question of is the US ready to attack

19
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:53,248
Russia

20
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:54,784
Using the bus cyber

21
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:58,368
So the Cyber the Cyber I couldn't say Cyber attack

22
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:01,440
Directory

23
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:04,512

Which makes the Almond router

28
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:17,056
And that is going to be a fun interview

29
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:18,080
Talking about

30
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:24,480
The future of the Smart Home & Security and yes router said that's that's more than a router

31
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:29,088
But I'm sure you guys going to talk about that we will talk about that and I actually have

32
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:31,904
An almond router that I have not set up yet because I haven't been

33
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:32,672
In home

34
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:33,440
But

35
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:34,976
In a coming show

36
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:39,840
So awesome let's quickly go to a word from our

37
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:40,608
Sponsor

This is

39
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,192
Samsung

40
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:50,592
Buick manufacturer service provider looking for the fastest path to enterprise-grade secure interoperable

41
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:56,992
An intelligent iot based products and services Samsung artik Smart iot platform

42

44
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:13,632
Alright it before we go to the show I'm going to do my own little plug for me which is I have a newsletter

45
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:14,912

You should totally sign up at Stacey on iot

48
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,592
Dot-com

49
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:24,384
Kevin said that but I don't know if he

50
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,152
Actually reads it

51
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:26,944
Eye to eye to

52
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,712
I love you

53
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,760
Alright so let's get started

54
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:31,040
Philips Hue

55
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,320
Big news

56
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,088
Was it this week

57
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,952
Maybe it was last week I think right after we recorded the

58
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:38,720
Pirate show

59
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:41,792
Yes we recorded early last week we're recording a little early this week

60
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:43,840
Will get you there

61
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:47,424
All right so what happened is actually Kevin you want to tell him what happen

62
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,960
Because it's pretty

63
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:52,032
It's almost scary but I should preface the story by saying it

64
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,312
It was more of a

65
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:57,152
Demonstration that anything else so don't panic as I tell you that

66
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:59,712
A drone was used to hack Philips

67
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:06,112
Hue bulbs and the did Supreme about 450 meters or a thousand feet away which is

68
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:08,416
It really is scary out on the surface of it

69
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:13,792
What happened was a vulnerability I believe in the zigbee

70
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,584
Protocol or stack

71
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,448
Was found by some researchers they did the right thing they contact a Philips Hue

72
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,472
Over the summer

73
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:27,872
And I believe last month Philips Hue actually put a firmware patch out to address the

74
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:28,640
Tissue

75
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:31,968
However having said all that the demonstration still happened

76
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,272
And folks were able to

77
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:38,368
Take control a Philips Hue bulbs they they injected some new firmware

78
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,904
Into I guess the hue

79
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,928
Bridge

80
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:43,232
And whatever like send SOS message

81
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:46,304
From a drone through the Philips Hue bulbs

82
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:48,864
This coming on the heels of

83
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,888
The Mirai botnet

84
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,424
Which is still ongoing

85
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,448
We shouldn't say like

86
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:53,728
Like that's done

87
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:54,496
Cuz it's not

88
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:58,080
And actually that's a bigger worry because they have all of these devices out there

89
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:04,992
Recalling and that's going to be a hassle and a half

90
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:05,760
But not all of them

91
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,040
Not all of them

92
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:08,576
Who knows

93
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,856
Yep unplugged

94
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,136
Unplugem

95
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,928
Buy new stuff

96
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:13,696
Sorry

97
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:16,256
I mean that's a terrible thing to say but it is

98
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:19,583
Baby iot devices need a kill command a kill switch

99
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:20,607
Hilton

100
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,191
Just thinking out loud

101
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,215
I like it

102
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:29,311
There has actually been some researchers talked about doing something

103
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,079
The do-gooder

104
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:31,359
Which

105
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:36,223
They're testing a research environment but what it does is it automatically goes in and changes the password

106
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,271
Now the downside is

107
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,831
That's like an automated bot so

108
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:46,207
What would happen if your password on your infected device that you may or may not know is actually infected with suddenly change it

109
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,487
You couldn't get to it anymore

110
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,559
So that

111
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:51,839
Probably

112
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:52,863
Bad idea

113
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,655
Killswitch

114
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,703
Yeah

115
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,727
Yeah

116
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,055
There's iot security people

117
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,847
I get away glad this is happy

118
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:03,871
Because people are

119
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:04,639
Are now paying a

120
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,407
Attention to it

121
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,687
So

122
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:12,063
What is disconcerting is there so few Avenue still for fixing it

123
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,087
So

124
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,879
I would focus on

125
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:18,719
A building secure products but be thinking about how you

126
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,511
How you can fix it

127
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,559
Over the air updates are like the best option

128
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,119
Mitigating red distributed

129
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,167
A solution is very very challenging

130
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,191
It is

131
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:28,959
But

132
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:31,263
Like that was really helpful

133
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,823
Security researchers pay attention

134
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:34,847
So

135
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:37,407
We don't have a solution for keeping an eye on

136
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,943
People who are smarter than we are

137
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,479
Cruising Solutions so

138
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:41,503
Hopefully

139
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,551
Hopefully we'll bring you some interesting stuff

140
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:45,855
In the meantime

141
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,391
I have been playing with

142
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:48,927
Google home

143
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,463
My

144
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:53,023
Google home is the Amazon Echo light

145
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,559
Speaker device that you

146
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:56,607
You talk to personal assistant speaker

147
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,655
And I can say

148
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,959
Fit at UK Monday

149
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:01,983
And this is Tuesday

150
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,519
And I left town so

151
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,543
I did not bring it with me

152
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,335
Said it was super easy

153
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,871
It took you know maybe

154
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:10,175
5 minutes and that includes it's time to

155
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:14,783
Then I tested it it sounds good

156
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,599
I don't know if it sounds better than the echo in all honesty some

157
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:21,951
People were saying that jury's out on that I'm seeing mixed comments on that

158
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:25,023
Bass pretty well

159
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:27,071
I think a lot of things

160
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:27,839
Trouble

161
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:30,655
The higher pitches and Dad

162
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:31,679
Lost

163
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:35,007
Maybe it depends on what

164
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,031
Kind of music you listen to

165
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,079
Google home

166
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,615
I did encounter

167
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,383
An issue

168
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:43,711
And it feels like it might be like a Stacy

169
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:46,783
Only issue but I'm going to tell you about it because there is

170
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,343
The customer help portion of this which I was kind of

171
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,391
Not as impressed by

172
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,415
So

173
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:56,511
I was able to connect my Nest thermostat and that integration worked was very easy

174
00:06:57,023 --> 00:07:03,167
I then went to connect my Philips Hue Lights because if my husband can't turn on the lights with his voice he feels like my tire job is worth

175
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:11,871
Dark in here against a serious they say I have to turn it on for the switch

176
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:14,431
Oh that was a terrible impression of my husband

177
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:17,247
Nobody tell him

178
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,783
So

179
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:20,575
It didn't connect

180
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:26,975
And so then I went to the troubleshooting page it showed me automatically the troubleshooting page but it was pretty basic it was like Harold

181
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:29,023
Are they on the same I find it

182
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,583
And is your Google home

183
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,351
I was like

184
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:34,143
Just all of these things

185
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:37,471
And then was a try again and it didn't work

186
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,263
So

187
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,543
I done went to the

188
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:46,431
Bigger troubleshooting page which basically had me do all those things again and then it was like okay reboot both devices

189
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:47,455
And then

190
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,759
I did that and it still didn't work

191
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,039
And I never like

192
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:58,463
Okay enjoy the troubleshooting got it so there's a there's a phone number there's online chat

193
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:02,303
Do you can call I did notice that Google does not make the phone number like

194
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:05,887
Easy to click you can just press the phone number to call you after like cutting

195
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:06,911
Pasting to make a call

196
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,447
What's odd

197
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:10,495
I know I was kind of like dude Google

198
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:12,799
Clearly don't be calling you

199
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:14,591
So

200
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:18,943
I spend about half an hour on the phone she the customer service agent was very polite

201
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:22,015
Took me through all the same steps that

202
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,039
Weather

203
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:23,807
Faceit taken

204
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:27,647
And after that she she had to call in like

205
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:28,927
Extra troops

206
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:35,583
And at no point in time did I get that they didn't ask me what I felt were probably some basic questions like

207
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,607
Hey

208
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,143
What kind of Wi-Fi router

209
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:38,911
Using

210
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:41,727
They did ask me what kind of phone I was using but that was just a chic

211
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:42,495
You could tell me where to go

212
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,263
Go to press the button

213
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,287
So

214
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:47,359
I found online someone said that they actually swapped

215
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:49,151
From they were using Firefox

216
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:52,991
And swap to the Chrome as their default browser to do this connection

217
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,783
And he said that made

218
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,831
So I use Adblock

219
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:57,855
Browser on my

220
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,391
And so

221
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:03,487
I'm going when I get back in town I'm going to swap over to

222
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,815
Chrome and see if that works

223
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,399
But Google when they decided they couldn't help me

224
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:15,007
They're like well we've escalated it in within 24 to 48 hours will send

225
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,335
So that's where I am

226
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,895
I didn't think it was the best experience

227
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,431
It was a terrible

228
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:27,807
But I didn't feel like the Google if you called Google you would get anything other than

229
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,343
What you would get online anyway

230
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:34,719
Yeah that's what it sounds like it sounds like the same process just now with a purse instead of a computer

231
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,535
Which is good for people who don't like following instructions

232
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,839
Computer but for me it was super frustrating

233
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:44,447
Well yeah because you know what you're doing and then you've already been to the types of warrants

234
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:47,519
I'm surprised that they didn't ask for or

235
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:52,895
Will ask for permission I pull a log from the Google home device

236
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:55,199
This this I thought was interesting so

237
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,991
Google home it said

238
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,783
Send feedback so I was like

239
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,575
Okay g

240
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:01,599
Ecology

241
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,879
Okay g

242
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:05,439
Send feedback it was like what is the problem

243
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:08,255
And then I was like I can't connect my Philips Hue Lights

244
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,071
It sent it

245
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,351
But I don't know what happened

246
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:16,703
So I don't know if that included lawsuit or is that was just like me telling it I just

247
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,823
Yeah that's that's swell

248
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:25,151
Without knowing what was sent to me that's kind of not a good experience either

249
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,431
It should be.

250
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:32,319
Free Christian clear so I forgot

251
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,111
But not in that division

252
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,135
Right at school

253
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:41,023
And I did not order a Google home as of yet because pink is not a partner in my stuff is a twink

254
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,839
You talked about maybe work around a little bit later in the show

255
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,887
Alright so

256
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:48,959
Wait wait one quick question

257
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,751
I can treat you for what

258
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,031
A lot of people were

259
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:54,591
Curious what would happen if you were to say the

260
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:56,895
Keyword for Google home

261
00:10:57,151 --> 00:11:01,759
When your phone is nearby and you have voice detection on the phone why did that

262
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:06,111
And I'm betting I'm hoping that it worked only on one device not both

263
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:09,951
It did so both devices were like your listing

264
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:13,023
And then the message on your phone screen is

265
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:15,327
What is it say it said

266
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,119
Answering on another device

267
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,655
And then the home

268
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,423
Would answer

269
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:20,703
Perfect

270
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,263
Alright so

271
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:30,943
Two Nest they did last week and announcement all about new appliances they work with so they

272
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,735
Have a list

273
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:35,807
Some of these we actually already knew about and I just don't know if they

274
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:41,183
Existed before this but Whirlpool it tells your dishwasher to start automatically when you leave the house

275
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:41,951
Or

276
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,231
Have your washer clip your

277
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,767
Clothes fresh until you get home

278
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,303
Jenn-Air

279
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,327
Which is the oven

280
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,423
If you forget your oven or stove is on and Nest says hey she's not home

281
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:54,751
You can get a notification that says by the way you left your oven on

282
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,031
Turn that off

283
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,079
Yes please

284
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:00,639
Yes well maybe not maybe a preheating while you go in

285
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:03,455
Get something dangerous

286
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,735
What's an oven

287
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:07,551
Okay this is what I'll tell you guys in my house

288
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,319
Princetown

289
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:10,367
So ream is another one

290
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,391
And

291
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:12,671
Hayward

292
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,695
Oh this is a pool

293
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:14,719
Kleenex

294
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:19,839
Yeah your non-essential pool appliances

295
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:24,191
To turn off during energy rush hour or demand response active

296
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,215
So

297
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:26,495
Nice

298
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:29,567
And then Samsung has your powerbot vacuum

299
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,359
It can turn on when you're not home

300
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:37,247
That's actually bad for me because by actually it's not a Samsung powerbot but my robot always gets stuck

301
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,551
Its Spots and we could only vacuum

302
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:42,879
Kind of counterfeit service

303
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,415
It does

304
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,463
All of these things

305
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:48,255
Seemed pretty cool Kevin Williamson

306
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,047
I love it I love it

307
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:53,375
We need more this more more more because

308
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:56,703
Typically and I know it's early in the whole Smart Home

309
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:57,983
Market

310
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,263
For a lot of people

311
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:05,919
A lot of things that are coming to Market a lot of products just replace an existing interface you know let's use voice instead of a light switch

312
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:11,551
Did the real benefit is when you start tying these things intelligently together

313
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,087
Which is what is happening here

314
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:16,415
Yeah I don't want to be home when my Robot vacuum is vaca

315
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,695
You know because

316
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:19,231
I don't need to be there for example

317
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:19,999
Crate

318
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:23,327
That's known as I'm not there fire up the robot go clean

319
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,119
Same with the other stove examples

320
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,167
Perfect music great safety feature

321
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:29,215
So I I want to see

322
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:32,543
So so much more of this cuz really we don't have Smart Homes yet

323
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,567
We have a lot of

324
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,615
A lot of smart

325
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:36,383
Devices that

326
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,407
Still don't really

327
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,687
Too much together

328
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:39,967
Yes we need

329
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:41,759
Yes

330
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,063
More give me more

331
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:50,975
More connections for Kevin in actually in a couple of weeks we are going to do a holiday-themed show that's going to talk about

332
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:55,327
Cool things that we have connected and things that you guys might find useful

333
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:01,983
So if you guys have done any cool connections with your hubs or things like that that you want to share that are like totally long

334
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:02,751
Until

335
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:06,079
Send info at iot podcast

336
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,103
DACA

337
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,407
Thread now onto thread

338
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:11,455
So last week

339
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,223
Thread group

340
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:15,551
Which manages the thread Wireless protocol for you guys that

341
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:19,903
You don't keep your wireless protocols memorize this is like a mesh

342
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:20,671
Network

343
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:24,255
Low-power mesh Network that also supports IPv6 which means

344
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,279
Go Direct

345
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,071
So they said

346
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,863
We are not just for the Smart Home

347
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,399
And they introduced some

348
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:33,727
Enterprise they said they were going to work on Enterprise use cases for lighting

349
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,263
And some other

350
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:36,799
Stop

351
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:37,823
So

352
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,591
They

353
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,127
Will start adding

354
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:40,895
Kind of

355
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:46,015
Extensions to the thread protocol that let people handle like security and Authentication

356
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,295
At all these kind of

357
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:49,599
Bigger subnets of thread devices that you

358
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:50,367
Can manage

359
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,647
So all of that is coming

360
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:52,927
And

361
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,207
Red is also

362
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,743
Good arm and

363
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:56,767
Other

364
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,559
Companies are

365
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:02,655
Producing radios that will basically let you run

366
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:04,703
Red and Bluetooth

367
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,983
On the same radio

368
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:09,311
Which is really interesting I said this was going to happen a while back but

369
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:11,103
It is actually going to happen

370
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:17,759
And the thinking there is maybe use Bluetooth to connect your thread devices to your phone for examples

371
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:19,807
Making the connection process easier

372
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,879
But I would be excited to see like a thread light bulb

373
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,927
Butterfinger also uses Bluetooth

374
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:27,743
And then you can get presence detection over your mesh

375
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,023
Lightning Network

376
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,047
How awesome would that be

377
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:35,935
And then could you theoretically access that light remotely without a hub

378
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:40,287
Yeah directions to the web

379
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,335
Yeah actually I guess you could

380
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:43,871
I'm thinking the cat

381
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:44,639
Yeah

382
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:46,431
Oh but you fancy man

383
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,735
Anyway to get rid of a Hayabusa

384
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:51,551
Teddy day I can get rid of a big breakfast

385
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:52,575
Will stay tuned for the

386
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,599
Scarify talk

387
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:56,415
All right so that's a threat news

388
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:58,207
Here we're going to get into

389
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:03,071
Actually let's talk about we've got some product stuff first but let's talk about if this then that

390
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:03,839
Before we get in

391
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:05,119
Because

392
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,399
It just feels better

393
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,423
So

394
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,727
If this then that one of our favorite

395
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,007
Averitt

396
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:12,543
Bobby holik

397
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,847
Connectable services

398
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,127
Flexible service

399
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:18,431
I don't know if that's

400
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,223
They changed

401
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:20,991
Their recipe

402
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:21,759
Keys to a

403
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:25,599
And this is a nomenclature thing they also integrated the

404
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:26,367
Baidu

405
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,415
I was like I can't

406
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,439
Remember what all these apps were

407
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:30,975
The integrated those

408
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:32,767
All back into the app so that's all

409
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,303
Bond

410
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:37,887
Which is fine you know I had to do I had a couple do apps and I almost never

411
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:39,679
Cuz I like physical buttons

412
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,239
Call me crazy

413
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:43,775
Basically

414
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:44,799
To create

415
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,847
Aplets it's the same process

416
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,383
Pretty easy

417
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:51,711
What we did notice there we're playing around

418
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:53,247
With a phenomenon

419
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:54,271
Is

420
00:16:54,527 --> 00:17:00,671
Did the Google assistant is a channel and that works on your pixel phone or your Google home device

421
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:07,327
I'm very happy with by this this discovery this morning because I did not buy a home

422
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:13,727
Because what's a represented by Necco at first because it didn't support what I needed to support my case wink

423
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:16,031
However in doing some quick

424
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:18,335
Playing around right before the show

425
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:20,895
Yeah I will be able to create a

426
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:21,663
Applets

427
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:22,687
Using

428
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:26,271
The Google Assistant Channel and my wink shortcuts

429
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:28,063
I don't think it's working quite

430
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,599
Right to say that I think it's

431
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:33,439
Speakers having issues with my wink Hub at the moment so I'll keep playing with that but

432
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,719
I can now

433
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,743
Theoretically

434
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:42,143
Control things through the Google assistant app on my pixel and order if I buy a Google home

435
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:45,727
Yes and I will go home and test this out to sow

436
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,519
If you're going to try this out

437
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:49,311
It also actually means

438
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:51,871
Theoretically your Google home could also control

439
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:53,407
WeMo or

440
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,455
There's so many issues

441
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:57,759
Controllable things out there your skybell

442
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:58,527
Sure

443
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,831
Like so much

444
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:06,975
Now if you want to connect it to your wink Hub you already need to have a shortcut ready for what you want to do which is an art

445
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,767
You just go create shortcut

446
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,303
Say what you want to have happen

447
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,095
It happens

448
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:15,679
You also have to do to if you want your lights on

449
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,447
That's one command

450
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,727
And if you want your lights off

451
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:19,519
That's another command so you've got to

452
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,543
Create all of that

453
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:24,639
So just keep on short that's her both of those so

454
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:27,711
So you could end up with a long list of shortcuts

455
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,479
But

456
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:30,527
If you really want to make your Google home

457
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:31,807
Uno programmable

458
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:36,671
And I imagine because if this and that has a lot of latency you're also going to deal with latency but

459
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:41,023
It still might be fun so I'm going to try it will let you know next week

460
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,071
I would do it right now but

461
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,607
By golly Avenue

462
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:48,191
It's it's a good alternative until

463
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:50,495
Petition Partners come onto the whole Google

464
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:52,031
Homemade lights

465
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,311
Yes and

466
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,591
Let's just say this rate

467
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,383
Shofar

468
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:58,431
Amazon Echo is still

469
00:18:58,943 --> 00:18:59,455
Chilling in my house

470
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:06,623
I love Google Assistant I think asking it questions is nice but like if I were going to still put everything around me

471
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,159
My house at still go with Amazon

472
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:10,719
Mohr partners

473
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:12,511
Mohr partners

474
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:14,303
Will for me the goal is to smart

475
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:16,607
If your goal is to access like

476
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:18,143
Massive Google

477
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,935
Intelligence then

478
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:22,495
I can see where the home comes in handy

479
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:25,823
I'm thinking actually I'll put I get a lot of questions in the shower

480
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:27,615
A lot of things coming to my brain

481
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:29,663
Put that in my bathroom

482
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:31,967
Can just ask random questions

483
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:36,831
Instant that looks like an air freshener it's like perfectly bathroom yes no one will know

484
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:39,391
Alrighty

485
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:40,415
So

486
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:42,975
Let's go into Fun exciting

487
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:44,511
Products

488
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:50,399
Takis this is something that occasionally people ask me about so there was a product while that

489
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,423
Call Troy email

490
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:53,727
And what it was it is apparent

491
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:56,031
Does a wifi-connected mailbox fit

492
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,567
Kids can basically

493
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:58,847
Talk to

494
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:04,991
Parents could leave messages in the toymail app and then the kids could play it back on the little mailbox

495
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:08,063
And how cute is that so parents who travel a lot

496
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,343
They can connect to

497
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,111
Communicate with her

498
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:11,903
While the parents at work

499
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:13,951
Share with the kid

500
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,743
Sota

501
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:18,047
I went away but now there is a

502
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:18,815
Plush

503
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:19,583
Animal

504
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,375
Call the toymail talkie

505
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,911
Basically it's

506
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:25,727
You exchanged voicemails with your kids

507
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:26,495
So

508
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:29,055
You can use your phone and send it to the toy

509
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:34,687
So I would send it to my daughter for example or my daughter could push a button on the back of the Taki to say something to me

510
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:36,479
Or to another kids talk

511
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:37,759
So

512
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:39,807
It's $50

513
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:43,647
I really want to get one of these because I love like

514
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,951
I love the idea of while I'm gone

515
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:46,719
Communicate

516
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:48,511
I think it's fine

517
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:49,791
So

518
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:52,607
And I'm putting it in a toy to cute implementation

519
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,751
The plushie is actually kind of cool because

520
00:20:59,007 --> 00:20:59,519
It's kind of a

521
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:01,567
Hello local

522
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:02,335
What that's not a word

523
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:03,359
Anyway

524
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:08,223
Able to be cuddled thank you thank you

525
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,783
That is available

526
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,599
Online and it's available at beta

527
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,367
So

528
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:16,416
Speaking of beta

529
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:19,488
This is the store I went to last week in Palo Alto that had all these Gadget

530
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:22,304
I bought a crazy silly device

531
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,840
And I'm going to tell you about it

532
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:24,608
Because

533
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:26,912
Cuz

534
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:29,472
Country Cat

535
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,520
So I would advise

536
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:32,288
Call the spire

537
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:35,616
And if tracks your respiration

538
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:36,896
2

539
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:39,968
Tell you if you are tense, murrin

540
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:42,528
Focus it also acts as an activity tracker

541
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,344
So this is a $99

542
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:49,952
Alternative activity tracker it's based on Research from Stanford

543
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,000
So it feels

544
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:53,024
Scientific

545
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:56,096
And they also offer you meditations

546
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:59,680
In the app so the goal is to get you to like learn how to be more

547
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,984
And I thought it would be good for me

548
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:04,032
Because I am super tents

549
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,080
And lo and behold

550
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:08,128
The app does register that it's like

551
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:14,528
You have had 298 tents minutes today

552
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:20,160
It's nice it is not a need to have because I am so focused on being mindful

553
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:23,232
I thought it'd be good for me and it has kind of helped with that

554
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:25,792
I'm still being through the tutorials that are helping

555
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:26,816
Can you breathe better

556
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:27,840
So

557
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,120
And I will see if I'm more

558
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:30,144
Peace

559
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:35,520
Is it a necessary to buy snow and then part of me feels like God I got so much crap stuck on me in the world

560
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:39,872
Ifitness tracker I've got this thing I've got a ring that you have

561
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:40,640
My phone

562
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:44,992
You know if you're trying to be mine

563
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,272
This is kind of fun

564
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,600
So it looks like this device Clips on

565
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:53,440
To you it was like a like a like a belt clip

566
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:59,840
It has to clip onto you and touch your skin so the device actually has to face inward

567
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:02,912
If your girl that means like in your bra like

568
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:03,936
Restaurant

569
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:04,960
Somewhere

570
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:07,008
Or in your pants like

571
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,288
Attached to your

572
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,568
Facing in on you

573
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:11,872
It's Raining Tacos

574
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:15,200
In this clip my God you guys this clip is so strong

575
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:16,736
I'm I'm constantly wrestling

576
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,600
What is high quality

577
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:24,160
Materials it looks like a little Stone

578
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:25,440
Clippers again

579
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,208
Fairy

580
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,000
Aries Spears

581
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:28,768
Hefty

582
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:30,560
And that it's got a wireless charger

583
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:34,656
So you just set it on the charger it vibrates to say like

584
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:35,936
Sweet

585
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:36,960
And that's it

586
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:38,240
So

587
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:41,056
If you're if you're looking for something like this

588
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:42,592
It does work

589
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:45,920
But you'd have to be really looking for something

590
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:46,688
Like us

591
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:53,088
It's interesting because it reminds you something that was just rolled out with the Apple Watch 2 and Ice apples new breathe

592
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,624
The app on the watch

593
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,392
Now

594
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:57,184
I don't use it because I'm not

595
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:00,512
One more thing. To deal with during the day but

596
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:04,096
I don't know that monitors your breathing but I know that reminds you to

597
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:06,912
Take time and breathe and walk you through

598
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:11,008
Deep breathing every symptom times a day I turn the function off but

599
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:13,568
I don't think it matters which this would

600
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,896
Yes so if you do buy it

601
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:18,944
The app has to be on

602
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:19,968
2 track

603
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:21,504
Into sync with

604
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:22,784
Spirestone

605
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:25,088
Used to consider device

606
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:27,648
So if you and it only stores like 6 hours

607
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,440
So

608
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:31,232
Yeah that's that is actually something

609
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:34,304
Here's a fun Kickstarter

610
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,840
This is The Big C

611
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,912
I love this because I like gestures in

612
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,984
They showed it to me in a kitchen and I was sold

613
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,264
Put on this ID

614
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,568
That's all you have to do

615
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:49,152
Get this in the kitchen and you can celebrate

616
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,456
Is it tiny sensor

617
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:52,992
Census year

618
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:56,832
Hand gestures in the air and commands whatever device you program it to

619
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,112
So

620
00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,648
It works with

621
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,184
If this then that

622
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:01,952
It works with

623
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:04,512
Music and lighting control GoPros

624
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:05,536
Your phone

625
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:08,608
You can even put it in your car in like gesture in York

626
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:10,400
Car that's actually a really interesting use

627
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:11,936
Or on your bike

628
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:13,216
You could use it on your bike

629
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:14,240
Control your GoPro

630
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:15,776
Where to get

631
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:17,312
Directions

632
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:21,408
I'm intrigued by this and it's $80 for one

633
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:25,760
I think it's $140 for a package of two when the kickstarter is met its goal

634
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:29,088
The estimated delivery is March of 2017

635
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:30,368
So

636
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:32,160
I probably won't buy it on the kickstarter

637
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,512
I might buy one

638
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:42,144
I appreciate what they're trying to do here

639
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:42,912
And

640
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:45,472
Gestures are not easy and you have to have

641
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:48,544
The device work with a lot of other devices

642
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:49,824
Value

643
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,640
I wonder how difficult it is to like

644
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:54,432
Swap the usage

645
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:59,808
For that cyclists say at your in the kitchen you want hands-free scrolling on your iPad they show that ended MO

646
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,856
So you're needing go and

647
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:03,648
You don't touch screen CD

648
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:04,416
Swipe

649
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:06,208
Yeah over this device grape

650
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:07,232
But then

651
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:10,304
What do you do when you want to act like now change it over to

652
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:11,840
Dimming lights

653
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:12,864
But you gotta

654
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,936
I guess there's an app and you have to tell it now you're going to do this one

655
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:18,496
I would think

656
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:21,824
Cuz it's can do a lot of different things and work with a lot of products

657
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,848
Switch is awesome

658
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,128
I just wonder

659
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:28,480
I think you're going to need

660
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,296
Yeah so I did

661
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:33,088
Have to

662
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:33,856
Define what

663
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:35,904
Each of them

664
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:40,000
Now they did say to reduce latency they've got a direct integration with lifx

665
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,024
Q which is a

666
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:44,352
And the battery on this thing lasts about a month

667
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:45,888
And so

668
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,168
Cuz you do have to charge it

669
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:50,240
Yeah so that's what we know on this and

670
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:52,800
I can't wait till I actually want to see it

671
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:54,336
So

672
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:55,616
Looks cool

673
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:56,384
It does

674
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:57,408
Okay

675
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,712
Kevin do you want to talk about Russian cyber attacks

676
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:05,856
What does Cyber more of the cyber yasso

677
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:09,184
Okay everybody if

678
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,536
Russia interferes with the US election the US government is already too

679
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:15,584
Pushback using the cyber

680
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,888
That's crazy NBC News who says that

681
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,704
The US military hackers have

682
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:26,336
Unable to penetrate Russia's electric grid Telecom networks and the kremlin's command systems

683
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:27,616
I don't know

684
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:32,992
This is kind of scary actually I don't know if this is hype this is just posturing this is

685
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:37,088
It's true it's scary no matter which of those scenarios it really is

686
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,184
You know it is it opens up a whole new world of like

687
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:44,256
A Whole New World

688
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:45,280
But not a good

689
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:46,816
Not not the kind of

690
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:51,168
Thinking Out Loud here do you think it's a question of

691
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:54,752
When there's an attack on a mass scale attack on the cyber

692
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:56,032
Versus

693
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:56,800
If

694
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:58,592
So like emasculata Connor

695
00:27:58,848 --> 00:27:59,616
Physical infrastructure

696
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:02,688
Yeah let's say by let's a state-sponsored

697
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:03,968
Yes

698
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,016
Actually Kevin it's already happened

699
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:08,832
Back in March 2016

700
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,904
The FBI put it out at the justice department

701
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:14,208
Claims that Iran had attacked

702
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:17,792
Us infrastructure online by infiltrating the

703
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:19,072
Shiraz controls

704
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:21,376
Of a damn that was 25 miles north of

705
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,144
New York City

706
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:23,424
So

707
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:25,728
The point here is

708
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:26,752
Not if

709
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:28,032
Not win but

710
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:29,568
I guess what

711
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:31,872
What's next

712
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:35,456
What will be the next Target when and what do we do

713
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:37,248
Annette that seriously concerning

714
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:41,088
Yes so in the reason why it actually didn't

715
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,112
Cause

716
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:43,136
Damage

717
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:47,232
Is because the physical infrastructure was unable to actually open on

718
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:49,024
So

719
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:51,328
In that instance

720
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:53,888
Free pick up at Target

721
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:55,424
Latin for sure

722
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:56,704
So

723
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,984
But yes if you have

724
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,520
I mean this

725
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:01,568
Again underlies the importance of

726
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,896
Protecting these assets and think about security

727
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:06,944
All the time in

728
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:07,968
I would say

729
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:09,760
Thinking about security

730
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:13,088
Not as something that could ever really be finished

731
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:16,160
That is that is a really big issue that

732
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:17,696
We just be like

733
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:18,464
There is no secure

734
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:20,768
Thoroughly products that

735
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:22,048
Contact yet

736
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,120
In that world view how do you change your mindset

737
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,472
Figure out updates you figure outfit like stopgaps like

738
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:31,264
If this goes down

739
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:32,800
What's your next backup

740
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:36,896
Especially when we're talking about actuators like things that actually make stuff

741
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:39,456
So

742
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,992
Scary scary

743
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,784
But don't worry

744

749
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,072
And

750
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:56,608
Little interesting side note

751
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,936
Rob was my first podcast guest

752
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:03,264

Schumann

764
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:33,984
Alessandro thanks for coming

765
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,032
I understand that you've got a wearable

766
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:37,568
Call the human beta

767
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,848
That's right

768
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:43,456
Warminster train better

769
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:49,856
By measuring the way that muscles are using oxygen in Wartime

770
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:52,416
Based on this information we can tell

771
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:53,696
Wendy warm up

772
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:56,256
Afaria from deleted how to recover

773
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:59,840
All of this in real time for performance Improvement workout

774
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:05,216
And where did this idea come from the market research project with MIT

775
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,800
Technology in biology

776
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:15,200
Increase something amazing top people understand more about that body you wake up in the morning today

777
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:20,832
Gas in the tank at the tires oil in the engine

778
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:27,232
You don't have access to the same level to me all the information you need to keep your buddy when it gets best and that's what

779
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:28,000
What will excited

780
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:36,704
People who are ready to embrace this concept

781
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,496
Use different station

782
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:39,264
Woody Allen

783
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:42,848
Because we could help them

784
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:44,384
Soldat biggest problem

785
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:47,968
What does knowing how hard to push himself and a****** so when

786
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:51,808
Clear that Bluetooth would be the way to go as it was

787
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:55,648
Easiest way to connect a wearable to phone 2

788
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:56,672
Deliver information

789
00:31:56,928 --> 00:32:00,000
In real time in a convenient way will technology.

790
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:08,704
I love you exactly how far I can see you guys are in theater right now

791
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,984
What kind of feedback are you

792
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:16,128
Devices to a speech over the US

793
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:18,432
And when I say about this program

794
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:22,272
You know we we get a lot of feedback about the quality of our data how

795
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:25,856
People information Bay

796
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:30,976
When they could get a real snapshot into what's happening in the body

797
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:35,072
Skip back so we can tell them what to do

798
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:37,632
And we help them understand how their body is reacting everyday

799
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:38,912
So you've had athlete

800
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:40,448
Has anyone else seen it

801
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:43,008
Yeah we had the chance to them alongside

802
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:45,056
Two others Bluetooth stick companies

803
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:48,128
At last month at the Discovery Museum

804
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,712
And that was an amazing opportunity to interact with

805
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:54,528
Yaz most influential

806
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,320
To demonstrate how Bluetooth

807
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:58,624
Houses built such an amazing solution

808
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:01,696
And we destroying people externally aphids

809
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:07,584

Hey everyone this is Stacey Higginbotham and we are back with the Internet of Things podcast

815
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:35,488
Today's guest is super special

816
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:39,328
Is rum melissani who is the CEO of securifi

817
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:43,168
Securifi is a company that makes the almond

818
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:43,936
Router

819
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:45,728
So hi Rob how are you doing

820
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:49,312
Hi Stacy I'm doing great thanks for having me

00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:51,616
Man I am so excited to have you

822
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:52,640
So guys

823
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:56,736
Way before this version of podcast I did a version that

824
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:58,016
And

825
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:59,040
Two or three years

826
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:00,576
And

827
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:05,696
Ron was my very first guest all the way back in 2013

828
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:06,720
So

829
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:08,000
Come full circle

830
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,024
Yay

831
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,072
Yeah we did

832
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:15,424
Isn't that crazy we've been doing this iot stuff for so long

833
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,448
Littleoralandie

834
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:21,824
I know so this is a good good place to start you guys started securifi

835
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:26,688
Back in 2012 before everyone else was like I know it let's build a new kind of router

836
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:28,224
What was your thinking

837
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:28,992
With

838
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:30,272
Starting the company

839
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:33,344
I've always hated my home router

840
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,112
And I think

841
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:35,136
You know there was

842
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:38,464
Gas was

843
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:42,816
The one time I have to help my landlord set up her Wi-Fi router and

844
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:45,888
Just a very simple thing I ended up spending like 30 minutes

845
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:46,656
40 minutes

846
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:50,496
And I realized why you know I'm supposed to be the expert at the stop

847
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:54,592
And I struggle with my home router just imagine

848
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:56,384
Regular consumers

849
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:58,432
And that was the founding story of

850
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:03,040
Is a big opportunity to make Robin's easy for consumers

851
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:05,088
This was in 2000

852
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:06,624
September 2011

853
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,392
And that's

854
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:08,416
Just when

855
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:10,976
Android phone started getting big so

856
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:16,608
Screens are getting bigger and cheaper so we thought why not put touch screen LCD

857
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,144
On the router itself

858
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:22,496
So you do not need to do the 192.168 stuff

859
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:24,800
So that was the founding Story song

860
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:26,592
It's it's funny for us because

861
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:29,664
It's like Silicon Valley woke up last year

862
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:31,968
About Wi-Fi or maybe this year

863
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,808
You know we've been screaming and shouting about the importance of

864
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,648
Easy to setup Wi-Fi on importance of routers that look

865
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:42,976
So you not show them inside closets

866
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:44,000
Yes

867
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:45,280
And you guys also

868
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:46,304
Was it

869
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,632
Maybe not your first router but your second generation writer also

870
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:54,496
Doubled as kind of a home hub or you had other radios other than Wi-Fi in

871
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:57,824
That's correct the first one router

872
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:58,848
2012

873
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:00,896
I did not have a smart home hub

874
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:03,968
But we lost Almond Plaza

875
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:04,992
The next year

876
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:06,784
CES 2013

877
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:12,928
And that one did have zigbee and Z-Wave all integrated into the home and I think that's when

878
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:14,208
Right before that

879
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,256
Was Ben I was on your podcast

880
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,376
Giving your crazy perspective on this industry

881
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,168
Excited about the Smart Home

882
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,192
4

883
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:25,472
Just about as long as I have

884
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,312
Weird almost four years off from it so how do you think it's going

885
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:31,104
So

886
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:36,736
I'll talk about this from the Wi-Fi perspective and the smart home perspective I think

887
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:40,832
They are they are related but they are orthogonal in

888
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:41,600
Sometimes

889
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:44,160
Wi-Fi sign in

890
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:44,928
You know

891
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:48,768
Everyone's just realizing the importance of Wi-Fi in home

892
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,072
If you go back a decade

893
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:54,656
You just probably had a laptop that required

894
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:56,448
A wireless internet connection

895
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,544
And so that was just one device one or two devices

896
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:02,592
He told the homeowner laptops

897
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:04,128
At home

898
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:05,408
But today

899
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,432
You know

900
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:10,016
Yunnan Wi-Fi everywhere you need Wi-Fi in the living room

901
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:11,040
Bedroom

902
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:13,600
Front door because of these doorbell cameras

903
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:14,624
Kitchen

904
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:19,232
Your bathroom you know you're mostly Plano take their phones and iPads to the bathroom

905
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:20,512
Backyard

906
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:22,560
People like working from the backyard

907
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:24,608
Play

908
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:25,632
In

909
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:27,424
Just around your home

910
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:30,240
I read you can live without Wi-Fi sauce

911
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:31,008
Become

912
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:32,288
Really interesting

913
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:33,824
And I think the number of seniors

914
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,384
Average American household has about eight

915
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,408
Wi-Fi devices

916
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:40,224
You know what

917
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,552
Comcast actually at its most recent earnings last week

918
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:45,344
Said that they've got 11

919
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,648
Wi-Fi devices on average hanging out their Network

920
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:50,720
So that's might be the

921
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:54,304
American average and 11 we are at 16

922
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,840
Social Security index

923
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:57,376
I guess even hayatabad

924
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:59,168
So that's on the wife I said

925
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:02,240
Still Wi-Fi has become extremely critical

926
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:04,544
Piece of infrastructure at home you know it's like

927
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,568
Water and Electric

928
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,872
So on the smartphone side

929
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:09,408
Yeah things have been

930
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,712
A bit of a mixed bag I would say

931
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:13,760
What we learned a lot of things

932
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:15,552
Thanksgiving we were so early in there

933
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:17,088
And we learned that

934
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:19,136
The Hub

935
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:19,904
Is

936
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,952
But most consumers it's

937
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:23,488
It's a very abstract

938
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:28,096
You know it's not the way consumers think about purchasing products

939
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:30,144
Listen to smart home space

940
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,680
That's what we learned

941
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:33,216
And we've seen

942
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:34,752
The industry has seen

943
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:35,520
Sunray

944
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:38,592
Wine product successes lyrics cameras

945
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:41,664
Know some of the bulbs from Philips

946
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,432
But

947
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:45,248
Was difficult cell phone

948
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:46,784
As a consumer product

949
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:50,368
So what we're doing with some of our newer products has I guess

950
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:52,160
Integrating

951
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:54,208
Some more value into the Hub

952
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:58,048
It sounds like it's not just a hop that just talks to all these devices

953
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,888
That's one of the II is

954
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:03,680
This is going to be a long

955
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:04,448
Slog

956
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:05,728
In the smart home side

957
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:06,496
I think

958
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:07,776
You know there was

959
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:08,800
Way too much hype

960
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:10,080
In the industry

961
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:13,152
I think it's not going to grow as fast as

962
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:14,432
It was hyped up

963
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:15,200
But

964
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:16,224
Here is my analogy

965
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:18,784
If you compare the smartphone

966
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:20,576
With the Smart Home

967
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:22,624
When you purchase a smartphone

968
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:25,440
Everything out of one device

969
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:26,976
So you got your

970
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:30,816
Instagram or Facebook or messaging apps

971
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:35,168
Games whatever you do you got all the value

972
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:36,960
Through this one device

973
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:39,264
I think that's one of the big challenges

974
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,288
It's it's

975
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:44,640
Even if you have the money maybe you don't have the time

976
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:45,408
Because

977
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:48,480
A smartphone

978
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:51,040
You need at least a bunch of things at home

979
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:52,576
Connected

980
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:54,624
And then you start using

981
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,416
But no one wakes up

982
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:58,208
Besides

983
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:00,256
Change my washing machine.

984
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:05,376
50 lights and whatever one day at a time in a percentage

985
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:06,400
Who do that

986
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:07,936
But that's not the main

987
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:08,960
Extreme Behavior

988
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:12,288
Okay so yes Hardware transitions requiring

989
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:17,920
Many pieces of Hardware are definitely more difficult than buying hey I've got a phone I have upgraded my life

990
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:22,016
So do you think so that there is a challenge in

991
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:26,112
Marketing to Consumers so you talked about a hub being abstract

992
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:31,488
I actually think the whole concept of connected devices is a bit abstract for most people

993
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:34,816
That's why we've seen a lot of people purchase one off devices

994
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,608
Weather like oh

995
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:42,752
This doorbell I can see and understand what it does but when you say to your lights

996
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,032
So

997
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:47,360
How can you as a company that is trying to

998
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:49,664
Sell a hug maybe make these sort of

999
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,688
Connections abidi

1000
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:52,992
Yeah I agree a hundred

1001
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:54,528
Percent that the

1002
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:56,832
Hobbits to apps like today and maybe

1003
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:57,856
Maybe Mike

1004
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:58,624
Guesses

1005
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:00,160
Maybe the whole hog

1006
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:02,720
Concept is couple of years

1007
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:04,256
Too early right now

1008
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:06,048
Or maybe doesn't work at all

1009
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:09,888
Serious

1010
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:12,448
Multifunctional

1011
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:16,032
Mainstream consumers I don't know

1012
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:17,824
You're ever going to want to do any

1013
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:18,592
This

1014
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:19,872
It's possible

1015
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:22,176
Very very likely I do think

1016
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:24,224
One product that could change

1017
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:27,296
My perception around this is the Amazon Echo

1018
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:31,904
It is effectively a hub I mean it doesn't talk directly to all the devices at home but

1019
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:36,512
You know I talked to a lot of the popular smart home devices today

1020
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:37,536
So

1021
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:40,352
I think that probably is what we'll get

1022
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:41,376
Customers

1023
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:46,752
Used to this concept of a hub and maybe that's what will make it less abstract

1024
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:48,288
In the consumer space

1025
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:53,151
So let's move on though because right now yet another thing that's coming against

1026
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:55,199
Connected devices is

1027
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:59,807
Security issues we can't stop talking about the Mirai botnet

1028
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:06,207
Should we invade culprits in some of these security was our routers that you don't have hearts hard-coded

1029
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:10,559
Passwords are the manufacturers didn't build onboarding processes that Force

1030
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:12,351
Customers to change password

1031
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:16,191
I'm curious what you think about all of this security

1032
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:18,751
Drama here and then how you guys are

1033
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:19,519
Thinking about address

1034
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:25,407
Before I jump into that I just want to clarify one more part I have on the hubs and why I think

1035
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:26,943
The knot

1036
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:28,479
I think in a

1037
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:32,575
When you go to Consumers directly yes it's been abstract but I do think

1038
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:34,367
When you go through

1039
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:35,647
Some interesting

1040
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:39,743
Other channels like b2c maybe something like an ISP or even

1041
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:41,279
Insurance companies

1042
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:46,399
I'm actually makes more sense for them because from a Catholic perspective it's

1043
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:49,983
A small one-time investment and they can keep adding capabilities

1044
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:51,263
I think in the future

1045
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:55,103
You mostly right now all of the smart home stuff is being

1046
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:56,639
Either home security or

1047
00:42:57,151 --> 00:43:00,991
What's provided what what do you get on Amazon

1048
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:03,295
So I do think as these channels make sure

1049
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:07,135
I think Rob will have a very important role to play I just want to clarify that

1050
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:08,927
So back to this idea of

1051
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:09,951
Security

1052
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:11,231
Yeah I think this is

1053
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:15,071
Become Suddenly at an extremely mainstream issue

1054
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:16,607
In the last couple of weeks

1055
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:17,887
I do think

1056
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:19,167
Lot of fun

1057
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:20,447
The Fulton Industrial

1058
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:22,495
Talking about

1059
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:24,287
Security with.

1060
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:26,079
You know we were all wondering about

1061
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:28,383
I was going to hack my lights was going to hack my

1062
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:31,455
My cameras are look at what's going on

1063
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:32,991
That didn't happen

1064
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:35,295
So they work some of these devices what hack

1065
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:36,831
And it's strangely enough

1066
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:38,623
Did not hack tool

1067
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:40,159
Mess up your lighting

1068
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:41,183
They hacked

1069
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:44,255
Mess up other devices in create an army of these

1070
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:46,815
HotBox I guess so which is

1071
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:47,583
We just kind of him

1072
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:49,887
On the traditional

1073
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:55,007
Thing that most of us were worried about when iot security first came out I thought that wasn't

1074
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:55,775
Mustang

1075
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:57,823
The second thing is yeah

1076
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:02,175
The crazy thing is this whole heck happened because of default passwords and

1077
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:03,199
And that's just

1078
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:04,735
Get on

1079
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:06,527
That's just crazy because

1080
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:07,807
If we cannot

1081
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:09,087
Get that right

1082
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:12,159
I mean there are so many other things that can go wrong

1083
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:15,231
Security certificates

1084
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:17,535
You're much more advanced things

1085
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:20,863
So I did not being encrypted

1086
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,399
We are at the ready

1087
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:27,007
Base level in terms of how poor the Securities with some of these devices it's just

1088
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:28,799
I don't know it's just awful

1089
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:31,615
So when you say we you mean the industry not secure

1090
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:37,503
Oh yeah oh yeah so tell me what securifi what you guys do

1091
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:39,807
What are the basics for security do you think

1092
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:40,831
That a product should have

1093
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:43,135
We were the first company

1094
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:44,671
In back in 2012

1095
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:47,487
Randomize every single Wi-Fi

1096
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:48,767
SSID password

1097
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:51,071
The admin credential

1098
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:52,351
We were the first to do that

1099
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:53,375
Nice

1100
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:56,959
Yeah back then you know everyone Netgear and all these guys

1101
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:59,519
You still just have the default name for the

1102
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:00,799
Everyone up there

1103
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:02,079
Devices

1104
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:05,919
That's all very first week

1105
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:08,479
If I was about to say

1106
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:11,807
Thesis even back then was we still believe in that

1107
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:15,647
Good security comes from good user experience

1108
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:16,415
Youfit

1109
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:18,719
Easy for customers to change passwords

1110
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:21,023
If it's if they feel confident that

1111
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:22,303
Okay

1112
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:26,655
I can change it easily I can I can find the password at this place is Ali

1113
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:29,215
They're more likely to change password

1114
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:31,775
So you guys were the first two

1115
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:33,311
Make default passwords

1116
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:36,639
Easy to change so yeah good on you what else do you guys do

1117
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:38,431
So we

1118
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:42,015
Currently have no devices on your network

1119
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:44,319
You can see you'll get a notification

1120
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:47,903
That device joined your network

1121
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:50,463
If it's a device that dinner

1122
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:53,535
It's a neighbor trying to hop on the network and we have

1123
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:54,815
Esophagus coming up

1124
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:59,423
Very soon where it'll be a paid service where you'll be able to

1125
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:01,471
Monitor some of the sites visited

1126
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:04,031
It's going to be a basic service

1127
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:05,823
Jessica less the

1128
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:07,871
Sites initially but

1129
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:09,151
Eventually we

1130
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:12,735
We'll have more intelligence on it and we'll figure it out

1131
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:14,271
Unusual pattern

1132
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:16,319
So as an example

1133
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:18,879
We'll have a service where you can figure out that

1134
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:22,207
Your Nest thermostat is talking to service in Russia

1135
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:24,511
So we think we are

1136
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:25,279
Router

1137
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:29,631
Can play a very significant role I mean it is going to be a firewall

1138
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:30,399
Home

1139
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:32,191
Got it okay well that's in

1140
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:35,263
I assume your routers are updatable over-the-air

1141
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:40,383
That's over there updates and then

1142
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:47,039
You know we make the updates very easy you can just go.

1143
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:49,855
You'll actually see a little notice on the Apple pay

1144
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:51,647
Does a new phone battery

1145
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:53,695
That's the second reality

1146
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:55,231
Security

1147
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:56,255
Contradict

1148
00:46:56,511 --> 00:47:02,655
What bugs are going to come out next year I mean this is something that manufacturers have to stay on top of

1149
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:04,959
Because a lot of people say that

1150
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:08,799
The reason that manufactures don't stand top of this in the

1151
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:11,615
Traditional routing industry is because

1152
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:14,687
These products are relatively cheap they send up they set him to forget him

1153
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:16,735
When I buy a securifi

1154
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:17,503
Device

1155
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:21,599
How long is it going to be supported or how how do you think about the economic system porting

1156
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:23,391
Continuous Security in

1157
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:27,231
This is a challenge because there's always there

1158
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:29,535
Download price per acre in consumer electronics

1159
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:30,303
But

1160
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:35,935
I think you'll have to beg him some of this online service cast into the hardware so that's

1161
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:36,959
One way

1162
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:38,751
On the 2nd

1163
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:39,519
Is

1164
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:42,847
We expect when we launched these monetize services like

1165
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:46,175
The Internet Security offering that I just talked about it

1166
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:46,943
Publix

1167
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:48,223
It will go out

1168
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:49,247
Next month

1169
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:50,271
We think

1170
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:52,831
Some of our customer base and convert to despot

1171
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:56,671
I do think pandas have to think about baking and some of these cars

1172
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:58,975
To give you a specific example of

1173
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:00,255
How we deal with

1174
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:02,047
Dalian Ramen was launched in

1175
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:03,583
2012 July

1176
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,887
And we still giving updates to it

1177
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:08,703
Okay how do you account for things like that I mean

1178
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:09,983
Let's say you have

1179
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:13,567
I don't know ten thousand of those out there in the world and

1180
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:16,127
It takes however many hours to develop

1181
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:17,407
The patch for that thing

1182
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:19,455
At some point in time

1183
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:21,247
They are going to cost you money

1184
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:24,575
It is that the point in time when you say hey it's like if I'm a phone

1185
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:29,183
Like a payment Apple or Google I'm like a certain point I just don't support it anymore

1186
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:31,231
So it's a good question

1187
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:34,303
I think by one good thing now is

1188
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:35,327
Because

1189
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:38,911
Our customers download the app when they set up the product

1190
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:41,471
At least they have that visibility into

1191
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:44,543
We haven't reached that point yet with any of our products

1192
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:47,103
Exped. Updating

1193
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:48,895
Especially

1194
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:49,919
Critical

1195
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:52,735
Piece of infrastructure at home

1196
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:55,807
But I think communication is the second thing one is

1197
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:57,087
Security updates

1198
00:48:57,343 --> 00:48:59,391
We kind of think of them as mandatory

1199
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:00,927
II

1200
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:01,695
Suppose you

1201
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:02,719
Dell customer service

1202
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:05,023
Maybe

1203
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:06,559
Resale Hardware

1204
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:08,863
The industry needs to think about

1205
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:10,655
Okay we're going to support this

1206
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:16,031
Hardware for X years maybe that's the sort of thing we have to come into

1207
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:17,311
My guess is

1208
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:20,895
Sonic FTC is going to look into something like this

1209
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:21,919
In the future

1210
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:23,967
They are thinking about it

1211
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:24,735
Fatso

1212
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:25,759
Act now Russ

1213
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:31,135
So let's look at these Services because this is another really kind of

1214
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:33,951
Interesting Trend that we're seeing develop which is

1215
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:35,999
Delivering Wi-Fi and itself

1216
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:37,023
As a service

1217
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:37,791
Or

1218
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:42,399
Delivering services like security or something on top of WiFi

1219
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:43,423
So

1220
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:50,079
Talk to me about that that's a big shift for consumers I think it might be a big shift for vendors to so can you talk

1221
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:51,871
About why this is happening

1222
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:53,407
Auto

1223
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:54,687
Call it a new thing at all

1224
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:56,223
Because we were

1225
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:57,503
In the USA

1226
00:49:57,759 --> 00:49:59,295
You always had the modem fee

1227
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:00,063
Service

1228
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:01,855
Right we just always have it

1229
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:02,879
But yes there is

1230
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:04,415
But almost all of us now have

1231
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:06,463
Yeah so that's

1232
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:09,279
That's the service I don't know I guess it's

1233
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:11,839
Anywhere from $2 to $45

1234
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:13,631
What's a $7 now

1235
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:15,423
How it's a cash cow

1236
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:16,703
Oh wow that's

1237
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:22,079
So goodbye at your own router

1238
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:26,431
But less than that you can get a basic almond for less than that

1239
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:27,455
I think

1240
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:29,759
What you'll see it perhaps is

1241
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:30,783
Some of these

1242
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:32,319
Isvs could give out

1243
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:38,207
Better remote and charge I don't know 12 instead of 7

1244
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:39,231
Okay

1245
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:42,559
And now if I has pee start doing this

1246
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:48,959
This kind of shrinks your Market in a sense because people will your customer base with them become isps

1247
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:50,495
Supposed to direct-to-consumer

1248
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:52,543
Yes that is actually

1249
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:57,151
It's it's a long-term Trend by the way in the US and rest of the world as well

1250
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:57,919
Where

1251
00:50:58,431 --> 00:51:00,223
Most gateways today are

1252
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:02,015
Given out by a species

1253
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:04,319
Not purchased through retail stores like

1254
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:06,367
Best buy on Amazon or Walmart

1255
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:11,231
A trial with the

1256
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:12,255
Cable company

1257
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:14,815
So we do think is be will be

1258
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:17,375
One of the key channels for the movie called

1259
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:19,935
Real fast before we go

1260
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:23,007
What percentage of your users have activated the Smart Home

1261
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:24,543
Settings or

1262
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:25,567
Use the smart

1263
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:30,687
Depending on the skill it's anywhere from 5 to 20%

1264
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:31,455
Currently

1265
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:32,479
All right

1266
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:35,807
LeBron takes so much for talking to me today and

1267
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:37,599
I can't wait to try this thing out

1268
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:42,719
Yeah thanks Stacy thanks for having me it's always a pleasure to be on your podcast and day
