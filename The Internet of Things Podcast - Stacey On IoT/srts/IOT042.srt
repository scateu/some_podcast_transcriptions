Kevin tofel and we have a great week for you hopefully know CES

6
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:24,064
Although I am going to do one quick plug for the Amazon Echo before we get to

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,344
Too heavy into things

8
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:27,904
There is we're going to talk this week about the

9
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:31,232
We're going to talk about the best Wi-Fi water sensors

10
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:33,792
Are actually the only two that we could find

11
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:37,376
Egg minder are the quirky egg minder because Kevin just got one

12
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:38,144
And

13
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:41,216
Hot new gear from Under Armour

14
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:43,008
And we also have a

15
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:45,056
I guess that will leave a surprise but

16
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:47,360
Near and dear to our hearts

17
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:49,664
So surprised it's a very good surprise

18
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:51,712
Let's get started with a quick

19
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:55,040
Last hopefully last mention for the Amazon Echo

20
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:55,808
Which

21
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:56,576
This week

22
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:58,112
Or actually news last week

23
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,696
Amazon announced that you can actually get your Kindle

24
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:02,464
Books

25
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,488
Read to you

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,024
From the echo

27
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:05,792
Which

28
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,840
If you're into that sort of thing

29
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:09,888
It's it's not like an after reading it

30
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:13,984
Noted that you're right it happened last week it was

31
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,104
Friday afternoon news dump kind of thing it happened to catch it right away

32
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,640
Read about it and tested it

33
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,736
It's there's some good and some bad here. Did you try it yet

34
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:26,016
I did try it

35
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,368
I didn't think I would use it but I like to read

36
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,392
Okay

37
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:36,256
And I love to read I read anywhere from one to three books or paper books a week

38
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:37,536
And

39
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:38,560
I'm not an

40
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:39,840
Audio

41
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:41,120
Book fan

42
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:41,888
I like

43
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:42,656
To read

44
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:49,056
However you know it's not terrible you is using as you said Alexis voice is not using a professional

45
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:49,824
Actor

46
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,616
Voice actress you not getting this

47
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:52,896
You know the feel of the

48
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:53,664
The tax

49
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,480
It's what she does okay I think

50
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,296
I mean

51
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:00,320
Voice kind of yours

52
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:04,160
Yeah but the nice thing is

53
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:08,768
Amazon audible I don't remember when they did that but I know they bought Audible

54
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,352
Sometime ago and if you want to hear professional

55
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,632
Read your books to you

56
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:17,728
Audible's great way to do it I forget what the subscription is like 10 $15 a month

57
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,288
Whisper book to use and so on

58
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,824
This is actually free

59
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,432
So that's was like I was like wow this is awesome even if it's not outstanding it's not going to

60
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,224
Really compete with Audible

61
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,576
It's free for some people who maybe there's vision-impaired people want to hear their books and don't

62
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:33,856
You know

63
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,416
We also noticed

64
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:41,536
Who also love to hear Echo talk so I agree with you

65
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:45,120
I have about 250 Kindle books in my account right now

66
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:48,192
And out of all of them it was like a handful five or six

67
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:50,240
We're not eligible for this

68
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:51,520
So pretty much like

69
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:53,312
Who's my whole Library I can just have

70
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:55,872
Bianca read to me

71
00:02:57,408 --> 00:03:03,552
So I just thought that was worth noting for people who may not you know Amazon Echo newsletter

72
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,320
Every week

73
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,856
Which

74
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:07,136
Don't know

75
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:10,464
Somehow I'm not surprised redo

76
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,536
So we have an obligation to our list

77
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:14,816
So this week

78
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:16,096
We're going to talk about Ness

79
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:19,680
Because why we talked about this

80
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:24,288
Why are we talking over the New York Times

81
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,824
He has a sad

82
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,456
Is he wrote this week about our last week

83
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,736
About the

84
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:35,296
The issue that Gizmodo actually wrote about

85
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:37,600
Kind of during the middle of CES

86
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:38,624
Csb

87
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:44,256
Nest 2nd generation Nest out there that have an issue with

88
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:47,328
A software glitch that drains the battery

89
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:49,376
If you're not using

90
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:50,912
Wired power

91
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:55,008
So it's it's less than a percentage of the second generation Nest

92
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:58,336
And if you want to fix it it's like a 9

93
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,360
Step process

94
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,408
So it is not a simple thing

95
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,760
And I think some people if they actually fix it

96
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:06,784
Which

97
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:12,672
Problem this is coming on the heels actually if you know we complained about some issues with with my nest

98
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:16,256
And I don't know about you Kevin you said you might have an issue with your nest

99
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:24,703
Say about it I told you beforehand and I had some that mention I didn't have the problem but I just found out literally right

100
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,727
Thank you for the show

101
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:31,103
But I never got the software update that actually caused the glitch in the reason I know that is because

102
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,895
Got an email today from wrestling

103
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:34,687
Hey we've noticed that you haven't

104
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:38,527
Don't have the latest and greatest software on your nest even though I know it got it

105
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,319
Configure to get the updates

106
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:42,623
So it told me how to

107
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,903
Reset the nest

108
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:48,511
And that's a lot of buy back and get one or two of the steps that people are doing actually fix their nests

109
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:54,143
And I and I didn't know if you pushed the ring in for about 10 things that actually reset resets it reboots it

110
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,679
And I had to do that today

111
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,727
I will get the software update soon

112
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:58,495
I'm not

113
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:01,055
Worried about having a battery problem because

114
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,335
I have wired power to

115
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:03,615
Got it

116
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:06,175
So there's a lot to unpack

117
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,479
I want to start

118
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,831
Products physical products

119
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:13,599
Is hard

120
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,391
I don't think that could be interesting

121
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:16,415
Because

122
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:20,511
Has a really good job

123
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:26,143
You know we can say it we can know that the nest protect had you know

124
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,935
It was recalled for a while

125
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:30,495
Because of the whole waiting in the air thing but

126
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:36,895
You know I still buy Apple products that you know have recalls associated with them because

127
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,199
Malfunctioning or

128
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,223
You know

129
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,503
Your battery

130
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:50,719
Good Hardware products

131
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,743
Is really hard

132
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:54,303
So in some ways I'm like

133
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,351
When you add

134
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,375
Computerize parts

135
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,679
Anything you make them infinitely more copper

136
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,959
Located

137
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:01,983
And so

138
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,263
This is a problem

139
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:08,639
Yeah and I don't think you're giving Nest up a pass here I think what you're trying to say is

140
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:12,223
You know this happens to various products any products

141
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,247
Like this

142
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:15,807
Faces so many challenges so and I agree with you on that

143
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,855
So I think as an industry

144
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,135
Overall

145
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:21,695
We've got to figure out because Nest problem

146
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:25,023
In what state is stuck to someone's wall

147
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:33,983
People like I used to forget about me

148
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:35,263
Right

149
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:38,335
Deal

150
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,615
With a thermostat

151
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,199
You don't think about it

152
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:45,247
Think about when people

153
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,783
I was at my parents with

154
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:49,599
They're just like

155
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:55,999
Why does it have to get an update what's it doing what's it getting what's the changing

156
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,535
Kind of a nerd

157
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,303
To that now

158
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:00,863
I'm sitting in my car

159
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,143
Which happens to be a Tesla

160
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,959
And happens to have a lot of software associated

161
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:06,751
And

162
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,175
I was like

163
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,199
What the heck

164
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:19,551
And I'm trying to troubleshoot that and then my phone for some reason was also

165
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:20,319
Not working

166
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,903
And it's totally Verizon provides the radio in my

167
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:27,999
Either I am liking a cellular black hole right now or I'm having

168
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:28,767
Some sort of

169
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:29,535
Weird

170
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:30,559
Issue

171
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,887
It was so frustrating to me because like

172
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,423
I have two things in my life that

173
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,471
Phone usage

174
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,495
Find

175
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:42,079
So we have all these things around us that are just getting kind of

176
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,127
Squishy

177
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:47,199
And I think the bigger picture here is that we

178
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:49,759
We have these great new devices

179
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:52,575
That are solving problems worth making things

180
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,343
Better

181
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,647
When we come to re and we come to rely on them

182
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,183
The point where

183
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,719
You know you expect your

184
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:02,303
Your heat in your house to be on when it's cold out and Sonic and Nick Bilton

185
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:07,423
He woke up to it was like 64 degrees in the apartment and the baby was crying probably because it was cold

186
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:08,959
And he was like

187
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:11,775
Distance versus make life easier for us

188
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:14,847
But anytime you add complexity you run the risk of

189
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,383
Essential making things worse

190
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,175
So

191
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:21,247
It's a challenge is a challenge so we've got to figure out

192
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:24,063
Is there a is there a solution here I don't know

193
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,111
Is it lambasting

194
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:29,439
You know I don't know if it was on the front page

195
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,743
Complexity

196
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,143
From a breeder formula

197
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:40,959
Listener this person was asking about

198
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:41,983
Wi-Fi sensor

199
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,031
I do not want to hug

200
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,335
And given Kevin you probably can't blame them

201
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,151
I was like

202
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:51,711
There's there's a couple issues there we found two

203
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:53,759
Using smart home DB

204
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:56,063
The D-Link

205
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:58,367
Water sensor which retails for

206
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:00,927
About 55 to 60 bucks

207
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:02,207
Depending on where you go

208
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,999
This works

209
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:06,047
Any Wi-Fi not just dealing

210
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,607
Connectsense

211
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,399
Water sensor

212
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:12,191
Which is 150

213
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:13,727
Michelle

214
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:14,495
For me

215
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:24,479
Similar reviews I was looking on Amazon I haven't tested these out

216
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,271
Personally because I

217
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,807
Have I think I have

218
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:32,415
A cluster of hope so I use Zippy and Z-Wave hubs

219
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:35,231
Just to clarify these are water

220
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,023
Detection like water leak sensors

221
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,583
Water leak sensor so these are things are going to stick

222
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,119
Under your sink spider

223
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:43,935
Water heater wherever you want

224
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:46,751
3 weeks in my house

225
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:48,031
Since I moved into it

226
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,311
Fun fun

227
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:51,359
Actually ever been

228
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,127
Where

229
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:52,895
I've had a leak

230
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:54,943
Theoretically

231
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:55,967
My mileage

232
00:09:56,991 --> 00:10:00,319
Sneaky water download sensors aren't

233
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:01,599
So

234
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:04,415
The challenge with Wi-Fi sensors

235
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:07,231
Is because Wi-Fi is such

236
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,279
You have to plug

237
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,095
So

238
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,887
They all are little funny

239
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:17,727
Play that's why most of the water sensors

240
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:18,495
Use a hug

241
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:21,567
Is because you need a zigbee or Z-Wave or some sort of

242
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,359
Really low power radio

243
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:26,687
So I'm just giving that to you guys straight

244
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:29,503
So even if you're like Wi-Fi

245
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,039
You may want to

246
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:34,111
If you're going to really like sensor outfit your home

247
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,647
You may just be Leo

248
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:37,439
I'm just going to invest in the hub

249
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:39,231
Sehrazat

250
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:39,999
Makes sense

251
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:46,655
And it's ironic that you had this topic on the show notes today because I just put some plants in the house that I want to get some

252
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,959
Soil / water sensors

253
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:51,007
And how goes into my

254
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,543
System here

255
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,847
And they're not cheap either I mean

256
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:55,871
Achievement

257
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,943
Heartless the parrot flower power

258
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:02,015
Looks nice and I think it cost

259
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,551
$60

260
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,343
I mean that's just for one

261
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,879
Potted plants

262
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:11,231
You know that's that's not cheap I saw the plant link

263
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:15,071
Which is a much smaller sensor and the center itself is only $35

264
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,351
But you do need

265
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,655
Plantlink hub

266
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:23,519
So if you buy the Hub and One sensor it's like $79

267
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:27,615
Anthony traditional sensor because you can have up to 64 sensors at the base station

268
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:31,711
Level is $35 I told little bit less expensive overtime

269
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,271
It's not cheap I

270
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:39,391
I wish it was that either I mean I know I can buy a nod non-connected one you just like a

271
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:44,255
Give me to plug in a thing and it just reads the soil over time and when it's done you throw it away disposable on

272
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,535
It's a lot cheaper but

273
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,351
You

274
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:49,375
LASIK

275
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:52,447
I know I know that you're right that's exactly what I'm doing now because

276
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:57,055
I'm checking that the top inch of soil and both plants right now bye-bye feel so

277
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:00,895
I can live with that. I'm not going to spend I don't think the money is just just just too expensive

278
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,175
Yeah

279
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,527
You could try those watering stones

280
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,575
Wiring stones

281
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:14,463
Yeah they like Whiskey Stones what are you do with the are not buy them from like The Container Store like fancy

282
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,511
Pipe catalog

283
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:19,839
They're like little glass globes that you stick

284
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:25,727
Water in and then you cook them in the plant and they're supposed to water them slowly over a. Of like a week or two

285
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:32,127
So this is good for people who travel more people like me or forgetful and then you just said

286
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,663
Reminder for like

287
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:39,295
Every every two weeks

288
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:45,951
I might do that. You know what though I also saw alveron instructables for

289
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:49,791
People have the time to Tinker you can actually use an Arduino

290
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:50,815
Pacific sensor

291
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:55,679
And if you want him put little LCD on there so tell you exactly how much moisture is in there

292
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:59,775
And you could use that and the parts were about fifty bucks that's

293
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:03,103
It's actually less than a lot of course

294
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:06,431
Download the source code know what you're doing

295
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,991
There you go alright well I look forward to

296
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:13,855
Going to make an Arduino sensor

297
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:15,391
Did you something

298
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,671
Equally silly

299
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:18,207
I think so

300
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,487
You purchased

301
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:20,767
A product

302
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:23,327
Once retail for $60

303
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,631
Yes and now goes for a

304
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,727
I'm interested

305
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:31,775
I didn't

306
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,311
Wicked Amazon I just

307
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:38,431
Saw something for $15 a night and I spent $15 on the quirky egg minder

308
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,991
You and your first question I told you before the show is

309
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,015
Would you mind at 4

310
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:53,279
Because I don't want to take my ex out of a container in Stick

311
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:59,423
Sure sure so it's so it's basically a plastic egg

312
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,703
Crate container

313
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:05,311
That holds a Baker's Dozen plus 1 to 14 eggs

314
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,103
Two dozen eggs at a pop

315
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,663
And there's a little sensor inside each

316
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,711
Holder for the egg

317
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:14,015
So there are 14 little sensors

318
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:18,623
When you take an egg out it notifies the Corky app through with my case wink

319
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,927
Bet that egg is gone

320
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:24,511
And now you know how many eggs you have it all time

321
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:27,839
The other thing it does there's a little blue LEDs next to each

322
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:28,607
Egg

323
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,399
Soldier in the crate

324
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:34,239
And it lights up and says this is the freshest egg

325
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:36,031
It says so in the app as well

326
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:38,079
Physically as you put the eggs in it

327
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,615
It's going to tell you which ones you put in

328
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:40,639
First

329
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:47,039
First in first out basically in and tells you I didn't buy it for that cuz we go through exit so quickly I bought it thinking

330
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,319
It's nice

331
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:51,135
If the whole family knows how many eggs we have in the house

332
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,183
At any given time in case we need them

333
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,487
Wow

334
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:57,023
Would you recommend to others

335
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:58,815
Should have said

336
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,119
Well I think

337
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:07,519
If you want to know at all times how many eggs you have in your fridge I would say yes but with caution and I'm curious if you

338
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,567
Saw any issues such as I'm saying

339
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:11,359
First of all the setup was kind of

340
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:14,175
Looky it just didn't seem to want to connect

341
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:16,991
Add to my Wi-Fi network in the way you do it

342
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:19,551
You actually use the Wink app

343
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:24,671
You add the quirky egg minder to the Wink app to the wink Hub through your app

344
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,719
And then you hold your phone

345
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:32,607
Face down over a sensor on the quirky egg minder and it flashes lights and that's what tells it

346
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:33,375
What

347
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:35,423
Wi-Fi network in the password is

348
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,983
And took me like 10 tries to get that working for summer

349
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:40,287
Did you have that issue I did not have

350
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:41,567
A problem

351
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:46,175
Yeah but that was only one of two challenges because I'm looking at the

352
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:47,455
App

353
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:53,599
Are the Wing Cap right now and I'm looking at the egg minder and it shows me 14 little eggs in there even though I know three of already been used as of yesterday

354
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:54,879
So it's not

355
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,671
Either it's not refreshing

356
00:15:57,183 --> 00:16:02,559
It's not refreshing or the sensor isn't just seeing that there's no egg in those three spots anymore

357
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:03,327
Sure

358
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,119
I know one thing about this because of my

359
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:08,191
G with the Wi-Fi you know it's kind of a wifi

360
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:13,823
How much Wi-Fi signal is need to get out through the fridge does it only work on the doors open

361
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,615
I'm thinking it just

362
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:18,175
Dinner the Faraday cage as you would have talked about once before

363
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:24,575
Can you close your app

364
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:26,367
I've always had to close out

365
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:28,415
And that's all what that's all about

366
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,463
Supposed to

367
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:31,999
Yeah

368
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:38,655
I just did that and reopen the app and all the eggs flash like they weren't there and then all the eggs and out back there

369
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,959
And they're all there even though I know they're not

370
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:44,543
This is definitely it don't bite

371
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:45,823
It doesn't do it

372
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:53,247
Function well it could be because I'm connected to a Wi-Fi network with a router is on the opposite side of the house

373
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,551
And the only reason I had to do that this is another

374
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:56,831
Potential gotcha

375
00:16:57,087 --> 00:17:00,415
The quirky egg minder only works with 2.4 gigahertz

376
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,439
Wi-Fi network

377
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,463
MI

378
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:05,023
Am I Google onhub

379
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:08,607
Kind of merges those to the 2.4 in the five

380
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:11,935
And I It wouldn't connect to that one side to connect to the further away

381
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:12,703
Router

382
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,263
So there challenges here

383
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:21,663
You know you have to know your instructor at your house to really know who's going to work for you

384
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,199
Interesting point to make about connect

385
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:25,503
Devices because I know that my Roost

386
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,039
Connected smoke alarm

387
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:31,135
I have another couple devices that only connect to the 2.4

388
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,927
Yep so

389
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:37,279
Daddy is at done because of its cheaper cheaper chips

390
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:43,167
I don't know I pay extra that work with 5G network is my reliable

391
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:45,215
Which is not far from the fridge at all

392
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,751
And that's a very future

393
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,287
Design right there

394
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,335
Watch investigator

395
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:54,175
Alright let's see

396
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,455
What else

397
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:57,759
Oh I know what else Kevin

398
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,551
Json testing out some excited

399
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:02,623
Kevin you've been reviewing everything this week I love it

400
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,903
Sit back and take a vacation

401
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,695
Quotes about your other

402
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:07,487
What we mention this

403
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:10,815
One or two shows back I think two shows ago that

404
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,607
Under Armour has a new

405
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:17,727
Help kid in a box I connected a bunch of connected devices in a single box called the UA

406
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:18,495
Healthbox

407
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:23,103
And it was announced at CES I actually had it before so yes we can talk about it

408
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,895
And even when it launched at CES

409
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:28,479
I couldn't give a final review because the UA folks told me

410
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:32,063
We're going to have additional software update you're not going to final software for another week or two

411
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:36,671
So that means basically we couldn't really go into detail about it until this week

412
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:39,999
So what can I tell you was just to recap what's in the box

413
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:43,583
You can have wifi-connected scale that works with up to eight different people

414
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:44,607
You get a

415
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:49,983
UA band which is designed by HTC actually HTC Desire

416
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,263
Scale as well

417
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:54,335
Bose very well-designed products working very well for me

418
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:58,687
You also get the UA strap which is a heart rate monitor that you can wear if you'd like

419
00:18:58,943 --> 00:18:59,967
Addition of that

420
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:02,271
Outside the box I also received

421
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:06,111
A pair of Gemini 2 speedform connected

422
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:10,207
Sneakers running sneakers and I've been running in those quite a bit since I've had him

423
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:10,975
That's where we

424
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:14,559
They have a sensor inside a radio inside battery inside

425
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:16,095
You'd never know it from looking at it

426
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:19,167
The trends will wear out before the battery is what these folks tell me

427
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:21,215
I put about 40 miles on the sneakers

428
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:23,263
Annies automatically

429
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:27,103
Sync up their data into the MapMyRun program which then sink

430
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:27,871
Everything up

431
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:30,687
The other devices into the UA record

432
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:31,455
App

433
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:33,503
And I am

434
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:34,271
Yeah

435
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:38,623
In the Box there's a scale there's a band and isn't there an activity tracker

436
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,159
The band is the activity tracker

437
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:43,743
Oh wait

438
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,535
That's correct

439
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:49,631
There are three things in the box which is $400 if you want to buy them separately

440
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:51,423
Just real quick the scales 180

441
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,983
The band is 180 the heart rate monitor

442
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:56,287
80

443
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,895
Yeah if you want that and then you can add on if you want somebody else in the house to use the

444
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:02,175
Band

445
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:05,247
180 they cannot Abandon All ties into the same system

446
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:06,527
So it's

447
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:07,551
Pricey

448
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:09,087
But I like

449
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:11,647
What they put together here and the key is

450
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:12,671
I think

451
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:17,535
The key is you a kind of bought their way into

452
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:22,655
Having a big audience for this because they purchased the MapMyRun and MapMyFitness

453
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,679
Software

454
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:24,447
Platforms

455
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,471
Last year

456
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:28,287
Faking like a hundred and thirty million

457
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:31,871
Users of their platform to track nutrition and Fitness

458
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,919
And then added more

459
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,479
Wearables that work with it

460
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,759
And you're

461
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:40,319
A fan of those MapMyFitness and MapMyRun products

462
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:45,951
You'll be happier the shoes just sync automatically I mean you can go for a run with nothing on but the shoes walk

463
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:49,279
Close hopefully no bands no phone no nothing

464
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:52,095
You didn't have to turn the shoes on you just go for a run

465
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:55,935
An automatic retracts of NSYNC the data into the MapMyFitness stuff

466
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:58,751
Which is all viewable in your dashboard in UA record

467
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:02,847
And that my fitness also pulls in your data from other

468
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:03,871
Ticketspice

469
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,223
It's one of the best ones out there for tracking

470
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:08,991
Suit

471
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,783
That would be great

472
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,063
Is pal

473
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:16,672
And they're all kind of

474
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,208
USA map

475
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:19,744
In my brain

476
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:27,168
And you you mentioned tying in those those abs tie into with a lot of other devices as well which is fine if you want to use us

477
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:34,336
Jawbone whatever you want is fine but here's the thing to UA record app which is your record for your health

478
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:38,688
Baptizing all that scale data the Band-Aid

479
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,992
It works with your but I can link it with

480
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,784
Apple Health Apple watch

481
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:45,856
Connect powered by Garmin Jawbone

482
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:48,672
Fitbit Suunto Misfit Wego polar

483
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:50,976
Dead bug and Believe by Sports Authority

484
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:57,120
So if you don't want to use you a apps you don't need to order devices

485
00:21:57,632 --> 00:22:00,704
But I will say that there's an integration that works really well because

486
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:02,496
Not that far from Apple your butt

487
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:04,288
They own the hardware and the software

488
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:06,080
All right hand

489
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:12,992
Yes I I keep getting insights from watts and although today's was really weird

490
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:15,040
Today's word something on lines of

491
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:20,160
Out of all the other people in your age group using map my or MyFitnessPal

492
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,464
They have three point five friends

493
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:25,536
Am I good for that

494
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:33,216
Last Bachelorette

495
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:38,848
And then I get that it wouldn't all the other apps that have used I appreciate the social aspect because I put my

496
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:40,128
Running out there

497
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:42,688
You know on the line as they say in the

498
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:43,712
The Internship

499
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:48,576
I have actually run and had real-time geolocation of my races

500
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:54,464
So that people could see me and why not to let people continue because I wouldn't want to let those people down or actually help me

501
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:56,256
So now there's a lot of

502
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:58,048
A lot of aspects to that so

503
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:02,400
I think you'd like the band I know you've learned some other band Stacy and this one

504
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,424
It's comfortable

505
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:08,544
It measures your steps and measures your sleep it does both those automatic it was a beautiful thing

506
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,104
As the time has alarms the silent alarm

507
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:14,176
It's got a heart rate monitor built-in at checking your resting

508
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:17,504
Heart rate right before you wake up or at the end of your sleep cycle

509
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,552
I got a ton of great data and I

510
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:22,112
I've lost several pounds I reduce body fat

511
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:26,208
I am running more because of this granted I'm doing the work yet

512
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:28,000
UA health kit

513
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:28,768
But

514
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:33,120
It's working well I'm getting all information I could ever want

515
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:35,936
Okay cuz I'm actually in the market

516
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:38,240
Core Fitness

517
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:43,360
I would recommend looking at least at the band even if you don't buy the other things and

518
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:46,944
The reason being you just said you had lost some trackers and they concert a lot

519
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:47,968
This

520
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:51,296
I literally don't take off at all except when I take a shower

521
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:54,624
And when I took a shower I usually put this on the charger

522
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:55,904
And it's last

523
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,744
5 days on a charge and it only takes 30 minutes to charge so it's never

524
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:02,304
In a place for me to lose it so to speak

525
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:04,096
Nice okay

526
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,632
Well I'm at

527
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:07,168
Guess who Our Guest is

528
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,448
Who is it

529
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:09,984
O'Malley

530
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:14,848
I know that guy we all do

531
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:18,432
Piece in the New Yorker that everyone was talking about

532
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:19,968
About what was it

533
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:22,272
Infrastructure

534
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,296
And how

535
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:26,368
We are currently in this era of how companies

536
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:29,952
There can only be one it's like the Highlander era of company

537
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:33,792
I'm very curious how that plays out with

538
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:35,584
Consumer devices and

539
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:38,400
The smart home in the internet of things because

540
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:42,496
I know a lot of companies believe that especially if they're selling Hardware

541
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:48,896
But I'm curious how that's actually going to play out and sit so mad I are buddies he's been my mentor he great

542
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:55,296
Decided he would talk to me about this so stay tuned

543
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:04,768
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast I am your host Stacey Higginbotham and with me is this week's guests

544
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:05,792
O'Malley

545
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:07,328
Hello how are you doing

546
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,888
I am great Stacy Happy New Year

547
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:11,168
Happy New Year

548
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:12,192
Happy posts

549
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:12,960
CES

550
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:15,264
How old is a venture

551
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,312
A true I'm a partner in

552
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:22,176
I will see I was be escalating you I'm so sorry that I had to other show this week

553
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:22,944
Typical

554
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,712
You wrote

555
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:24,480
What about

556
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:25,504
A really good

557
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,528
Story of The New Yorker

558
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:27,296
How

559
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,320
Startups

560
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:29,600
We are Becoming monopolies

561
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:33,440
They're doing this because they have this infrastructure advantage

562
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:36,512
I'd love for you to kind of give a quick summary of your article

563
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:39,072
And we're going to talk about how that may or may not apply to the internet

564
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:42,912
So my theory is that there is a new

565
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:43,936
Which applies

566
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:47,776
Pretty much any languages in the

567
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:49,056
Connected space

568
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:49,824
So

569
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,616
Salute goes like this

570
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:52,640
The service

571
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:54,432
Infrastructure

572
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:55,712
I logged into

573
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:56,736
Dada

574
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:57,760
And that Loop

575
00:25:58,272 --> 00:25:59,040
Keeps going

576
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:01,344
More data you have more intelligent

577
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,904
Are you allowed to them becomes and from Dad

578
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:07,744
Your service becomes more useful to the people who are using it

579
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,024
Like this is what

580
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:13,632
Google did so effectively this is what Facebook did so effectively and

581
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:16,960
I think I see you were doing this really really

582
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:19,776
Aggressive user of uber I know

583
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:23,616
Need the predictive nature of uber is pretty scary

584
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:26,176
But it's also pretty nice because they

585
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:27,712
Populate my

586
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:29,248
My Uber VIP

587
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,064
You know. 15 to 20 drivers

588
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:34,624
Who I actually seem to like to give

589
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:37,184
I started eating more often than others

590
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:39,232
And that is actually a pretty

591
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:41,536
It's a deeper relationship not just

592
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:45,632
Read the service but also with the drivers themselves

593
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:47,168
I know their names

594
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:48,704
I know how they're doing

595
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:52,544
Is United member to ask the questions that need to be asked

596
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,336
Next porch light

597
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:56,128
Uber the dog

598
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:58,432
Like them trying to make any

599
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,456
Interference

600
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:03,040
Right it's not creepy it's just a very

601
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,648
Are there drivers like waiting outside your house

602
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,232
Remove

603
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:16,352
Them knowing that at 9 I need to go to

604
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:17,888
Is pretty scary

605
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,680
So we got this virtuous cycle

606
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:21,216
Am I question for you

607
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:24,800
Because what I read this was like this works for internet services

608
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,592
Uber obviously

609
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,128
It's a real world service

610
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:31,712
Does this work

611
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:32,480
4

612
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:34,528
Physical devices in the Smart Home

613
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:35,296
Because

614
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:38,368
There's there's a huge difference here with consumer devices

615
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,184
I have to spend $250 on a nest

616
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:42,976
And I know with like

617
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:47,072
Nest cam when it was Dropcam they actually did very well

618
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:49,888
Creating is virtuous Loop

619
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:52,192
By having enough

620
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:52,960
People

621
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:54,752
Submit kind of

622
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:57,312
Data to them that they were able to create

623
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:01,152
Facial recognition that helps make a better service

624
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:03,712
And they did an itemized to that sort of thing

625
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:08,320
So in some ways this is true they had enough data to create a better service in

626
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:11,392
People loved it so can you do this with a physical.

627
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,464
Okay the number one thing I would say on that

628
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:16,768
We haven't seen the device

629
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:18,048
Make which we make this

630
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:25,472
But we don't love them enough

631
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:26,496
Laura

632
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:27,264
Scale

633
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:31,872
Yeah I don't know how many nests are out there may be less than a million

634
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,432
February 1st I'm hoping we'll know

635
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:35,200
Alphabet

636
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:36,480
What's number

637
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:37,248
So

638
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,528
That's not

639
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:39,296
Enough

640
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,832
Nest in the market

641
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,368
Wacky hat

642
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:44,160
For them to have

643
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:45,184
Say

644
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,232
Stockbridge

645
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:49,536
Which can become more useful to

646
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:53,376
From from that standpoint you know it still radio today's for

647
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:54,912
Internet of things change

648
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,496
So we're looking for

649
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:00,032
Do you have a sense of how many

650
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:02,592
We need to have in the real world

651
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:04,384
Apple was smart in

652
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:06,688
Nina badric together

653
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,992
Homekit would be very very

654
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:10,784
Good way to move forward

655
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:12,832
Pumpkin cars

656
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:15,392
The ability to provide identity

657
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,696
Store and manage data

658
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:19,744
And create a more personalized

659
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,512
Expedient

660
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:22,048
And have the infrastructure

661
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:23,840
For Independence

662
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:24,608
Small

663
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,144
In The Internet of Things

664
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,984
So far it has been

665
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:32,288
I miss it's not even a hit in the mess

666
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:34,336
Is a complete mess

667
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:38,176
Same goes for Google right Google can do exactly the same thing

668
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:41,760
Amazon could do exactly the same thing

669
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:43,296
Unfortunately

670
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:45,344
I'll be doing

671
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:47,648
Like any of these companies

672
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,976
You know look outside their silos

673
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,328
So from my standpoint this is an opportunity for somebody

674
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:57,632
Maybe Facebook I don't know but

675
00:29:57,888 --> 00:30:01,728
There is an independent service provider out there

676
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:04,032
Who can you can capitalize on this

677
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:04,800
Opportunity

678
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:06,592
Individual

679
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:10,176
Device makers are still so small

680
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:12,736
And they don't have what it takes I don't think

681
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:16,320
Samsung has water takes what example with the SmartThings

682
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:17,856
United status

683
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:21,184
It seems like. Quite a mess like I stop using it

684
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:25,280
And you know and then there was blank which was a good idea but

685
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:27,328
Never really took off until

686
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:31,168
But you know the Phillips we don't know they have their own Hardware agenda

687
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:33,728
Everybody has their own agenda

688
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:35,264
And nobody's getting mumps

689
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,032
Scary just

690
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:38,848
Anyone get scared going to be

691
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:41,408
That you will get the loop right

692
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:43,200
Okay and

693
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:44,736
You know it may be that it

694
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:46,784
Because he's our devices in homes

695
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,576
And there's about a hundred and

696
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:52,928
20 million homes quote-unquote homes in the US just in the US

697
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,232
I am curious if that's even enough

698
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:57,024
Scale

699
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,048
Yasso

700
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,584
I remember

701
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,864
You and I talked about

702
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:02,400
Last year

703
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:03,680
About

704
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:05,472
Like I want to connect to

705
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:06,496
Annapolis

706
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:10,336
Play like it is such a basic building block

707
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:12,128
Gmail

708
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,688
Every little gadgets in your house

709
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:15,968
Quasi connect

710
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:16,992
Right

711
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:19,040
Quasi internet

712
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:20,832
The Baxter

713
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:23,136
I still think those guys have the right off

714
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:24,672
Somebody

715
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:25,696
Who can make

716
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:28,512
Really affordable power strip

717
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:30,048
Is it really nice

718
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,376
Openstack with people can plug into

719
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:34,656
And that becomes

720
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:36,704
Building blocks for

721
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,728
For what comes now

722
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:39,520
I think I still feel

723
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:44,384
$15 product is the right entry point for Internet of Things

724
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:46,176
Hello Manuel

725
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:48,736
They got to get scale before they can get that

726
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:49,760
Cuz

727
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:52,832
The power strip you're looking at Wi-Fi and a Wi-Fi chip

728
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:54,112
In one of those like

729
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:55,904
You're going to add $5 to like

730
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:58,464
Building materials and then

731
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:00,512
No but I think it's

732
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:02,560
It's like you look at $5

733
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:03,328
You look at

734
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,424
You know you have all these new like microcomputers which other

735
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:11,008
Take Micronor you can call them Nana computer the same tree

736
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,056
Which are coming to market now

737
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:16,896
If you have those and you can send for less than $10

738
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:21,248
I think there is still room to make a smart intelligent

739
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:23,552
Power strip for like less than

740
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:24,320
$15

741
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:27,136
What are the key for that is to have

742
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:29,184
A stack which is more

743
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:32,256
And innovate more programmable for other people

744
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:33,280
2

745
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:34,304
Do you know

746
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,328
Piggy back office

747
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:36,352
I took

748
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:39,680
I do look at people like Belkin have their power strips but

749
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:42,752
You know they don't have a stack or they don't have any

750
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,312
Intelligent verification

751
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:46,848
What to do with that

752
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,688
Innocent opportunity I always think

753
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,504
The most basic thing you can do

754
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:58,368
With the internet of things in this is the power strip

755
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:00,672
The five belkin.com

756
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,720
Okay you know

757
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:07,840
Just open yourself up to all of the guys out there trying to build a 15-2

758
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:09,376
$20 power strip giving you

759
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:10,400
Call Sol

760
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:12,448
With that in mind

761
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:16,544
In your role as a as a VC

762
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:21,664
What do you think right now given given the FourSquare just had a Down Round given

763
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:25,248
Bet there's been some consolidation already and kind of

764
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,296
I guess it was in The Flash sales Market

765
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:31,136
What do you see coming into 2016 for the internet if they

766
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:34,464
I think that is too big trends with

767
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:37,024
Are happening right now one

768
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:40,096
Is the Asian manufacturers

769
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:44,704
Quickly imitating some of the more successful products

770
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:46,240
And offering them

771
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:48,544
To turn parties AJ

772
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:49,568
The old

773
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:52,640
School companies which resetting power strips

774
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:54,432
And become enough

775
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:55,200
Connecting

776
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:56,224
Power strip

777
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:57,760
Satellite

778
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:00,064
We saw the rise of the

779
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:04,160
That is the Wi-Fi routers and stuff like that

780
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:07,232
So that is a huge Trend which is going to

781
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:10,048
Suck out any prophets left in the market

782
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,352
I'm a little worried about that

783
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:15,680
From from a startup perspective I think that is a

784
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:17,472
What is enunciate

785
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:18,752
Carbon monoxide.

786
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:20,800
In my opinion

787
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:24,640
Ain't nobody sees it just one day just got you though

788
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,408
And boom

789
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:27,456
You're gone

790
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:30,784
And the server Market by quantity and

791
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:32,320
Are those guys just

792
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:33,856
Took away everything from

793
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:35,648
Some of the more established

794
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:39,488
He saw the same thing in phones and we have seen that in a turnip

795
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:43,584
Is happening really fast

796
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:44,608
Situation

797
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:45,632
II

798
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:46,912
Isave

799
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,216
I think the biggest challenge remains

800
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:53,824
Very few Internet of Things companies are gone from

801
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:58,432
You know they go from 0 to 25000 customers very easily

802
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:01,504
But it's very hard to go from 25000

803
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,808
To 250000

804
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,904
And 250,000 to like 25 billion side view

805
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,744
Dollar girl challenge

806
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,280
We don't know how big it is

807
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:16,096
Play the biggest

808
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:17,632
Internet of Things company

809
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:19,168
You still don't know how big it is

810
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,192
Gun show

811
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:21,472
It's pretty big I mean

812
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,032
It's been around for a while and living selling

813
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,312
But we don't know

814
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:26,080
Right

815
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:28,128
That is a challenge nu-vu

816
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,456
Have gone past the 25000 Mark in

817
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:32,992
You're over

818
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:34,016
Unit 2 words

819
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:35,552
Marching towards to

820
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:37,856
250000 users

821
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:40,672
Our buyers are accounts whichever way

822
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:42,208
You want to calculate it

823
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:43,488
I think you're on the right

824
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:46,048
That's pretty good project free

825
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:48,864
Yeah I would think nest in probably a Philips Hue

826
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,656
Are probably the biggest connected

827
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:52,448
Products in Phillips

828
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,008
It's kind of its own Beast because it is

829
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:56,288
Phillips

830
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:57,312
So

831
00:35:57,568 --> 00:36:00,640
I understand a little bit more presumably hadoop support products

832
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:04,480
Weibo has 1.5 million users

833
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:05,760
Which is

834
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:06,528
A lot

835
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:07,808
They're actually struggling

836
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,856
And their own by Falcon which

837
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:11,648
Sounds a lot of physical product

838
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:12,672
Kinecta Prada

839
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:13,696
Not so much

840
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:16,256
I think so I don't know what

841
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:20,096
The challenges of Belkin may or may not be my view is that if

842
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:20,864
If you

843
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:22,144
Have multiples

844
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,168
Use like

845
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:24,448
You know they have

846
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:27,520
I mean it's it's very hard to be a very focused

847
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:29,568
Connected device company

848
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:32,384
What's a separate company

849
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:35,200
Running independently as a

850
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:37,504
Tech company and not as part of Belkin

851
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,552
I bet you they probably would have

852
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:40,832
Way better cracker

853
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:41,856
Action did they have right

854
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:45,440
So we're calling for a spin out of WeMo

855
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:49,280
You're calling first.

856
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:51,072
I was seeing a Toyota Cruiser

857
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:55,680
An independent company that would have

858
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:56,960
Way more

859
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:58,240
Controller test

860
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:04,640
Alright so what are the biggest challenges you think for the

861
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:08,736
Not just a smartphone but just for the internet of things because I feel like this year is

862
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:11,040
This could be a big here at CES

863
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:14,624
I saw a lot of big companies coming into the space

864
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,672
We can call it taking a startups ideas

865
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:24,096
A lot of the ideas coming from startups we're really just like hey I've got these awesome sensors I'm going to connect them in the

866
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:25,376
Then I can do amazing things with her

867
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:26,144
Which

868
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:31,008
Yes that is a novel idea but it's also kind of what technologies all about

869
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,032
So

870
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:33,056
Dallas.

871
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:35,616
You know Procter & Gamble I've got you know

872
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:36,896
Sleep Numbers

873
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:40,480
Coming head and connectivity to their mattress in a way that

874
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:43,040
Smaller companies have already done

875
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:43,808
So

876
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,600
What do you think this year is going to bring us

877
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:51,744
I think the whole thing really reinforces when I was talking about is that

878
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:53,280
Because

879
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:54,048
It's so much

880
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:55,584
Easier for

881
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:57,888
But the Asian

882
00:37:58,144 --> 00:38:00,192
Manufacturer

883
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:01,216
Replicate

884
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:02,752
Successor of someone

885
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:04,032
New startups

886
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:06,080
And offered to

887
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:07,872
Do the old established brands

888
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:12,224
The time for Stardust do exist in isolation

889
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:15,552
Be Market leaders is much much shorter

890
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:17,600
So if you have a product

891
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:18,368
Which is ahead

892
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:20,672
Then you can't really miss your shipping.

893
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:22,464
Miss your

894
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:26,560
You know your growth projections like you have very little room to fail.

895
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:29,888
And that's that's a bigger challenge

896
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,936
My prospective mm

897
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:34,240
16 and still going to be very much like you.

898
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:39,104
You highly focused

899
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:40,640
Point Solutions

900
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:44,224
Which offer an ongoing service

901
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:45,504
Ben sexy

902
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:51,904
I can't say more so just to be clear we are investors in a bunch of companies which offer

903
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:54,720
Services on top of that like Unilever

904
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:56,256
Adidas Fitbit

905
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:58,560
Investors in Peloton

906
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:00,608
Which is a connected biking offers

907
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:02,912
Service service riches like

908
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:05,216
You get biking lessons on

909
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:06,496
Cream

910
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:08,288
Which is attached to Bala.

911
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,568
It's

912
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:11,872
That thing you look at companies like

913
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:13,920
You know we have ring which provides

914
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:14,944
Disservice on top

915
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,784
Beauty Masters in narrative which provide storage and

916
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:22,624
You know I like that image processing services on top of that

917
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,160
That's how you're going to

918
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:26,208
You stand out you're not going to stand out

919
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:28,256
By just selling pure Hardware

920
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:29,792
So the service has

921
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:32,096
And service my mean

922
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:34,912

923
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,960
Call Manda people hate

924
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:37,728
Subscriptions

925
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:42,592
No I think subscription revenues are the right way to value a company now

926
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:45,152
Especially in this Hardware space for Jesus

927
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,200
The margins are so low

928
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:50,528
Okay I look forward to buying my my 50

929
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:52,576

00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:55,136
Again that's enough

932
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:58,464
Trinity for somebody write somebody

933
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:01,792

No I'm I'm a big Amazon

945
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:23,296
What's a Catholic

946
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:25,600
Less and less share of my daughter

947
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:27,648
It's not doing too good

948
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:28,928
Job

949
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,976
Easily taken more

950
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:33,792
More dollars for Federal Express for music

951
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:35,584
Or what if it was for

952
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,656
E-commerce or stuff like that

953
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:42,240
Done a good job. By the way yesterday I use instacart

954
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:44,544

955
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,312
Pictures like

956
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,592
It was pretty seamless

957
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:48,640
I did not do anything

958
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:49,664
Nothing just

959
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,200
You know like touched

960
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:53,504
My community

961
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:54,784
And so I

962
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,832
That's kind of seamless I think

963
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,136
You know I wish Amazon

964
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:03,744
And afterward not in a fight with each other in fruit makes life so much easier

965
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:10,144
See there you go see and I buy all my gadgets through Amazon so if I could just

966
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:12,448
Or like when I'm talking to the echo

967
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:13,472
I could just be like

968
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:14,752
Oh here do this

969
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,544
That would be amazing again

970
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,312
Shameless

971
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,104
Echo is so racist

972
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:22,688
Yes, it doesn't it doesn't

973
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:24,992
I just like Siri I mean

974
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:25,760
Seriously

975
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:29,088
Billion and a half people how can you be racist against

976
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,112
You know what

977
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:31,136
I'm going to say

978
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:32,160
They should train it better

979
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:34,720
Yeah

980
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:36,512
How to understand what I was saying

981
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,328
It's it's true that that's inexcusable

982
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,376
And that just is so much harder

983
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,424
I can be trained

984
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,472
No no nobody can fan use

985
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,336
