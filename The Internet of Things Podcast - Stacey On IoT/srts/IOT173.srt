Okay

32
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:36,256
Kevin we're going to start the show with a disclaimer if you have a thing against

33
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:38,304
I think they're crows they may be Ravens

34
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,584
This is not the show for you

35
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,352
Because I am

36
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:43,936
I'm doing this for the Pacific Northwest and there is a very

37
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:46,240
Excited black bird that really likes

38
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:48,032
So you're going to hear it throughout the

39
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:50,592
He's a fan of the show obviously but

40
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:53,408
I have to actually add a disclaimer to

41
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:59,808
Before we talk about some of these thing I am currently doing some freelance Consulting writing for Google a

42
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,856
It is specifically with Eric

43
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:08,000
Chrome OS Enterprise team has nothing to do with iot but just wanted to mention that cuz we will be talking about Google today

44
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,024
So much Google

45
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,072
Let's kick it off with

46
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,376
Next CEO

47
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:14,912
Out

48
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:15,680
So

49
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,728
Marwan fawaz

50
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:18,496
Joined

51
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:24,896
Google in 2016 and took over as CEO of nest

52
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:26,688
Aetna

53
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,712
Plus

54
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:30,272
Is part of the reporting on the story we learned it

55
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,808
Google did try to sell nest

56
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:33,088
To Amazon

57
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,904
So lot of stuff here

58
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,720
Yeah it all comes back to the same

59
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:43,072
Central theme that many of us had when Google bought nest

60
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,608
2 / 3.2 billion dollars

61
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:45,632
Back in 2014

62
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:47,424
Yeah that fart was

63
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,984
They paid 3.2 billion dollars which is a lie

64
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:54,080
And ever since then that's has just never seem to

65
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:59,456
Fit for whatever reason from a financial standpoint Google has a new CFO as of 20

66
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,736
15

67
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:03,040
That's Ruth Torah and

68
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:09,440
Having worked at Google Underoos not directly obviously but Google is very much more held accountable for its finances

69
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,464
Now and

70
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,024
So that's an issue right there if Nest is not making

71
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,304
Enough money to

72
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,840
Recoup the investment

73
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,632
Shirley doubted us then you've got

74
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:18,912
The issues that

75
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,704
Adele had with Google and

76
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:25,312
We say he stepped down but I think he may have been forced out that's just my thought

77
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:28,384
Yeah because yeah his management style was

78
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,920
Google

79
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,968
Too much

80
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:36,064
And if you remember Google also have their own smartphone

81
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,112
Same time so they were like parallel tracks

82
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:41,440
Set development Tony was focused on developing this

83
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:43,488
Crazy new thread protocol

84
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:46,048
Right and it wasn't focused on products

85
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,352
And they were forced to integrate Dropcam

86
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:50,144
It just it was naughty

87
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:51,424
Copacetic

88
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,472
So he was forced out

89
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:54,496
Then

90
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,056
Well and then

91
00:03:57,312 --> 00:04:03,456
Marlin came along and they put him in charge but as we're finding out he really wasn't around that much he lived in

92
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:06,784
Denver and the nestings in Palo Alto I believe

93
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,088
So there's some rumbling on that fact

94
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,392
Change in leadership may be the leader

95
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:14,976
Vision is an issue or wasn't if I don't know all-in-all what's happening hours

96
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,768
As you said I wanted out

97
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:17,791
And the

98
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:22,655
Nest team is now moving under the Google home and living room area

99
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:25,983
We just part of Google Hardware which is run by

100
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,007
Marlins

101
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:30,079
Motorola Powell Rick osterloh

102
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:32,127
So Nest should be under

103
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:32,895
In my opinion

104
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:34,175
The Google Hardware division

105
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:40,063
Because I need to be sharing the information and their efforts and projects with all of their hardwood addict

106
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:43,903
Cohesive line of products right now they don't I mean I still can't

107
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:47,231
Use Google home with certain Nest products for sale

108
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,767
Sample minutes

109
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,071
Weird yeah and nest

110
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:54,399
Had been pulled back in February that's was pulled back

111
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,167
Talking to

112
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:57,471
Google from an alphabet company

113
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:59,519
From being its own independent alphabet

114
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:04,895
And so this change that because if you're going to be pulled back in as a hardware company

115
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:07,967
Google you don't need your own CEO so this makes sense

116
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:09,503
It also made sense back when they

117
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,271
Hired

118
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:13,343
It felt like they were going to try to sell nest

119
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,111
Figure out what

120
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:14,879
To do with it

121
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:21,279
So in some ways this is good news for people who love nest care because it means that Google is not going to try to sell

122
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,327
They're just like okay we've got it

123
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,607
How to make the best of it

124
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,143
Start pulling all the stuff

125
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:31,775
So I agree with you there I can't help but wonder what would have happened if Amazon had bought it

126
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,335
Then we'd only have

127
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,967
Yeah I did I don't know & Shirley

128
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:40,735
Plank

129
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,015
And Ringwood

130
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:48,415
I'd still be there possibly be their own entities that I don't think they would be purchased by Amazon at this point they only

131
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,695
Right might have blank

132
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:51,743
As blank I think was much more of a hardware

133
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:55,071
Technology Center staff

134
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:57,375
Right here we go

135
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,423
Give so that's the latest on desk

136
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,727
As if you owned a scare I think this is good news

137
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,055
One more time

138
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,103
3.2 billion.

139
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:07,871
Okay I'm done

140
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:11,199
Remember that he D fun days

141
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,527
All right

142
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:17,087
Let's talk about Industrial iot

143
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:17,855
GE

144
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,159
Microsoft Cloud

145
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:23,743
So I talked about Microsoft Azure 4 years it is

146
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:26,047
Top cloud of choice for people building

147
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:28,095
GES

148
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,631
Decided

149
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:36,031
So they are going to be pulling together much more integration between the products appliances and software in

150
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,311
Services

151
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,079
And software

152
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:42,175
You're going to have more integration between Microsoft Azure Analytics

153
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,455
Azure iot

154
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,759
This is

155
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:49,599
Part of an ongoing seeing that we're seeing in the industrial iot which is

156
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:51,391
All the Defenders have realized

157
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:53,183
There's a couple realizations one

158
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:53,951
They realized

159
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:56,511
Way too hard to pull all the stuff together for

160
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,559
Companies that are not used to dealing with I

161
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,935
So GE has to work harder

162
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,471
Original GE was like

163
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:08,287
Hey we can do the it side too and they were building

164
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:10,335
Critics cloud and all this crazy stuff in

165
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,615
That's gone

166
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:14,431
So they realize that they should let it guys do the it

167
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:18,783
Do the industrial not stop

168
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,575
Work together to create the

169
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,111
Really tightly integrated pack

170
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,671
About calling this an end-to-end solution

171
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,999
But in this case it actually works

172
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,023
So that is

173
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:29,791
WhatsApp

174
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,351
We're seeing it happen all over

175
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:34,911
We're seeing companies like sap and

176
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:35,679
Sazon

177
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:36,447
Xeomin

178
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,471
All of them

179
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:40,287
Tying at these Cloud assets and even doing so

180
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,055
Some Partnerships

181
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:43,615
Vertically specific companies as well

182
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:45,151
So it's a big deal

183
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,431
Is another

184
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:48,223
For Microsoft

185
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,271
Credibility in the industrial

186
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,039
End

187
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:52,831
That's what this is

188
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:56,671
I don't claim to be an expert in Microsoft Azure cuz I'm certainly not

189
00:07:56,927 --> 00:08:03,071
That's not anything I've looked at in detail but one thing I did note in here and I don't know how true it is or isn't but one of the other benefits for

190
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:05,887
GE is to enhance the product

191
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:06,655
Platforms

192
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,679
Security layer

193
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:08,447
Thrasher

194
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:10,751
So that is always a good thing assuming that is true

195
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:19,711
Alright we'll speaking of GE we're going to move from their industrial stuff making jet airplane engines and all that

196
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,735
It's tough to

197
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,015
Their home appliances

198
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:26,879
They announced on Tuesday that they had created the GE smart

199
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:27,647
Microwave

200
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:29,439
This is a microwave

201
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,975
Is wifi connect

202
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:33,535
And is integrated with Madam

203
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,839
You basically can scan

204
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:40,703
3000 different microwavable products from Hot Pockets

205
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,031
Studio Cuisine and it will automatically know the instructions

206
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:44,799
Cooking time

207
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,335
Is popping in the microwave

208
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,407
Start the microwave

209
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,431
And then poop

210
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:54,271
What's amazing about this

211
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,551
Historical price

212
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,087
That's what Kevin thinks

213
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:59,647
The price is 125

214
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,183
Actually the MSRP

215
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,463
Which is the manufacturer

216
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,255
What is actually

217
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:05,791
Suggested retail price

218
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,071
There we go

219
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,375
So MSRP is 139

220
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,399
So my God

221
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,935
Oh you got to keep going

222
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,215
You feel like this is a

223
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:20,127
I think this is a great College thing although her college requires you to rent the microwaves that they provide but that's a whole nother

224
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:24,991
Absolutely I mean it's not a huge microwave at 2.9 cubic feet so

225
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:27,295
It is perfect for like a dorm

226
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,063
And

227
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:30,623
Yeah yeah I made it

228
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,671
And it's also not expensive

229
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:33,951
No it is

230
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:36,511
MSRP is 139 and then

231
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:39,327
As part of prime day they did a deal where they bundle this with

232
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,887
An Amazon Echo dot for 125

233
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,423
Now that's a visible

234
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,447
That deal will be

235
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,751
Today is not Friday

236
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,823
But it's pretty sweet

237
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,871
So here's what I'm excited

238
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:56,991
Kevin is rightly excited about the price but I'm excited because it's going to have What's called the

239
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,015
Cooking and time

240
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:58,783
Controllers with

241
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,551
Matamata

242
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,343
So consumers will be able to

243
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,623
Directly to her

244
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,415
Without using GE

245
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,439
Appliances

246
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:07,487
Basically natives

247
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,559
Cooking and time controller

248
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,095
Where's the Amazon has now added

249
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,631
So you no longer have to say

250
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:14,655
Anime

251
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:15,679
Ask

252
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:16,447
Geneva

253
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,727
To start the microwave

254
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:20,287
If you could just say Madam a start the microwave

255
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,311
So this is

256
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,335
Huge

257
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,615
I agree

258
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:26,943
Is signals one the creation of a new type of

259
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:27,967
Native skills

260
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,247
Matamata

261
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:34,111
Intuit signals that GE recognizes that asking Geneva for stuff is sucky

262
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:37,183
Well now I wonder I wonder how many other

263
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:39,487
Partnerships will come about once people start

264
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:42,815
Enjoying the fact that they don't have to name the skill and their command

265
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:44,095
What's up that's what I like

266
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:46,399
SP exclusive to GE

267
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,191
Opportunity for Amazon

268
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:50,239
This is just become

269
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,519
Everyone else could use it

270
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:57,151
Number two is that Delta faucet is working on an

271
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,687
Amazon integration

272
00:10:58,943 --> 00:10:59,455
4 faucet

273
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,991
Which means you'd have native

274
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,015
Support for

275
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,039
Turning your wife us

276
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,319
We talked about that last

277
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:08,415
So a lot of Hope in my heart that Amazon is

278
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,951
Trying so hard

279
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,999
To become the standard Slayer

280
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:12,767
4

281
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,047
Smart home and

282
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,071
This Market

283
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:19,935
J&D time if they can come up with standards that will eventually let's say

284
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:21,215
Have met him a work with

285
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:21,983
All

286
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:24,287
Madam a enabled voice services

287
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:29,919
Not have a skill for it all just have a API layer that will work with different brands and so I'm behind the scenes

288
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,199
That could be big

289
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:33,759
So not only is a microwave cool but how you talk

290
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:38,367
Speaking of the echo

291
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,135
Kevin

292
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,439
Do you want to upgrade your Echo

293
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,231
I do not

294
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:45,535
However that is a question we

295
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:50,911
Commonly hear from Friends colleagues and countrymen and women around the world and

296
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:51,935
I feel like we should give us

297
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:52,959
Special shout out to

298
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:55,519
We should he's in your backyard there because

299
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,287
Season

300
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,311
Washington State

301
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:59,103
Our old house

302
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,383
Yeah probably

303
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,431
Mr. Chris Albrecht who has

304
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:04,991
We work for them in the past to go home and

305
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:07,295
I know he's doing some podcasting work these days as well

306
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,063
It hasn't been

307
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,087
For a while but

308
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:11,391
Every once in awhile mr. Albrecht

309
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,951
Ping us and say Kevin Spacey

310
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:16,511
Can I get a new Echo is it time to upgrade my ago

311
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:17,791
Is there a new Echo coming out

312
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,815
Checking account now

313
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:19,583
How about now

314
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:20,607
So

315
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:25,471
Yes I'm making fun of course but it's actually a valid question and Rye Crist over at CNET

316
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:29,055
Poses that question in an article that both looked at before the show

317
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:34,175
I don't know let me try make some good points I mean you have to understand if you're going to buy a new Echo then you are

318
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,455
Committing further to

319
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:37,503
Being in the Amazon Echo

320
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:38,527
And that's fine

321
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,319
That's totally okay

322
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,343
Security guard

323
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:44,671
Without a doubt you and I are both happy and as are many other people

324
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:45,695
However

325
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:49,023
I like flexibility and I'm glad where I pointed this out

326
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,887
That's why I was kind of hot on the Sonos one because it came with Madam a

327
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:54,655
Out of the box

328
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,191
But he's also getting

329
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,471
Google Assistant

330
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:58,751
At some point this year.

331
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:01,823
Plan it did recently get AirPlay 2 as well for

332
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:02,847
Controlling music

333
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:03,615
Interior

334
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:05,151
IOS device by voice

335
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:10,527
With Siri but so I'm not interested in upgrading my echo I would still have an original one and

336
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,295
Any

337
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,063
.

338
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,087
And I'm fine

339
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,367
I don't see the need

340
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:18,975
Even the newer one with the Hub is just liking some radios for me so I can know thank you

341
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,535
And that would you recommend they buy this

342
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:22,559
-1 is a

343
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,607
If you have nothing

344
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,399
If you have nothing

345
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:28,703
I would say yes but

346
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,751
Cause you're not locked in

347
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,031
21 platform

348
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:36,639
If you want to be on the matinee Amazon platform you can do that today

349
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:40,223
If you decide I might get some things that might work better with

350
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,247
Google Home Products

351
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,015
Then

352
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,295
Can I give you an out

353
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:45,087
You can have both

354
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:46,623
That's what I

355
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:48,415
Confusing

356
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:51,999
Okay so yes and I have the original Echo that I bought

357
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:54,815
December of 2014

358
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:56,607
It still work

359
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:57,887
Sounds good

360
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:00,959
Why is making the point that maybe Amazon should update it

361
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,775
Is the market has changed significantly but I actually don't think

362
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:10,175
I think it's better that it hasn't changed significantly because it just becomes this based of ice that sits in your home and can

363
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:10,943
Controls everything

364
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,527
That's kind of the point of having software-based update

365
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,319
One of the benefits

366
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,087
Connectivity

367
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:22,207
So hungry. What should they upgraded to any women that have had newer versions

368
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:27,839
Come out they have upgraded it yeah so he's saying they need a new flagship line I say no this is like

369
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:31,679
It's almost becoming an appliance in your home that you just set and forget

370
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,215
Parks

371
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:34,751
I would like that a lot

372
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,287
All right

373
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,823
Let's talk about

374
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,127
Where Amazon

375
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:41,663
UPS

376
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,455
Is taking on Amazon key

377
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,223
Sort of

378
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,015
You want to talk about

379
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:47,551
Yeah UPS

380
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:50,879
Has announced that it's got a pilot program with latch

381
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:51,647
Smart Lock

382
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,951
4M building deliveries

383
00:14:54,207 --> 00:15:00,351
To multi-unit homes AKA apartments in such in New York City this is a trial program pilot Pro

384
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:06,495
Basically it's very similar to the Amazon key in that you know if you have a package and you live in it New York multi

385
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:10,079
Home UPS can now get in and leader package

386
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:13,407
It's not going to leave your package in your apartment

387
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,687
Or you're living

388
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,455
SpaceX

389
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:17,247
Just leave it in the building

390
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:23,903
So it's kind of limited in that regard it's not meant for single-family home such as what Amazon key is doing with their cat

391
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,951
Ameren Smart Lock and door there

392
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:26,975
Access to vehicles

393
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:30,047
Trunks as well so this is very limited by comparison

394
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,071
But it's a start

395
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,351
And it's great for this user

396
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,375
So I wrote about this

397
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,143
Does company

398
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,727
UPS working with the idea here is

399
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:40,031
There's a lot of apartments that don't have dorms

400
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:42,847
I went to New York City I had a

401
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:43,871
So

402
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:46,687
Apartment building

403
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:50,527
But the apartment building basically did not like a bail closet

404
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,063
You can

405
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,599
Get it and get your package

406
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,135
But the time comes

407
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,671
I think it's great

408
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:59,487
Is going to be useful for a lot of people

409
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,279
I'll have the traditional

410
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:02,559
Family homes

411
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:04,863
And it's a beauty big deal for latch

412
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:05,887
What is a startup

413
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:06,655
And

414
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:08,703
So I think it's really

415
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:09,727
I like it

416
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:12,031
Yeah two things come to mind one

417
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,823
I never knew you lived in New York City

418
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,127
I live here right after college

419
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,407
I didn't know you were deaf

420
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:24,319
To this could extend to other delivery services I'm thinking like pizza Chinese food etcetera

421
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,599
Is very common

422
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:27,391
Yes yes yes

423
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:33,279
The latch door locks they control access in and out of public areas in these apartments but they also

424
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,303
Can be placed

425
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,583
Residence

426
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:36,351
Stores

427
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,119
As well

428
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,655
So what can happen there then

429
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:40,703
Is this could go further

430
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:46,591
UPS probably doesn't want it to go further cuz they don't want their delivery guy having to go down an apartment making all these deliveries that seems

431
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:49,407
Crazy when you dump it in the mail closet

432
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,431
But yes

433
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,199
Spur

434
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,735
Service providers

435
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:53,759
4

436
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,039
Pizza delivery whatever

437
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,319
Grocery deliveries

438
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,903
You could say latch has a foot in the door

439
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:09,631
All right also in the luck news World a similar startup this is a startup called open path they just raised 20

440
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:10,655
Million dollars in

441
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:13,215
Instead of residential locks you guys are providing

442
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:15,519
Smartphone-based access to building

443
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:16,287
Offices

444
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:18,079
So they are

445
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,359
Very similar except

446
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,895
I think of it kind of like August

447
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,175
It's partially because I went to Oz

448
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,199
Blocks

449
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:26,527
Officers when they were starting out in these guys give

450
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:28,319
Smartphone access to

451
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:30,879
A building so the say instead of having your like

452
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,415
NFC card

453
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,439
RFID Card

454
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,207
Whatever

455
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:36,767
I've only worked in one building where I've had a card

456
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,047
Situations

457
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:42,655
But this election

458
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:45,983
Large amount of money

459
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,263
Doing this for

460
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,543
About two years

461
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,079
So it looks like

462
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,639
We're kind of slowly upgrading our access infrastructure

463
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,967
And we actually have a lock

464
00:17:56,223 --> 00:18:00,831
Related question and I are listening to voicemail a little bit later on the show I just want to point that out because

465
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:06,207
There seems to be a very big difference between industrial War office Enterprise locking and unlocking

466
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:07,743
I'll leave it at that for now

467
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:08,511
Yes

468
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:10,303
Okay find a lot story for you

469
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,095
August

470
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,375
Says it has

471
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,911
1 million users

472
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,703
Users

473
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:18,495
Users not

474
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,287
Customers with law

475
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,335
Yale locks sold

476
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,103
So

477
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,383
I don't have an August lock on

478
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,687
But I am technically an August user

479
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:27,711
Because I have a

480
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:31,039
And my husband is also a user

481
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,063
Because he is

482
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,111
Are you sure on that doorbell as well so

483
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:37,183
We are at least 250 million with our August doorbell

484
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,463
The question is

485
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:39,999
How many locks

486
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:44,863
All right it's a milestone for them for trying to downplay but I'm trying to keep it in perspective as well

487
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:47,935
Yes and Nesta sold more than a million

488
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:49,983
Mystats we found out that the Arlo geyser

489
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:52,799
Just sold more than 7 million Arlo products

490
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:56,895
Sonos devices

491
00:18:57,151 --> 00:19:03,295
So what do you think about those numbers in the context of the us having a hundred million households about 310

492
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,319
10 million people

493
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,343
You know the Smart Home

494
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,647
Got a lot of room to grow

495
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,207
We're not yours

496
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:15,327
Speaking of the August doorbell Apple Insider has noticed

497
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,607
Apple his

498
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:19,679
Purge the doorbell category from the homekit

499
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:20,447
Accessories

500
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:21,983
And it is indeed

501
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:22,751
True

502
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:24,799
So it suggests that

503
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:27,359
August and ring doorbells that

504
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:30,943
We were promised to give us homekit support which meant you could open the home app

505
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:33,247
And see what was happening on those devices

506
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,527
It seems that may not happen

507
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:38,879
This is a big deal for people especially on the ringside because the ring folks have been

508
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,415
Promise homekit support

509
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,951
4 years

510
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:44,767
And they've just never gotten it so

511
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:46,815
Apple has not commented yet

512
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:51,167
On the story it is unlikely that they will say anything substitutive because it is

513
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:54,495
But this is worth noting if your

514
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:57,055
NFL fan of these doorbells and homekit

515
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:59,615
I'm a little surprised that apple

516
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:05,759
Elvis just wondering what they had in mind because it is not like them to have a suite of products and have a gap in that sweet

517
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:12,671
Yes but it could be that the security implementation for homekit just doesn't work on basically what is a battery pack

518
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:15,231
Powered wifi-connected device that supposed to

519
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:15,999
Glassboro

520
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,535
It does feel

521
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:20,607
Wired

522
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:26,239
I don't know if you could be power that is you're absolutely right I kind of feel like Apple

523
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:29,055
They want Simplicity with their protocols but as a result

524
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,359
They have limiting options

525
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:32,383
Okay

526
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:33,919
Moving from

527
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:34,687
Locks

528
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:35,711
Let's talk about

529
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:42,879
Cars not the movie but cars that we drive or the drive us I had not heard of this company

530
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:44,159
I'm about to talk about Bruce Lee

531
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:45,183
It's called

532
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:45,951
Zoosk

533
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:47,999
I hope I'm saying that right it's a z

534
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,279
Oox

535
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:51,583
Basically it is a startup

536
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:54,399
That believes autonomous cars should be built

537
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:59,519
From scratch applying sensors and everything else that we need all the smart summer planning

538
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:01,311
You currently available vehicles

539
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:03,871
Is not the way to go it's a very radical take

540
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:08,223
He was a very good profile on this company and the CEO

541
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:10,271
Add Bloomberg to learn a lot from reading it

542
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:13,343
They're basically trading robot taxis

543
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:17,952
Autonomous taxis the ticket of very different approach again they are filling from scratch

544
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:18,720
And

545
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,256
It's a bidirectional

546
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:25,888
Taxi it literally we can go forward or backwards at the same speed so that's kind of unique in some sense

547
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:29,472
Compared to today's traditional cars they have to do other testing with

548
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:31,264
Currently available cars that can tow

549
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,824
Put their own cars on the road yet because I just don't have

550
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,848
Penis look like

551
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:37,664
Sand dune buggies right now just frames essential

552
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:42,272
It's very interesting though they're going to have the sensors actually communicate to other cars

553
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,808
Are there drivers I should say

554
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:46,112
With a long LED strips and such

555
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:50,464
To suggest that hey there's a problem further up ahead that I noticed you should be aware of it or

556
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,768
I'm going to make a right turn now and

557
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:54,560
It's all clear ahead of me Etc

558
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:57,376
It's just a unique take on things and

559
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:59,168
Kind of interested to follow

560
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,960
Especially because they really stepped out

561
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:06,080
Not about papers 800 million that was the other big news for them 500 million in early July

562
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:07,104
Very recently

563
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:11,712
That is an evaluation of 3.2 billion dollar so clearly the investors

564
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:13,504
Support them and see Vision here

565
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,784
It'll be interesting follow

566
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:18,112
There's a huge Market

567
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:22,208
A huge market for a delivery vehicles for

568
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,488
Industrial

569
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:26,304
Self-driving car so why the heck not

570
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,608
Alright also in the car world

571
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:29,376
Light

572
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:35,264
Which is a camera company has just raised another big round of funding 121 million

573
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:36,544
Self-driving cars

574
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,592
Yes light is

575
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:41,408
Probably better known if you know them at all that is

576
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:46,272
As a camera company in their camera looks like a smartphone innocence but it has

577
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:48,832
16 different sensors and lenses

578
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,648
And most smartphones today at best come with

579
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:54,720
Maybe two rear facing cameras this has again 6

580
00:22:54,976 --> 00:23:01,120
The reason they do that is because they use software and AI to create the best possible photo using

581
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:04,192
16 different viewpoints in a sense and sensor for me

582
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,472
All of these sensors

583
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:10,080
And it's really a cool idea that camera alone is $2,000 again for 500 smart

584
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:13,152
Price on DSLR like that it's just a handheld

585
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:15,200
$2,000 intelligent camera

586
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:16,736
The weather doing has

587
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:18,528
And why just raise money

588
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:21,344
They are planning to sell the camera technology

589
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,880
Tu connected car

590
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:29,280
Companies because a lot of these car companies are using I would say off-the-shelf camera components but they're using things that are red

591
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:33,632
Readily available lidar obviously is not something that I would say readily available and inexpensive

592
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:35,680
But from a camera perspective

593
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:39,520
There's not a whole lot of amazing new technology being used in can I see cars

594
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:45,920
So this could extend the vision capabilities of are connected cars which in turn would obviously given more information at be

595
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:47,712
Smarter and perhaps even cut costs

596
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,272
Because maybe they would need to use as many lidar and other sensors

597
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,808
Wow that would be

598
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:53,600
Pro getting rid of light

599
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:55,136
A $10,000 Tesla

600
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:56,672
Okay

601
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:58,208
So that was our

602
00:23:58,464 --> 00:23:59,232
Smart Car news

603
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:01,024
Kevin you want to talk about the ticwatch

604
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:07,680
I do we don't talk about too many wearables these days just because that market seems to have slowed down in terms of energy

605
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:09,728
Vacation but there is

606
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:10,496
The ticwatch

607
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:14,848
Pro is now available and it is an Android Wear OS smartwatch

608
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:20,480
Personally I'm not a fan of where OS I got away from the Android Smartwatch platform once

609
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:23,808
Start use a nap a lot to me and I just was more consistently

610
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:27,136
Stable for me added features usability was better Etc

611
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:29,696
So I think Google has a lot to do with wear OS

612
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:32,512
However the ticwatch pro is

613
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:38,144
Kind of unique in that it sells one of the major issues with wear OS watches that is battery life

614
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,936
So what this device has

615
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:44,032
It hasn't what you'd expect like a 400 by 400 resolution OLED display

616
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,312
But on top of that

617
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:47,104
There's an LCD display that's

618
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,128
Transparent

619
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:49,152
So

620
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:55,552
It has two modes one isn't always on mode with that low-power LCD display that can show some basic information and the other

621
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:56,832
OLED display

622
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:58,880
For using you don't certain apps that work

623
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:01,696
Android Wear OS wechat music app store

624
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:02,720
Exercise app

625
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:03,744
And so on so

626
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,864
What does does it really resolve the whole issue of really poor battery life cuz I have not found it

627
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,400
Two or three day battery

628
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:12,192
Life watch with wear OS

629
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:13,728
Typically Monday at best

630
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:19,104
I just buy Apple watch I can sometimes get too so I don't want to you know too many conclusions there but

631
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:25,760
You can go for days and days on this two days on Smart Mode when it switches back and forth between the displays

632
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:27,296
Multiple days

633
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:29,856
30 days and just what they call Essential mode

634
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:33,952
So that is the LCD watch face always on

635
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:37,536
So it's a nice balance I thought it was an interesting use of Technology

636
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:38,304
So

637
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,608
Good news on a possible watch Aldo

638
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:43,168
Android Wear but you also have

639
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:51,360
Yeah real quick little Pro tip if you have a Fire HD device the current one the tablet I actually have one so this is how I feel

640
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,640
Found out with a software update

641
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:57,248
I was a week or two ago the Amazon said hey we could have Fire HD tablet charging stand

642
00:25:57,504 --> 00:26:00,320
And that will turn your tablet into an Echo Show when it's

643
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,088
In this

644
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:01,856
Turning Stone

645
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:04,160
Will turns out you don't need the stand

646
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:07,232
You just need to have your tablet plugged in

647
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:10,816
And I found that out again through software updated explained all that to me so

648
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:17,216
I have a case that doubles as a stand for my tablet I just leave it in there and plug it in and now I feel Echo Show capable

649
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:19,520
Without having to buy Amazon

650
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:22,336
Starting to see how you feel about

651
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:26,688
Special capabilities I'm not 100%

652
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:30,016
I never was sold on it to see if it wins me over

653
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,040
There you go

654
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:32,064
All right

655
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,112
Thank you for that Pro tip and now

656
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:35,392

On July 31st

671
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:04,320
Remember

672
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:05,344
Smarter homes

673
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:06,368
Start with

674
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,392
Schlage

675
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:09,696
Okay this week's voicemail is from

676
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:10,720
Rob

677
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:13,792
Hi Stacy this is Rob Lowe in Chicago

678
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:18,912
We are doing a commercial build out of her office spaces and looking to do some kind of Bluetooth

679
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:23,264
Door lock for both our offices as well as other folks in the building

680
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,032
However

681
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:26,080
I know a decal won't work

682
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:27,616
Ana commercial space

683
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:28,640
Need to be able to push it open

684
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:29,664
From the inside

685
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,224
So wondering if there is a commercial version of a

686
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,784
Schlage archival or anything like that

687
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,064
Thanks have a great day

688
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:37,856
Rob

689
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,136
This is a good question

690
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:40,160
Really glad you asked it

691
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:42,464
And we came up with a couple Solutions

692
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,000
You're very expensive

693
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:46,560
One of them we think is actually probably opt

694
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:49,632
Which is buying a

695
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:50,912
Bluetooth lock

696
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:51,936
From a company called

697
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:55,520
Ultraloq that is ultraloq with an l o q

698
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:58,336
Actually if you have a deadbolt this lock won't work because

699
00:27:58,592 --> 00:27:59,104
It

700
00:27:59,360 --> 00:27:59,872
Cover up your Deadpool

701
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:04,736
So this is waterproof so you can do indoor and outdoor

702
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:06,016
You can use a fingerprint

703
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:07,040
A cold

704
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:09,344
Or a key to unlock but you have to

705
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,904
To pick a fingerprint or a code you can't do both

706
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:17,024
And it is Bluetooth enabled so that means you can't do it remotely

707
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,816
Does wifi bridge but

708
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:22,656
People seem to like it except for the fact that they don't love the

709
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,960
Functionality so I would say go key code

710
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,568
Yeah definitely that would be the way to go get rid of biometrics

711
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:35,456
So that you said say say this does not require attack it won't work or the Deadpool it works with a traditional lock

712
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:36,480
Door strike

713
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:39,040
Doesn't look like it belongs in an office because it's

714
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:40,576
Satin nickel hits

715
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:42,368
Believer and

716
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:44,672
Battery powered obviously because

717
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:46,208
No power to your door

718
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:49,280
And it's only 199 from

719
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:50,560
Smart Home

720
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:52,096
Cam

721
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:57,984
Which I think is pretty reasonable considering this is really a very unique lock and that its Bluetooth without a deadbolt

722
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,776
Oh and I saw its

723
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:02,080
145 99 on Home Depot

724
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:06,688
Who was out there you go there you go it does work with Android and iOS

725
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:08,224
And with the app

726
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,808
You can knock on your display screen if you have IOS

727
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:12,832
Or you can shake

728
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:16,672
Your Android phone to unlock on either one of those platforms

729
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:18,208
Mexican Andy

730
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,232
Until

731
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:20,512
Any other weird

732
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:21,280
Category

733
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:23,584
I don't even know how to think about this

734
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:24,864
There is a

735
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,888
Comedy called haven

736
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,680
Is Hayden lock.com

737
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:29,984
And this is instead of a

738
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:30,752
Door lock

739
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:32,288
This is actually

740
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:34,592
Bar that you either screw into your floor

741
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:36,640
Beer fluoride

742
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:40,736
Little unclear about the install there in this bar actually has a little

743
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:44,064
Thumbs up

744
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,856
Pops in front of your door and prevents it

745
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:48,416
From opening so this is smartphone tested

746
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,696
This works with a smartphone

747
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:50,464
And

748
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,488
I don't even know what to say

749
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:57,888
Save-A-Lot when it's unlocked when it's unlock a little pop-up art is down into the base of it and the door can freely

750
00:29:58,912 --> 00:29:59,936
Is Bluetooth enabled

751
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:00,704
10

752
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,472
When you

753
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:04,032
Want the door lock that little section pops back up

754
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:06,848
It keeps the door from opening it's been interesting it's like a

755
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:08,384
Extending the Seal of a door

756
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,408
Are door frame

757
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:12,480
And just having something that blocks the door from opening so

758
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:14,016
You can step on it to lock it

759
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:14,784
Kind of interests

760
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,552
But it's not cheap

761
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:17,344
And it is kind of odd

762
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:18,624
It's 349

763
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:24,512
So is this is important to you and I can't imagine how this gets installed in carpet but

764
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,584
If this works for you and you like to look at this it's

765
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:35,008
They say it's 10 times stronger than a Deadpool and it sort of makes sense because a deadbolt is rather small compared to the large Center

766
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:37,568
Pop-up section of this that has more surface

767
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:38,848
Knots to the door

768
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,896
Yes they do have a tape

769
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:42,688
They have a tape install

770
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:43,968
So you use

771
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:45,504
3M VHB tape

772
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:46,784
And 3 m is like

773
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,064
Secret winner in this market

774
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,344
You guys I mean how much

775
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:52,160
3M double-sided tape have item play them

776
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:55,744
For me it's command strips but that's because a lot of things are temporary for test

777
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:58,304
Yes so those are the options

778
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,864
I also was looking because I saw this in this house

779
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,144
Fairly common

780
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,728
I think I saw it at csrc. But a magnetic lock that

781
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:07,520
They're basically electromagnetic

782
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:10,080
Things that you use to replace your

783
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:12,896
Lock cylinder and then also the key stripe

784
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:17,504
The inside of the door frame and those basically when you

785
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:21,088
The clothes when there's electricity running through activating these magnets

786
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:21,856
And then

787
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:26,976
Turn off my electricity and then I can unlock the door they do require

788
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:31,328
Power and they also I didn't find anything that was bluetooth enabled

789
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,888
So you may look for something like that if you

790
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:36,448
Do you have like an existing smart home system cuz a lot of

791
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:40,032
Companies offer that but otherwise and that's actually cheaper you can buy

792
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:41,056
Something to replace you

793
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:43,104
Door cylinder for like 60 bucks

794
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,408
Assuming you have liar power available to the door

795
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:46,176
Yes

796
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,736
But you got to have power in

797
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:49,504
It's not going to be blue

798
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:52,064
So those are the things we found

799
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:52,832
And

800
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:53,600
Hopefully

801
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:56,928
Actually call us back let us know what you chose or if you hate all of your apps

802
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:00,256
That does it for this segment

803
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:01,280
The show

804
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,560
Stay tuned for

805
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:03,584
Mark Allen

806
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:05,888
Jacuzzi he's going to talk about how

807
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:06,912
Company

808
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:08,448
Has connected their hot tubs

809
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:11,008
What products be used and a lot more

810
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:12,288
In the meantime

811
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:18,688
Here's a message for this week sponsor a pharaoh hey everyone we are taking a break from this week's I

812
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:25,088
Iot podcast for a message from our sponsor this week sponsor is a pharaoh and I have a pharaoh CEO joke

813
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:26,368
Albert here to talk to us

814
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:28,416
So let's start with what is

815
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:32,000
A pharaoh Pharaoh is a fully upgraded fully Interactive

816
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:35,328
Fully secure sensor to Cloud iot platform

817
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:36,864
Our customers choose a p

818
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:41,984
Because they can cut down their time-to-market by as much as 80% which cuts down on

819
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:42,752
Cost and

820
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:45,056
Complexity

821
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:48,896
The affair of service and how they can reuse 90% of their work

822
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:51,968
Project in consumers love how easy it is

823
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:55,552
Just to get their devices connected and how fast and responsive they operate

824
00:32:56,064 --> 00:33:01,696
UK and last week we talked about the work that you've done with Kenmore at this week we're going to dive deeper into the security you guys

825
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:03,488
So tell me about your secure

826
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:10,400
Security is a big deal and it's only going to get more important both for businesses and consumers

827
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:11,424
The challenge though

828
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:15,008
Is the iot is an end-to-end kind of Technology

829
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:16,288
And so is secure

830
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,312
Jamaica

831
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:18,080
He trustworthy

832
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:19,360
Not only do you have to

833
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:20,896
Secure all of the data path

834
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:21,920
But you also have to see

835
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:22,944
Your identities

836
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:24,224
Build security with

837
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,552
Resilience and then you also have to secure the manufacturing process

838
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:28,576
Supply chain

839
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:31,136
So what is it mean to be able to ensure Trust

840
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:32,160
Throughout the supply chain

841
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:34,208
If you think of your PC

842
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,280
And their firewalls also

843
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:39,584
The place in malware still continues to get

844
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:41,888
So we know you have to go

845
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:43,424
Beyond secure data path

846
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:45,472
Devices

847
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:46,752
Don't have a lot of love

848
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:47,776
Processing power

849
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:50,080
So we really need a different strategy

850
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:53,920
Compared to the PC or smartphone

851
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:55,712
Also have a much longer life

852
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:57,760
PC and you have to ensure

853
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:58,528
Did their secure

854
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:03,648
5 years 10 years 20 years on this will be the next Battle Ground

855
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:05,696
When you have to go beyond just securing

856
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:08,000
Potato Patch

857
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,024
Formatting mine

858
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:11,584
Text one

859
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,352
Building Trust

860
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:13,376
Kitchen Hardware

861
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:15,936
In the right place is in the process and to

862
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:17,984
Integrating them into the rest of

863
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,032
Decentralized iot stack

864
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:21,056
Across multiple

865
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:27,200
Protocols if you're using a communication protocol built on TCP IP this is relatively straightforward

866
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:29,504
But if you're using something else like Bluetooth

867
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,528
It's not straight

868
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,112
To dress this we came up with two very useful inventions

869
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:36,416
One something that we refer to as an

870
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:37,184
Estem

871
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:37,952
Coyote

872
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:42,304
This is similar to the SIM card in your smartphone but it's a hardware root of trust for

873
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,328
The device

874
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,096
Second

875
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:48,192
Something we call VPN for iot what are the shortcomings of

876
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:51,776
Historically has been that it works only over TCP IP network

877
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:53,568
So this is not totally appropriate

878
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:54,336
Propriety

879
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,640
We've developed technology that overcomes these

880
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:59,200
Okay so in practice how does this process work

881
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:00,480
There's a hard word of trust

882
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:06,880
It's built in a secure facility that enables us to build the rest of the system at not secure facilities and then we use that

883
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:07,648
Cryptographically

884
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,488
The device is who it says it is when it connects

885
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:14,048
That sounds great so where can we go to find out

886
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,608
The best place is a pharaoh. IO

887
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:23,008

888
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,640
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast

889
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:32,480
This is your host Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest is Mark

890
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:34,528
Alan who's VP of it

891
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:35,808
Add jacuzzi

892
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:37,344
Hi Mark how are you doing

893
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,624
Good how you doing Stacy

894
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,696
Man I have to say I'm really excited because

895
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:42,976
Where can we talk about connect

896
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:46,048
I also

897
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:49,376
So before we started recording I learned a little bit about hot tub

898
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:51,424
I'm going to give you guys the same

899
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,704
Benefit so

900
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,240
Mark briefly tell us

901
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:58,848
The journey that you guys are on a Jacuzzi when did you launch your connected products and

902
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,384
Refit on why

903
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,944
We've been looking at this iot Plaza

904
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:09,088
For quite a while back when it was you don't machine-to-machine and trying to figure out when the right time was to Diamonds.

905
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:13,184
No pun intended but we wants the initiative back

906
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,720
In June of last year

907
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:17,024
And it was a really quick production cycle

908
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,864
We dedicated a few people from the company and partnered with particle

909
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,656
Man from Jason partner perspective

910
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:25,472
And a very rapid implementation

911
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:26,240
Cycle

912
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:31,360
And launched our first product went down a manufacturing line in November of last year

913
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:34,432
Wow and you now told me that they're like

914
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:36,224
500 of these guys

915
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,248
Out in the fields that are

916
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:39,040
Thousand out in the field

917
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:39,808
And half of them

918
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:41,088
That's correct

919
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:42,112
Yeah we're still names

920
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:43,648
Itsy bitsy. So far as

921
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:44,416
Phenomenal

922
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:48,256
So we're going to talk about what you guys have learned from this we're also going to talk about the

923
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:49,280
The process of

924
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:50,560
Connecting these things

925
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:52,096
And get into why

926
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:55,680
So let's start with what are the benefits for a consumer

927
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:57,216
Who is buying a connected

928
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:59,264
And then what are the benefits for

929
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:03,360
Yeah from a consumer perspective we've had an Apple mobile app

930
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:04,128
In the past

931
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:05,664
That you can control your hot tub

932
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,248
And that's obviously the first dentist said if it connected hot tub is sick

933
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:10,784
Consumer can control their hot tub

934
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,320
So from a vacation

935
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:13,088
Homer some

936
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:14,880
Monster on their way home

937
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:18,720
From work and they want to eat the hot tub up a couple of degrees

938
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:19,744
Let's ready for when

939
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,280
Make it home they have that obvious

940
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:23,328
Above and beyond that

941
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:25,120
The true iot hot tub

942
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:27,424
They get the additional benefit of the hot tub unit

943
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,448
Communicate back

944
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:30,496
So maintenance reminders

945
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:31,520
I have to replace

946
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:32,288
Filters

947
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,080
As well as

948
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:34,848
The ability to

949
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:35,616
To get air noise

950
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:36,640
Application so happy

951
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:37,408
Don't forget something

952
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:38,176
What's wrong with that

953
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:39,712
That are notification

954
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:41,248
To them as well as

955
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:42,016
Comes to us

956
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:43,296
As well as notified

957
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:45,600
Local dealer so action can be taken on the

958
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:48,160
And your initial thought maybe

959
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:49,952
How important is air notice

960
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:50,976
Vacation in a hot tub

961
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:55,584
But with a hot tub is in an area where it freezes and it's a vacation home

962
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,864
Someplace that you don't

963
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:57,632
Visit on reggae

964
00:37:57,888 --> 00:37:59,168
Basis in a power goes out

965
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,448
Or iot device

966
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:01,216
Asus battery backup

967
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:02,496
Got that your notification

968
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:05,056
Because now you only have a certain amount

969
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:07,872
Time to drain a hot tub or restore the power

970
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:09,408
Before damage

971
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:12,480
So the dealer or the

972
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:13,760
Consumer can take Act

973
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:14,784
Prior to damage

974
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:16,576
Wow

975
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:18,112
Okay I'm like sitting here

976
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:19,136
Like I know nothing about

977
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:21,696
So you guys sell your hot

978
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:22,976
2

979
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:24,000
People not

980
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:28,352
Right here we have an independent dealer Network and we still are hot tubs today in Des Peres theater

981
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:30,400
So some of your thousand

982
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:32,704
Connected hot tubs are probably sitting around

983
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,264
Inventory dealers as opposed to

984
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,288
Consumers not coming

985
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:39,104
Yeah it's true it's the right now we're in the process

986
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,384
Assuming those hot tubs.

987
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,920
What's the dealers in Salinas

988
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:44,736
Supply chain so all of those hot tubs 1000 hot tubs

989
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:46,272
The $500 right now

990
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:49,344
Disconnect consumers backyard and the other five

991
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:52,160
Okay so let's

992
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:57,792
Talk about those 500 hot tubs what have you learned so far I don't know if you've seen a lot of Arab

993
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:59,840
What do you learn from

994
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:00,864
The 500

995
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:03,680
We've learned quite a bit about the process of iot

996
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:07,776
So we are on probably our I would say 8

997
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:08,800
18 Federation

998
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:09,824
From lunch

999
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,872
I've just fine-tuning ever

1000
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:12,896
Everything from

1001
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:14,944
The firmware upgrade advantage

1002
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,992
Price of doing coyote

1003
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:18,272
Keep us on the way we did it is

1004
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:20,064
Firmware

1005
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,112
Servicing from the firmware to the

1006
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:22,880
Marshall application

1007
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:24,928
So we've learned a lot about her

1008
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:26,464
Consumers in the we're also

1009
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,488
Have just launched

1010
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:28,768
In-app purchasing

1011
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:32,608
So the idea being that when a maintenance notification is given to a user

1012
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:33,376
Result

1013
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:36,704
Replacement for example we know exactly which

1014
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,472
Hot tubs

1015
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:38,240
Summer house

1016
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:43,360
So they don't have to hunt around about which filter fits their hot tub when they get a maintenance notice

1017
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:46,944
Application that they need a filter replacement they can immediately click on to

1018
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:50,016
And they are directed it exactly

1019
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,088
It is that through the dealer or is that Direct

1020
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:54,368
ESO

1021
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:56,160
The way it's set up today is it

1022
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:58,464
Direct from us and then we do a pro C

1023
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,488
Feedback to their local

1024
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,024
In the future we'd like

1025
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:01,792
Like to set it up

1026
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:02,816
The point where it seems

1027
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:05,632
Soaked through the dealer and then they will also have an option

1028
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:06,912
Pick that up in there

1029
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,472
Okay cuz this is a really interesting

1030
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:10,752
Conundrum for many

1031
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:13,056
Companies when they're dealing with the dealer Network

1032
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:14,080
And attract

1033
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:17,152
So how did you guys approach your dealers

1034
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:18,688
When you were watching this in

1035
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:19,712
Cut them into

1036
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:20,480
The process

1037
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:21,248
I don't know what

1038
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:23,040
Is it still important in this day and age to have

1039
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:25,088
Yes absolutely important for us

1040
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:25,856
A couple of different

1041
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:29,184
This one is our dealers not only seller hot tubs

1042
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,208
But they also service

1043
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:33,536
And then from a tumor perspective hot tub

1044
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:34,560
You know it's an important

1045
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:35,584
Purchase it says

1046
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,352
Significant

1047
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:37,120
Much like a

1048
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:39,168
So we encourage our can

1049
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:41,216
Somerset actually do what we call wet

1050
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:44,800
Physically go to a dealer to sit in a hot tub into a wet

1051
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,848
Hot tubs are very different

1052
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:49,408
Not only by brand but also by model

1053
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:52,224
To encourage them to go into a dealer and actually do a wet test

1054
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:52,992
Before they purchase

1055
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:56,832
So do you or critical in that sense and they also are the ones that

1056
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:57,600
Do the actual answer

1057
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:58,368
Installation of God

1058
00:40:59,136 --> 00:40:59,904
To the approach

1059
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,696
To our dealers was at this

1060
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:04,000
Benefit the dealer from being able to

1061
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:04,768
Provide

1062
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:07,840
A connected hot tub and then also from a dealer for

1063
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:11,168
We give the dealer a portal that enables them to

1064
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:12,448
Co-star

1065
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:14,752
Disconnected hot tubs

1066
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:15,520
What's the status

1067
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:18,592
And then also any error message

1068
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:20,640
Respect

1069
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:21,920
Station quickly

1070
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:23,200
CNE hot tubs

1071
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:25,760
Have errors and then they can also run remote

1072
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,320
So from a dealer perspective

1073
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:29,088
Huge fan

1074
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,136
In the past they would get a call from

1075
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:32,160
Consumers

1076
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:36,000
And they would roll is an was going to everything in it

1077
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:37,280
I hoping that they have

1078
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,048
What's needed

1079
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:40,864
Now they run remote diagnostic

1080
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,912
Annie's got a pretty good idea what's wrong with

1081
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:44,192
Hot tub before they go out

1082
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:49,056
And I bet there's actually some really interesting things

1083
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:50,848
I'm assuming type Geographic

1084
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:53,151
Custard so if I sell

1085
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:55,711
I got X number of hot tubs in my service area

1086
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:56,479
There's like

1087
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:57,759
If it's going to freeze break

1088
00:41:58,527 --> 00:42:00,319
You could send out a friendly warning

1089
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:01,855
Establishes relationship

1090
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:02,879
Ongoing relationship

1091
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:04,415
That's exactly

1092
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:10,047
And what about you guys because I know in some Industries like the insurance industry freaks

1093
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:11,327
Temple there is also

1094
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:17,215
It's not exactly a dealer network but there's there's a middleman and they're looking at connector products

1095
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:23,615
Bypass them but get more information on their customers and understand what they need and establish a direct relationship with

1096
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:25,407
Securities if you're looking at

1097
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:26,431
Doing that somehow

1098
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:27,199
All is well

1099
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:29,247
We see the value in the data

1100
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:31,039
Right so yeah that's

1101
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:32,063
Phenomenal

1102
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:33,599
Solana park for eyes

1103
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:35,391
So looking at the data.

1104
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:36,415
Coming in from all of us

1105
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:38,463
So in the past

1106
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:40,255
Any data that we were receiving

1107
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:41,535
The hot tub was warranty

1108
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:43,327
You type data in that warranty dated

1109
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:44,095
Was coming in

1110
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:45,119
From a

1111
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:47,935
Technician that was out in the field and repairing a hot

1112
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:49,983
And say hey here's what it heard in

1113
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:52,799
Right to his only when we receiving date it was

1114
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:55,615
And that was a human interaction

1115
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:57,919
Certification for

1116
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:00,479
Now the day that we're getting in the hot tub

1117
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:03,295
Is not only errors but it's also any type of that

1118
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:04,319
Activity that's going on in

1119
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:07,903
Hot tubs we can see FaceTime temperature how much the

1120
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:09,439
Just turned on how much

1121
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:11,999
Turned on when there are errors week

1122
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:13,279
Correlation between

1123
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:14,559
Between those errors

1124
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:16,351
And other things that are going on in

1125
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:19,167
Hottub usage temperature all kinds

1126
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:21,215
So the data for us

1127
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:22,239
Scream lyrics

1128
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:24,799
The other part of it too is

1129
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:26,079
Nunnally correlation

1130
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:27,615
But then also

1131
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:28,383
Future product

1132
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:30,687
So in the past we would go out with

1133
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:31,711
We would survey

1134
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:32,735
100 users

1135
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:33,759
Hunter customer

1136
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:36,063
What's important in a hot tub

1137
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:38,623
Now we have that data and it's not only a hundred.

1138
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:40,159
Will eventually be Oliver

1139
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:42,719
So will definitely Drive

1140
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:43,743
Product

1141
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:44,767
And that's a

1142
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:46,815
Huge mean that the value of that is

1143
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:47,839
Unbelievable

1144
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:52,447
Oh yeah and a lot of people tend to say oh my gosh that sounds amazing I would totally use that

1145
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:53,215
And then

1146
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:56,287
Okay let's talk about the process a little bit

1147
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:59,359
When you guys made this decision you said you worked

1148
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:00,639
Particle

1149
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:02,431
I mean it is not as simple as saying

1150
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:05,759
Someone calling up and saying Hey I want some iot on my Jacuzzis

1151
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:08,319
You're like who talk to you about this wear today

1152
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:11,135
Order come from and how did you start approaching this as a

1153
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:12,159
Problem to solve

1154
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:15,743
Yeah like I said we had a review of some application mobile app

1155
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:16,511
Controller Hut

1156
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:17,535
And

1157
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:20,863
We had been thinking about doing some type of connector

1158
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,143
Hot tub

1159
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:26,751
So we were looking at doing long before we knew really what I was he was

1160
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:29,311
Thinking about doing a machine-to-machine kind of

1161
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:31,103
And we've been thinking about that

1162
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:33,919
3 years and we had approached two different companies

1163
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:36,991
Thanks for doing something like that and it had just never found

1164
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:37,759
The Wright company

1165
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:38,527
Need a partner with

1166
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:42,111
And then we actually was our CEO had that I think

1167
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:43,647
Been sitting on a flight neck

1168
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:45,183
To one of the CEOs

1169
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:47,231
Vertical and just had been talking

1170
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:49,279
About it and that sparked interest

1171
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:50,559
And that's what beginning

1172
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:51,327
Discussion

1173
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:55,167
In the particle partnership was it just was a perfect

1174
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:56,191
Fit from day one

1175
00:44:56,703 --> 00:45:01,567
When they came in to meet with us and we started talking about what we wanted to do and where they were at

1176
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:03,103
Process it was a

1177
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:05,151
Okay and I have to ask

1178
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:06,943
I'm really excited

1179
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:07,711
Zach who is the

1180
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:12,575
Must have said you guys using Wi-Fi or

1181
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:15,903
Cellular cellular and it was important

1182
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:17,695
We have used Wi-Fi in the past

1183
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:18,719
Center previous product

1184
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:20,511
And Wi-Fi for us

1185
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:21,279
Dad

1186
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:22,559
Some issues

1187
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:24,351
Because of our product being in the backyard

1188
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:26,399
And because our product

1189
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:27,167
Is under the

1190
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:28,447
Covers in a hot tub

1191
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:31,263
So we have electronics that are under the covers

1192
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:34,079
We have water and then we have the backyard the disc

1193
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:34,847
The backyard

1194
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:37,151
So we were dealing with all of those things

1195
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:38,175
Estranged

1196
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:39,199
Connect to somebody

1197
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:40,991
A consumers Wi-Fi network

1198
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:41,759
And that just

1199
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:43,039
Percentage a lot of issues

1200
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:45,855
So we decided that we wanted to go

1201
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:48,415
Cellular to alleviate those issues and also make

1202
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:49,183
Easier on the

1203
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:50,719
So that was one of the

1204
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:53,023
Score of ordering with particle

1205
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:54,303
Is we really wanted to you

1206
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:55,583
Taylor number

1207
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:57,375
So I'm very familiar with particle

1208
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:58,399
Do you just

1209
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:04,799
Did you buy the boards and just slap a mind as part of your electronics or how integrated and how much work did you do

1210
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:05,567
Do with them

1211
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:08,895
From the Ford and physical stuff all the way up to

1212
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:09,919
Your hosting

1213
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:11,711
And building the app

1214
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:13,247
I wish it were that easy

1215
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:14,783
We wanted more of an integrated

1216
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:16,831
We have a lot invested in our

1217
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:18,623
The structure that

1218
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:20,927
So now the partnership

1219
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:23,999
Particle was really taking their existing or

1220
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:24,767
And cuss

1221
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:26,815
Mising that and allowing

1222
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:27,583
Particle

1223
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:29,375
How to do a lot of work in interphase

1224
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:31,423
Infrastructure

1225
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:34,495
And then building out the

1226
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:35,775
Particle cloud

1227
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:36,543
Customizing

1228
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:39,359
Oracle cloud and then Doling out AWS

1229
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:40,639
Infrastructure

1230
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:42,687
Jacuzzi so that we had a

1231
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:44,223
Really tightly integrated

1232
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:45,503
From Indian

1233
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:46,783
And how do you guys connect

1234
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:47,807
Ford dealers

1235
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:49,855
Thor dealer portal is provided through

1236
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:51,647
Salesforce vs Salesforce

1237
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:55,231
Community how was the activity that are notification and everything

1238
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:55,999
Comes in

1239
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:57,279
From AWS

1240
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:58,303
Salesforce

1241
00:46:58,559 --> 00:46:59,839
So are notifications

1242
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:01,119
Country style source

1243
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:02,143
As well as all the nodes

1244
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:04,703
Any Tire Dealer portal

1245
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:07,775
So what would you

1246
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:09,055
Like to see

1247
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:12,127
After you've done this and you're operating this and you

1248
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:13,919
Hopefully will see it grow to

1249
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:15,711
I don't know how many hot tubs are sold a year

1250
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:18,271
Thousands hundreds of thousands of hot tubs

1251
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:19,295
What do you need

1252
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:22,111
Yeah I think the one thing that makes me the most nervous

1253
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:28,255
Is not so much on the jacuzzi side is it is on the consumer privacy

1254
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:29,023
Issues

1255
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:31,583
Things like gdpr

1256
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:32,607
And castle

1257
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:34,143
Those things make me nervous

1258
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:35,935
I don't know if they do you

1259
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:37,471
Those things make me nervous

1260
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:39,007
Comes to iot

1261
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:41,055
And especially with the fact

1262
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:41,823
The California

1263
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:42,847
Just came out

1264
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:45,919
Announce that they're pretty their own version of gdb

1265
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:48,223
PR what Hoops are we going to have to

1266
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:52,319
Jump through in order to continue to advance this last

1267
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:53,599
In the future

1268
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:54,879
How are we going to be able

1269
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:55,903
Continue

1270
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:57,183
Do business

1271
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:58,207
With all of us

1272
00:47:58,463 --> 00:47:59,231
Deregulation

1273
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:00,767
They're going to exist in the difference

1274
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:03,839
The world would you like to see one Unified

1275
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:07,423
Maybe one unified regulation is kind of absurd but maybe

1276
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:08,191
Three or four

1277
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:09,215
Absolutely

1278
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:10,239
I mean it would be

1279
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:12,031
Astounding right would be abs

1280
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:13,055
Absolutely amazing

1281
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:14,335
You have one Unified

1282
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:15,871
Version of gdpr

1283
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:18,431
I think that probably it probably will never happen

1284
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:19,711
Our lifetime

1285
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:24,063
But even if we had three or four different Unified gdpr

1286
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:24,831
Thai policy

1287
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:26,879
To start getting to the farm we have

1288
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:27,647
State-level

1289
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:28,927
DPR policy

1290
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:30,463
In my mind that's going to win

1291
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:31,487
Nightmare

1292
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:36,095
And to be clear your issue isn't necessarily with the regulations with ideas

1293
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:37,375
Giving users controller

1294
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:40,191
30. It is more just trying to implement many

1295
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:41,727
Conversion 10 variations of

1296
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:43,263
Those types of regulations

1297
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:44,287
Describe

1298
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:46,079
Yeah I have no problem with

1299
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:47,359
Consumer privacy

1300
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:48,895
I've completely believe in

1301
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:49,663
Consumer privacy

1302
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:52,479
It's more of trying to implement that

1303
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:53,247
Across

1304
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:54,527
Different Geographic

1305
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:55,295
Hilarious

1306
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:56,831
So if you have a different policy

1307
00:48:57,087 --> 00:48:58,623
In California than you do Intex

1308
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:01,439
Trying to make sure that

1309
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:03,487
You treat that data differently

1310
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:05,023
California for those

1311
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:08,095
First thing you do in Texas in designing your application

1312
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:09,375
Around that and then

1313
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:11,423
You know that balloons up into

1314
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:12,959
30 different policy

1315
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:14,751
Then doing the development

1316
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:15,775
Around that

1317
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:16,799
Keeping up with

1318
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:19,871
Since we're in privacy let's talk about our other favorite

1319
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:21,407
My friend security

1320
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:23,455
So how are you guys

1321
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:24,223
Dealing

1322
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:25,247
With six

1323
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:26,015
Security

1324
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:28,831
All the various levels cuz I can see a hot tub

1325
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:37,535
So we were very careful from the very beginning working with Oracle and Pandora to make

1326
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:41,119
Make sure that we use the industry best practice

1327
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:42,399
Straight from beginning

1328
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:44,191
So we do it a whole

1329
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:45,215
Variety of different

1330
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:48,287
Security measures depending on you know what devices

1331
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:49,055
Communicating

1332
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:51,359
So depending is particle stylist

1333
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:54,175
Communicating with a w a sore ass particles

1334
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:56,991
Device where is the mobile app is

1335
00:49:57,759 --> 00:49:58,271
Communicating

1336
00:49:58,527 --> 00:50:01,343
Directly with particle you know we do different things

1337
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,135
Cherokee's all

1338
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:04,671
Great measures

1339
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:05,951
Spell our consumers

1340
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:09,023
Rest assured that there when they communicate with their hot tub kits

1341
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:12,351
Right and also that no one will get boiled alive

1342
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:14,911
That's exactly true

1343
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:16,191
Well that's also handled

1344
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:17,983
Within our controller

1345
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:18,751
In the hot tub

1346
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:21,055
So if that hot tub

1347
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:21,823
Decides to

1348
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:24,383
For some reason try to overtemp it goes into

1349
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:25,151
Andover temperature

1350
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:26,943
So that it does not allow the

1351
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:39,487
Cuz people you know they get into these and maybe they're not their best

1352
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:40,767
Selves who knows

1353
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:42,047
So okay so

1354
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:44,607
Let's talk about what all of this cost

1355
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:46,399
Because this is very different

1356
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:49,983
I imagine it's very different to build a connected product

1357
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:53,567
Just kind of some ongoing overhead

1358
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:54,591
Be crazy expensive

1359
00:50:54,847 --> 00:51:00,479
Last a long time so I'm trying to think about how you change how you sell these things how you

1360
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:01,503
Projector

1361
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:03,807
Liabilities for these things how does that all

1362
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:06,111
How does connectivity change that

1363
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:07,135
Ma

1364
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:10,975
So right now we're targeting our Amir products

1365
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:12,767
We quickly hope

1366
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:14,815
Platform will

1367
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:15,839
Easter Sunday

1368
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:18,655
Quickly plan on having the iot Plaza

1369
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:19,679
Wheat bran

1370
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:21,471
SmartStyle on all of our

1371
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:22,751
Prices and

1372
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:23,775
It should vary

1373
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:26,079
Quickly be a revenue generator

1374
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:28,383
Through the driving

1375
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:29,663
Additional hot tub

1376
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:31,199
Sales because of it being

1377
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:34,015
Product we believe that it's a differentiator

1378
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:36,063
In the industry as well as

1379
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:37,599
Accessories

1380
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:38,623
Accessory sales

1381
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:39,391
Or the app

1382
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:40,927
It's also when somebody is

1383
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:41,951
With that mess

1384
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:43,487
For a

1385
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:45,279
Or for chemical

1386
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:47,839
Mike that that additional sales footage

1387
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:48,607
Brandon

1388
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:49,631
Products with lead

1389
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:50,911
It's also will drive.

1390
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:53,727
Recently I read about GE Appliances

1391
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:56,287
They are doing a smart fridge and

1392
00:51:56,543 --> 00:51:57,055
It actually

1393
00:51:57,567 --> 00:51:59,871
Won't dispense water if you

1394
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:02,175
Don't put a GE branded filter

1395
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:02,943
Into

1396
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:03,967
The refrigerator

1397
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:06,783
As you can imagine that did not go over well with

1398
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:08,319
People are you thinking about

1399
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:10,879
Doing any sort of DRM associated with

1400
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:12,671
Aker jacuzzi filter only works

1401
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:17,279
No I mean that's I don't know that the we could ever get to that

1402
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:20,863

00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:22,911

00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:24,959

1409
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:34,175
Person accessories but we get to a point where we

1410
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:35,455
Physically turn

1411
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:36,735
Are hot tub off

1412
