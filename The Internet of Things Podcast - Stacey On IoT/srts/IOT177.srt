And today we have a scary show for you

5
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:20,992
We are going to kick it off with the Defcon hacks

6
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:22,272
We're going to talk about

7
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:23,040
Google

8
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:24,320
Behavior around the

9
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:27,136
Location we've got the first easy mesh router

10
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:29,184
Refresh your memory on what that is

11
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,208
And why it matters

12
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:33,280
And Samsung has partnered with plume to do something

13
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:34,048
Pretty cool

14
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:34,816
Also

15
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:36,608
Samsung has a new smart speaker

16
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:38,144
We're going to see what you guys

17
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:42,240
Plus Microsoft's Cortana and Amazon's Echo art

18
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:43,008
Into each other

19
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:44,032
Hand

20
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,056
We're not sure what

21
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:47,104
But that Kevin's going to finish up

22
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:53,504
Is Lenovo smart display review after living with it and I for the first time tried sous vide cooking

23
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,040
I'll tell you a little bit about that

24
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:57,344
Plus we have a message this week from

25
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,880
Netgear our sponsor

26
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,952
And our guest this week is Alison cliff

27
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:02,720
Jennings

28
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:03,744
What's a filament

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,280
Who is going to talk about

30
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:06,048
What block

31
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:08,352
Chain does for The Internet of Things

32
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:11,168
It is not your typical blockchain discussion

33
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:12,192
Do not fret

34
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:13,216
You're gonna enjoy

35
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,544
And now for a message from one of our sponsors

36
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,080
A pharaoh

37
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:24,480
Looking for an iot platform find out why Kenmore and D-Link pick a farro a farro

38
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:30,880
Customers have experienced as much as an 80% reduction in time-to-market 99% pure

39
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:37,280
Your support calls in 10x higher activation rates plus they can we use 90% of their work

40
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:41,120
Check from one project to the next to learn more visit a pharaoh

41
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:45,728
. IO that's a f e r o. IO

42
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,776
Okay Kevin

43
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:51,104
Let's get ready for Defcon is your Wi-Fi turned off

44
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:57,760
Scared of we talked about Defcon cuz it's crazy with the hackers of Jews there just

45
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:00,320
Prove that things are not as secure as we might think

46
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:01,088
Just to make us

47
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,624
Little more insert

48
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:06,464
Actually because of Hotel policy

49
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,768
The big story at a Defcon is not the hacks

50
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:13,632
It is the management at hotel sending security guards in randomly to check

51
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:14,912
People's rooms which is

52
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:16,192
Not a great thing forever

53
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:17,728
So we're not going to talk

54
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:20,032
That we're going to talk with the devices that are half

55
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:23,104
Including our favorite the Amazon Echo

56
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:26,688
But researchers from tencent they spent months

57
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,712
Trying to

58
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:33,088
Figure out how to convert the Amazon Echo smart speaker into a surveillance device

59
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,672
What they did was they use multiple bugs

60
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:37,952
In the second generation

61
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:41,792
Show that allows a hacker to remotely stream audio from the devices micro

62
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,584
But those researchers

63
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,352
Did

64
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:46,400
Notify Amazon

65
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,680
And Amazon has

66
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:50,240
That's why I like ethical hackers

67
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,008
Ethical hacker

68
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:54,080
Should you be worried that someone else is going to come

69
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,104
Come do this to you

70
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,664
It also requires access to your Wi-Fi

71
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,200
And so

72
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,736
Most of us are not

73
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:03,040
We don't have people coming around trying to attack her

74
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,624
If you are that person

75
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,648
You know that

76
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:08,416
And

77
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:14,560
It it actually though braces are good point I mean not cortical front door to the smart home is

78
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:15,840
You know your Wi-Fi network

79
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:16,864
Innocence

80
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,680
You really want to focus on keeping that secure

81
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:25,056
Routers updated Etc to talk more about routers later today but I think it's worth the mention to your point that out

82
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,592
Yes don't give out your wife

83
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:28,896
My password I know we used to all casually B

84
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,432
You like

85
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:31,968
Gesnetwork baby

86
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,016
I know it's not I Ortiz

87
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:40,416
Specific related but I tell you what voting machine hacking by the kids that are really scares me

88
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:42,720
1 well folding machines are supposed

89
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:44,768
These aren't button

90
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:45,536
Instead

91
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,584
What did this 11 year old

92
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:53,216
Here there was a bunch of enterprising young children including the 11 year old who was able to

93
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:55,520
A control mock-up of the Florida sec

94
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:57,824
Terry of State website and change the voting results

95
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,408
And guess what it took him all of 10 minutes to do so that's

96
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:05,248
Concerning an even though voting machines aren't supposed to be

97
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:07,040
Network can connect Etc

98
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:09,088
There are processing

99
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:13,184
Bits inside them and they have firmware and some of the kids

100
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:18,559
Scott's is voting machines to change vote tallies they uploaded their own software the machines

101
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:23,167
And even had a looping gif file on the screens of one of the voting machines so that's

102
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:24,959
They're just old

103
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:28,543
Not the kids the machines

104
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:30,335
Yeah

105
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:34,175
Keep a paper record you guys

106
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,199
Another thing

107
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:35,967
That was hacked

108
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:36,991
Police body cameras

109
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:40,319
These people device waited live stream footage from the

110
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:41,855
So

111
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:45,439
Basically hack into a police person who's Maybe

112
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:48,255
Monitoring your criminal organization and be like

113
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:50,559
Look outside everybody's play it cool

114
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,351
He also could put

115
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,631
Malware on the camera

116
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,167
And then you could bring

117
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,191
That into the

118
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,215
The police department in

119
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:59,775
Go to their other databases and allow you access to

120
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:00,543
To their Network

121
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:03,359
Which as we all know is the beginning of the end

122
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:04,639
Okay

123
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,663
Voicemail

124
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,223
This one cracked me up because it was like

125
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,551
Hacking into voicemail but I'm like who uses voicemail

126
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:13,087
Yeah I mean

127
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:16,927
Probably very happy because people don't care about as much although they probably should

128
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,463
I'm like what are they

129
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:20,511
Be part of my endless parade of

130
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:21,279
Your prescription

131
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,559
The pharmacy is now ready

132
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:24,095
We are confirming your

133
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,119
Appointment at the dentist's

134
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:26,911
There was another

135
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,191
Kind of freaky

136
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,471
Freaky hack

137
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:35,359
I don't know it was a hack McAfee hackers basically showed off the ability to hack into a

138
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:38,431
Hospitals Network and falsify a patient's vital signs

139
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:44,575
And this gets into some of the medical device hacking we've talked about that a lot on the show

140
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:47,903
There's a networking protocol used by medical devices known

141
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,439
When is

142
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,463
RW hat

143
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,999
I'm not sure how to say

144
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:54,815
Rwhat I have no idea

145
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:55,839
Exactly

146
00:05:56,095 --> 00:06:02,239
So basically what they did is they hacked into this protocol and let other devices come on to the network that looks like they

147
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,799
They were monitoring patients to mimic their vital signs

148
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:07,103
This is again an example of

149
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,127
A case where

150
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:12,735
If you were in a position where someone is really after you and wants to hack you

151
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,271
This is that kind of scary

152
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:16,575
Most of us are not in that position

153
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:21,439
I don't know if many people are going to want to freak out hospitals by creating imaginary patients or

154
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:24,255
Overloading people's actual vital signs with

155
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,535
But

156
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,303
For me

157
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:29,375
Government let's see here and ex-russian spy purse

158
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,143
Rhapsody

159
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,191
These sorts of hacks confortini

160
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:32,959
From that perspective

161
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:35,775
This is an interesting way to murder kill someone

162
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:40,895
Poor kidnap them and make it look like they're still there in the heart is beating normally

163
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,943
They just took that another level

164
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,223
Sorry

165
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,759
We're going to see this and you know

166
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,551
The next batch of movies

167
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:49,087
TV shows I'm sure

168
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:52,415
But it is something that we should keep an eye on just because

169
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:56,255
We're connecting all this stuff and it's providing a lot of new ways to

170
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:58,559
Falsify information and also

171
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:00,863
Allowing people access to

172
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,911
Things like insulin pumps in that sort of

173
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,959
Too many attack vectors

174
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:06,495
Too many

175
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,263
Access

176
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:08,799
Okay

177
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,591
Speaking of attack vectors

178
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,127
Speaking of attack

179
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,943
Amazon web service introduced

180
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,735
Their iot device Defender

181
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:19,039
Actually they didn't release it they just made it available

182
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:19,807
Kevin

183
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,623
Right at AWS invent

184
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:26,207
Equus November last year they announced the iot device

185
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:32,607
Defender for AWS but it is now available basically it is another service that they have for their IRT offer

186
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,655
And What it lets you do is

187
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:36,703
It lets you create audits

188
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:41,311
Of all of your fireteam devices you can schedule them excetera and you can look for like

189
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:45,151
Cat doesn't different things like certain certificates that are expiring perhaps

190
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:48,223
There's a policy that overly permissive

191
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,319
Is a whole bunch of parameters here in the idea is that you can cut a check

192
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:54,367
I would say real time I would say and I

193
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:59,743
Schedule regular basis if all of the it devices that you were managing are doing what they're supposed to do

194
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:00,511
And or

195
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:06,143
Maybe they have been hacked maybe they are getting too much information but they don't need so this is a way to help manage that so it's

196
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:10,495
Iot device Defender and again it's all part of the AWS iot services

197
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:12,543
Okay so

198
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:17,663
Let's get into another big story this week which is

199
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,223
AP working with some

200
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,527
Princeton researchers discovered that Google

201
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:23,807
Share your location

202
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:24,831
Even when you

203
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:25,599
Don't

204
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,135
That's

205
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,415
Yeah that's a fact

206
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,695
I was going to say that

207
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:36,095
Kind of the story but that is a fact it is true the issue here is one of transparency because Google

208
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:38,399
Says hey just disable location

209
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:41,727
Settings on your phone or whatever Android device or Google devices

210
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:47,103
To cetera and your location history will no longer have your location that is technically true

211
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:50,687
However there's another area of

212
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:52,223
Your account that

213
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:53,247
Tracks your location

214
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:55,295
It is the web and

215
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,831
Activity

216
00:08:57,087 --> 00:09:03,231
That's where you need to disable also the location information you can manually delete it if you want to go in your account

217
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:09,631
You can do all that now retroactively but I just find it very disingenuous of Google to say the name something location history with an O

218
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:13,983
On off toggle essentially it's not all of your location history that's bothersome

219
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:18,847
Yes and we talked about this all the time but trust is so important

220
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:19,871
With the internet

221
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:20,895
Thanks and with

222
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,431
Mobile devices and

223
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,711
With all of the data.

224
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:24,735
It's been collected about

225
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:28,831
We is users have to trust that the companies are

226
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,879
Doing what they say they do

227
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:34,975
And maybe this was not nefarious on the part of Google maybe it was just you know

228
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:38,815
Engineers making decisions and not thinking about the UI impact

229
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,607
Privacy impact

230
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,655
We can't do that anymore

231
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:45,983
The information that is being gathered here is so personal

232
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:50,335
I really think all companies have to pay attention to this

233
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,103
And

234
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,127
Start being

235
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,151
Way more transfer

236
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,431
By the way

237
00:09:54,943 --> 00:10:00,831
If you want to turn this off you have to go to on your phone do you go to Google settings in the Google account

238
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,367
And tap on data and personals

239
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:04,671
Station that's where you going to get the web and a peck

240
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:05,951
Then

241
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:09,279
Utah the blue web and app activity slider

242
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,047
Two off

243
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:15,935
Google's going to be like this is going to limit or disable more personalized experiences across Google services

244
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:16,703
In

245
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,471
Then

246
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:19,519
And it will

247
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,567
Every now and then I turn off

248
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,871
Or change my privacy

249
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:24,895
And sharing settings

250
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:28,223
And I can tell you the experience degrades tremendously

251
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,783
I mean that's kind of to be expected

252
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:34,367
If they don't have that information they can't deliver my weather without me asking

253
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,415
My commute

254
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,463
Yeah I mean that's the thing we have

255
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:41,023
I want to say treated privacy but I guess that's

256
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:47,423
Probably the best word for now we traded some of this data for very personalized useful Services Bureau

257
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,447
Don't want their services

258
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,215
That's fine

259
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,495
You can turn all that off

260
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,031
But

261
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:58,431
I'm kind of can't complain that you're not getting your commute times anymore and you're not getting local traffic cuz it doesn't know what local is for you right now

262
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:00,735
There's so many things that will disappear

263
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:01,759
That we've already just

264
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,039
Become accustomed to

265
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,087
All right

266
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:08,415
Let's move from Wiki security and privacy topics to

267
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:11,743
Do Wi-Fi Eros

268
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,047
Almost all of the cable

269
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:14,815
Out there

270
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:18,399
They have made the first router that works with the easymesh

271
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:23,263
And if we remember easymesh we talked about this a while back

272
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:25,567
This is the Wi-Fi lamp standard

273
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:28,127
To allow different wifi routers

274
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,943
What's Wi-Fi routers from different brands

275
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:35,039
Is beforehand if you wanted a mesh wi-fi system you had to basically by

276
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:38,111
These were all heroes or all whatever

277
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:38,879
Phillips

278
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:39,647
So

279
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:44,767
That's still the case with those systems but now Harrison this make sense because it's possible that

280
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:45,791
If I bought

281
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:48,607
My cable provider comes in they want to be able to

282
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,143
Adopt whatever

283
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,423
Mesh systems they were

284
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,727
Or maybe are already know

285
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:56,543
True but I kind of laughed when I saw this

286
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:00,895
Because this is like getting the first fax machines and then saying what okay what do I do because

287
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,175
Even though this is the first

288
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:04,223
Certified easymesh product

289
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:05,503
No other

290
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,319
Of the brands that you just mention no other ones

291
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:10,879
Work with EZ match so it's still only

292
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:11,903
It wasn't working

293
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,951
This one it will if

294
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,255
Yeah

295
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,791
So I mean somebody's got to be

296
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:21,631
First I get it and it does make sense of the terrorist who can sell these two

297
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:27,775
You know home broadband providers by the pallet load but it doesn't matter until somebody else says

298
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,823
Networking it allow using mesh to

299
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,103
All right

300
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,127
Also in

301
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,407
Wifi router news

302
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,175
Samsung

303
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:37,503
They have what they're calling the new SmartThings mesh wi-fi system

304
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:38,783
What it actually is

305
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:39,551
This is

306
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:40,831
Looms

307
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:41,855
Service

308
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:42,623
Rebranded

309
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,391
And

310
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:46,719
I feel like we talked about this in the past because I talked a lot about the

311
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,743
Future of Wi-Fi

312
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:51,071
Basically all of your Samsung SmartThings hubs

313
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,351
Will have this technology

314
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,887
Built-in +

315
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,471
Basically this is a rebranding of the Samsung connect

316
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:58,239
Home

317
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:04,639
Mesh Wi-Fi systems to become SmartThings Wi-Fi and Samsung had added the SmartThings keypad

318
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:06,687
Ability to these Wi-Fi Hub so it's not

319
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:09,759
Unusual they also are taking the time

320
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:10,783
Because they had

321
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,831
But this operation I'm guessing

322
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:16,415
Add a new and improved SmartThings Hub sensors and out

323
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,695
These

324
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,719
Are cute

325
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:23,583
The new SmartThings Hub is actually cheaper it's only to be 70 bucks 6999

326
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,119
The sensors are bad

327
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,399
20 + 2

328
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,423
$25

329
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,959
And the smart outlet is

330
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:36,895
Ya know it's this good for SmartThings admin for SmartThings users or somebody wants to upgrade or what

331
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:42,271
Start there's hard on why I get ahold mesh Network system with smartphone capabilities and

332
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,807
The only downside to me is

333
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:45,599
I'm not a fan of the mobile app but that's

334
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,367
Just me

335
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,391
Oh and they added

336
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:50,975
Button button

337
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:51,999
Basically

338
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:52,767
This is

339
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:53,535
It's a button

340
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:58,143
So you can have triggers on it and you can control various things around your home so

341
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,191
Yay

342
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,471
That is the one thing

343
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:07,103
With SmartThings I had a lot of automations but I am almost never in the app so if I can't talk to my

344
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:08,639
4

345
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:11,199
It's not already automated

346
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:16,319
Write it one question I haven't seen Samsung or plume address

347
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:19,647
Because I know the reason the plume middle layer to integrate the

348
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:23,231
Temp service on this Hardware we just talk recently about plumes

349
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,511
Subscription fees

350
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,559
I don't see any

351
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,679
That's the question yeah there's no mention of it

352
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:37,311
So I assumed not since you can buy this I would imagine it would tell you when you buy it and I'm not saying

353
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,871
So basically if you wanted to you could get the

354
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:41,407
Flume capabilities

355
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,687
Without the subscription

356
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:47,807
That's if you want you then get this exciting

357
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,367
That also

358
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,647
Has additional radio

359
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:55,231
That also work with zigbee and Z-Wave and Bluetooth which

360
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:56,767
Actually kind of a smoking good deal

361
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:01,119
And does what Kevin wants which is hay puts All the Small Things

362
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:01,887
StubHub

363
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:02,655
You just got Wi-Fi

364
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,935
Why so it's functional

365
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,751
Exactly

366
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:07,775
Alrighty

367
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,311
Moving right along

368
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,591
Samsung has

369
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:11,615
Also announced

370
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,895
Galaxy homes

371
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:13,919
Speaker

372
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:18,527
Quizlet of the Amazon Echo or the Google

373
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,063
And

374
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,855
This is bixby's version

375
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,135
Looks

376
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:25,183
Like a fondue pot BBQ

377
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:30,047
Yeah it's just almost like a teardrop

378
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:33,375
Shape with the top of third cut off and has the

379
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,423
3 silver legs

380
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,191
Maine

381
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:41,823
Looks like some of the modern lamps that we had in my home when modern in the 70s men lots of chrome and

382
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,103
Pretty shapes

383
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,127
Can finish it but whatever

384
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,663
There's no price yet it's

385
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:52,063
Coming soon cording to Samsung they did use it at their Galaxy unpacked event where they did do the Samsung

386
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:57,951
Galaxy Note 9 and the Galaxy watch they had a hundred sixty days playing some of the presentation and

387
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:03,839
From my perspective I was watching it online I couldn't tell the difference the sound sounded great but I don't think I'm going to buy a hundred six days for

388
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:06,655
I'm not convinced that Bixby is

389
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,679
For me but

390
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,959
That's what it's going to run

391
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:11,007
It also also

392
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:13,055
Also works as a SmartThings

393
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,847
Hub that's actually

394
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,383
It is

395
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,407
So it's got

396
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:21,759
It should because it says works as a hub

397
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:22,527
Core SmartThings

398
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:27,391
We don't know but has a smoking good deal but if you hate extra

399
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:31,231
Alright I can see that Samsung is going to stick SmartThings

400
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:32,767
Actually

401
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,303
SmartThings is the basis of

402
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,351
Are there apps that actually switching a lot of their lie

403
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,655
Washing machine up in the fridge app

404
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:39,679
Are becoming the smart

405
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:42,495
And Bixby of interface for a doll

406
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,823
Speaking of things that

407
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:46,847
Talk to each other

408
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:47,615
Cortana

409
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,151
And Madame

410
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:53,247
By the way I get this question a lot matinee is just what we call

411
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,295
Amazon's Echo assistant

412
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:56,831
Because we don't want to trigger it

413
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:00,159
But we can say Cortana on a bet it's fine

414
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:08,351
Bixby Bixby

415
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,631
Cuz that's what we don't say

416
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:10,911
The hot words for those

417
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:11,679
Yes and

418
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,239
Why do you call it something

419
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:16,287
Dancers

420
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,311
Anyway

421
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,615
So back at Microsoft build

422
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,663
Microsoft showed off

423
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,687
Cortana

424
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,223
And me

425
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:27,039
Together so basically you take Cortana as matinee

426
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,319
How to turn on my lights

427
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:31,135
That would happen and you should also

428
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:34,719
Do it in reverse and say Madam a ask Cortana to find this

429
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,487
Particular email

430
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:38,559
It was awkward to ask

431
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:39,583
To do the others

432
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:42,399
Who's going to do whatever job

433
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:44,191
And it was really high latency

434
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:47,007
It's rolling out to everyone so everyone can

435
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:55,455
Yeah I just think from a user experience perspective I don't want an assistant asking another assistant

436
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:58,527
To do something the only possible benefit I see

437
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:02,111
Is Windows is still very entrenched in the Enterprise

438
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:05,695
And why you could use an echo there you probably wouldn't use a

439
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,231
Google home because

440
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:09,535
Business data

441
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,303
And

442
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,095
Maybe use the

443
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,631
Integration to ask

444
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,423
Madame a to set up a

445
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:21,823
Calendar event for your work people on you know without looking so on wherever you using Windows and maybe there's something there

446
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:26,943
I'm not a fan of this and I don't understand why it took a year they announced this last August

447
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,223
It took a year

448
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:29,247
The basically make this

449
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,783
Skip yeah I don't know

450
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,623
There's a lot going on I think there was probably also some inviting

451
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:35,647
Back at the event

452
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:41,279
Satya Nadella the CEO of Microsoft was like Hey Cortana is for business and Madam A is for home

453
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,559
Maybe there was some like

454
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:43,839
Calling an Uber

455
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:44,607
Is that a business

456
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:51,263
I don't know that could be and there could have been some debate over who gets what data because the way that this works

457
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,287
Today is

458
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,823
As I understand it when you use

459
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:58,175
Madame a Amazon gift the data when use madhumeh to

460
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:04,063
Ask Cortana do something Microsoft gets the day. So there may have been some pushing and pulling there and that will tug of war

461
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,855
Yes so that's out

462
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:06,879
Etsy

463
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:10,207
Now it's time for the part of the show where Kevin and Stacey try things at

464
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:10,975
And tell you about them

465
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:13,279
Kevin last week talk to a lot

466
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:15,327
About the Lenovo smart display

467
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:19,167
He did a pretty comprehensive review now we've got one up on the site which are linked

468
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,959
But Kevin did you have

469
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,263
Having now used it for more than 30

470
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:26,335
How do you feel about

471
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:32,223
I really like it is not for everybody I guess I'll say that right up front if you are a homekit

472
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:34,271
Person this doesn't do anything for you

473
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:36,831
If you are all in on echoes

474
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:40,927
This doesn't do anything for you it is basically a Google home with

475
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:46,047
Screen which I find very beneficial for viewing information just like the Echo Show does

476
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:47,583
Also for fine

477
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:52,703
Tuning your smart home controls because if you say satellite to 40% it'll do that

478
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:59,103
You can say that my voice but it then we'll show you a little slider on the screen and says 45% and maybe you're in that room and

479
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,383
That's not enough

480
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:05,503
You just touch it you don't need to speak again then just touch it and drag the slider that is actually coming to the

481
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:06,527
Google Assistant

482
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:11,903
As well I've seen that rolling out as of last week so you'll see what I'm talking about on your phones and tablets

483
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:12,927
If your

484
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:16,511
Thinking about switching over to Google devices this is a

485
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:20,607
Great great device and if you watch a lot of online video content

486
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:21,375
Fantastic

487
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:28,031
Because it comes in two sizes 8in and 10in I bought the 10-inch one because it is a full HD display where's the other one at 7

488
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:29,567
20p you can voice search

489
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,615
And give commands to say watch

490
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:38,015
Cat videos on YouTube and there it is is your Google Play music you can save play songs by The Beatles whatever

491
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:38,783
It does not

492
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,831
Work with as many Music Services

493
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:43,135
But that's typical of the Google home platform

494
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,671
So that is a limitation

495
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:51,071
But I love it for watching video as well as YouTube TV which I switched over to about three weeks ago not because of this ice

496
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:52,351
Switch in advance of this

497
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,119
And

498
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,655
It's just nice to have a little

499
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:57,471
Nightstand TV to watch a half an hour of something

500
00:20:57,727 --> 00:21:01,823
In full HD the sound I think it's better than the regular Google home

501
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:07,711
Play Smash it's much better than the Google home mini there's two 10-watt speakers in here and I like the fact that it just

502
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:12,831
Looks more modern than say a competing product like the Echo Show as a nice bamboo back if I

503
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:19,232
Curved back so you can stand the device in portrait or landscape I will admit I've only used it in portrait one time that was free

504
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:21,792
Google Duo call with you Stacy

505
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:25,632
I have not made another one and that's the only function that works in portrait mode

506
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:26,912
This is meant to be in landscape

507
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:30,240
So I got my photos from Google photos on there all the time I've got the

508
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,008
Time on there

509
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,824
25 hours a day get my weather and so on

510
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,408
I love it I got to be honest there are things that don't work yet such as Netflix

511
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:43,808
It's on there even though I link my Netflix account but it's all in the work so I'm very very happy I'm using this far more

512
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:49,184
More than any other smart speaker in my house just because that screen add so much more value to me

513
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:51,744
I can't wait to get my own

514
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:58,144
And we shall say this is all specific to the 10-inch one because I don't think the 8-inch one can you switch it from porch

515
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:58,912
Landscape

516
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:05,312
You can't and both of them have cameras to use Google Duo but I should also mention the smartest thing they did was putting it

517
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:07,872
Physical shutter cover on this device

518
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:11,456
And you just slide it and the camera is off its block there's nothing

519
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:12,224
Vatican City

520
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:14,784
EXO $200 for the 8in

521
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:16,320
215 to the 10 in

522
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:17,856
Yes and

523
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:18,624
Kevin Lee

524
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:19,904
I'm actually

525
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,720
I kinda want to get to it he didn't actually talk about this but like

526
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:24,256
Facts about Alaska

527
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:26,816
But you can see things from like your nest cameras

528
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:27,584
On the device

529
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:28,608
Another sibling

530
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:30,656
So exciting

531
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:31,424
Already

532
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,216
Let's talk about my experience with

533
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:33,984
Sous vide

534
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:36,288
You guys know that I am

535
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:40,128
Crazy person in the kitchen and I met the CEO of chefsteps

536
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:40,896
Mexican Heaven

537
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:41,664
Come on the show soon

538
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:43,456
They make a sous vide cooker

539
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:44,480
They're one of many

540
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,040
Cemitas

541
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:48,832
Cooking under water at a set

542
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:49,600
Temperature basic

543
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:56,000
Play so you put one of these circulators in its got a thermometer it circulates water ideas you stick your food in a plastic bag

544
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:56,768
And

545
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:58,560
You cook it at a set temperature at

546
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,328
Takes

547
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:01,632
A little longer or a lot longer depending on the food

548
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:02,400
And

549
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:04,448
Quote on quote perfectly done

550
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,216
So

551
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:05,984
They're right

552
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:13,152
Perfectly done I will say that I would not cook something in a suvee I would not suit

553
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:13,920
Need something

554
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:14,688
A suburb

555
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:17,760
And then serve it to someone I would want to

556
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:21,088
Put some charna so fry it up afterwards they tell you about this in

557
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:24,416
So this Tuesday GIF cooking I'm not

558
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:25,696
Super keen on

559
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,744
Like one pot Stacy

560
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:31,072
It really makes deliciously

561
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:36,448
Jimmy eggs but like eggs with the proper yolk that is not like to renovate

562
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,472
Not to

563
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:39,776
Hard and then it does a great job

564
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,056
Beach

565
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:43,360
And for anyone who trying to meal prep

566
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:47,712
In advance it's actually really good because what you can do is you can stick in

567
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:54,368
Couples it has to be the same kind of meat in roughly the same size but you can flavor it different ways so you can have like a

568
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:55,904
Mediterranean flavor in

569
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,696
Southwestern flavor and you

570
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:02,048
You can stick those in individual bags and you can basically prep different types of chick

571
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:04,352
Different types of flank steak

572
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,120
Which

573
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:05,888
Actually

574
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:10,496
Does the juul have any connectivity or mobile app or any other

575
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:12,288
It does in fact

576
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,056
It has

577
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:14,080
Nothing on it

578
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:15,616
There is no interface

579
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,384
Without the app

580
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:18,432
Which is a questionable thing

581
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:20,224
Some people are not going to let this

582
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:23,808
Others like the Anova have that capability on the device

583
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:25,600
Schedule without your app is

584
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:27,136
Shell

585
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:28,160
The app that

586
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:29,184
Is really good

587
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,464
Chefsteps has

588
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,256
Comprehensive

589
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,280
Recipe site

590
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:35,840
In some of the things you don't even have to sous vide

591
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:38,656
So they have lots of cooking guys that show you how to make

592
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,704
But then they also like

593
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,520
Have a visual indicator so when you're trying to

594
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:44,288
Cook something

595
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:47,872
Like I put meat in its like hey what are you cooking and I'm like I'm going to cook a cow

596
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:49,408
And I like yours the cut

597
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:50,688
And then they show you

598
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:51,968
Video basically

599
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:52,992
Tidy

600
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:57,600
Video or GIF but it just a quick shot of how would you like a cookie they show it to you

601
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:59,392
So you don't say meme

602
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,440
Pinkness of the meet basic

603
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:06,304
They show someone cutting into it so you can see like the juicing as that all of the stuff

604
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:07,840
It's kind of terrible twos

605
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:09,632
Are you in Siri when you're hungry cuz

606
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:11,424
Can take an hour or two or three

607
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:15,776
Except that is

608
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:17,568
You know what would be neat

609
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:20,896
Well I see something on the site that has a hands

610
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:21,664
Free mode

611
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,432
Were you can

612
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,480
Kind of talk to it and

613
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:26,016
You can't you can't talk

614
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,064
Okay

615
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,856
So if you can do that

616
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:34,464
Would it be cool to at least see the temperature or anything else you want to see on that

617
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:40,864
Smart display or something similar that I was just telling you about it mean it's got Bluetooth and Wi-Fi just temperature information it and or timers

618
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,632
Simply

619
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:42,656
Small bits of data

620
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:45,984
I see a lot they could do with this in terms of integration so I guess is what I'm saying

621
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:46,752
Yeah they could

622
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:48,032
Integrated to work with the show

623
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:48,800
It doesn't work

624
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:49,568
Google assist

625
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:50,592
So

626
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:51,360
Sorry Kevin

627
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:52,640
That's okay

628
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:54,176
If you're interested in

629
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:55,456
The

630
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:57,760
Juul which is what I tried is

631
00:25:58,272 --> 00:25:59,552
179 for the

632
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:02,112
Cheaper version and then they have an industrial one

633
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:03,904
The bigger clamp that is 119

634
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,184
On Amazon

635
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,024
So in there are others like the Innova it goes on sale regularly for

636
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:09,792
Like 17

637
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:11,584
So

638
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:15,168
Pick what you will that's just the one I used but I was actually Pleasant

639
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:17,984
I surprised in this is very much and I.

640
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:23,616
In the sense that it's using the processing power on your phone to make these kind of decisions about

641
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:25,664
And the sensors in the particular

642
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,688
Suvee cooker

643
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:28,992
To figure out the most appropriate way to

644
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,272
Your food which

645
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,040
Awesome

646
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,088
Kevin

647
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:33,856
I believe

648
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:34,880
It is time

649
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:35,904

672

Smarter homes

673
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:19,680
Start with SLI

674
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:21,984
Alright let's hear from

675
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:22,752
Jessie

676
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:29,408
Accusation Kevin this is Jesse from Connecticut here I'm currently building a house and had a question about Smart Control of

677
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:30,176
Overhead fan

678
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:34,272
Can I have a fan in my bedroom and I asked my electrician to wire separate

679
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:38,368
Switch for both the lights on the fan and the fan itself under the assumption that spark

680
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:40,416
Be easier with sex

681
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:45,024
I am having Lutron caseta switches style throughout the home for lighting control

682
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:50,144
Set SmartThings Hub brother control and have a number of Madame a and Google flights

683
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:52,704
What would be the best way to

684
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,472
Trolling motor

685
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:56,800
Specific make and model of the fan on getting

686
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:59,104
Thanks spot

687
00:27:59,360 --> 00:27:59,872
Jessie

688
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:00,640
This is

689
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:01,408
A good question

690
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:03,712
And your luck because I have Facebook

691
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,248
Myself

692
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,272
And I

693
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:07,808
Have all the devices you have

694
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,600
And the best option is

695
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:11,136
The GE Z-Wave

696
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:12,160
Plus smart

697
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:12,928
10

698
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:13,696
Speed control

699
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:16,256
Device so basically this is a

700
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:17,536
On Amazon it is a

701
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:20,096
3782 device

702
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:24,960
$37.82 and you want to get the paddle fan control

703
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:27,776
Vice this is going to turn your fan on and off and

704
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:29,568
You do a long press 2

705
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:31,104
Control the fan speed

706
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:35,712
It works really well at use a Z-Wave plus so it's going to work with SmartThings

707
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:37,248
It also will work with

708
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:39,040
Wink and madam

709
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,064
And

710
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,392
You were smart in dividing up the things I will tell you

711
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:48,256
We actually last week talked about a device

712
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:51,328
Call the bond ir and RF remote

713
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:53,376
For people who have existing fans

714
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:57,728
Control that's actually a really good option if they have a remote

715
00:28:57,984 --> 00:29:00,032
That goes with their fan they can use

716
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:03,360
That remote to program it to the pond and then it would work with

717
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:05,152
Madame a and

718
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:05,920
An app

719
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:07,456
So just throwing that out

720
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:08,224
Are people who

721
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,504
Maybe we're not as smart

722
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,272
2 divided

723
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,808
Lighting and the

724
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:12,576
Air fan control

725
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:14,624
And Jessie and anybody else

726
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,696
Has to be careful if you do go to buy this on Amazon

727
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:20,000
There are several switches there

728
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:25,120
And this looks exactly like the paddle light switch but that only controls the lights

729
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:26,656
So make sure you get the

730
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:28,192
Paddle for fan control

731
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:31,008
And on the bus it says easy smart fan can

732
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,288
And shows a picture of a

733
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:34,336
Really look forward

734
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:37,920
And is a really easy answer for you Jesse so hopefully

735
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:39,712
You can call us back and let us know

736
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:40,736
How it went

737
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:41,760
Okay

738
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,296
I think that's it

739
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:45,344
The new 2nd of this week show

740
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:47,648
Stay tuned to hear from our guest

741
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:51,488
Who is Allison clift-jennings the CEO of filament discussing

742
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:54,816
What blockchain can do especially around microtransaction

743
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:58,144
And it's a really good we actually get a little philosophic

744
00:29:58,656 --> 00:29:59,168
In there so

745
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,192
Is that your bag

746
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:01,216
You're going to like this

747
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:03,008
It's not listen anyway because

748
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:04,800
You can never have enough black

749
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:11,968
And now let's go to a message for this week sponsor hey everyone we're taking a break from this week's Internet of Things

750
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:16,832
Podcast for a message from our sponsor this week sponsor is Netgear

751
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:17,856
And I have

752
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:22,464
John McHugh who is a senior vice president of commercial networking at Netgear

753
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,744
Alright so we talked

754
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:26,048
A couple weeks about Netgear which

755
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:27,328
Not only has a

756
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:33,984
Homebase router business that a lot of us are familiar with but also a commercial and small to medium-sized big

757
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,264
Business Solution

758
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,032
So let's

759
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:38,080
Talk about how you guys make that

760
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,360
Easier for

761
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:40,384
Commercial customers

762
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,432
Setup and operate their Network

763
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,784
You know one of the things Stacy the Netgear really takes pride in

764
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,552
Is

765
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:50,112
Making networking technology

766
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:51,648
Accessible to folks

767
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:54,720
Who have little or no networking knowledge

768
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:56,256
Kind of taking rxp

769
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:57,792
Ortiz from home networking

770
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:59,584
Where millions and millions

771
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:05,984
The people rely on Netgear for their home networking Solutions and most of those folks aren't really technical specialist

772
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,288
We do the same for small business owners

773
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:14,944
Okay so as someone who's dealt with this are we talking about oh now I've got a router and then I've got access points everywhere

774
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,992
Where and how do you make that process

775
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:17,760
Easier

776
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:20,832
Let me give you great example orbi Pro

777
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:26,208
Right or be Pro is a solution for a small maybe four or five thousand

778
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:30,560
Square foot retail outlet or bed-and-breakfast even a hosp

779
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:35,424
Fatality Ben you like a restaurant or whatever and what it allows you to do is

780
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,472
Stand up a small business Network

781
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:41,824
Turn on guest user access the able to log who the guests are they

782
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,104
Use your ecosystem

783
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,384
Have a bunch of ports

784
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,408
Wi-Fi

785
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:46,176
4

786
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:49,760
Business-oriented stuff that you don't want the gas to get access

787
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:53,856
And it does it all in a way that somebody who's an opposite networking

788
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:55,392
Turn it on to make it run

789
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:59,488
Okay so that's orbi problem we've been talking about your Insight line so how is that different

790
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:00,512
Inside

791
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:06,912
Kind of plays the next roll up orbi Pro is really designed as a turnkey for a do-it-yourself net

792
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:07,680
Working person

793
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:09,472
I like to say or be broke

794
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:12,288
Is for people who don't know what a VLAN is

795
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:16,384
And so can you can set up a grade secure business Network

796
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:21,760
And not know anything about networking whatsoever but if you want to go to the next level then inside

797
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:25,088
Bridges that Gap it's both simple to use its

798
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:26,112
Common English

799
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:27,392
Straight boards

800
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:31,488
30 let you get in and start dealing with a real complexities of

801
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:33,024
More scale-out Network

802
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:35,072
What are some of those complexities

803
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:41,728
You're the most common one is that people like to think about structuring their networking isolating various

804
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:44,800
Is domains one common thing I hear for my customers is

805
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:46,080
I want all my

806
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:48,384
Internet of things on a separate VLAN

807
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,968
So that my home network my base business network is

808
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:53,504
Completely isolated

809
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:58,112
Well that requires vlans that requires Port assignments on

810
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:04,000
Switches and a lot of stuff that kind of goes to the next level inside allows you to be able to go to

811
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:05,792
Full Security in Attica

812
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:09,888
Where can I go to find out more about insight and

813
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:10,656
Orbi Pro

814
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:12,192
Www

815
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:16,288
Netgear.com inside

816
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:29,344
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your home Stacy Higginbotham and today's guest is

817
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:30,880
Jennings

818
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:32,928
Who is CEO of

819
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:34,208
Hi Alison how are you doing

820
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:36,256
I'm so well how are you

821
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:37,792
I am excited

822
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:41,376
Because we have talked for like years almost about

823
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:42,656
How we're going to use the black

824
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:45,984
So let's Orion people in

825
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:46,752
And tell them

826
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,032
Where

827
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:50,848
Filament darted in the iot

828
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:51,872
Originally

829
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:56,480
To think quite a while to get into this realm

830
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:58,272
Having an engineering problem

831
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:02,880
Salishan

832
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:05,952
She was problem and then from there it's always hard to realize

833
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:11,072
And now we're squarely in this marriage

834
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:12,864
Between the blockchain and the internet

835
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,632
Awesome

836
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:16,448
We should probably talk a little bit about the hardware problem that you encounter

837
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:20,288
I think it's important only because there's a lot of us height in this phase I mean

838
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:22,336
You taking and everything for just barely IP

839
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:23,360
And you had blocked

840
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,408
You got to get this like

841
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:26,176
Meda hajt

842
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:29,504
Originally address that we were

843
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,368
We had a lot of customers to pay for Internet of Things

844
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:36,416
Product they wanted to pay for it

845
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:37,952
Korea score per month

846
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:40,000
Princeton

847
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,888
Upfront

848
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:51,008
In the technical in the financial world who called capital

849
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,824
Or capex versus

850
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,128
The common terminal Airlines

851
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:57,920
So what we ended up having this

852
00:34:58,176 --> 00:35:00,992
Orangewood company saying what they want to pay for this

853
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,064
Topic

854
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:05,088
Requirements

855
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:07,648
Is it that way

856
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:08,672
Didn't have a good way to

857
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:11,488
On the device

858
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:16,096
And so it is a fundamental engineering problem

859
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:20,960
Any physical device that isn't always online

860
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:23,264
It turns out that this is a very large problem

861
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:28,896
Century there's some famous

862
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:30,944
Problems

863
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:31,968
Sybil attack

864
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:34,784
These are well-known.

865
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,576
Talk and it turns out that the block

866
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:38,624
Happened to be a recent

867
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,416
Invention that had address

868
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:41,184
Does

869
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:44,256
When we start looking

870
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:45,280
It's called

871
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:47,584
Sales problem with some aspects of

872
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:51,424
OKC

873
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,192
You guys

874
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:53,472
Your solution

875
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:55,520
Build your own car

876
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:59,872
It was because we needed to be able to store

877
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:01,152
The cryptographic keys

878
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:01,920
For the block

879
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:05,248
And the only way we knew how to do that

880
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:07,808
SPX

881
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:09,088
The Cure

882
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:13,696
And so that's where we went down the throat if you know originally again only happy

883
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:14,464
Aspire

884
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,512
She asked if I censor device

885
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:19,328
We moved now squarely into bring it up

886
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:21,632
Security of the hardware aspect of making

887
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,448
By having the heart

888
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:25,216
Secure element

889
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:27,264
That we built

890
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:30,848
Okay but that's actually not what you got

891
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,176
It was nice

892
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:36,224
Talk about is a startup

893
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,040
I'm going to solve this problem

894
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:40,064
Now I have

895
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,856
Exactly

896
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:46,976
What were you trying to do 6 years ago you saw this opportunity

897
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:50,560
Wow we could do x what was so cool about those ideas

898
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:55,168
Write this a good question to the pathway

899
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,032
Industrial

900
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:02,080
Ceviche like Sportsman 1000

901
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:07,200
The world in the Ford motor

902
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:11,296
These were the companies that we thought wanted Industrial iot

903
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:13,344
Coming iot

904
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:14,368
And it's

905
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:15,136
Partially true

906
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:17,696
The truth is that we found out

907
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:18,720
Hard struggle

908
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,024
There are

909
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,864
Several people in the company who do want it but there are also several people who do not

910
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,960
Can often be towed Enterprise

911
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:31,008
And the only one way to learn this lesson

912
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:34,848
And then have the field close shutdown

913
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:36,128
Sanya Let's Ride

914
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:37,408
Because of the startup

915
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:39,712
Everything is based

916
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,784
Clearly

917
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:43,552
Industrial

918
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:46,880
When we solve the problem for having a little device

919
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:51,744
Payable on going contract or peruse

920
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,512
Economics

921
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,560
We've been had that moment

922
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:55,840
And which one

923
00:37:56,608 --> 00:38:00,704
We can do this part 5 what happens if we allow our

924
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,240
Officetel

925
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:03,264
Their products

926
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:06,336
Another words what happened

927
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:07,360
Product

928
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:10,432
This could also be economic

929
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,760
And if they could be does it allow them to have him

930
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:17,344
And more importantly does it get

931
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,880
Those who use the veto it

932
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:22,720
Now say oh heck yeah

933
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:24,256
It's about sweater

934
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:28,864
Thule rack today but through a lot of hard lessons by trying to sell Industrial iot

935
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,912
Stacy very difficult

936
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:35,776
Okay so what turns a little bit more so when you say

937
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:37,056
Product

938
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:38,592
Economic machine

939
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:39,872
Giving it economic

940
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:40,640
Capabilities

941
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:43,712
Is that simply like vending machine have the trust

942
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:45,248
And value

943
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:46,272
Store TUMI

944
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:48,576
How would we

945
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:50,880
It's a great question it's an important point so

946
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:53,440
Stoneham thinks about making machines economic

947
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:56,000
I can make sure what we mean is that machines by default

948
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:57,792
Can't our infrastructure Maybe

949
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:00,096
Car trucks

950
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:01,888
Carpal

951
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,680
Those are awesome

952
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:06,496
Not economic nature meaning they can't

953
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:10,080
Transaction value

954
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:12,640
Some people value is data other people

955
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:13,408
Value is

956
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:18,784
Now what that looks like it's when you start Splenda forget it looks like a cryptocurrency

957
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,136
But if those infrastructure pieces or less machine

958
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:23,904
Could

959
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,184
Transact value

960
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,976
Or trade or exchange you know even

961
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:31,072
Can musically be built upon a new business models that allow us to do

962
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:37,728
Simple machine to have the core components required

963
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:38,496
In order to

964
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:39,776
Transact

965
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:40,800
Extension

966
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:43,104
Hair be paid or a test

967
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,152
2

968
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:46,688
True that the minutes happened

969
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:49,504
Cryptographically Exchange

970
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:52,576
Aggregate

971
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:54,368
Together so let's actually

972
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:56,928
Take a step-by-step because this is a pretty

973
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:58,976
I think it's not a hard concept but it

974
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:00,256
Examples totally help

975
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:02,048
Let's go with something

976
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:07,424
Listen Vision something we know and love

977
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,448
Now with

978
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:10,240
The machines having this inherent

979
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:11,776
Capability unit comes from

980
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:12,800
Implanting

981
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:14,592
Write in cars in

982
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:19,456
If you take Vehicles today are usually operated by

983
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:23,552
People usually own the vehicle or pay regulation

984
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:27,392
And usually also pay other

985
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:29,440
Entity to operate a vehicle

986
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:30,976
Insurance

987
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:33,536
Or sometimes a ticket to a highway patrolman

988
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:36,608
For a toll road these are various aspects of

989
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:39,936
Payment.

990
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:40,960
Need to make

991
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:43,264
In order to use music

992
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:46,592
So when I start talking about how this might look differently with her

993
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:50,944
As we see in the future on the horizon of autonomous vehicles

994
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:52,480
They'll still need to

995
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:54,272
Transact on behalf of

996
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:56,576
Either their owner operator the writer

997
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:57,600
The manufacturer

998
00:40:57,856 --> 00:41:00,928
Somebody will need to pay for the fuel to recharge

999
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:01,952
The ticket

1000
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:02,720
Find

1001
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:05,024
Toll road fee and so these are all

1002
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,584
And there's just not

1003
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,352
8 weight

1004
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:09,120
To do that today

1005
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:12,192
This is like a coyote today is literally like

1006
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,472
Me too

1007
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:20,128
We had gray background website sir Tim berners-lee invented the world wide web and we're all excited about make your own web

1008
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:23,968
And then came along.

1009
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:26,528
E-commerce which allowed the internet

1010
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:27,296
2B Transit

1011
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:34,976
To be transacted as well because what happened when we brought e-commerce the internet

1012
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:36,512
We got companies like Amazon

1013
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:37,536
Alibaba

1014
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:38,560
EBay

1015
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:39,840
How old is amazing

1016
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:43,168
Exactly could not have existed

1017
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,448
Of the internet

1018
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:47,776
So when we can bring the future Alibaba

1019
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:48,800
Amazon eBay

1020
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:51,616
Could be built upon the machine

1021
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:54,943
The Stick of payments for a moment longer

1022
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:56,479
A lot of people look at this

1023
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:58,015
This is like a way to enable macros

1024
00:41:59,039 --> 00:41:59,551
So

1025
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:02,367
I feel like in some ways that's a bit limiting but we

1026
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:03,647
Do need a way to do my

1027
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:05,183
Transactions so can you

1028
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:05,951
Give us your vision

1029
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:09,023
Yes microtransactions are funny

1030
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:11,071
Because they are buried

1031
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:13,375
So many ways but the technology

1032
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:14,399
In the trees

1033
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:16,703
Directions for

1034
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:18,751
He almost empty Commerce

1035
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:21,311
Publishers

1036
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:24,127
You're going to pay podcast

1037
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:26,431
We were going to pay a lot of people a lot of things

1038
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:28,223
Never really

1039
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:30,783
And a big reason why

1040
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:33,343
Did the minimum transaction fee to make

1041
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:36,671
In the traditional credit card or electronic

1042
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:39,487
World that we had up until 10 years ago was still

1043
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:40,767
Too high for microchip

1044
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:42,559
Do you like going to the ATM

1045
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:44,607
And clean out $0.30.

1046
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:46,399
$2

1047
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:47,423
It just doesn't

1048
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:54,079
I didn't know in this actually going to do that so there is an aspect to this that we're looking at that cryptocurrency

1049
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:55,615
Allow for the pie

1050
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:56,383
Possibility

1051
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:57,919
Have microtransaction

1052
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:58,943
Capability

1053
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:04,063
This isn't always

1054
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:07,647
Spaceballs

1055
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:12,767
That public blockchain such as Bitcoin and ethereum are quite expensive right now

1056
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:16,863
Taxi transact on internally want coffee maker conduction test

1057
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:20,959
Luckily there are some new technologies in that state

1058
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:21,983
Network that

1059
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:26,591
Requirements

1060
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:29,407
All that is to say that this technology

1061
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:30,175
Along with

1062
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:33,247
Development is setting up

1063
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:34,271
The situation

1064
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:35,295
Very nicely

1065
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:36,575
To actually be able to

1066
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:37,599
Could you microtransaction

1067
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:38,623
At the hardware level

1068
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:39,391
Finally

1069
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:41,695
It only took us like 30 years ago

1070
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:43,743
That's how I feel about a lot of

1071
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:47,839
Now it's actually here

1072
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:49,375
So

1073
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:50,911
Let's talk about value

1074
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:52,191
Because this is

1075
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:54,239
Cryptocurrency hype

1076
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:55,263
I think a lot of people

1077
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:57,311
Don't think about the idea

1078
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:58,335
Attestation

1079
00:43:58,591 --> 00:44:00,639
Update on saying hey this came from here

1080
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:02,687
It's a really important thing and I'll just

1081
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:03,455
Sherwood

1082
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:04,223
Our listeners

1083
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:07,295
I was talking with someone from Bosch and they were talking about

1084
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:10,111
Connecting trucks please of trucks

1085
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:14,207
And it would be really beneficial to have some sort of decentralized way

1086
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:16,255
For those trucks to identify

1087
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:17,535
Car self driving

1088
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:19,327
Identify that they can join

1089
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:21,887
Time it take advantage

1090
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:23,423
Cartoon VR so

1091
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:26,239
Machines being able to

1092
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:29,823
Data or Truss

1093
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:31,103
Absolutely

1094
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:32,639
Because you know a lot of

1095
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:39,039
Networking

1096
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:40,575
Machine learning

1097
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:43,135
That's better

1098
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:45,695
Detective chief

1099
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:48,767
And I think that economics

1100
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:53,375
Not even when people sell things are always after the data

1101
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:56,191
Catchphrase

1102
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:59,007
Expected we think of it

1103
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:01,567
If you look at information or what

1104
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:05,151
Definition Theory data is the Bottom Rung of this

1105
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:06,687
Definition

1106
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:08,479
Because data and then on top of that

1107
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:10,527
Information which is data that

1108
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:11,295
Organized

1109
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:14,623
And then on top of that information

1110
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:15,647
Categorized

1111
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:21,279
And then you have your wisdom which is overlooking based

1112
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:22,559
Previous knowledge

1113
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:26,911
Proactive

1114
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:29,983
Siri and Alexa kind of think about how we

1115
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:31,007
Deal with data

1116
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:32,799
Is it similar thing that we

1117
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:34,847
Headed to dig into the economics

1118
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:37,407
Is not data

1119
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:38,943
Economics

1120
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:41,503
And then on top of that you start to have

1121
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:43,039
Party or participate

1122
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:43,807
Cinemark

1123
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:47,647
Look up. You start to have things like

1124
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:49,695
Transaction demand

1125
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:51,999
Reputation is like Wednesday

1126
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:55,583
Like I will trust you again cuz I trusted you in the back

1127
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:56,607
Every time

1128
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:59,423
So it's interesting because it's parallel

1129
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:00,703
Field

1130
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:03,775
And both of them are just as powerful as the other

1131
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:05,567
But we spent a lot of type of data

1132
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:07,359
In the tech world

1133
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:10,431
Talking about values

1134
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:12,479
Requires

1135
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:14,783
Trust to be absolutely rock-solid

1136
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:17,855
If you can't trust the other party

1137
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:20,415
Your reputation for the park & Market Apartments

1138
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:22,463
Don't know

1139
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:24,255
And I thought they were most attacks happen

1140
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:25,535
Today in the cryptocurrency

1141
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:28,095
Space is like trying to steal cheese in the Trap

1142
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,167
So when we think about this we really do want

1143
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:32,191
Established

1144
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:36,031
Really strong roots of traffic and then on top of that let others build

1145
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:37,055
Their applications

1146
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:39,359
Let's break down this

1147
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:40,639
Concept of trust from

1148
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:42,175
Economic theory

1149
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:43,199
Because

1150
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:45,759
What you're talking about is just that it's

1151
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:50,623
Sure it's trust that it's secure in your stuff won't be stolen or

1152
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:53,695
I can't be value cannot be

1153
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:54,463
Temperature

1154
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:55,231
Correct

1155
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:57,791
Because there's also an element of trust in

1156
00:46:58,303 --> 00:47:00,607
Reputations like what I think of is a person

1157
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:02,911
Trusting another /

1158
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:04,447
That's more reputational

1159
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:05,215
Incorrect

1160
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:06,239
I think so

1161
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:08,287
Okay because the tech companies

1162
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:13,151
I would look at them and I think going into eye

1163
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:15,711
Abstract for a lot of people as machines being

1164
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:16,479
Transaction

1165
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:17,503
Build it

1166
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:18,527
A lot of companies

1167
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:21,087
The reputation Trust

1168
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:24,159
It's becoming increasingly clear that

1169
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:25,439
If you're going to say

1170
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:26,463
You're going to hand

1171
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:27,743
Company the keys to

1172
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:28,511
Creative me

1173
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:30,815
Some sort of aspect

1174
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:32,095
Business weather

1175
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:32,863
Partner with

1176
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:35,679
That relationship

1177
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:37,727
In the reputation entrust their beak

1178
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:42,335
So much more important and I don't see a lot of companies thinking that way

1179
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:43,871
I think that maybe

1180
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:48,735
Completely agree in concurrence I don't even see it in our Clinic

1181
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,015
No fear in other areas

1182
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:53,087
What happens when trust breaks down

1183
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:56,415
It can be pretty dense metal can be able to trust

1184
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:59,487
Perspective

1185
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:02,559
And I completely agree with you.

1186
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:04,863
Used trucks

1187
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:05,631
URC

1188
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:09,215
Then when losing out on possible future capability and

1189
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:10,495
Quite frankly

1190
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:13,311
Payment issue later because we have trust based in

1191
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:17,919
We don't have it yet we're not quite there I do believe it starts with people reconsidering what trust means

1192
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:22,271
Okay well that got deep real

1193
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:26,623
It's something that I'm not sure we can

1194
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:28,927
But if you have any tips

1195
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:30,207
Stephen Thompson

1196
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:31,487
Blase about

1197
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:33,791
Really so important

1198
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:36,607
Ways to establish real partnership

1199
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:39,935
What are the kind of things that a company should be

1200
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:42,495
Communicating and also internalizing

1201
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:47,359
Considering this as a first class property

1202
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:49,663
Property

1203
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:52,479
Fire today

1204
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:54,015
It's not unlike

1205
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:55,039
Traditional

1206
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:55,807
Security office

1207
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:02,975
And then we had the Home Depot

1208
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:05,279
Target another hacks where

1209
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:08,863
This is a requirement this is a necessary thing for

1210
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:09,887
To take seriously

1211
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:14,495
I do believe that you know

1212
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:19,103
Sir I'm not sure he could probably fall under CIA

1213
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:20,895
Regardless

1214
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:25,247
Somewhere where somebody champions

1215
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:26,527
I need to be treated

1216
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:28,575
Because it will be one of us

1217
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:29,855
Lightable area

1218
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:31,391
Where are you again

1219
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:32,415
In some ways

1220
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:34,719
Traditional human or social

1221
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:38,303
Spearfishing

1222
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:39,583
Gmail

1223
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:42,143
Nfcu

1224
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:43,935
A breach of trust at the end of the day

1225
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:45,471
People assumed that they could

1226
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:46,495
Email coming from

1227
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:47,519
Westside Pizza

Text Lee

1230
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:54,687
Much more broken up

1231
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:58,783
Treated with respect. Whatever type of I don't want cause a liability but

1232
00:49:59,039 --> 00:49:59,551
Responsibility

1233
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:00,831
Of companies

1234
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:02,623
Connect

1235
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:05,183
Religious Wireless World or

1236
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:06,207
Connected world

1237
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:07,487
Where's that they must also

1238
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:10,303
Have some aspect of responsibility around the

1239
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:11,071
Festivus

1240
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:17,983
List of people you know

1241
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:21,567
So it could be as simple as

1242
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:23,103
SM Plaza

1243
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:24,639
It could be something it has

1244
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:26,431
Proactive is the key about

1245
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:28,991
Training your algorithms to handle adversarial at

1246
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:29,759
Tax

1247
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:31,039
Which exactly

1248
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:32,831
Is kind of crazy hard

1249
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:33,855
I think about

1250
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:37,951
Grateful

1252
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:41,023
The question isn't can you

1253
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:42,815
How do you know when it's actually Act

1254
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:44,095
Attract the Great Plains

1255
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:45,375
Okay well

1256
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:47,167
We have talked about a lot of things

1257
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:47,935
Analysis

1258
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:50,495
I appreciate you making me think so hard this after

1259
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:52,031
I really enjoyed it
