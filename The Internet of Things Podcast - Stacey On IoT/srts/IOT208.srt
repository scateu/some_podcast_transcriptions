Kevin tofel

6
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:21,760
That's right

7
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:23,552
Instead of Kevin who is off

8
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:25,088
Watching his beloved

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,136

00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:29,440
His team is Arizona State University so

11
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,488
He's actually at a nearby game

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,792

Yes

18
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:42,496
Yes I made you an offer you couldn't

19
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:47,360
Refuse that was basically at Chris Forest both Kevin and I into the podcasting game

20
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:49,152
Low these five years

21
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:50,944
Hates Chris

22
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:54,784
Hey you're welcome and it's a pleasure to be here I don't want people to feel

23
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:59,648
Like a Miss Kevin too much so I'll be sure to drop a bunch of Beatles references as we're chatting

24
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:04,256
Excellent and if you could be overly optimistic and not at all privacy-conscious.

25
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:05,280
Also help

26
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:06,048

Kevin tofel

28
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,352
Okay

29
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:11,168
We have a big show we're going to be talking a lot actually

30
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:13,216
About connected cars

31
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:18,080
The federal government is ripping up some of their efforts with an iot security bill

32
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:19,872
And a facial recognition bill

33
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:21,664
Talk about we've got yet

34
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,432

Machine learning at the edge stick this time from Nvidia

36
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:30,112
We could be talking about for borrow doing a deal with SmartThings

37
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:31,136
And

38
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:33,184
Welcomes smarter chips

39
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:33,952
Are smarter

40
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:34,976
Speakers

00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:35,744
Plus

42
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,024
Robots Galore

43
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:40,352
I guess this week is going to be Bjorn block from Ikea

44
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:42,912
We're going to be talking about Ikea's plans in the smartphone

45
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:46,240
Including the smart blinds and an upcoming partnership with

46
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,008
Sonos

47
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,824
We're also going to hear from our sponsor of feral

Cool stuff

51
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:58,528
And finally we've got another message

52
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:00,320
From another one of our sponsors

53
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:02,880

And for all of you who are like

61
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:38,208
Nvme

62
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:39,488
Just think to yourself

63
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,024
It's wicked

64
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:42,816
So

65
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:43,584
Chris

66
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:45,632
Let us get started with

67
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,704
News about securing our cars

68
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:51,520
Didn't which is a security company

69
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:53,568
They have added a new program

70
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:54,848
That basically

71
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,408
Brings all of those OBD

72
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:58,432
To Port

73
00:02:58,944 --> 00:02:59,712
Devices

74
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:04,320
So does things you plug into your car they're connected they can tell you where the car is been they could tell you

75
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:06,112
How it's breaking all of that

76
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:07,904
They now tie that into your smartphone

77
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:08,928
What's a villain

78
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,976
Security package you can get

79
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,256
A OBD port

80
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:14,048
Monitor device and

81
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,376
Then it will do things like if someone bumps into your car

82
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,704
It will trigger the accelerometer inside that device

83
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:21,728
That device

84
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:24,032
Will go over a cellular modem connection

85
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:24,800
Into the cloud

86
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,848
Clown calls back down to your house

87
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,384
And it turns on

88
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,152
Camera

89
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,200
It's watching your driveway

90
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:31,968
And it'll be like

91
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:33,504
Oh dude it was your neighbor

92
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,272
I totally back today

93
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,552
What do you think

94
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:39,136
Well

95
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,928
Is it something you would get like

96
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,464
Let me ask you that cuz I don't

97
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,488
I don't think I would

98
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:46,304
But I live in a pretty room

99
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,584
Rural area

100
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:48,608
So

101
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,424
I'm not as concerned about it but is this something you would want

102
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:52,448
Plugged in

103
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:54,752
Tight end do you need to know that much about what's going on

104
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,080
So I don't but I don't park my car in the street

105
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,104
I think if I did

106
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,128
My car in the street

107
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,152
Might be nice

108
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,944
The other thing is

109
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,224
Apparently

110
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,784
According to the people at Vivint a lot of people

111
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,344
Don't really know much about these OBD

112
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,368
We got to find a better name

113
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:11,648
I hate saying this

114
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,744
Basically they're little things you plug into your car they're connected usually cellular

115
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,791
Via cellular modems and

116
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,351
Again they monitor where cars been

117
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:21,631
How fast is going

118
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,399
Breaking

119
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,935
Bumps all kind of

120
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:30,591
We actually just answered a question last week from somebody who's like I'm a teen driver and I'm thinking that might be a good thing to get

121
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:32,639
Yes

122
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:36,223
Do you need to link it to your house Vivint is going to charge you

123
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,015
$10 a month for

124
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:43,391
One and then $5 a month for every subsequent device you want to connect in through their platform

125
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:45,439
And then you'll also need a camera

126
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:47,231
Right pointed at your car

127
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:48,255
Yes

128
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,791
They also offer that

129
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:50,815
And

130
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,863
I think for some people this is going to be

131
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,143
Relatively

132
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:54,911
I mean it's

133
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,447
It's not terribly expensive

134
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:59,263
If you think about like it's got a data plan associated with it.

135
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,031
They're paying

136
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,055
So

137
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:03,103
Some people will like it there probably like

138
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:07,711
More so than like weren't being worried about their car getting bumped they probably will want

139
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:10,783
The Peace of Mind of being able to look and see where their car is

140
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:13,855
I know that because I have a Tesla I can see where the

141
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:14,879
The Tesla is parked

142
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,671
And so I always know like

143
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:17,695
Where am I

144
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:20,255
My car is gone with like my husband and child

145
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:21,535
For they are

146
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,303
Which country

147
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,863
Get you don't part of me

148
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:27,167
As I think about these things and I think about

149
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,959
Protecting my home

150
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:33,311
And property or whatever I get some point I just I don't want to go down a rabbit hole on it

151
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,847
For something like this

152
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:37,151
If someone bumped my car and they take off

153
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:40,223
Do I really want to go through the process of tracking them down

154
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,015
Finding them confronting them

155
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:44,063
Making it like a big

156
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:44,831
Deal

157
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,647
You know depending on the size with dang

158
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:51,999
Just taking care of it like I just think of the number of times that my car whether I've lived in a city or not

159
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,535
Has actually been hit

160
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:58,911
And you know I don't know this could just be the old curmudgeon in me but I just wear like a you know what sometimes

161
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:02,751
Life happens and I can't prepare for everything and I don't need to know

162
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:07,103
Yeah I don't need to be able to track down whoever done me wrong every single time

163
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:09,919
I think you wouldn't do it cuz this is not like a

164
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:14,783
A Jack Reacher novel I think what would probably happen is that you would give it to the police in the insurance

165
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:15,807
Couple and they will take care of

166
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:19,135
What yeah I know I don't forget I am not saying that I would

167
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,159
I am not saying I would

168
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,975
Right

169
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:26,303
Yeah it was just a matter of like how much more

170
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:30,143
Work is going to go into it versus just taking care of it and just you know

171
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:33,471
On the ongoing again get ive lived in dense cities

172
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,495
And

173
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:40,895
In the case of a car being. Again you said there's something with like a teenager there might be something of value that and maybe

174
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,967
10 years down the road I could see value in it with my own kid

175
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,319
But I don't know for right now it's you can really you can over ensure things

176
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,599
Thanks to a point to where it's

177
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:51,135
Statues of going to happen man

178
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:54,719
Yes I feel even better about this since you know I'm

179
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:57,791
Actually going to live near you at some point in the very near-term

180
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:00,095
If I didn't your car I'm going to be like

181
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,631
Stuff happens

182
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,751
If you make the trip to ding my car I'm going to let it go

183
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:09,055
Did you get to put the work in I'll respect that

184
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,591
Excellent so

185
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:14,431
In other car related news on Amazon

186
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,527
What color Madame a Blog and if you remember what we called

187
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:21,087
Amazon digital assistant so as not to set off every

188
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,111
Devices

189
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:25,439
They actually with the launch of the echo Auto

190
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:29,535
Which again I talked about a couple weeks ago cuz I really want Madam and my car

191
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,839
Kevin Dixon crazy but I'm all for it

192
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,119
What

193
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:37,727
Madam

194
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:42,335
To build skills for these devices to recognize what kind of device there are

195
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:45,919
This is really important because it gets to our favorite topic

196
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:46,687
Fake witches contacts

197
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:48,479
So if someone

198
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,807
What is the weather

199
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,599
And The Echoes

200
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:55,903
Realize there in a car

201
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,207
They can pick the most appropriate weather to that low

202
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:01,279
Location or maybe they can tailor something a little bit more specific to

203
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,047
The car

204
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,071
I don't really know what

205
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,863
You would do with weather in the car that was terrible

206
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:07,679
But this is really good I think it's really

207
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,471
It also

208
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:15,103
Anna speaks to the fact that Madame is getting embedded in more and more devices so this will become more and more important

209
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:17,151
Because there are certain things you want

210
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,943
If you ask it on like a dick

211
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:19,967
Display

212
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,759
Versus if you ask it

213
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,039
Nest Thermostat

214
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:24,831
I don't know if your thoughts

215
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,623
Tennis grass or if you want the ecowatt

216
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:27,903
Do you want Amazon in

217
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,207
I really don't

218
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:35,839
This whole conversation is setting me up to be an old curmudgeon get off of my lawn

219
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:37,119
But what I have

220
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,399
So I drive a Chevy Volt

221
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:39,679
And

222
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,983
I have a hard enough time getting

223
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,007
Carplay to work

224
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:49,919
Like it for some reason I don't know if I just have a bad thing or whatever but it is super infuriating to try and use apple carplay

225
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:52,223
Play the car if the phone is plugged in

226
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,527
I don't really use all the time needing the

227
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,575
A question answered or some kind of

228
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,623
Smart assistant other than Mike Maps

229
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,671
However what is kind of interesting is if you can

230
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:02,463
Pull the camera back right

231
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,767
So in terms of contacts

232
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,327
And the assistant and an echo in your car

233
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,863
As Amazon

234
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:12,447
Start building out more things like an Amazon grocery store

235
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,471
Right

236
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:16,031
That talks possibly to your

237
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:18,079
Amazon fridge or Dash replenishment

238
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:23,199
System it could say hey you're near an Amazon grocery remember you needed to get coffee

239
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:27,039
Do you want to pop in and get it we can have somebody waiting for it you know automated I'm just

240
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:33,951
Obviously a long enough timeline sure

241
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:37,023
Or just pour the coffee directly into your mouth but

242
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,071
It is interesting to think of context

243
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:42,143
In terms of connecting all your Amazon Services which I use a lot of

244
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:44,447
I haven't found that I use

245
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:47,519
Or have been wanting a smart assistant too much in my car

246
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,799
Let alone one

247
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:52,895
That requires an extra step so I already have carplay so I can use Siri

248
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,687
Whenever I want should I want

249
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:59,039
The idea I get it Siri is not the greatest

250
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:01,599
Voice Assistant platform in the world however

251
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:04,415
It is there and four basic questions

252
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,439
She could answer

253
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:09,535
But can I put a side note in here about the problem with Madam a

254
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,839
Yeah just personal anecdote

255
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:16,191
So I read to my son every night and we are currently reading the Wildwood series of books

256
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:19,519
And two of the main characters in this book

257
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,823
Are named Alexandra and Alexei

258
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:24,895
And so when you trying to get your son to go to sleep

259
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:27,711
And every time you mention one of the characters

260
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:28,991
And then there's a beep

261
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,039
Because misses a pop song

262
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,063
I just kind of

263
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:35,135
Authors of the world please stop using those two names

264
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:36,927
Will my solution for you

265
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:37,695
Sleepy

266
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:41,279
Oh yeah I guess I couldn't I would require work

267
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,815
Already got him trained

268
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,351
To say

269
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:48,191
You know my son already knows how to use Alexa I don't need to switch it up on him now

270
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:53,311
I think that would be a lot of fun actually to to suddenly change all the a digital assistant names in your house

271
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,079
Watch how long it

272
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,895
Teehee

273
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:59,199
Fun up until like 4 in the morning

274
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:03,039
When he wants Astoria is trying to go back to bed and keeps yelling anywhere

275
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,063
Hayward

276
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,391
Okay

277
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:09,439
Moving along to

278
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:11,231
Federal government

279
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:12,767
The US federal government

280
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:16,863
That's where we are based even though not all of her audience is there

281
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:17,887
This week

282
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,167
For senators

283
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,959
Co-authored and introduced

284
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:24,287
The Internet of Things cybersecurity Improvement Act of

285
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,055
2019

286
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:27,615
Is the following act when they introduced

287
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,151
T17

288
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:29,919
Images of

289
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:30,943
Very different

290
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:33,759
And I would say it a lot of ways it's much better

291
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,807
The prior act required

292
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:36,831
Lots of

293
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:39,647
Things it spent time to finding firmware

294
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,695
Time to finding a server

295
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,999
It's bedtime saying hey you

296
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:47,071
You can't sell a device to the government that has hard-coded passwords in

297
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,607
How to cut of a long list of things

298
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,679
A lot of those things were perfectly fine

299
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,239
The idea of setting

300
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,007
Something like

301
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,079
What you need to be secure and stone like that

302
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,359
Felt really

303
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,127
Dumb

304
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:02,431
Because security is an ever-changing

305
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,735
Moving Target as it were

306
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:07,039
We're so this next version basically says

307
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:07,807
Hey

308
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:11,135
Before the federal government buys connected devices

309
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,415
They need to

310
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,695
Golang

311
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:19,583
Make sure they follow security guidelines that are set forth by the National Institute of Standards and Technology

312
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,351
Earnest

313
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,375
So

314
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:25,471
When a Sac passes nist has 180 days to basically say

315
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:28,799
Here's some of the rules we think you should follow here some of the vulnerabilities out there

316
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,335
Don't do this

317
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,103
And then

318
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:31,871
The

319
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:38,271
OMG the Office of Management and budget is going to basically say okay nist thank you and it will tell each agency

320
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,807
How they should follow those rules

321
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,343
And then presumably

322
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:43,135
The agencies will follow the rules

323
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:45,439
And then it also says

324
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:49,023
Over every five years missed Will Come Back in

325
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,303
Do this whole process over again

326
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,095
So it also recognizes the fact

327
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:53,631
Hey

328
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,655
Security

329
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,423
Again

330
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:59,263
Will change vulnerabilities will change and it lets the government update

331
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,055
In some cases

332
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,615
Industries have been reluctant

333
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,895
Patch because I feel like

334
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:09,759
They're not allowed to patch and in some Industries they're actually not allowed to patch so this could

335
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,295
Possibly alleviate

336
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,319
It's kind of

337
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,111
That's what I said

338
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:18,463
Do you think five years is too long

339
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:22,047
But I also think that this is the federal government

340
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,327
Hopefully

341
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,375
There's a couple things I'd like to say

342
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:28,191
I'd like to see a budget set aside for something

343
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,471
I like this is part of the bill

344
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:30,751
Because you know

345
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,543
Unfunded mandates are everybody's

346
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:35,615
And I would like to see the time limit shrink a little bit

347
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,407
But I recognize

348
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,175
That

349
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:40,735
When your is huge as the federal government

350
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,015
You can't just be

351
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,295
There is no agile

352
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,063
And the Federal

353
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:49,439
Most companies when I talked to them about how they're thinking about security they're following kind of

354
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,743
A devops or an Agile development Strat

355
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,023
Around it

356
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,071
The government really isn't great at that

357
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:57,375
I'd love for them to get there but I don't think

358
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:59,679
A bill is the best place to start

359
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:00,447
Necessarily

360
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,007
It's like turning a battleship

361
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:08,383
And then turning it again in 5 years and then turn at me like it is there is a lot of inertia behind it

362
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:11,199
So you said you don't think this is going to go anywhere this bill

363
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,735
You know I don't know

364
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:14,015
Maybe it will

365
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:18,623
You know what's it's being introduced to both the House and Senate this is a senate version

366
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,671
We'll have to see if it gets too

367
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,439
Committee

368
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,231
I mean it's about darn time

369
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,511
We need something

370
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:27,839
And this is a decent way of going about

371
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:28,607
Not doing it

372
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:34,495
I don't know if it's goes into effect it won't go into effect until March 31st

373
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,031
But you know

374
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:36,799
Hey

375
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:40,895
Almost a year away and government timeline

376
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,175
That is true

377
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:45,247
That's that's pretty good

378
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:49,855
You know what this article got me thinking about I actually grew up in military housing

379
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:53,183
And it got me thinking cuz I know you've written stuff about like

380
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:55,743
Smart home stuff in apartments

381
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,791
And what you can and can't do

382
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,327
But the idea of

383
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,887
You know Security in iot

384
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:05,471
And consumer adoption when that consumer adoption happens to be

385
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:08,031
On a military base with military families

386
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:11,103
I just thought that was kind of I hadn't thought about before

387
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,895
Because you never ate while I am

388
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:13,919
Confident

389
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:14,943
But you know

390
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:17,503
People aren't spilling Secrets over the dinner table

391
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:19,039
Are you dumb

392
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:21,599
In military housing you know there are still

393
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:27,487
People get together and chat and if you've got microphones everywhere that's just I wonder if there are any

394
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,279
Regulations around that

395
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,839
What people are allowed and aren't allowed to do

396
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:34,911
I'm sure people have thought about it but it just something you know

397
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,447
I never thought about you know

398
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:42,847
Growing up we didn't have these kind of things but they're still especially with like the nest Revelation and I don't know if you would put a nest if you were in a

399
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:43,871
Military home buy

400
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:45,919
I don't know maybe you like to Tinker and you would

401
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:51,551
Or just an echo device listens to the show military housing

402
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:57,183
Let us know do you have an attitude or their documents are guidelines about that sort of thing

403
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,975
I know that the

404
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:02,303
Department of Defense after the whole Strava

405
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,071
That really wasn't

406
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:03,839
And it was just

407
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:07,167
Widespread release of public data on

408
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,447
The Strava running app

409
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:11,007
And then it showed

410
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:13,567
The location of military bases could be

411
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:14,847
Construed from looking at

412
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,431
Everybody

413
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:19,967
Don't use Strava

414
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:24,319
Especially if you running on an undisclosed military base

415
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,111
Which

416
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:30,463
So I don't know

417
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:31,487
Let us know

418
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,279
Can call and tell us something

419
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,815
Flight at 5 12623

420
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:35,583
7

421
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,119
That was early

422
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:40,703
Okay another piece of legislation

423
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,751
We're not just caring about internet

424
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:44,287
Security

425
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,591
We are also caring about

426
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:48,383
Facial recognition

427
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:52,735
So I think it was last week Kevin and I talked about using facial recognition

428
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,551
US airports for

429
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:59,135
Basically tracking people as they come into the country to make sure they're not on

430
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,415
Crazy watch list

431
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:01,695
We were like

432
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:02,719
Hey

433
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:05,791
That's kind of iffy because nobody actually

434
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,071
With the none of this went through public

435
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,095
Comment

436
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:12,959
I'm and there were no limitations placed on the Airlines and how they decided to use that facial

437
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:13,727
Recognition data

438
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:14,751
So

439
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:15,775
Kevin and I worry

440
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:16,543
We're not in Peru

441
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,079
But

442
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,359
It sounds like

443
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:20,895
Might have

444
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:21,663
I don't know what real

445
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,199
This

446
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:26,783
Is a bipartisan acts that means a Democrat and a Republican

447
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:29,087
Holy cow working together submitted this

448
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:31,903
This is the commercial facial recognition privacy

449
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:34,207
And basically

450
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:34,975
It's

451
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:37,535
Saying that users would be notified

452
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:41,375
Whenever their facial recognition data is used or collected

453
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:44,191
This is also part of the backlash we saw

454
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,471
Probably a week ago

455
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:46,751
About

456
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:48,543
IBM pulling data from

457
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,311
Flickr

458
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,335
And

459
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,871
Using that to build

460
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:53,151
Best biased

461
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,687
Facial recognition

462
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:58,527
And people who had their photos on Flickr we're kind of like

463
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:01,087
Hey what you did what with my foot but I didn't say

464
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:01,855
Yes to that

465
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,135
And it upset people

466
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:05,183
So this law would prevent that

467
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,463
And

468
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:08,767
Again who knows if it will pass

469
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,047
It could be useful

470
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:10,815
I don't know

471
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:12,095
You want to get currently

472
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:15,679
So let's tie this in with the Vivint story from earlier

473
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:22,079
How does that work in terms of like if your facial if your security camera captures my face

474
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,615
And is used

475
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:26,687
Howl like a bystander basically captures a bystander

476
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:30,015
In a case like that my hunches

477
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:32,575
If your Vivid you can't actually use that

478
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:34,111
Image data

479
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,391
From that camera

480
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,671
To train an algorithm

481
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,463
For facial

482
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:40,511
Cognition

483
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:42,559
Use a facial recognition

484
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,095
Let's say you have a database

485
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:47,423
You probably couldn't run it against a database

486
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:50,495
Especially for a consumer used in the

487
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:51,519
Or something like that

488
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,311
Is my gas without permission

489
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:55,103
Like I have cameras that record

490
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,151
But I have actually opted

491
00:18:58,943 --> 00:18:59,455
And I've tried

492
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:01,503
Help me hear

493
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,551
He helped me understand the importance of it

494
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:04,319
Because

495
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:06,111
There are so many things

496
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,903
But I know I should care about

497
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:14,559
And this is one where I just had sort of resigned myself and it's like I'm always going to be under surveillance I'm always somebody's always going to be

498
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:15,839
The appearing somewhere on

499
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,119
Camera at some point

500
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,911
And it's going to be used for something

501
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,447
And I know I should

502
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:24,543
Mindful and care about it I get the big like macro pictures and

503
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,847
Issues surrounding it but help me like

504
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,639
Help me want to

505
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:31,711
You care more about it

506
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:35,551
I think surveillance in public areas is something that has

507
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:38,367
We all acknowledge that there are cameras everywhere

508
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:40,415
There are fewer actually in the US Senate

509
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:42,463
Places that there are cameras everywhere in Pueblo

510
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:46,559
The question is if you are going to use facial

511
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,839
Recognition ansan

512
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:50,655
Right now the cameras just see you going about you

513
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:52,447
Your day but the computer system doesn't

514
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:54,751
Special recognition

515
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:55,775
The system

516
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:57,055
With tag you

517
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,079
And what's

518
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:59,615
Really worrisome to lots of pee

519
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:02,175
Is it might tag you and also have

520
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:04,223
Scary information about you

521
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,247
Even this is actually happening

522
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,271
King in China so

523
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,295
It might be like

524
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,063
Oh

525
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,343
That guy walking

526
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:10,623
Where is Chris Albrecht

527
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:11,903
And he has a parking

528
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,183
At the

529
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:14,719
In the city of Seattle

530
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:15,487
And

531
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:18,303
He is delinquent on his student loans

532
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,583
That it might share that information

533
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:20,351
Information with people

534
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,399
So the key

535
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,423
Here I think

536
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:25,727
Isn't the surveillance other that's good

537
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:26,495
Frustrating

538
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:29,311
It's the surveillance of the actual knowledge

539
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:33,919
And the ability to tie that knowledge to other data to derive insights about you

540
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:34,687
That is so

541
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:35,455
Worrisome to me

542
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:36,991
Part of me is just like

543
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:39,807
You actually

544
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:43,903
Bring up a really great points right at I totally understand that

545
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:45,183
And it's also

546
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:47,231
Target has feels like it's a sort of

547
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:48,255
Inevitable

548
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:52,351
And bearing down on us and I realized that the sort of an A-list a point of view but like

549
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:55,167
What chance does this bill have of passing out

550
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:56,703
In its current form

551
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:59,775
Probably not much although both Texas and

552
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:00,543
I believe it's

553
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:01,567
Iowa

554
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:05,151
It's a nice State there's Iowa Idaho in

555
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:06,431
Illinois

556
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,199
Illinois

557
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:08,223
It's Illinois

558
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:12,831
However it is Illinois in Texas

559
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:13,599
Have

560
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,416
Laws actually against collecting and using

561
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:19,744
Which means like cool things like

562
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:22,048
Google look like your art

563
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:25,376
It was a Google thing a couple years ago were there like what

564
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,656
Art do you look like

565
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:27,936
You take a picture and it would

566
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:28,704
Show you

567
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,264
That was actually just a grab to get a bunch of a state

568
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:32,544
And also I'm sorry

569
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,824
Sorry show you the world's museums

570
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:37,920
So stuff like that wasn't actually legal in those places so I couldn't do it

571
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:38,688
For example

572
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:40,480
There are rules about that

573
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:42,272
That I think we're actually going to come down for

574
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,296
Pretty hard on

575
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:45,088
Not necessarily the surveillance

576
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,624
But how we link

577
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:53,024
That surveillance to knowledge and especially how we link the knowledge of who a person is to other data

578
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,352
That third step is really what

579
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,120
Is dicey

580
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:58,912
And

581
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:02,496
Is very easily done but I don't think we're going to do it except in a few

582
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:05,824
Cases I do think we'll probably do it wherever lights to light

583
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,616
Like security inside countries

584
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:11,968
Maybe there will be places where when you enter them you'll have to voluntarily sign

585
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:12,992
Away those rights

586
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,064
And that's going to feel kind of iffy

587
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,088
Weird and we may not

588
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:17,856
I like that

589
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:18,880
Right

590
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:19,904
But that's my thought

591
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,184
Maybe look at you go to school

592
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,208
Pick up your kid

593
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:24,000
It's so creepy I don't like it

594
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:25,024
You convinced me

595
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:26,560
Have I

596
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:29,376
You can't just be like I was going to happen

597
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:35,520
To not be seen

598
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,616
That's staying in

599
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:41,152
It yes yes it will

600
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,688
In other news

601
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,760
A video did a big conference this weekend at it

602
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:46,784
They announced

603
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,808
The Jetsons

604
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:48,576
Nano

605
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:51,648
Device this is basically machine learning at the edge which

606
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:54,208
Holy cow might sound familiar cuz we talked about it with

607
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,256
Google's Coral project

608
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:57,280
I believe it was last week

609
00:22:58,048 --> 00:23:00,608
And then we've also talked about it with Intel's movidius project

610
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:03,168
This is noteworthy because

611
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,192
A lot

612
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,216
Of people

613
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:08,544
Industrial iot are using Nvidia Jetson

614
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:13,152
They have a board basically and people are building a lot of industrial iot gateways on

615
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,432
Because it is

616
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,736
Crazy powerful

617
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:18,528
This is $99

618
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:23,648
Can basically get you 472 gigaflops of computing power

619
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:27,744
It's got a quad-core arm a57 processor

620
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,072
Set 128 quart Nvidia Maxwell GPU

621
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:33,120
And 4 gigabytes of

622
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:34,144
Ram

623
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:36,192
It's going to support tensorflow

624
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:37,216
Caffe

625
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:40,544
Pytorch all these other Frameworks for AI

626
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:41,824
This is going to be crazy

627
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:43,616
You will have to plug it in

628
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:46,432
This is not battery powered

629
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,504
This is going to be awesome

630
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,784
It should open

631
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:52,064
Machine learning at the edge

632
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:53,600
Uptmor peep

633
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:58,720
Cuz the original boards for like three hundred and $400 so you actually in a lot of cases had to

634
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,000
Requisition

635
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:02,304
But this at a hundred bucks

636
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:03,584
Easy peasy

637
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,888
You just go out and get one and you play with it and you do something cool

638
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:11,264
$250 autonomous robotics kit

639
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:14,592
And if you want to play with that

640
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:17,920
And it also has like a little robot chassis Motors

641
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:18,944
Battery pack

642
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,736
It's battery powered

643
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:24,064
And you can build your own little robot

644
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:27,904
I don't know Chris Do you want to build your own robot maybe you or your son

645
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:31,232
You know we've gone through that phase and you build it and then

646
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:34,048
You kind of make it move back and forth and get a little bits one

647
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,096
R2D2 little bits

648
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:40,448
He programmed it

649
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:41,728
So

650
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:44,544
Now I have a dismantled R2D2 sitting in a box somewhere

651
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:46,080
But I want to know

652
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:46,848
Like this

653
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,176
Explain to me just cuz you know obviously I don't write about iot

654
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:52,992
And all this industrial stuff can you tell me what it like

655
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:55,552
Are there other products like this out there

656
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,320
And

657
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:59,648
Where do you think the big opportunity for this Nano is

658
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:03,488
So there are there's like a pension the Intel movidius stick

659
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,280
And the Google

660
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:06,048
Oral

661
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:11,168
And I think the opportunity for this is basically for people who are both obvious

662
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,192
It also

663
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:16,800
People inside companies that are trying to figure out how to use iot

664
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,848
They're the people who these things are

665
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:21,152
And the idea is

666
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:22,688
You will say to yourself

667
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:23,456
Man

668
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:25,760
If I you know I got this great model

669
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:29,600
It says if my engine sounds like this could you put some kush

670
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:31,136
That it's going to fail with it

671
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,160
2 days

672
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:33,184
And

673
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:34,976
If I could just get something

674
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:37,280
To recognize that could chunk chunk chunk

675
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:38,816
And then send an alert

676
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:40,608
We have this awesome monitoring system

677
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:41,888
And so

678
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:44,192
What you would do is you would basically

679
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:44,960
Train it to

680
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:46,496
Recognize that ketchup Coachella

681
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:49,568
And put it on this device and then stick this device

682
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:50,848
Somewhere near your mission

683
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,896
And then all of a sudden you've got this late

684
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:54,176
Maybe you spent like

685
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:55,456
130 bucks

686
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:58,528
Are they monitoring project save you some serious down

687
00:25:59,296 --> 00:25:59,808
That's the idea

688
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,088
Is that

689
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:03,648
You'll find all kinds of crazy use cases

690
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,440
That you never even thought of

691
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:06,464
Before and

692
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,256
You'll do it because it's cheap and

693
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:10,304
And I think that's right

694
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:11,584
Oh good

695
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:12,864
Is it out now

696
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,144
Is not available

697
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,680
Today at you can pre-order it

698
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:17,984
On the Nvidia website and it supposed to ship

699
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,264
At the end of March

700
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:21,056
You probably should by now be

701
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:24,640
Because I remember when Intel launch their movidius stick

702
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:26,944
Get on it

703
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,712
You guys

704
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:28,992
All right

705
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:30,272
Next up

706
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,808
SmartThings

707
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:34,368
Users who also love for borrow

708
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:35,392
Rejoice

709
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:38,976
Because fibaro which makes a line of popular Z-Wave

710
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:40,000
Sensors

711
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:46,656
They have finally collaborated with SmartThings so you no longer have to download basically these separate device Handler stick

712
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:50,240
Get the football gear to work as intended on the SmartThings platform

713
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:52,288
Yay

714
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,824
That's basically all we have

715
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:55,872
And then in other

716
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:56,896
Sun News

717
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:57,920
Qualcomm

718
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:59,456
Is announcing a new

719
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:02,272
System-on-a-chip DQ SC400

720
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:08,928
It is basically going to go its design for smart speakers and it should let them hear you better even with background

721
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:10,720
And it should

722
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:12,768
Let them basically respond a little bit more

723
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:13,536
Quickly to you

724
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:17,376
Yay so so yes please

725
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:19,424
It's incremental but it's important increments

726
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:22,752
Yeah no like anything that improves that

727
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:25,312
To get cuz you can just stand in our house

728
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:27,616
If someone says misses a or

729
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:32,736
You know the mr. G or Miss G or gender-neutral Geodon

730
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:34,528
Locate Haji

731
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,344
Then you know there's nothing more frustrating

732
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,136
For both the person trying to

733
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:45,280
Ask a question or listening to that person ask a question then not finding that connection right not being heard

734
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:48,352
And then having to repeat it anyway I'm just saying there's no down

735
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:52,448
You're right there isn't a downside and they announce

736
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,984
Another new chip

737
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,056
Fit basically it puts a higher-quality amplifier

738
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,336
On your smarts

739
00:27:58,592 --> 00:27:59,360
Speaker switch

740
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:01,152
It's not going to be magic

741
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:05,760
You know you're not going to suddenly have these masterful Bose sound systems or anything but

742
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:07,296
It will sound better

743
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:10,880
So go Qualcomm for incremental improvements to Smart speakers

744
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:14,720
This was a category that did not exist a few years ago and now we're at

745
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:17,792
Okay

746
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:22,144
What are you listen to your music on now

747
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:29,056
In-ceiling speakers that are powered by my Sonos we almost exclusively listen to it on

748
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:31,360
On the echo or the Google

749
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:33,152
Yeah I am the same way

750
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,944
Just to make you sad

751
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:37,248
You know what actually it doesn't cuz I sold

752
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,784
Oh that my Sonos stuff

753
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:43,392
A while back but it was amazing how quickly I've gave up Fidelity for

754
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:44,160
Convenience

755
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:47,488
Don't let your wife

756
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,792
All right

757
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:51,328
Moving right along

758
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:54,400
Cool thing that I would totally Buy

759
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:55,424
I don't know about you

760
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:59,008
So this is a Kickstarter I'm going to tell you that so you don't

761
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:02,080
This is not something that may ever come to

762
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:04,384
Fruition however I thought it was so darn cute.

763
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,152
And I really want one

764
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:06,944
This is a therapy dog

765
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:08,992
It is called the tomboc puppy

766
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,784
It is being funded now in

767
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,552
Kickstarter

768
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:16,416
It has reached its $20,000 goal and basically this is a $500 robot

769
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:17,440
Puppy

770
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:18,464
Is 4

771
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,536
Patients with dementia and Alzheimer's and it just interacts with them

772
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:23,072
It's dark cute

773
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:26,656
Man I just wanted and I think my daughter would want it because

774
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:27,936
Bissell Pet

775
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:29,472
That flaps its ears up and down at

776
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:30,496
Looks adorable

777
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:35,360
It's kind of like the aibo except it's only going to be like $500 when it launches its

778
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,384
$300 if

779
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,664
Support the kickstarter

780
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:38,688
But

781
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,992
I really well and also it's got fur

782
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:43,808
Ribose just digit hard plastic

783
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,088
Yes

784
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:45,856
Exactly

785
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:47,392
It's it's just supposed to be this

786
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:48,416
Companion dog

787
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:49,440
I mean

788
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:50,464
Yeah I want it

789
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:53,536
I don't know if I told the guy it is hard for me to

790
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,584
Dump on this idea when it's

791
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:00,960
For the target audience where you know it's older people with dementia who just needs a companion in this

792
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,520
Potentially provide some sort of relief

793
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:04,800
It's just a bummer that it

794
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:07,104
On Kickstarter because

795
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:11,456
Kickstarter I just I write about projects at Hardware projects in particular

796
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:13,504
On Kickstarter that just

797
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,040
Never see the light of day

798
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:17,088
Because people just miss

799
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:18,624
Plan in terms of

800
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,928
How much manufacturing is going to cost and what

801
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,464
Things are going to happen

802
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:29,120
But it is cute and it certainly is something that you know for me I wouldn't get it on to let it out at the middle

803
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:30,656
Schneider you don't have to

804
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:32,704
Board it when you go on vacation

805
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:35,264
Now

806
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:40,128
That probably doesn't for this week's news announcements let's go now to our

807
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:40,896

808
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,712

This week's voicemail is from

828
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:33,632
Casey

829
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:35,424
Hey Stacy and Kevin

830
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,448
Circassian

831
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:37,472
Welcome uses

832
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:38,752
On the show

833
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:40,800
I'm receiving emails from Monoprice

834
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:44,640
I see things from their overtime

835
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:47,200
And I see that they have some kind of

836
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:48,480
Smart home home automation

837
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:52,832
I haven't really been able to find much information on it so

838
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:55,136
If you have a chance

839
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:57,952
Okay Casey I looked up this

840
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:58,720
Product

841
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:03,328
Bee Stitch by Monoprice and it sounds kind of good right you're like

842
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:04,864
Hey it's a hubless

843
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:06,400
Sensor thing

844
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:07,424
Sensor Network

845
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,448
Yay

846
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:10,752
The pricing is not unreasonable it's in Lima

847
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:11,520
With other devices

848
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:13,824
But my concern here

849
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,360
Is twofold one is Wi-Fi

850
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:18,688
Which means a lot of these sensors that you place around your house

851
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:23,552
Depending on how enthusiastic you get your going to have to change their batteries probably within six to eight months is

852
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:28,672
And that may be fine for one particular sensor but I'm going to tell you

853
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:30,464
When you have a bunch of these

854
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:32,000
Or if you have one another

855
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:33,536
Place where it goes off often

856
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:34,816
It's going to happen

857
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:36,352
Rapidly and you're going to get really

858
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:39,936
So that's why WI-Fi sensors I tend to

859
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:40,960
Billy just not go

860
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:42,496
So that's one part

861
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:44,800
I feel like the Grinch yourself

862
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:46,080
Think I'm the commissioner now

863
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:47,872
The other thing is

864
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:50,432
I don't know who makes this and

865
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:51,712
I don't like that

866
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:54,528
I don't like that there's not a lot of information

867
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:56,832
In here about the underlined platform

868
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:57,600
Provider

869
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:59,648
I don't see a lot about it

870
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:01,440
It's security efforts

871
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:03,744
Usually when I look for a product

872
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,792
Smart home product I try to

873
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:06,560
Google

874
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:07,840
The maker obviously

875
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:09,376
And I look for hay

876
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:11,424
Does it have a bug Bounty program

877
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,984
If there has been a vulnerability disclosure

878
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,520
How is it handled it

879
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:18,848
What other people say about how it handles it I look for information about a

880
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:20,640
Encryption I didn't see anything

881
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:21,408
2

882
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:22,944
I have some questions about

883
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:23,968
I thought overall security

884
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,248
Against you made

885
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:28,320
Those are kind of thoughts in

886
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:30,368
I also just looking at it

887
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:31,392
It got really terrible

888
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:36,512
And for the price I would recommend going with something

889
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:40,864
That maybe isn't Wi-Fi maybe do Abode that is a wonderful system

890
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:42,144
People love it

891
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,424
It's high performance

892
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:47,264
If you're focused mostly on security than do SimpliSafe

893
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:51,360
It's another option if you really want smart home automation efforts

894
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:52,896
SmartThings

895
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:55,456
Has a learning curve but it's pretty high quality

896
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:58,016
And Kevin if he were here would tell you

897
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:59,552
Hey there's always the wink

898
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:02,624
And I wouldn't especially type in on this thinking that

899
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,928
You're going to build it and it will work for a while

900
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:09,280
And now it's time to say goodbye to

901
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:12,352
Chris Chris thank you so much for hosting and

902
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:14,144
Just for our audience

903
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:14,912
Please

904
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:18,240
Can you tell me about the show you're doing with robots in San Francisco

905
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:19,264
Cuz I think they'll like it

906
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:22,848
I think they will too and thank you for letting me be a part of this day

907
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:27,200
It's always fun to chat with you Stacy I write for a publication called the spoon.

908
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:29,760
And I want two things that cover his food robot

909
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:32,832
And we are actually putting on a food robot conference

910
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:39,232
In San Francisco on April 16th is called articulate who got speakers from Sony Google Discraft

911
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,512
Robomart

912
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:41,280
Starship

913
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:42,304
Kiwi

914
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,608
Cafe X briggo from Austin

915
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:50,496
Again it's articulate on April 16th and San Francisco I highly recommend if you are at all interested in robots

916
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:53,312
These are all jammed with iot things to so you know

917
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:55,360
There's a business case for that day or for this audience

918
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:57,152
All right I will leave a

919
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:58,432
Lincoln the show notes

920
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:02,016
Again I am moving the day before otherwise I would be there

921
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,552
It sounds awesome

922
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:04,576
So

923
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:05,600
Steve Wilkos

Hi Joe how are you doing

938
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:40,160
Hey Stacy I'm doing great how are you

939
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:43,232
Excellent so we talked in the past about

940
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:49,120
The bank of things in the work you guys did with Mitsubishi bank and we also talked about building a platform

941
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:49,888
Approach

942
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:50,912
Chayote

943
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:53,216
This week I'd like to talk to you about

944
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:54,240
Radios

945
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:55,008
But

946
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:55,776
First

947
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:59,360
I'd love for you to remind our listeners what it is that a pharaoh does

948
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:02,432
Acero provides an iot platform

949
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:03,712
Simplify

950
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:07,040
How you connect anything to the internet we can help you build

951
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:09,856
Business case as well and take you all the way to

952
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:12,160
Rollout and ongoing management

953
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:13,440
Maven data analytics

954
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:14,720
For whatever your connect

955
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:15,488
The product is

956
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,304
Our customers tell us that a pharaoh is the best choice

957
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,584
Sprint user experience

958
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:21,376
And developer productivity

959
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:23,168
It's also beautifully designed

960
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:24,448
Really easy to use

961
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,472
Fast

962
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:26,752
Very very secure

963
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:28,544
So down onto the radio

964
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:32,640
Recently I did an article that talks about combining bleh

965
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:39,040
And cellular on the same chip in the main point was that you could get to the internet through Bluetooth

966
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:41,856
And last week you actually made a pass a Brethren stew

967
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:43,392
Solution that your team

968
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,160
He created a

969
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:45,952
So what's your take

970
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,488
Bluetooth or

971
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:52,608
Specifically ble Bluetooth low energy is really interesting technology because

972
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:54,400
We've already got it and all of our smart

973
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:59,520
And you can probably guess from the name Lou energy it uses very little power so

974
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:01,056
You can build battery operated

975
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:03,360
Is that run for a long time but

976
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:04,384
Unlike

977
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,176
Networking Technologies such as

978
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:10,784
Is LTE or WiFi ble devices don't connect to the internet Direct

979
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:11,808
Play it on their own

980
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:14,624
They need to have some help you use a pharaoh

981
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,392
We provide

982
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:16,672
Technology in the form of

983
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:17,440
The software St

984
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:20,512
That you can embed in your mobile application

985
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:21,792
To enable

986
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:22,816
Pharaoh power

987
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:24,352
Ble device

988
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,912
To securely and automatically

989
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:29,216
Connect through whatever connection

990
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:31,264
Caesars mobile phone already has

991
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:34,336
What Pharaoh was really done is

992
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:38,176
Created a custom ble profile that not only ensures that

993
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:38,944
Secure connection

994
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:40,480
But also enables

995
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:44,064
Acero ble devices and gateways such as phones

996
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:45,600
To find each other

997
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:46,624
And set up internet

998
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,648
Connections automatically

999
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:48,928
This way

1000
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:53,536
As your phone comes within range of these Sakura Pharaoh ble device

1001
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:56,608
They will automatically form a connection back

1002
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:57,376
To the internet

1003
00:37:57,632 --> 00:38:01,216
Using policies that are entirely set and governed by rules

1004
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:02,496
Running in the cloud

1005
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:04,800
We call a table for a fair of ele

1006
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:07,360
That sounds a lot like what we talked about

1007
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:10,688
When we talked about the bank of things idea

1008
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,760
Let's talk a little bit about data piece of AI

1009
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:19,392
Before we go please remind us where people can go to get more information

1010
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,440
Sounds great Stacy

1011
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:23,744
Arrow. IO

1012

GoDaddy

1013

Watch Big

1014
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:26,816
Is the best place to start

1015
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:28,096
If you're a developer

00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:48,832
Hey everyone welcome to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham

1021
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:51,392
And today's guest is Bjorn block

1022
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:52,416
Who is

1023
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:53,696
The business leader

1024
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:55,488
Ikea Home Smart

1025
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:58,048
He is returning to the show so how

1026
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:03,168
Hi Stacy how are you I am great I am super excited to have you back and

1027
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,448
We're going to be talking

1028
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:08,544
Why it's so hard to sell connected devices at retail

1029
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:11,360
And get a little bit more information on these blinds

1030
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:13,152
When is super excited about

1031
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:15,456
Let's start with the Kinect

1032
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:17,504
Sublime's what was your vision there

1033
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:24,416
But I think it's coming back to what we always do at Ikea Wheatley always start with the dilemmas

1034
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:27,488
I'm trying to solve problem to make things better

1035
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,352
That was really the starting point for our connected lines as well as well

1036
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:34,656
Spotlighting

1037
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:37,728
Are equate severe on and how to make people feel

1038
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:40,032
Safe at home using using lighting

1039
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:43,360
The journey started

1040
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:45,920
Many years ago when Ikea actually on the

1041
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:47,200
Norma blinds

1042
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:53,088
Took away the street

1043
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:54,624
Help with children and so on

1044
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:57,696
Same day dental course you can have applications

1045
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:58,976
Are you completely blind

1046
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:00,512
If you don't have the strength to

1047
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:01,280
To put it down

1048
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:04,352
And that is a little bit of a problem at home

1049
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:08,192
And coming together with us working with HomeSmart what we

1050
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:09,728
The wireless

1051
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:12,032
We can actually control things

1052
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:14,080
Atwood

1053
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:17,152
Adding the two and say why don't we start controlling the blinds

1054
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:18,688
In a wireless

1055
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:23,296
I need to reach them you can just use voice or use the app

1056
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:26,880
Controlling

1057
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:29,440
Journey together without fencing

1058
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:31,488
Textile department at Ikea where

1059
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:34,560
What they seek the old insights and knowledge that you need to know about

1060
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:38,144
Rolling up and down the blinds will put it down the correct answer

1061
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:43,264
And so on so it's

1062
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:48,128
Publix we took it on as a Sears task and wanted to make sure that we don't something that is said

1063
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:50,688
12 class and then the u16 status

1064
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:51,456
Street tacos

1065
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:55,296
I feel like when I visited Ikea about a year ago

1066
00:40:55,808 --> 00:41:01,440
I saw an early iteration of them and it was kind of very exciting for me because it was a huge Prada

1067
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:05,536
The people have been demanding for a long time in the smart home space

1068
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:08,096
And I'm curious what did you learn

1069
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:09,632
Along the way

1070
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:11,936
Have superheroes relief

1071
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:15,520
Really fun having you in Alma Thomas Estates it was a privilege to

1072
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:19,104
Show Yorkie and that's kind of hard to like Kia Soul. You have to come

1073
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,152
And the connected lines

1074
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:22,688
Associative starting with that

1075
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:26,784
I shouldn't say simple tasks but at least a fairly commission will be want to touch it

1076
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:29,088
If you going to

1077
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:31,904
Dual Wireless blind there's no point having

1078
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:32,672
Apollo Court

1079
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:35,232
Because then you're

1080
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:38,304
Norman string to pull them up and down you get the power cord

1081
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:43,168
We learn from amanda initiativ stats

1082
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:44,448
Taking away

1083
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:47,520
Power chords it's a good way of making your home more beautiful

1084
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:50,080
So we need to put the task and then

1085
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:52,384
The challenge quite high in order to make them

1086
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:57,759
Completely wireless so will therefore we also put the bar saying that they needed to be battery operated

1087
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:58,783
We don't know

1088
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:01,343
Do you know how big

1089
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:02,111
Can you make

1090
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:04,671
The power pack and how long should it last

1091
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:09,023
How often do you need to recharge the battery because we don't want that disposable batteries

1092
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:13,887
So we put the ball really high to make

1093
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:19,775
Blind that works in many locations is super easy to install completely wireless

1094
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:22,591
I bought some the control limits on the power perspective

1095
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:28,223
Visa to recharge and so on so you continue to use it over and over and over again

1096
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:29,503
A bit of a challenge of course

1097
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:31,551
But right now

1098
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:35,135
What we have learned

1099
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:35,903
Again

1100
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:37,695
Good-looking and I can't stop.

1101
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:39,487
We're going to try to be stubborn about

1102
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:43,327
Not letting go of a functionality and also not letting go

1103
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:47,423
Leading with the lowest price sewing

1104
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:48,959
We design the price tag

1105
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:50,495
First reset the

1106
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:56,895
Tri-City want to reach and saying this is what we think it's an important that we should achieve with this product

1107
00:42:57,151 --> 00:43:03,295
Both the functionality on the Aesthetics

1108
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:04,831
Outsole

1109
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:07,391
Market leader of coursing in Commonwealth

1110
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:09,183
Affordable solution

1111
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:10,975
Just for the audience these blinds

1112
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:13,023
Are going to range from between

1113
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:17,631
113 u.s. dollars to $181 US dollars and that's

1114
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:18,911
Dependent on the wit

1115
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:20,447
Correct that's correct

1116
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:21,471
Excellent

1117
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:24,799
Alright in the widest they're going to go is 76

1118
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:27,103
Y'all so

1119
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,383
It's a pretty big window

1120
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:29,919
Dauin might guess

1121
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:33,503
Is the reason you can't go bigger is because it's hard

1122
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:35,551
For a battery-operated motor

1123
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:36,575
The pull that much battery

1124
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:38,367
Right

1125
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:40,159
Yeah I think it's also for us

1126
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:46,559
To to give ourselves a decent starting points in order to meet the masses in elections I'm pretty

1127
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:49,631
Expand the range symbols

1128
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:51,423
More expression Santander

1129
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:52,191
More weeds

1130
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:54,751
Variations as we move along

1131
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:56,031
Debbie sing like a

1132
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:57,055
A good ranged

1133
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:57,823
2 * 20

1134
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:00,895
Window sizes on the

1135
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:07,551
The greatest tactical shotguns from from day one so yeah you're cracking up a little

1136
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:10,623
I appreciate this in

1137
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:11,647
For reference

1138
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:13,695
If you guys want to just be like

1139
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:19,071
I have automated Shades in my house and they cover a 10-foot wide window so it's very big

1140
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:20,095
Much larger

1141
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:21,119
Netspot

1142
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:22,655
They cost 10000

1143
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:23,423
Dollars

1144
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:24,191
That is

1145
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:24,959
Insane

1146
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:29,567
And a lot of that was for the motor and because there wasn't a lot of competition in this

1147
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:30,847
Space so

1148
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:32,639
Yay Ikea

1149
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:38,527
In the US you're doing the blackout Shades those are the I'm going to make you say it so everyone knows the proper way to say it

1150
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:39,551
The future

1151
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:40,319
How do you say

1152
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:42,623
I was pretty good they call C2

1153
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:43,647
Future

1154
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:45,951
All right and then

1155
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:51,327
You have the semi-transparent ones in those are like to me it looks like

1156
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:53,119
Typical Ikea butcher

1157
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:54,399
Consonance

1158
00:44:55,679 --> 00:45:00,031
It's a Wee Willie Europa glow Shalom school because the semi-sheer

1159
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:01,311
Horsham Sunoco

1160
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:02,847
Back at 1 which is 10 cold

1161
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:05,663
Digital retailer

1162
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:07,455
Target lowering prices

1163
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:13,599
So we will see if you also open this up to USA

1164
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:15,135
However we expanding

1165
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:17,439
The range of connected lines in the US

1166
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:22,047
This is not a technical question but as a person who has to live with blinds at my house

1167
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:23,583
Do these come in different Fabrics

1168
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:29,983
It only coming into Fabrics to start off with so they come in the in the in the block out on the semi share about again

1169
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:31,007
We made

1170
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:34,591
The solution we made it support scalable so we can build on this Ranch

1171
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:40,991
Moving forward so I'm sure we could learn some in the first years outside so we can we can expand ourselves more expressions

1172
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:43,295
Sound and color variations on and so on and so on

1173
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:46,623
Okay so right now if you want smart blinds that are affordable

1174
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:47,391
Your choice

1175
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:48,159
Is Darkrai

1176
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:53,535
Alright it's kind of like Henry Ford and his Model T

1177
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:54,303
T4 little

1178
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:55,327
All right

1179
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:58,143
These are coming out in April

1180
00:45:58,399 --> 00:46:00,959
But you have had the tradfri lights

1181
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:01,983
Out for

1182
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:05,311
80 months to years a really long time it feels like

1183
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:06,847
Internet of Things face

1184
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:07,871
And I

1185
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:14,271
Curious to hear what you've learned after having those on the market I know the last time we talked I was in a bit of a snit

1186
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:15,551
Because my

1187
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:18,111
Tradfri lights were not working well with my

1188
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:19,391
Home assistance

1189
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:20,415
I put them back

1190
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:21,439
And there better now

1191
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:22,207
Also that's

1192
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:23,999
But what if you learned

1193
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:29,375
Yeah you mentioned Appliance will be on Salem in April they will actually be on sale in Europe

1194
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:33,215
Before summer time and day will it be on sale in US

1195
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:34,239
In August

1196
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:36,543
Disappointing August is a pig

1197
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:37,823
But what if you learned

1198
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:42,431
I think we're learning lost in the space and I think it's one thing that we have really

1199
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:43,455
Taking all me now

1200
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:47,039
In a serious manner East importance of having a system that is

1201
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:50,111
Stable anambra boss does not fail on you when it comes to

1202
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:51,391
Nativity Mendoza

1203
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:55,999
It made some efforts in order to improve the

1204
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:59,327
The trophy Aspen and experience without the making sure that it

1205
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:02,911
Safeway

1206
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:05,727
Work to ensure that we stay in compliance

1207
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:06,751
I mean working with

1208
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:09,055
Amazon Apple and Google

1209
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:10,335
We need to make sure that

1210
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:15,711
Doc user experience is also to the best possible that you take two

1211
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:18,527
Constantly make sure that this is what needs to be but

1212
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:20,575
Of course the beauty of working with

1213
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:21,855
Food product that is

1214
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:28,511
Is a life that you have to take care of any proven and bites lice all the time so I think we are super excited

1215
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:31,071
We are also taking it in a very serious way

1216
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:32,607
Okay in French

1217
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:34,655
Kiss from a business perspective

1218
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:36,959
How does the tribe free product line

1219
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:42,335
In terms of employees and people working on the project has it stayed relatively consistent to

1220
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:45,151
Because as you mentioned it's alive so I'm

1221
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:47,967
Very curious how that's changed how you

1222
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:48,991
Port and

1223
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:51,039
Maintain that purses

1224
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:52,063
I don't know

1225
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:52,831
The mom

1226
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:53,855
Dressers or

1227
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:57,439
That's a good question of course our heritage is our

1228
00:47:57,695 --> 00:47:59,231
Conventional Furniture pieces

1229
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:01,791
Furniture Airport

1230
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:04,863
Coworkers in the stores and Ambien customers

1231
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:06,655
Fortis want to relate to our

1232
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:08,447
It's good products so far

1233
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:09,983
So there you have it

1234
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:12,287
A pretty steep learning curve and also how we are

1235
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:14,335
Putting resources behind our

1236
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:15,615
All connected products

1237
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:17,407
So I think what you will see

1238
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:23,295
Looking at this as we are investing by traveling to this face and we of course want to put more

1239
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:29,183
More efforts on and make our safe solution better in the stores we want to educate that we staff

1240
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:35,327
Want to get a customer support

1241
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:40,703
Learning a lot right now and it is a space that just been identified as being really important for Ikea moving forward

1242
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:43,007
So a my last trip

1243
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:45,823
Through the IKEA store which was only

1244
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:46,847
Only a week ago

1245
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:49,919
I noticed that I had a hard time finding

1246
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:50,943
The tradfri light

1247
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:52,735
And I wondered if

1248
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:54,527
There was a reason behind

1249
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:56,319
That and I asked because

1250
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:58,879
I saw a Bluetooth speakers prominently to

1251
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:02,207
Displayed also in the last few months we also saw

1252
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:03,231
Lowe's

1253
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:05,023
Take out their Iris

1254
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:06,303
Smart home platform

1255
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:08,607
And prior to that we've seen

1256
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:10,655
Tons of retailers

1257
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:12,191
Try and then just

1258
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:12,959
Hoback

1259
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:15,775
On smarthome in iot things so I feel like

1260
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:19,871
Maybe we don't know how to sell this well yet or what's happened

1261
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:26,271
It's not that we are trying to hide a name and it's all three lights are on is not lighting the stores.

1262
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:28,063
In the car but we are building up

1263
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:32,415
The rain should wear building off the retail solution it takes a little bit of time in the

1264
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:34,975
Ikea Machinery to get everything sorted

1265
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:39,327
After summer I'm sure you will see some really good Improvement in a

1266
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:42,399
Store nearby you because we are launching you

1267
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:45,471
Eureka concert pole for the smart home arena

1268
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:46,751
After summertime

1269
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:49,055
Started with a big sound

1270
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:53,151
Together with the complete smart home solar

1271
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:57,247
I'm really excited about this and I'm pretty confident that we would have them

1272
00:49:57,759 --> 00:49:59,551
Ace that can be encouraged to

1273
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:00,831
Amtrak

1274
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:03,135
Play with the products and also learn a lot to buy

1275
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:05,183
Enjoy your sin in the starting lineup

1276
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:07,487
Okay it sounds like

1277
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:09,791
You don't want to tell me too much more about

1278
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:12,863
But can you give us any hints about

1279
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:14,911
What's some of the issues that

1280
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:16,959
You guys had seen and are trying to solve

1281
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:20,031
I think they are being reminded every now and then

1282
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:24,639
Getting the day fixing place in a sentence on the way saying when I went to speakers

1283
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:26,431
Bluetooth speaker for accomplish

1284
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:27,455
Is turned on

1285
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:28,735
We sent twice as many

1286
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:29,503
Amedisys

1287
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:33,599
Simple us. That people want to interact and see and touch and feel

1288
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:35,391
The greatest compliment that we have

1289
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:38,975
I could webpage son and a good eCommerce solution.

1290
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:40,767
The touching feeling playing around in the

1291
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:42,559
Neglected

1292
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:44,863
It's really important to have that

1293
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:48,959
And I think that's what we are male excited about that we can desecrate the space

1294
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:53,311
So are you able to play with the blinds table

1295
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:55,359
Symphonic speakers and pinyin

1296
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:56,127
See what

1297
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:58,431
Capable of playing what type of music

1298
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:03,807
Okay and we've talked about them now

1299
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:09,439
For a while. You guys have a partnership coming up with Sonos where you're going to be releasing

1300
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:10,207
Much

1301
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:11,487
Anticipated speaker

1302
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:13,535
And that's going to also happen in August

1303
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:15,583
Account disabled start is in August

1304
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:18,655
They will be safe

1305
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:23,007
North America same time but we are having a big

1306
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:25,823
Launch event in April in the Bronx

1307
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:28,895
This year so

1308
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:34,015
That's what we really going to reveal in first to the public which is going to be very fond of course

1309
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:36,319
Can you tell me anything more about the speaker

1310
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:38,111
Should I cook my dinner

1311
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:39,903
I wish they could bust

1312
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:43,231
Innocence of collaboration with

1313
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:47,839
So much fun and the such a good journey from from day one.

1314
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:49,887
We literally reached out to

1315
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:53,727
To take the next step in

1316
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:56,031
In creating atmosphere we had that

1317
00:51:56,543 --> 00:52:02,687
Quite a few insights about what it is to create atmosphere at home

1318
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:04,223
People we talked to Rich

1319
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:08,831
Should do quite a lot of the year with you quite a few people

1320
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:10,623
59% of those two

1321
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:13,439
Music is the number one factor

1322
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:14,719
Creating atmosphere

1323
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:18,815
So having smart Lighting in place or at this grasping up on we thought it was

1324
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:22,655
I needed that we also took on the task of the

1325
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:23,423
Having

1326
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:24,703
Music and Sound

1327
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:26,751
In order to do that then

1328
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:28,031
We reached out to Sonos

1329
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:31,103
And the same thing was said when we did reach out to them

1330
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:32,127
The other day

1331
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:36,991
Maybe they would like to reach out to Ikea that work with us

1332
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:39,295
Okay let's see so far you guys have

1333
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:41,855
Connected lights so you have connected blinds

1334
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:42,879
We're going to see

1335
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:45,695
The partnership with the Sonos / speakers

1336
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:48,767
And that's all about creating this this atmosphere

1337
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:52,095
We've also seen I introduce wireless charging

1338
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:53,631
You guys have embraced

1339
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:56,703
Connectivity and Technology where it seems to make sense in the home

1340
00:52:57,471 --> 00:52:59,519
Where do you think you'll go neck

1341
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:01,567
We know where we going next

1342
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:05,663
But I think it's more to say I think that the luxury we have on

1343
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:07,455
Being home smart

1344
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:08,479
Reading Ikea

1345
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:09,503
History of Acts

1346
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:10,783
To every rule

1347
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:14,367
And I think this is really a luxury in this space.

1348
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:18,975
Dictated to a certain space or a certain activity we can actually

1349
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:24,607
Nothing to whatever activity or scenario or identify a big nose

1350
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:27,167
Most important elements in Life

1351
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:29,983
Right now it's very lucky

1352
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:36,383
Keep hiding in fear being working with lighting and shadows of darkness and

1353
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:39,967
Sliding in

1354
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:42,271
Sound of Music 2

1355
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:43,807
Of course Ruston

1356
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:50,207
Next step is a course to start combining the two but you know when you really can get the the scenes going with

1357
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:55,583
Appliance of the music and the lighting and everything in in harmony

1358
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:56,351
Thing that we are

1359
00:53:57,887 --> 00:54:01,215
What comes after summer time and work with Dustin and also release set of course

1360
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:05,055
To the greater area stuff we will enter after that then turns off

1361
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:08,639
Today we have to

1362
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:13,503
To keep your eyes and ears open for that moving help but we are definitely serious about the categories

1363
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:14,783
Orbitz Amsterdam

1364
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:21,439
Okay I didn't make my guess which is actually you're going to go into Wellness

1365
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:24,255
One because I feel like we talked about into

1366
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:28,607
Prepping for this interview I read about your air-purifying curtain concept

1367
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:30,399
That just blew me away

1368
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:33,983
And I think that actually indoor air quality

1369
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:36,799
And health and wellness we're seeing a bunch of come

1370
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:37,567
Companies

1371
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:38,591
Head that direction

1372
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:40,383
That's just me you don't have to answer

1373
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:42,175
Guys if I'm kidnapped this is

1374
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:44,991
