00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,728
Hey everybody welcome back

2
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:12,288
This is the Internet of Things podcast did I am your host

3
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:13,312
Stacey Higginbotham

4
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:14,592
And here is your

5
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:15,872
Excellent co-host

6
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:17,152
Kevin tofel

7
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:18,176
And this week

8
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:21,248
We are getting a started with some big news for

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,784
Google IO

10
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,856
Which is Google's big developers Conference held in California

11
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:27,136
Kevin

12
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:28,416
What do we have

13
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:29,696
Google sleeve this week

14
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,864
A whole lot of stuff Google typically unveils its latest and greatest version of Android which I'm sure it will do

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,424
I don't think I'll actually launch it that usually

16
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,216
Show it off and then watch in the fall

17
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:44,544
More important to the show though is Tok

18
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,080
Google

19
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:48,128
Connecting all the things with

20
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:48,896
Brillo

21
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:53,248
This is an android-based platform for the internet of things so

22
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,112
I would anticipate this to be a keynote announcement the keynote is on Thursday this week

23
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:04,768
Curious to see what they're doing seems to be a light version of Android my guess is like the communications and

24
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:06,048
Notification stack

25
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:09,120
And it would run on really light Hardware

26
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:10,144
So

27
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,168
We'll have to see

28
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:12,192
The funny thing is

29
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:13,984
Do you remember Stacy that

30
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,568
Google did something similar back in 2011 call Android at home

31
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:18,848
I do and

32
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:20,640
It looks like of the people

33
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:21,664
Who are still at

34
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,760
Google who used to work on Android at home I think some of those guys are still working on this

35
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:28,064
That could be because Andrea at home

36
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:31,648
In my opinion is generally a flop nothing really came of that and I

37
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:35,744
That was more of the timing you know I don't think IRT was

38
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:41,632
Getting to be close to mainstream then we talked about on the last show is only just now really starting to go mainstream and

39
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:42,912
I just think was ahead of its

40
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:46,496
Time even I mean even devices like Fitbit weren't even

41
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:47,520
Coming out

42
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:51,616
Until like 2012 I think is when we first started

43
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:53,664
I first started writing about

44
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,456
Connected devices in

45
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:57,760
CES 2012 I want to say

46
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:00,064
I was probably pretty early

47
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:02,112
I mean there were still connected devices

48
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:03,136
But people weren't like

49
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:05,184
Let's connect all the things

50
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:10,048
I believe in October of 2013 or maybe

51
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:12,096
Yeah I think it was like that's about right

52
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,120
20

53
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:21,056
Indeed it for years makes a big difference I mean just in terms of mainstream awareness of connected things

54
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:24,640
The fact that we've got much better Hardware that's low power and looks

55
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:27,200
Kind of getting some consolidation and

56
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:30,016
New agreement and what radios and protocols to use it

57
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:32,064
So I guess I think it was ahead of its time but

58
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,856
It doesn't matter now mean that that's

59
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,392
The Meandering home as a daughter

60
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,160
It's now

61
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,208
Going to be a presumably Brillo

62
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:39,744
You know

63
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,096
Scratch yes this is going to battle Apple's homekit platform in Samsung tizen

64
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,120
Well

65
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,912
So there's some things to know about

66
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:48,704
1 is

67
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:49,728
Michaels

68
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:52,032
Who is a smart home analyst

69
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,848
Has talked to people in the know it

70
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:57,664
Google and he says that the guy in charge of all this

71
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,456
Is Venom Craig Barrett

72
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:02,272
Who is Intel's Craig Barrett but

73
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,552
Craig Barrett who is

74
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:06,624
It's the former CEO of atheros which was a Wi-Fi chip

75
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,416
Qualcomm

76
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:09,952
And so

77
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,744
He's been at Google since 2013

78
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,024
And

79
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,816
Apparently Google has been talking to

80
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:16,608
Router makers to try to

81
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,376
Get

82
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,400
Grillo

83
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:19,680
Installed into kind of

84
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:21,984
Routers and what they're looking for is

85
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,776
What's called a real time operating

86
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:24,544
System

87
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:27,104
And it looks like this wouldn't be like a super

88
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:28,896
Blowing

89
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,688
Artist butt

90
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:31,456
Something

91
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,480
That would run

92
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:33,760
On a router

93
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,040
Andon device

94
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:36,320
Surround the home so they

95
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,856
That you wouldn't need a Smart Hub

96
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:38,624
Basically

97
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:40,416
We talked about the

98
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:42,720
Listen to past but the idea of getting rid of the

99
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:43,744
Hub is just

100
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:44,768
Crate

101
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,560
I would love not to have an extra

102
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,328
Device plugged in

103
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,096
Is my router

104
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:50,400
Or devices if you need multiple hubs

105
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:51,168
Exactly

106
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,960
The other important thing

107
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:55,008
Cure that we should note is

108
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,568
Google is getting behind

109
00:03:59,360 --> 00:03:59,872
Craig

110
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:02,176
Possible that Google is getting behind Wi-Fi

111
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:03,968
And

112
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:05,504
Read Because nest

113
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,784
Which is owned by Coke

114
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,320
Is a big proponent

115
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,088
Of

116
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:10,880
Red

117
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:13,696
Which is a wireless protocol based on

118
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,232
B

119
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,024
802.

120
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,047
14

121
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:19,839
Turn it off

122
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:23,423
Which we're getting all radio wonky but basically it's the same

123
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:26,239
Radio that also power is zigbee

124
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:28,799
Sydney's just a different type of software that's running on top of

125
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:30,847
So

126
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:38,015
What we can take from this is like things like Z-Wave and zigbee are kind of getting left out of the newer generation of

127
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:41,343
Kind of connected Home Products because if you look at it

128
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:43,391
Google stream with Brillo

129
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:44,927
Ask Abby wifi-based

130
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:45,695
Probably

131
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:47,487
Probably Wi-Fi baby Bluetooth

132
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,023
Or Wi-Fi and thread

133
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:54,143
And then you got Apple which is doing homekit around Wi-Fi and probably

134
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:54,911
Bluetooth

135
00:04:55,679 --> 00:05:00,799
So nosy be nosy wave I'm not going to say I told you so

136
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:03,359
Wait a second.

137
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:04,895
Okay well

138
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:05,663
Yeah okay

139
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:10,271
I don't I don't think these are going to go away

140
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:12,063
I agree

141
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,343
Yes there

142
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,671
Is somebody I think was Alex Hawkinson the president

143
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:20,255
SmartThings the CEO of SmartThings this was bought by Samsung

144
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:21,791
He called those he's

145
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,327
Psych gathers Our Kind of legacy

146
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:24,607
Protocols

147
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,911
They're at their old school dinosaur

148
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:31,775
The problem is now that we're getting too mainstream awareness of this Market

149
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,055
Those are not

150
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:36,895
Mainstream known protocols and radios Wi-Fi that's ubiquitous

151
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,943
Best Bluetooth most people even get that

152
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,991
I think that had a lot to do with this

153
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:44,319
I agree now threads going to be a tough sell

154
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,111
Totally new

155
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:48,159
And to make matters worse

156
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,951
Or maybe it'll make it better

157
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:53,023
Zigbee and thread have done this kind of co-marketing agreement

158
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,559
Barcode software

159
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:55,839
Agreement where they're going to

160
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,631
You're going to be able to develop

161
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:01,215
Red stuff will work on certain zigbee flat

162
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:06,847
That'll be kind of interesting going forward so maybe it's only a Z-Wave that gets left on

163
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,127
Kohl's

164
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:10,175
Yeah it's it's hard to say that

165
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:13,759
Give me know we're seeing consolidation here and then the approaches

166
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:18,111
I think it's also worth noting in in Michaels piece that according to what he's found out

167
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:21,951
Brillo is not part of 20 Fidel's Group which is the nest group

168
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:22,719
Over at

169
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,487
Google

170
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:25,279
And that's actually something that I

171
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,559
Had talked to my sources about

172
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:30,399
In in discovering what Google is doing

173
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:31,423
Along with

174
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,727
Mike I have actually heard the same thing

175
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:36,287
But not part of nest

176
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,847
That's a little surprising to me

177
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:41,151
I don't think so because

178
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:47,551
Google has made it very clear rather than S guys have made it very clear that they're not part of Google and I think that's probably a

179
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,575
Wise move because

180
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:51,903
Google is known for vacuuming up tons of data

181
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,439
And

182
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,487
Nest guys

183
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,791
Have the potential to vacuum a lot of data

184
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,583
And it's from your home and so

185
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:03,167
I can see the the need to keep those two kind of entity separate

186
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,215
I will also say though

187
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,239
That

188
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:09,311
Google fi pushing Wi-Fi and pushing the

189
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,591
Kind of

190
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,895
Operating system on devices

191
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:16,223
Especially if it's an IPv6 or like

192
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,527
Thread based in wifi-based

193
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:20,063
That's straight to the cloud

194
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:23,903
It doesn't have to go through any other device

195
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,695
That's a very Google Centric

196
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:29,023
Approach because it will send data from the device straight to the cloud

197
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,327
And they're huge fans of that

198
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,119
That because that gives them the ability to get

199
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:33,887
Get as much data

200
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:37,471
And that is their standard operating procedure I mean that's

201
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:41,311
Their whole Revenue stream is pretty much built upon that taking that data

202
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:43,103
And then delivering contextual ads

203
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:46,687
I don't think we're going to see ads on her door lock

204
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:48,991
But I do know no but

205
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:52,063
But it's all tied to your Google account.

206
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,671
The tie that binds everything together so my while you won't see ads on your door locked

207
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:59,743
If another could be information gathered by the door lock that

208
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:03,583
Put an ad relevant ad on your phone the next time you do a Google search

209
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:04,607
I think

210
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:07,167
More likely what we're going to see is

211
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:10,495
Google selling more context about you

212
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:13,823
Or Google providing services that you'll eventually

213
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:14,591
Pay for

214
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,383
Based on the data they have

215
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,151
About you

216
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:20,735
I don't think that it's going to be as simple as

217
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:21,759
Ads based on

218
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:24,831
Oru home during these hours of the day here some demographic

219
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:25,599
High-profile

220
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:27,135
Yeah that's a fair point

221
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,927
I think it'll be a little bit more in

222
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,207
God I hope

223
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:35,583
Otherwise you know cuz this gets into things like

224
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,607
You know how you can't

225
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,399
There's there's laws in Play Store

226
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,679
Protect children on the internet

227
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,215
Right

228
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:41,983
Advertising

229
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,519
So if your 13

230
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,567
You can't collect certain data about children

231
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,615
When the home there's a

232
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:50,687
There's no guarantees that you know you're not collecting data

233
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,711
About a child

234
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:52,991
Who's coming into the house

235
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:53,759
Right

236
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,319
You can't use that data for Mark

237
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:03,999
You mean you really don't want to walk up to your front door forget your keypad number and all that and instead just watch a 30 second video app

238
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,279
Add to get in your house tonight

239
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:10,143
You know yesterday it was yesterday that they were tornadoes so I guess they know

240
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:10,911
Okay now

241
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,191
No

242
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,727
Please Google no

243
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,519
New doorbell app

244
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,823
The Wizard of Oz it's on

245
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,103
Tonight at 8

246
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:22,431
Google well that's contextual it is context

247
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,735
All right

248
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:32,927
Let's go to the next piece of news that I thought was actually really good for the Internet of Things

249
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:38,047
And that is alarm.com on Friday filed to go public

250
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:41,375
I filed a raised 75 million through an initial public offering

251
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:42,655
Which

252
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:46,751
Significant for the smart home space because alarm.com

253
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:48,799
Says that it is the largest

254
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:49,567
Company

255
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,591
In this space

256
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:53,151
I don't know if I believe that

257
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:53,919
But

258
00:09:56,991 --> 00:10:00,575
I mean I don't know either but you know I'm looking at the peace that you wrote and

259
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:04,159
They're saying or telling you that they've got 2.3 million subscribers

260
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,439
You're telling me a sec.

261
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,023
I think they can lie to me but

262
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:10,815
TCU getting

263
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,143
So alarm.com for those of you guys who don't know

264
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,935
Started out in 2000's

265
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,471
Security

266
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:21,567
And they could Abridged into the selling home automation just like all the other

267
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:24,127
But many of the other companies

268
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:27,455
And what I found most interesting in there

269
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,247
Their s-1 filing

270
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,295
Was a that they're profitable

271
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:33,343
They're actually doing

272
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:37,183
Pretty well for themselves they've grown significantly they reported 167

273
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,975
1.3 million in Revenue last year

274
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:43,071
The net income of 563000

275
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,095
And they're growing

276
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,119
And

277
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,399
The other thing is

278
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:49,215
Not sure how long that growth is going to last

279
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:52,031
They have this amazing churn rate

280
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:52,799
Which is

281
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,079
The amount of

282
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,103
Customers that

283
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,127
Renew

284
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,407
Service

285
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:02,527
Edit set the 93 to 94% of their customers renew each year

286
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,855
Their customer service provider

287
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,671
Oh not end-users

288
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:13,023
State the 2.3 million subscribers that they say they have are the end users

289
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,095
And those end users are locked into

290
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:17,631
The three to five-year contracts

291
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:18,911
Service provider

292
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:25,567
And that makes sense because typically they will subsidize the equipment for the house and installation with the long-term country

293
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,359
So yes

294
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:30,175
But what actually happens at alarm.com cases

295
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,455
Buy the equipment

296
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:38,111
They sell to the service provider the monitoring software

297
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,391
On an annual basis

298
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:43,231
So what I would be looking for is

299
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:46,303
Maybe next year and the year after that is for that

300
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:48,095
Keep an eye on their turn figures

301
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,375
Because I suspect

302
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,679
SOS three to five-year contracts

303
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:54,751
Come up the end customers are going to probably look

304
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:55,519
Like

305
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:59,359
Maybe alternative Solutions out there maybe DIY do-it-yourself do-it-yourself

306
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,127
Yeah

307
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,199
Even like ADT just

308
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,479
Launch they haven't

309
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:05,503
Stay there now

310
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,063
They haven't actually launched a new all-in-one

311
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,599
Kind of security box

312
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:10,879
Camera

313
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:11,903
Sensor

314
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,695
Package thing but

315
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,231
I think that's kind of a

316
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,255
Wave of the future

317
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:18,815
We'll see

318
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:23,679
Yeah I think you're spot on Watch the watch to see who renews after those three

319
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:25,471
Three to five-year contracts are up

320
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:29,055
Because they're just going to so many more choices everything will be cheaper

321
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:34,687
And you probably be confident enough and the device will be simple enough that you can do it yourself

322
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:38,783
Sure especially depending on what Google and apple lunch this summer

323
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,575
Yes

324
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,343
Okay

325
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:43,391
And let's see we've got some cool

326
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:47,231
How to say we got some cool back to school things for you

327
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,535
Kevin you saw a fun project

328
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,071
Kickstarter did you want to talk.

329
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:55,423
Now I think this is perfect for a back-to-school little gift for your ear

330
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:57,215
Curious child

331
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:02,335
I mean kickstarter's got tons of stuff that mean you could sit there all day and look at their projects with this particular one

332
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,615
Caught my eye

333
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:05,919
It's the microduino mcookie

334
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:08,735
They are small electronic modules that are

335
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,527
Compatible with the Legos of all things

336
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,831
So think of Arduino

337
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:16,415
But being in a smaller package and Metcalf

338
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,207
Be connected to Legos you can like

339
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:22,047
Make stacks of different devices you can link build your a little devices with Legos

340
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,327
And get them smarts

341
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,607
With the microduino

342
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:27,167
Income just double check with the

343
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:29,983
Delivery time is July so that's why I said back to

344
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:30,751
School

345
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:37,151
The initial early birds are all gone but here's what you would have gotten them you can still get it you're going to cost a little more

346
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:43,039
For $68 you got the mcookie 101 basic kit which was 4 modules and six sensors

347
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,831
Along with a bunch of instructions in the

348
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:49,183
LED microphone that lights up a Bluetooth Bluetooth controlled LED

349
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:54,559
Turn the little projects you can make with us I just love the idea for this for

350
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:56,607
You know again inquisitive kids

351
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:59,167
And it's it's actually so if you didn't catch

352
00:13:59,423 --> 00:13:59,935
What's the

353
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,983
The $68 it's only 70

354
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:04,031
That's reasonable

355
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,335
I mean

356
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,103
I paid

357
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:12,991
I think 35 for my Arduino and I can't play with Legos and my dunno at the same time so right there that's a bonus

358
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,039
There you go in the fatter kits

359
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:17,855
There's there's one for $150

360
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:18,879
It's at 1:40

361
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:23,487
But that's the advanced kit and that gives you 8 modules 13 sensors

362
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:25,279
And a whole bunch of other accessories

363
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:28,095
And you can make things like a music box

364
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:28,863
Situation

365
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,399
Electronic puppy

366
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:31,935
That would be so cool

367
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:34,751
Yeah they have to go outside no that's good

368
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,079
Exactly

369
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:42,175
And you know the who the $258 kit

370
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,455
Get you a weather station

371
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:45,503
You can make a weather station or time lapse

372
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,271
Photography

373
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:49,343
Okay for that cause I'm thinking that's a Christmas gift

374
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:52,927
Well okay or you know it's science

375
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:53,951
I know I know

376
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:56,767
So that the closest analogue to this I would say

377
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:58,559
Choke there

378
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,839
Is little bit

379
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:03,679
It is very much reminded me of little bits but I don't think my little bits are compatible

380
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:04,703
I was like I was in

381
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:09,311
So if you're if you're missing your little bits and you really want to stick them with Legos

382
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,079
This is

383
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,359
A great kind of fun

384
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:18,015
Little cookies little stackable Lego cookies for everything there's an NFC thing or zigbee

385
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,807
You can have Wi-Fi you can add

386
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,879
GSM cellular capabilities

387
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:25,439
For crying out loud there's tons of different modules here

388
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:31,839
Oh yeah and you don't we actually of use the little bits in the cloud bit sensor to make like iot devices for a house and we tie

389
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,631
Tie them together through is this and that

390
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:34,655
Weather like

391
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:35,679
Will make like a

392
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,727
Pressure sensor or something else

393
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:41,311
This sort of thing is a really fun way if you have a

394
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:43,103
Kid or maybe you're just

395
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:43,871
Not

396
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:45,407
Totally comfortable

397
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:52,319
Building on your own like with sensors you can get something like this and you can make your own light connected doorbell or you

398
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,087
You can make your own

399
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:55,135
Motion sensor in

400
00:15:55,647 --> 00:16:01,023
You can kind of start to have fun building exactly what you need for the scenario you're envisioning for

401
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:01,791
Are your Smart House

402
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:07,423
That's the key you got all the different building blocks with the sensors modules and everything else you need

403
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,191
Annies

404
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:10,751
Chet's obviously you pay more to get more modules and such

405
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:16,383
I look at the two or $300 LEGO Mindstorms robotics kit that I bought a couple years back

406
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,919
It's really cool as well

407
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:18,943
And it's Legos

408
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:19,711
But

409
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:22,783
The very few sensors that it really comes with

410
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:26,111
Universe has a wide range for Whiting Ranch

411
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,903
Yeah I mean

412
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,183
260

413
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,719
Dollar tip has like

414
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:31,999
21 sensors

415
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:34,047
I'm looking at these sound like

416
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:36,351
We can really have some fun with this

417
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,399
Absolutely

418
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,471
So I am

419
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:44,287
I'm game I I find these things a lot of fun

420
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:47,103
I will say with my daughter who is

421
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,383
She's 8 years old

422
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:54,015
Doing this sort of thing in the house is a lot of fun for her because she can see

423
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:57,087
Right in front of her when we build it and we hook it up

424
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:01,695
She sees the action right away and she's affecting something in her real life

425
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:03,743
Which makes her really

426
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:08,095
Like the sort of like it really gets here until like programming and building the stuff

427
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,119
In a way that

428
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:11,935
You don't maybe a more abstract thing doesn't

429
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:16,799
Yes sitting in front of a terminal and coding something again and again and again till you get it just right and they work

430
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:18,335
What's is one thing but here

431
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:22,687
It's a Mann's on one side Plug and Play because it's not quite that easy but it's pretty darn close

432
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:25,503
Yeah and she doesn't she doesn't equate it with like

433
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:28,831
It's play cuz we shan't

434
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:32,415
The other thing is if you're doing something like a haunted house or

435
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,207
You know any sort of project

436
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:34,975
Like that

437
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,511
We we do like little

438
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,047
Plays and sketches

439
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,839
This is also great for building

440
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:40,863
Props and that's hard

441
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:44,191
Throwing that out there for all the parents

442
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:48,543
Or just creative people in the room who really want to build an awesome haunted house next year

443
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:50,335
And because Legos

444
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,103
And because

445
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:53,407
Also like

446
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,455
And other news for this week

447
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,991
Let's just go into

448
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:58,015
Shall we do it

449
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,551
It's time for the

450
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:01,855
5-minute review

451
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:04,415
Ice Kevin

452
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,439
All right

453
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,975
Kevin's going to do the review this year

454
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:12,095
Okay this is my one review for the year that's it you heard it here

455
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:14,911
Yo no so what it what is it is it Cortana

456
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:17,215
It is Cortana because

457
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:18,751
This week

458
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,287
This week actually

459
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:22,079
Today is Tuesday

460
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,359
Microsoft

461
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:28,223
Announce Cortana it was going to be available on both IOS and Android in

462
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:31,807
I thought this was huge because I've actually never used Cortana

463
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,599
And I love you

464
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:36,159
And I was like Kevin you got to tell us what it's like

465
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,439
Because she downloaded

466
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,207
I don't know

467
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:40,767
Well I would say yes you should

468
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:46,399
Here's the thing you said you you never use Cortana I'm betting most people haven't use Cortana because

469
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:52,031
Unfortunately for Microsoft Windows Phone share is literally around 3.7% worldwide right now so

470
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:55,359
A very small percentage of the population of use Cortana

471
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:59,455
I have used it I do have a couple Windows phones here that I play with from time to time

472
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:04,319
Here's the best summary I can give of Cortana and we put it in terms the people may be familiar with

473
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:07,135
It's very similar to Apple Siri

474
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:11,487
It's also similar to The Voice Control actions of Google Now for Android

475
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:16,351
The thing is it kind of takes the Best of Both Worlds I find it far better than Siri

476
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:18,911
Because Cortana has a lot of contextual

477
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,191
Things that I can do

478
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,215
But you could

479
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:21,983
Say

480
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:26,591
Cortana remind me to wish my mother-in-law happy birthday the next time she calls

481
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,127
Now that's like

482
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:30,431
You can have location-based service type

483
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:32,735
Reminders on Siri but you can't do

484
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,271
What I just said I'm serious person

485
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:35,807
The flipside is

486
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:38,879
Do I Google now it does have contextual smart Square

487
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:43,743
Cortana will be able to surface information that's important to you at the right place and the right time

488
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:46,047
Even if I just gave it up a surprisingly perfect

489
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:51,679
So it's kind of a blend of Both Worlds I like it very much I think it's worth downloading

490
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:58,079
Installing on your iPhone or Android device when you can the thing is I don't believe and I could be wrong but I don't

491
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:00,895
Hopefully you can actually just go to an App Store and download it

492
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:04,223
It seems to be that Microsoft is putting out

493
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:07,039
An app called the phone companion app for Windows

494
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:07,807
10

495
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:13,183
And if you hook your Android phone or your iOS device to your Windows machine with this app

496
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,463
You can then use that app

497
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:15,999
To push Cortana

498
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:17,279
To your

499
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,815
Android or iPhone

500
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:22,911
I like it I find Cortana to be very useful bar more useful than Siri

501
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,191
I will leave it at that

502
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:27,775
Awesome but also a little disappointing

503
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:29,567
Because I don't have a Windows

504
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,335
Anyting

505
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,103
In my life

506
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:36,735
Well that's going to make it tough at least for now I mean bear in mind this is all part of the whole big Windows 10 push

507
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:38,527
So Cortana is actually going to be

508
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:39,807
Part of Windows 10

509
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:42,367
Sui voice activation there and such

510
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:47,743
It's early days for Windows 10 is not officially launched it's all inside her bills and so on so it may be

511
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:50,047
That Microsoft I would expect him to change this

512
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:53,631
I think they're just trying to get Cortana out there for people who are interested want to test it

513
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:55,423
On Android and iOS

514
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,495
When push comes to shove them Windows 10 largest later this year

515
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:01,311
They have to put it out there and in the app stores

516
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:04,127
Alright well I'm going to hope because

517
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:05,151
You know there

518
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:06,943
I love voice

519
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:07,711
Send

520
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:11,039
I I find the right now my favorite is still

521
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,063
Alexa

522
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:14,367
Who's on the Amazon Echo

523
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:17,952
Contextually she is she's not all that

524
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:19,232
And Google

525
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:20,256
Yet

526
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:21,792
And Google's is

527
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:22,816
Decent

528
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,632
A lot of we'll just say personality

529
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,216
Yep Siri has far more personality than

530
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:31,264
Google now and that's why I again I say

531
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:34,848
Cortana is probably the best of both worlds cuz Cortana has a pretty good personality

532
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,896
It's actually fun to use

533
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,688
Yeah yeah Google

534
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,736
Know their utilitarian

535
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,832
We will table

536
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:48,928
You know someone who is very utilitarian and pragmatic I can get behind that

537
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:52,256
So I'd rather my robot Overlord be pragmatic

538
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:53,792
Pretend to like

539
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:55,840
It's less confusing that way

540
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,632
All right

541
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:59,168
Well let's see I think that

542
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,448
I think that's it for this

543
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,216
Sweet show

544
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:03,008
Stay tuned for John Mann

545
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,288
He has a

546
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,568
Principal at

547
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,336
The artifact

548
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,104
Group

549
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,152
And it is a design consultancy

550
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:14,272
We're actually going to talk to you about brillo and homekit and kind of Designing for the Smart Home

551
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:16,064
User experience roster

552
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:16,832
Talking about

553
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:24,000
What we can expect from hotels in airplanes as users and how that can kind of help us adopt new technologies

554
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:30,400
Send to the smartphone and it should be a really good show

555
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:34,240
Hey everybody

556
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:35,264
Welcome back

557
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,080
2B Internet of Things podcast and we have is Our Guest

558
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:40,896
Today John man who is the design director at artifact

559
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:42,688
Hello John thanks for joining us

560
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:43,968
ICC

561
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:44,736
Thanks for having me

562
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:46,528
I am really excited to have you

563
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:50,624
You today because we have a lot of really cool things to talk about that I think

564
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:51,648
You're probably

565
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,440
Really going to be good at talking

566
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:55,744
We'll start with

567
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:58,304
A lot of news has come out

568
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,328
About

569
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:04,960
These are actually weeks they're not actual news yet I should clarify but it looks like the summer is going to be a big one for

570
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:08,032
The smart home in kind of how we're going to control it with

571
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,824
Apple's homekit

572
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:16,224
We're not a hundred percent sure how much we're going to see but there is going to be something at the worldwide developer conference

573
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,760
June 1st

574
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:21,344
Our second week in June apples going to announce something related to homekit

575
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:23,648
Possibly not the full range of device

576
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,928
But something

577
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:26,720
So exciting news there

578
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:28,000
And then it just came out

579
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,536
This last week

580
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:30,816
That Google

581
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:31,840
Is building

582
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:33,376
What looks to be a

583
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:36,960
Operating system for the internet of things that it is going to call

584
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:37,728
Brillo

585
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:38,752
And

586
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:40,544
The way that that is looking

587
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:42,592
And again this is all

588
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:45,152
Based on sources this is not from Google

589
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:47,200
Variety of news reports including

590
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:51,808
My sources including the information and in some from Mike Wolfe who is an analyst

591
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,600
Up in Seattle

592
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:56,672
Basically Google has Craig Barrett who

593
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:58,720
You guys may be familiar with as a former

594
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:02,048
CEO of atheros which is a Wi-Fi chip company

595
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:03,328
Is building out

596
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,608
Operating

597
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:05,888
System that looks like

598
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:06,912
It's going to be

599
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:07,936
Inside router

600
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:09,216
Edible

601
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:11,008
You won't have like a Smart Hub but it

602
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:12,032
Control a bunch of

603
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,056
The devices in the house

604
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:14,336
So

605
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:17,152
With all of that Exposition out of the way

606
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,176
John

607
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:19,456
Tell us

608
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:20,736
What do you think

609
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:23,808
About kind of all of this news and is this the way

610
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:25,600
Did the smart home should kind of evolve

611
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:26,880
As you said

612
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:32,768
This has been a long time coming Apple first announced homekit at WWDC last year

613
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:36,608
And everyone's really been waiting with bated breath ever since

614
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,424
And obviously eater does the flip side of that with

615
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,728
Android umbrella getting to the game

616
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:47,616
Hopefully this is where we start of cross that Chasm get out of the trip current crop of disillusionment

617
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:48,640
And hopefully start

618
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:50,176
To see some things that work

619
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,712
And really work together

620
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:56,064
And work it in this notion where we're not diving in and out of

621
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,088
Multiple app

622
00:24:57,856 --> 00:25:00,160
Jamaica are smart home dreams come true

623
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,208
But it feels like a single solution

624
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:05,024
That's really the missing elements

625
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:05,792
Today

626
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:08,608
Let's go to take the smart home and make it feels sort of after

627
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:10,400
I think today's

628
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:14,496
Elements within the smart home and felt a little bit like multiple Islands

629
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:16,032
Either of icons

630
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:17,056
Floating around

631
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:18,336
Or at the very least

632
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:19,872
Stinks like SmartThings

633
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:20,896
Peking wings

634
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:25,504
A single app to rule them all but still an app that I have to get into and doesn't quite get

635
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,272
Take me to the start

636
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:28,320
A high-level access that

637
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:32,160
Apple's IOS or or the Google Android

638
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:33,696
Operating system can

639
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:36,000
Can do it only a swipe or a

640
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,560
Talking point away

641
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:41,120
I was all of that intelligent agents so

642
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:42,912
This is really something to do

643
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:44,448
Start looking pretty closely at

644
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:47,008
And hopefully we won't continue to be disappointed

645
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:48,288
But today is your day

646
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:52,384
Smart home islands are are not quite pulling their weight

647
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:55,712
And certainly not mainstream ready yet

648
00:25:56,224 --> 00:26:00,064
So I'm going to sort of disagree with you because I feel like while these are

649
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,904
Islands because they're bigger they're more like continent

650
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:06,464
They are still separate continents and

651
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,024
You know my husband actually carries an iPhone

652
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,304
Icarian Android

653
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,864
And I look at this and I kind of like oh

654
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,632
Nuts

655
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:14,912
This could be today

656
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:19,776
Difficult think that's a great point in one of the things that we often forget

657
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:23,104
Is when we deal with multiple users in a home is

658
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,128
It's it's

659
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:25,152
More

660
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:27,200
It's certainly more personal

661
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:30,272
And it's our Sanctuary but at the same time at the sanctuary of us

662
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:34,368
Typically more said in the sanctuary of me so that multi-user components

663
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,440
And knowing that they could be on multiple platforms

664
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:38,976
Definitely an interesting point

665
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:41,536
The other point I'd like to bring up about this

666
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:42,560
Future

667
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:48,960
With all of these devices they still revolver on my smartphone even if there's like a Hubbard the Wi-Fi

668
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:52,032
Router is the brains of the operation or maybe it's like an apple

669
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:53,312
TV boxer

670
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,080
Whatever

671
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:55,872
But I still think

672
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:59,712
At the end goal should be a much more contextually aware

673
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:02,784
Home kind of like what Tony fadell from desk talks about

674
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:04,064
Which is

675
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,928
My house responds to me as opposed to meet ordering my house to do things

676
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:11,232
And I don't know from your first

677
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:13,280
How far are we actually away from some

678
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:14,304
Like that

679
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,864
Yeah I don't think we're too far away from

680
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,424
That's an excellent point and in many ways

681
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,448
Hopefully

682
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:23,776
What having these larger platform players involved

683
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:26,336
That will get us closer to

684
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:27,872
To make a great point

685
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:30,432
Context is important in 10th is important

686
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:32,224
And it shouldn't have to be

687
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,528
Expressed intent of pushing a button

688
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:36,832
What is that button is on my wall

689
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,112
Pocket door online read

690
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,648
Or even a voice

691
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:40,416
Command

692
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:43,232
There are things that the system can start to know

693
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:45,280
As they learn about us

694
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:48,352
Where it doesn't become a requirement

695
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:49,632
That we are interacting

696
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:51,168
And

697
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:55,008
The really interesting opponent that is how do you get that set up

698
00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:00,896
How do you how does the user understand what those opportunities are or we would examine their own in 10 *

699
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:01,664
And

700
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,200
Anyways the role of

701
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:05,248
The system is in helping to

702
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,552
To discover those and present the offer

703
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:10,624
Because today with most many of these

704
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,904
Smart home systems

705
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:12,928
Weather

706
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:15,744
What we think we'll see from homekit or even Brillo

707
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:17,280
It's so much about the sea

708
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,560
Expression of

709
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:20,864
What do I want to do before I've done it

710
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,168
Understanding I like this current context

711
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:24,960
When we call this

712
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:26,496
This is dinner

713
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:27,264
And

714
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,104
Like to write the music and everything in that's what dinners going to be

715
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,640
Inside when dinner happens this

716
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,664
Should be what happened

717
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:38,528
In some ways Harmony did that a long time ago with certain that having things that are activity-based

718
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,600
Although we still have to kind of pull out a remote and head

719
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:42,880
Watch TV

720
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:45,696
But the sooner that we can understand those contacts

721
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:46,464
And

722
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,768
Do things on behalf of the user

723
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,560
In the beginning with their permission

724
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:53,376
Could it odd if you do something and it was unexpected

725
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:56,448
But after it becomes a pattern and repetition

726
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:59,008
And we can do those things and take something off the users plate

727
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,056
And I think that's where things started

728
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:02,080
To become mad

729
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:06,688
And I think on the way to that magic we're going to get a lot of these kind of

730
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:07,968

Type feelings wear

732
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:11,296
Your house is going to be like oh

733
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:16,160
I think it's dinner time and it's going to dim the lights and you're going to be suddenly in the middle of trying to

734
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:18,976
Turn of work on a project late at night and you're like

735
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:21,280
No house no it's not dinner

736
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:22,816
Prince lights up

737
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:24,352
And house is going to be like

738
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:25,376
Sorry my bad

739
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:27,936
I do think we'll get there a very Optimus

740
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:31,264
Absolutely and it's one of those places where

741
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:33,312
Nemours data points

742
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:36,384
We have more information and awareness that the system has

743
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:39,456
The Laura can be a bit more accurate with those

744
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:42,016
Understanding those patterns in the nuance

745
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:44,832
In that part of having these systems at work

746
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:46,880
Together in unison

747
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:48,160
Rather than

748
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:50,720
Being their own islands of sensors

749
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:51,488
Input

750
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:52,768
And and output

751
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:57,632
That's the kind of thing where we need more cooperation across devices

752
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:00,448
I just interoperability

753
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:01,216
Data

754
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:03,008
Itself but the meaning

755
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,544
Behind that data

756
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,568
And that

757
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:06,336
Swear

758
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:10,176
It's going to be I think that the really interesting Innovations are going to come from

759
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:10,944
Is

760
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:12,992
That the company is trying to make

761
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:14,272
Expensive patterns

762
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:16,064
Machine learning is going to be

763
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:17,856
Exact what's going to take the

764
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:18,880
Smart home India

765
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:22,976
Smart not just a remote control that happens to be on the adult

766
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,536
Alright well let's think about

767
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:28,096
Bringing the smart home to the masses

768
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:30,144
How is it that we're going to

769
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:34,240
Can I bring this to the mainstream and you mentioned earlier before the show

770
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:41,152
Places like Disney and experiences in other business locales is being a good way to go

771
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:42,944
Get people introduced to this

772
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,224
Beyond just like

773
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:45,760
Blog posts

774
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:46,784
Marketing campaign

775
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:53,440
I'd love to hear your thoughts about Disney's Fastpass which is kind of right now the gold standard in the internet if they

776
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:56,000
Venetian Bay

777
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:58,816
Automation delivering an awesome experienced

778
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,168
I think one of the things at Disney's always done and done so well

779
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:04,960
Is they put us into the future

780
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:07,520
Epcot Center way back when I was a kid

781
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:11,872
Tomorrowland and everything they've been doing it is a full experience

782
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,992
And it's a great exercise and Industry of end-to-end service design

783
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:18,784
Is it a Magic Band

784
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:23,648
Is pretty remarkable in that in that sense because it starts from the point of

785
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:25,952
Before you even gone to Disney

786
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:32,352
You should have got this band in the mail you on talking it's already should have got your information and is personalizing you can do something

787
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:35,680
And the moment you walk into Disney

788
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:37,472
They know your name

789
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:42,848
And they can create some really interesting magical experiences when you make you just comes up to you and says

790
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,128
Hi Stacy

791
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:46,944
To understand where you are and how they can

792
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,760
Help improve your experience while you're there

793
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:52,064
Getting getting past lines or

794
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,136
Letting you know where there is another

795
00:31:55,392 --> 00:32:00,512
A video of a ride you want to do that that is not as crowded right now and beyond all that so

796
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:01,792
And that's what

797
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:03,584
We want our smartphone to be in

798
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,680
When you see these magical experiences in this this world of Disney

799
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:11,776
You start to understand are you get exposed to what happens when

800
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:14,080
All of this intelligence comes together

801
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,360
And so

802
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:16,896
Their opportunities

803
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:17,664
In

804
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,944
Hotels

805
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,272
In the airline experience do you sort of really end-to-end

806
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:24,320
Service design Industries

807
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:26,624
Start exposing the consumer

808
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,392
To what

809
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:28,672
What's the value of

810
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:32,512
And integration of technology and and

811
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:34,304
That intention in the

812
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,840
Career your person

813
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:37,120
Personalization in York

814
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:38,144
EXO

815
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,168
If we think about

816
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:42,496
Hotels just starting to do this a little today I can

817
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:46,592
Go to a Starwood Hotel walk up to the door and in my my

818
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:48,640
Phone or my Apple watch

819
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:55,296
I will unlock the door and that's kind of a magical experience and there's opportunity beyond that as you start to integrate

820
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:57,600
Your content traveling with you your likes

821
00:32:57,856 --> 00:33:01,696
And media and leaving your alarm clock automatically being set

822
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:06,048
Within the room based on what you might do on on your phone or your watching soap

823
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:08,352
When you think about an end-to-end Xperia

824
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:09,376
Airlines

825
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:10,912
Again this is sort of 4

826
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:14,752
For 2 hours for 6 hours work were captive

827
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:19,104
You know how do we engage the user from that moment they purchase their tickets even if it's

828
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:20,640
A day a week a month

829
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:23,456
Having that information on you

830
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:25,248
Smoothing to the checking experience

831
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:28,064
Sitting in your seat and having your favorite music

832
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,344
Your content

833
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:32,160
Got your drink type kind of all there

834
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:37,536
And it becomes an expected so hyper-personal to you and deeply integrated with technology

835
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:40,608
Into that swim start understand we'll look at my home do

836
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:43,680
Oh sure now what I think about getting on a plane

837
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:45,728
Especially for like a

838
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:48,032
An overnight kind of Trooper Redeye

839
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:51,104
Flying across the ocean to a different time zone especially

840
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:52,384
Thinking about

841
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,944
Doing some of these circadian rhythm

842
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:55,968
Light cycles

843
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,760
That would be amazing

844
00:33:58,016 --> 00:34:00,832
And all you have to do is replace the LEDs on the plane with

845
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:03,648
I was slightly smarter LED and then you could run like a

846
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:05,952
You know I'm going from

847
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:08,256
Dallas Texas to Sydney Australia

848
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:09,280
Can you run a

849
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:11,328
A circadian rhythm cycle that puts

850
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,376
At the right time zone when I land

851
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:15,168
I look at stuff like that and I

852
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:16,192
I'm really excited

853
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:20,032
Absolutely I mean if you take that to that sort of

854
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:21,824
The full Disney contacts

855
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,360
If you had a smart home

856
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:29,504
When I bought that plane tickets and we understand the calculation that you're going to Sydney Australia and here's the time difference

857
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:31,808
Did circadian rhythms

858
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:35,392
Affecting that bealite can actually happen automatically in your home

859
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:37,440
Starting a week before the trip

860
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,208
End

AC systems

00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:46,400
Are open to where the triggers being tentrr talking to each other

864
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:48,448
User should have to think about that

865
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:53,312
I put my Airline I don't know if I have enough trust in my airline that I be like

866
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:54,336
Yeah you know what

867
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:56,128
United you can have axe

868
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:58,688
You cannot

Annette

870
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:00,480
Kind of brings up

871
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:01,504
Issues about

872
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,528
Like when you

873
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,320
When do you start having this

874
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:06,112
Is very interconnected world

875
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:08,928
In your start sharing this kind of levels of personal data

876
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,744
Be not even personal data but access to

877
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:13,024
Your home

878
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:14,816
And control

879
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:17,120
Who are you going to share that with

880
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:19,168
Because I sure as heck

881
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:21,984
Is there companies out there that I'm like nope you're not getting any of it

882
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:23,264
Not

883
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,032
Not ever

884
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:26,848
Oh it's it's a great point and

885
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,408
You know there's a big component of trust

886
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,688
End

887
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:33,504
What's important when we do talk with clients is

888
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:34,528
Kid

889
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:37,600
Presents realities about where trusted currently exist

890
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:38,368
What are brands

891
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:41,184
Who do I trust with some of this information in

892
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,488
In N even there's an ocean of time limit

893
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:45,792
Which we don't really see too much today

894
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:47,072
It's sort of an all-or-nothing

895
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:49,120
Never or forever

896
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:55,264
How do I set a time limit on something United for this flight to get me to Australia and then make that a pleasant experience

897
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:58,848
For the next week and a half or starting now and

898
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:01,152
When does my flight land

899
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,688
I'm going to give them Trust

900
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:04,736
That within the boundary of what

901
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:05,760
What can they ask

902
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:08,576
Presenting that clear value proposition

903
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:10,112
What is a user get

904
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:14,976
From disclosing some level of privacy are giving some level of access

905
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:17,024
To their technology and their lives

906
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,840
It was in the things that brand have to get right first

907
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:22,144
User experience aside

908
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,728
It all comes down to is this worth the trade-off is it exciting

909
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:26,496
From me

910
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:28,800
We can't get overly excited just by the Techno

911
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:31,104
And that's the biggest challenge that

912
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,384
Technology companies have

913
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:34,432
Those are the things you have to focus on

914
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:37,248
Because that's what's going to drive the adoption

915
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:38,784
Anime boys

916
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,320
About in our industry

917
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:43,648
The killer app what's it saying where you're like oh my God I need that to happen

918
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:47,232
And that in many ways is the Serta missing

919
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:48,256
Proposition

920
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:51,328
For some of the smartphone I think we're getting smarter about it now

921
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,144
Yeah I think the challenge with presenting the Smart Home

922
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:56,960
And selling the smart time to people is that

923
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:59,264
Can you mentioned it before this the home is

924
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:06,176
Both shared but it's also very personal and so everybody wants different things and different people in the home

925
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:07,456
Want different things

926
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:08,480
Side of it so

927
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:10,528
It's very hard to Market this stuff

928
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:11,552
Alright
