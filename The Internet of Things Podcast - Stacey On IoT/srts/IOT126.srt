Regarding terms of service

00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:28,672
And we're going to say the phrase TOs

12
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,232

What happened to the Nvidia spot

00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,888
Do some news bits take a reader question

And talk about a new project that we built here at the show

18
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:45,824
We also got a message from our sponsor Hyksos Solutions and our guest this week

00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,200
Who's the head of innovation at Johns Hopkins Sibley Innovation Center

Eros

27
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:07,072
Arrow makes a mesh Wi-Fi

28
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:08,096
That is

29
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:11,168
Awesome I have it in my home it is

30
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:17,568
Currently Powerade over 50 connected to places they just launched their second generation mesh wi-fi system

31
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:24,224
It contains 10111 beacons and the beacons are basically access point

32
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:30,624
Plug-in around your house and they just expand the coverage and this isn't complicated to do like a tradition

33
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:37,024
National kind of network extender where you got to have late at work

34
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,328
D-rose recognize each other and they're like

35
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:45,728
You can buy individual heroes or

36
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:52,128
Word that begins to add to your current system if you're a first generation Eero customer I bought an additional begin for about a hundred

37
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:58,528
$49 because I needed a little extra coverage for my Wi-Fi video doorbell

38
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:04,928
Start at 399 410 into begins now ships

39

41
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:19,008
Stacy

42
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:23,872
I love my Eros and hopefully if you get yours you will love them too

43
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:25,920
All right now back to the show

44
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,224
Let's get started with a meeting

45
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,248
An intense

46
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:30,016
Topic that

47
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,552
People have very strong

48
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:32,320
My feelings about

49
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:33,600
It is not

50
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:34,624
Politics

51
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,928
Sonos is new

52
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:40,512
Terms of service in this is part of an overall trend that we

53
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:41,792
A lot actually

54
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:44,864
Are we buying Hardware are we buying

55
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,144
Services for

56
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:47,680
We pick up its neck

57
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:52,544
Kevin you want to break down 10 of the Sonos drama for us

58
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,592
Yeah

59
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:55,616
And I do not have a

60
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:57,664
As soon as I know you do something curious separate

61
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:59,456
Now

62
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,992
Alright then overachiever

63
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:02,784
So I am not

64
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,320
Affected by this

65
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:10,464
Basically Sonos has said that users must accept the new privacy policy

66
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:15,072
Weather devices the Sonos audio devices May cease to function

67
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,608
They're not letting you up

68
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,424
Out of their new privacy policy

69
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,008
And that's not good I mean it's pretty much a

70
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:25,312
All or none situation the way things

71
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,848
Are looking right now

72
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:31,200
I am very curious what you think about this because you have a

73
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,760
And I have some just hide

74
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:36,832
What is your feeling as a Sonos customer

75
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:37,856
So

76
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:38,880
I was so disgust

77
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:40,672
I

78
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:43,488
Understandably miffed

79
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,024
At the idea that might

80
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,048
Devices

81
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,072
That I bought

82
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:49,376
I bought my first Sonos back

83
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:51,936
It was like

84
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:52,704
Yeah it was

85
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:54,240
It was a weird mm

86
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,568
Baby 2009 my first one

87
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:01,920
And then when we moved I spend another $2,000 by

88
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:05,760
I can't remember the part names but little connectors Ono's things for my

89
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,808
In-ceiling speakers in

90
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:08,576
That wasn't

91
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,112
12 Sol

92
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:12,928
As an existing Sonos customer I'm probably going to

93
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:13,952
Well I am going to

94
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:17,024
Except these and I would accept it almost blindly just be

95
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,047
Because I want

96
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:18,815
Dysfunctional

97
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,351
Play Lose My Soul

98
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,399
But

99
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,423
For people who are

100
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,447
Upset

101
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:26,495
I understand they're upset in this

102
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,775
Because

103
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,311
Buying something

104
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,103
Even if you just bought it last year

105
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:33,919
One of the questions I have is how long before they

106
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:34,943
Degrade the server

107
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:35,711
Best rate

108
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:37,503
2 years

109
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,783
Terrible if it's

110
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:39,807
10 years

111
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,087
I feel like

112
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:45,951
Maybe a bit more reasonable although this is why I think

113
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,231
Connected devices

114
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:49,023
Expiry date basically

115
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:52,095
Appoint over which you would not support the software because

116
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:53,887
Front about this kind of thing

117
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:57,215
From Sonos is perspective I understand why they're doing

118
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:02,591
If they're going to start offering Integrations with other devices

119
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,383
And if they're going to

120
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:06,687
Do these Services All In

121
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:08,991
They're going to have to have a measure of control

122
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,271
Over how they purr

123
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,575
Pro-Med customer relations

124
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:16,159
Soto says you don't have to send all of your data

125
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,951
But you will have to send what

126
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:18,975
Functional

127
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:24,607
Email address IP addresses account login information

128
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:27,935
As well as device date information about Wi-Fi internet

129
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,983
Other Hardware

130
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,519
Information

131
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,543
And

132
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,847
Location is in there as well

133
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:35,615
Okay

134
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:37,919
You can't opt out of it

135
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:40,479
You can't opt out of the functional data

136
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,247
Right

137
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,295
Privacy people are

138
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,575
Understandably

139
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,623
And I get it

140
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,903
But I also see

141
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,951
Why sodas wants

142
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,999
If your Sonos isn't

143
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,023
Performing well

144
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,559
With another device

145
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:55,839
It needs to be able to

146
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,399
Now the question

147
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,679
Personas dispersed

148
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:04,799
Is if no one wants to add these additional features and just wants to use their

149
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,079
Old Sonos has

150
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,103
Until

151
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,383
Brake switch

152
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:13,247
How to play five

153
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,551
Almost eight years and it's

154
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,343
Looks great

155
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,623
Works fine but

156
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:20,159
For Sonos sub

157
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,951
Sporting those devices

158
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:28,607
Plus another set of software for the new gradle with other connected devices system

159
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:31,423
Good become cost-prohibitive really quickly

160
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,471
So I think that

161
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,495
The challenge

162
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:36,543
And I would agree that

163
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:37,823
What song is this

164
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,871
Trying to do at least partially is

165
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:46,015
To lack of better term control the experience or offer a guaranteed minimum level of positive

166
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:50,367
They need to have some control over the devices to make sure

167
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:52,159
Everything's working the way it should

168
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,951
So that its customers are happy

169
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,743
Flipside is

170
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,303
Support

171
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:01,631
I use the June oven as an example you and I both purchased one

172
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,679
I had some problems with my first one

173
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,983
And when I reach out to support they said okay

174
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,263
Will you give us

175
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:10,591
You're okay to go into the logs of your device

176
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,871
So we can troubleshoot it

177
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:13,151
Absolutely I said

178
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:15,455
They normally would not be looking at that

179
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:17,759
So it's a way to do this on a case

180
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,551
Space spaces from support standpoint

181
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,855
Yes but they were collect

182
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:22,623
Data

183
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:28,511
So

184
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:29,791
Do all these they're just saying

185
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,327
Hey we used to not collect

186
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,863
This data and now we have to

187
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,911
Now we want to

188
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:37,983
I would say there's a couple things they could do he

189
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:40,287
The closest example I can think of

190
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,847
What is Google when it bought revolve

191
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:43,615
Call Cyn

192
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:46,431
This revolver was a smart home hub that Google bought

193
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:47,967
Mostly for the engineering

194
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:52,063
Revolve worked on a completely different set up the nest

195
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:54,111
Which is Google's other Hardware

196
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:54,879
Platform

197
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:55,903
Thing at the time

198
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,951
Google shut revolved

199
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:02,815
It just didn't make sense to operate those two things and have the move them over

200
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,863
Have those soccer teams basic

201
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,143
And so

202
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:12,031
When they shut it down they did so very poorly they were more than 10,000 customers

203
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,407
People freaked out

204
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,711
And as a result Google said okay

205
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:20,991
Will do

206
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,527
So they did

207
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:25,599
Refunds I don't know if they were hold a partial refunds

208
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:26,367
For this device

209
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,903
Sonos has a

210
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:28,927
Heart problems

211
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,719
Because they have way more devices

212
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,023
A full refund

213
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:36,863
Do a partial refund

214
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:39,935
Coupon they could do something for the customers

215
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:40,703
Don't

216
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:41,471
What

217
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:42,751
Their sister

218
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,543
And they should

219
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,311
Also

220
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,615
Not say that it will cease to work

221
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:50,175
In some nebulous future although I understand why that's

222
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,199
EOS

223
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,223
Are privacy policies

224
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:54,783
But they should actually come up with a plan

225
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:57,087
Say something like hey your devices

226
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:57,855
Spell failing

227
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,159
We pledge to

228
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,439
Support these devices

229
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:04,255
Till this time frame and it should be

230
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,023
Reasonable time

231
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,559
It should be

232
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:09,631
These devices in this service as you

233
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,655
No

234
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:11,935
Evolve

235
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,215
Pretty quickly

236
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:15,007
New hardware features

237
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,567
New services and so on anycast 2.4

238
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,359
Carpenters Tipping Point

239
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:22,175
Hey I just got a really old one of our products

240
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:27,551
We're just we just can't support you anymore because we've always you Advanced features in the newer products and so on so forth so

241
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:30,623
That's a little concerning me but that's the way this industry is right now

242
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:35,231
Well it would function they would have to pledge to keep a functional version

243
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:36,255
Of what they offered

244
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,535
Today on those device

245
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:40,863
I don't think that's crazy although with like

246
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,423
Eventually

247
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,471
Sonos works on your wi-fi system

248
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:46,495
But it also has appropriate

249
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:47,263
Network

250
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:51,871
And I don't know but if you could support that for an additional 10 years beyond your

251
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:53,663
I think that would actually

252
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,943
It even say that

253
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:59,039
I think that would go a long way to curbing some of this out

254
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,599
So that's just the sort of stuff

255
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:03,647
Another challenge

256
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,671
Experiencing right now

257
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,439
How is this

258
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:07,487
Oh my God what am I

259
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:11,327
We are still working that out

260
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,375
And there are not a lot of Protections in

261
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:15,935
Place for consumers as this happen

262
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:18,239
And Kevin and I talked about this

263
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,519
Ear when you buy a Kinect

264
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:23,103
It does behoove you to read the terms

265
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:26,175
In conditions that terms of service to privacy policy

266
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,223
Pretension

267
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:30,271
And not every company has that

268
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:32,063
I will call again

269
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,599
And for some sort of standard

270
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,391
How

271
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,927
We communicate

272
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,463
Data practices

273
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,231
To consume

274
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:41,279
In every device should come with a label

275
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,047
That says

276
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,607
In plain English we followed you

277
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,375
Practices

278
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:48,191
Right maybe something as simple as a Good Housekeeping seal of a

279
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,215
Although you can buy

280
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:54,591
We are but something something before

281
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:56,639
A consumer makes a purchase

282
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,663
They need to understand

283
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,455
For they make the purchase of my penny

284
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,223
Right

285
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,015
Because once you've made the purchase

286
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:03,807
You opted with

287
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:07,647
It's clicking on this thing and then you're like

288
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,951
Rap I've been selling my

289
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:12,255
My grocery list every week

290
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,535
That sucks

291
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,119
That's what

292
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,143
And then to

293
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,959
Is I think we really need some legal protections

294
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:24,799
Probably a few class action lawsuits to settle this

295
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,847
So in other news on this front

296
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,383
Anti-consumer kind of

297
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,175
Device Services challenge

298
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:34,271
The second court of appeals for the southern district of New York

299
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:37,599
Actually overturned a lower Court's decision

300
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:39,135
About Uber

301
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,415
And it's terms of sir

302
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,207
Basically a complaint

303
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:42,975
Was made

304
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:43,743
That

305
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,791
Uber's terms of service should be valid

306
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:47,327
Because you get it on your phone screen

307
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:49,375
Like I need a ride okay

308
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,143
Click yes

309
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:50,911
And you don't read it

310
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,703
And basically the court said

311
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:53,983
You know what you have

312
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,007
How to read those so

313
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,543
It said that

314
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,591
The arbitration clauses

315
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:01,151
Uber's terms of service

316
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,431
We're actually fine

317
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,455
They were legal in

318
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,479
This person

319
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:05,759
Click through to it

320
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:06,783
And said yes

321
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,575
Search two things that are bad

322
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,599
About this one

323
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,623
Terms of service

324
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,647
Terrible

325
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:12,671
They can take

326
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:13,695
Literally

327
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:14,975
Over an hour.

328
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:18,815
Like I will be to turn the service

329
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,607
Because legal jargon

330
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:23,935
By forcing

331
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:28,543
Arbitration arbitration clauses that are in these terms of sir

332
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:32,127
The court has basically said

333
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:34,943
All of the litigation or

334
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:39,039
Maturity is a litigation that we're going to have around the Internet of Things

335
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,855
It's going to happen behind closed doors

336
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,647
And that's terrifying

337
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,695
Yeah and any

338
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:47,487
For one thing you may have

339
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:51,327
Similar situations arbitrated differently so you'll have different outcomes

340
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,935
Secondly as you said behind closed doors we don't know we as consumers don't know

341
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,215
What's really being

342
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:57,983
Disgust

343
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:00,031
Decided and so on and

344
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,055
These are products

345
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:03,871
And services that millions of people use so

346
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:04,895
We need to know this

347
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:06,943
So

348
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,479
Sonos perspective

349
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:10,783
It's someone's like a su about this I think this

350
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,575
It's a sucky that they're breaking my device

351
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:16,927
If they had a terms of service originally that says hey you're going to arbitration

352
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:17,951
That could happen

353
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:18,975
Replicas

354
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:19,999
Customer support

355
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:25,119
Waive the right to sue the company as a result of agreeing to the terms of service if they have arbitration clauses in there

356
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,143
So

357
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,423
What are we saying to you

358
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,703
Find connected Hardware

359
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,495
You should read the terms of service

360
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:32,543
And

361
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,823
I'm also saying that we

362
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,151
Probably need to come up with more consumer-friendly

363
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:39,199
Explain privacy

364
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:41,247
Explain data retention policy

365
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,527
Also

366
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:45,087
Understand that there's a reason companies are

367
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,623
Selecting some of this data

368
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:50,207
If a company wants to change the terms of service on it

369
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,487
An existing device

370
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:52,511
I actually think that's

371
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,327
Because I get why they're doing it

372
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:57,631
If you're going to break some

373
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,751
You know it's funny because

374
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,031
A lot of this

375
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:07,871
Has happened in the past and it wasn't really highlighted people didn't realize

376
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,151
The computer world

377
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,431
If you're on Windows

378
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:16,575
There's a lot of telemetry data captured by these

379
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:17,855
Computers and devices

380
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,135
That's not new

381
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,159
That's actually

382
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,439
Happened four years

383
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:24,767
And there's a reason for an estimate the products better and see

384
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:28,607
Maybe people are clicking a start button windows

385
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:31,423
Don't need to because they have what they want is already

386
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,983
Shown their you know so that tells Microsoft

387
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:37,055
Tweak rui and saucer with make it better

388
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:41,919
It's a little different I think with these very personal type devices though

389
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,967
I meant I think that's why it's getting more attention now

390
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,503
Agreed

391
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:46,527
Okay

395
00:14:55,487 --> 00:15:00,095
That's the report and this comes by way of a teardown or

396
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,119
Viewing of

397
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,167
The newest Google Assistant

398
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,471
APK which is it an Android X

399
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:08,543
Executable settings the app itself you can look at the code if you have a

400
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:11,359
A program that can open the APK and that's what

401
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,895
Books 495 Google

402
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:16,479
There's a lot of code strings in

403
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:17,247
The

404
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,271
Google assistant app

I don't know but

408
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,231
Regardless

409
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:29,279
The deal is all these

410
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:31,839
Code Snippets point to headphones that will

411
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:34,143
Have Google Assistant built in

412
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,727
We just got interesting at school because actually I just

413
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:38,495
Qualcomm

Baby Alive

418
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:56,671
LOL and I was just going to say that it's a trend growing friend because

419
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:58,463
More devices more Mew device

420
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:02,815
Particularly are losing their 3.5 millimeter headphone jack so

421
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:05,119
Going Wireless

422
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,655
I'm okay with it

423
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,935
Smile couple pair of

424
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:09,727
The Bluetooth headphones so I

425
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:13,823
What I like to have

426
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,919
Magic word to the Google Assistant get information

427
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,199
This will be

428
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:21,759
But again we don't know yet and there's no official

429
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:25,343
News from Google on this is just people being around in the

430
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,367
APK

431
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,903
And the other speculative

432
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:30,207
Google News

433
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,743
Compete with

434
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:35,071
Either the Amazon Echo dot or possibly

435
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:39,935
Oh okay well there's a homepod

436
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,471
News 2 so

437
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:42,495
I was like

438
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,519
What is happening

439
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,567
Google homepod or Apple

440
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:51,455
Right and I I don't I don't think it's a true

441
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:55,295
Apples to Apples comparison to punto because the homepod

442
00:16:56,319 --> 00:17:02,463
I believe is going to debut at $349 where is a smaller Google home would be more like an

443
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,743
Can Echo dot work

444
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:06,047
Where are you feed we talked about last week

445
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,327
And

446
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,375
Should I hope cost $50 or less

447
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:10,399
I would have

448
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:11,935
Show Kevin

449
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,543
You doing some research here whatever happened to the Nvidia spot what is the

450
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:19,871
What a great Segway because I just talked about

451
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,919
Home assistance for $50 or less

452
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:24,991
I don't know if folks remember but back at CES in

453
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,783
January Nvidia

454
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:32,415
Debuted its newest version of the Nvidia Shield TV which is an Android TV set-top box

455
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:33,439
And you haven't

456
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:35,999
I do I bought one and I use it all the time

457
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:36,767
Fantastic

458
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:41,631
Sky 4K support for streaming HDR support

459
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,655
Android

460
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:46,239
TV apps and games

461
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,263
Controller

462
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,543
A voice remote

463
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,359
My TV my game is everything through it

464
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:55,711
Part of the reason I bought it was because the day they debuted this

465
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:58,015
Sexy as they also said coming soon

466
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:00,063
Will be our Nvidia spot

467
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,087
Which is a

468
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,623
$50

469
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:04,415
Little microphone

470
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:09,791
That you plug in I believe to an outlet and you buy multiple inputs

471
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:13,631
And basically turn your whole house into a giant microphone

472
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,935
Nile Clinic do that my whole house but I thought

473
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:19,775
I can put this in a couple rooms that way I don't need to be

474
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:21,823
You're my one single Google home

475
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,615
Get information song

476
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,407
They said

477
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:30,527
Coming in months and months and months are past now because we're now into she's almost September

478
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:33,343
I don't know what's happened to this it still

479
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:37,183
On the website the website you can still cook to notify me

480
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:42,047
I just think it's almost a missed opportunity each day goes by in this video is not available

481
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:43,583
Yeah

482
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:45,119
So you don't actually know

483
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:47,935
I just saying

484
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:50,495
If you find this service

485
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:52,799
Okay

486
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:55,871
Tucson news

487
00:18:56,383 --> 00:19:00,479
Speculation is that AT&T Digital Life Division that is there connected

488
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:03,039
Home automation and security offering

489
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,063
Is for sale

490
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:07,647
AT&T Apple back on this couple years ago Verizon's actually

491
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:08,671
Nickelback

492
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,695
Animation

493
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:10,719
Meanwhile

494
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:11,743
In the ISP world

495
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:12,767
Comcast

496
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:14,559
Des Moines

497
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:16,863
It makes sense

498
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,911
AT&T separately

499
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,215
So we'll see

500
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,495
Who might buy it

501
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:23,263
Gosh

502
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:25,567
Companies

503
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:26,591
We talked about 1

504
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:29,151
Couple weeks ago called perdia that is

505
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,431
Offering the back

506
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,199
Software

507
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,223
For this type of

508
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:33,759
Service

509
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:35,551
I don't think they would want

510
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,599
Actually manage the footprints oh my

511
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:38,879
I'm just someone like ATT

512
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,951
Which are also really bacon homeschool

513
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:45,791
That makes sense for purchase and interesting

514
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:46,559
Glen

515
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,327
Blurry

516
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,607
From AT&T

517
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:49,375
He is

518
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,911
Stepping down

519
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:55,775
Yes the president CEO of AT&T Mobility operations I believe that

520
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:57,823
Blake suit next month or two

521
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:04,479
What would I find super interesting he says his house has a hundred and sixty-five connected devices

522
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:06,783
So I'm curious who does by this because

523
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,343
I'm sure that his all-round AT&T Digital Life

524
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,367
165

525
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:11,391
Cheese

526
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,951
Combined

527
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,999
Although it may not be more than Charlie King

528
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,815
Tesla

529
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:25,727
Hot robots

530
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,103
I love the now robot

531
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,151
It is 6

532
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:33,919
Good thing

533
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:39,551
No amount of money can keep you safe

534
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:41,343
Basically

535
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:43,135
What they did

536
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,487
Basically control the arm of a collaborative multi-jointed

537
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:48,255
Robot

538
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:50,815
These robots can extend as far as

539
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:51,839
Lift up to 22

540
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:54,143
2 lb industrial setting

541
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,703
Is airsoft

542
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:58,239
Caesars

543
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:01,567
These robots that use what's called a buffer overflow attack

544
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:04,639
And that's basically so you send all kinds of data until the

545
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:06,175
Did Isis like

546
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,199
And

547
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:09,503
Then they overwrote the safety file

548
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:12,831
And so then you could make it they could control.

549
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:14,623
Richard Scarry

550
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:18,976
That is a problem

551
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:23,840
These are the robots that use in the game soccer robotics soccer games on TV ever watch those

552
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:24,608
Music

553
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:25,376
I have no

554
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:29,984
Control Alexa remotely and make my team win

555
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:31,776
What if someone had a hacker

556
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:34,848
Okay

557
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:36,384
You want to know more about the

558
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,224
It's pretty creepy and videos

559
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:43,808
In the show

560
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,368
Project this weekend

561
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:48,416
I don't want to tell you about it this week I'm going to tell you about it

562
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:50,208
Going to tell you about it

563
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:52,512
Because we're almost out of time but first

564
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:53,792
I want to answer

565
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:54,816
A reader question

566
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:57,888
And

567
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:59,168
Some of you may have this problem

568
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,984
So it's a question

569
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,776
This guy has for security camera

570
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:04,800
This question is

571
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:05,568
Dave

572
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,336
Upstate New York

573
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,360
Hello Dave

574
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:09,664
He has for security cameras installed

575
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:12,480
And they're all power over ethernet

576
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:15,808
Are HD cameras three of them having to be pause cams in one or trend

577
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:17,088
He's

578
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:20,416
Tie them all together using software called I spy which is a

579
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,696
Open source software

580
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:23,232
To make them all run together

581
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,256
It's on Eazy-E

582
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:26,560
But he really wants a unifying platform

583
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:28,864
Form for security and iot devices

584
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:32,192
And so he's got the hard wire traditional alarm system

585
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,520
He's got Google home Google Wi-Fi he's got SmartThings

586
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:36,544
She's got cameras

587
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:38,080
State wants to integrate

588
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:40,640
And he wants this unifying popcorn

589
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:45,504
So he's thinking he might use a Raspberry Pi to create a web server so he doesn't

590
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,040
Computer all the time

591
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,576
Yay

592
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:50,368
But she's wondering if there's another

593
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:57,280
It sounds like it really that the sticking point here is the cameras themselves getting

594
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:59,840
Using camera things to trigger

595
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:01,888
Kemmerer events to trigger automation

596
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,424
If I'm understanding it

597
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:04,448
That's my boy

598
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,520
It's a little Leah this is what

599
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,104
We're going to recommend Blue Iris

600
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:15,456
Softer and I know there are issues with blue iris but people have loved it in the past

601
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:17,504
A lot of Peter questions actually it

602
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,624
And blue iris has an integration with the Amazon Echo

603
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,392
Google

604
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:24,928
Now

605
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:26,720
The Amazon Echo integration

606
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:29,280
Is actually an official Blue Iris skill

607
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:30,048
And so

608
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:32,096
The link to how this works

609
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:32,864
Accurately

610
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:34,400
So you can do that day

611
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:38,240
There's also other services that will tie together

612
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:41,056
Blue Iris with Google home

613
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:42,848
Called Dash Runner

614
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:45,408
That's her voice commands for both

615
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:50,272
It will it will I use blue iris

616
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:56,160
A couple years ago with the couple of Ip webcams but at that point I didn't know how that automated system here

617
00:23:56,672 --> 00:24:01,024
The only thing I could do is actually a kind of automated that it's like send a tweet

618
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,072
Every hour of what was outside my window just for

619
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:05,376
Profundus I was hacking kicking things around

620
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,656
But there may be

621
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:12,032
Some scripting that you can do with it might even be some ways to tie things together with

622
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,056
Honest-1

623
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:18,688
Well so I also found a blue iris Fusion software this is on the SmartThings platform

624
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:22,784
So if you search for Blue Iris on SmartThings you're going to find

625
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:26,368
Actually says it ties everything together

626
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:29,952
It's going to be a little complicated but

627
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:32,512
I think they gave you were up to it since you were going to build your own

628
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:33,792
Using the pie in

629
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:34,816
All this yourself

630
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:37,376
Set rich with IP camera this is a challenge

631
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,144
If you go with

632
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,424
Say I nest

633
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:44,800
Or another similar type device that is more of a service-based things cuz IP cameras too.

634
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:47,104
Get a camera and you make it work yourself

635
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:47,872
Where at

636
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:51,456
Nasty they have a service for you and

637
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:54,016
You can build off of that or they can go outside so that's

638
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:56,832
That's the tricky part that's kind of getting away from IP webcam

639
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:00,928
So that's our thought on that

640
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:03,744
My sponsor and

641
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,512
Foreign

642
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:05,536
Awesome guests

643
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:09,632
This is Nick Dawson who is head of innovation at Johns Hopkins

644
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:10,656
Community Hospital

645
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:16,288
And he is going to blow your mind with cool stuff he's doing using things like Amazon dash button

646
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:18,592
Philips Hue Lights and

647
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:21,152
Even Sonos

648
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:29,856
Hey everyone this is Stacy and we are breaking into the podcast for a message from our sponsor this we sponsor is haiku

649
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:33,952
Do Solutions and we have Martin mauersberger who is the CEO of high

650
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:37,792
So remind me again what is high CO2

651
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:39,584
We are in

652
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,352
Advance Auto

653
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:42,400
Lucky engineering Solutions provider

654
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:44,960
With Development Centers in Eastern Europe

655
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:49,312
We have primarily used Bass Lines by providing engineering teams

656
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:50,848
Help them

657
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:52,128
Design artist

658
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,688
With heart radio

659
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:55,968
And not ending

660
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:57,760
With mathematical data flask

661
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:00,064
The data they collect

662
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:05,440
So let's dig into that a little bit more can you explain what the service is that your

663
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:06,464
Providing

664
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:08,768
Requires

665
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:11,328
Real world data to be sourced from a thing

666
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:12,096
Or not

667
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,888
You need to transmit

668
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:16,960
Through the internet to some form of backend

669
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:18,240
Were you practicing

670
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,008
You also

671
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,800
Time to activate a phone

672
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:23,104
On the side of the object based on

673
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,128
Giggling

674
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:25,920
Sunday sounds pretty pretty

675
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:27,200
Easy Button

676
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:29,504
Entails a variety of operation

677
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:31,552
Baleful requires number of

678
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:32,832
The first

679
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:38,464
Resource from a sensor and then transmitted either directly or through a gate with a Q

680
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:41,280
System work can be analyzed or visualize

681
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:43,072
The other way around Dayton

682
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:44,864
To be transferred back to the object

683
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,144
Where it causes

684
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,424
A desired app

685
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:49,216
And that's usually outside

686
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:54,592
Wow that's going to cover a lot of things so what kind of skills do you employee

687
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:55,360
Provide

688
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:56,128
Disservice

689
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:58,176
We have experts

690
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:59,968
An analog and digital electronics

691
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:01,760
An embedded software engineering

692
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:02,784
They focused on

693
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,064
The size of the thing

694
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:04,832
Orgeat

695
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:06,112
Then we need to cover

696
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:06,880
Communication

697
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:09,184
And that was done by Engineers who understand

698
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,720
OSI stack

699
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:11,488
And then we

700
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:13,024
Various

701
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:15,072
Data scientist

702
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:16,864
Mapreduce algorithm

703
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,656
Which analyze the data

704
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:21,472
Front-end software developers to create the user interface

705
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:22,752
Is Rudy a range

706
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,032
Back in Turkey

707
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:27,104
That does sound like a lot of interface

708
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:28,384
Is that something

709
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:29,664
Concerned about

710
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:33,760
Well you have the coordination of different skills is most

711
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:36,064
There are differences

712
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,856
Language or terminology

713
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:40,928
A good example would be an electronic in

714
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:42,976
Together with him

715
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,024
Visalia Dental

716
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,072
The mathematician

717
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:48,864
Expresses the imaginary part of

718
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,912
Complex number as the letter i

719
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:52,448
Where's the electronic

720
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,984
Give me will understand

721
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:54,752
Current

722
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,544
Port a tectonic engineer

723
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,360
An imaginary number is represented by the letter j

724
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:00,896
So we need to make

725
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:01,920
The date

726
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:02,688
Understand

727
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:04,224
Speak the same language

728
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:06,016
How does Ico a

729
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:06,784
Address that

730
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:08,064
Over the years

731
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,368
Training programs

732
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:12,928
That makes sure the teams collaborate efficiently

733
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:14,208
This is also

734
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:16,000
Why are combined experiences

735
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:19,328
Cindy found in areas I was incredibly valuable.

736
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:22,144
We remove this learning curve

737
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:24,192
And where can I find out

738
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:26,240
Go to our website

Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham

742
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:46,208
And today's guest we have

743
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:47,488
Nick Dawson

744
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:49,792
Who is the executive director of innovation for the

745
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:52,352
Johns Hopkins Sibley Innovation Hub

746
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:53,632
Hello Nick

747
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,680
Hey good morning Stacy

748
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:58,240
Man I am super excited to have you on the show beat

749
00:28:58,496 --> 00:28:59,008
Because

750
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:03,616
I'm really excited about what you're doing for innovation in iot and hot

751
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:06,176
Herself

752
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:08,992
Let's just get started with telling me a little bit about

753
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:10,016
What you do

754
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:12,832
For the Johns Hopkins community hospital in

755
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:13,600
But you work

756
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:20,512
I have tried for wieden here for about 4 years and I tried for four years to come up with a really short pixie way of saying

757
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:22,304
Saying this and I still stumble on it but

758
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:27,680
In short we are a team of human-centered designers and technologists

759
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:28,448
Sand

760
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:33,312
Project people in the heart of literally sitting in a space in the main lobby

761
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:34,592
Of a hospital

762
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:35,872
In our job

763
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:37,664
To constantly look for

764
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:41,760
Ways to reinvent reimagine improve and fix Healthcare

765
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:46,112
Mostly we try to do that Through The Eyes of patients and Families

766
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,648
That was pretty good

767
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:51,232
It's hard to be pissy when you're talking about the lives of patients and Families

768
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:52,768
So you're on the show

769
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:55,328
Because you and I've had this amazing conversation about

770
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,096
Putting

771
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:58,144
Technology into patients rooms

772
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,216
Let's get started by it with you just sharing what your journey

773
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,568
Maybe two years ago two and a half working on a project

774
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:11,712
Try to give patients more control over their room in their experience in your laying in a hospital bed

775
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:17,856
You don't have a lot of control even over the physical environment let alone what happens to you and in this is right about the time the

776
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:20,672
I guess I got to be careful about it I can't say the a word the

777
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:21,952
Padme is what week

778
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:23,744
Matinee

779
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,560
Had just come on to seeing it we said alright let's experiment

780
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:27,840
Let's just prototype

781
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:30,400
The concept of giving people voice control

782
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:36,800
Over a root and so we bought a couple of them and that's when we said oh my gosh how are we going to get Madame a connected to this

783
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:38,080
Highly secure

784
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:39,616
Appropriately secured

785
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:40,640
Corporate Network

786
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:44,480
And you can imagine that inside this corporate network is

787
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:45,760
Highly regulated

788
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:48,064
Protected patient information and

789
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:53,952
Clinical information in medical science information and then there's also the all the gear there's MRI machines that are network

790
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:54,720
Connected

791
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:59,072
IV pumps and sore pretty particular about what can go on to a hospital Network

792
00:30:59,328 --> 00:30:59,840
Working what can

793
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,400
We got no problem with a guest Network

794
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:03,936
Work we can get this thing on the guest Network

795
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:06,240
Work but the guest network has a captive portal

796
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:10,592
And there was no way without an interface to clear the captive portal we can we talk about

797
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:12,896
Spoofing the MAC address and he said you know

798
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:14,944
This is our chance to do something a little bit

799
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,224
And so we ended up

800
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:19,040
Running a completely separate line

801
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:25,696
Call the local ISP and said would you come install a line in our hospital that's separate from the hospital Network

802
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:26,720
Set up our own

803
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:29,280
Infrastructure in here and

804
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:33,120
It kind of laid the groundwork to say oh my gosh what can we do now

805
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:34,912
That we have this

806
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:35,680
Separate

807
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:36,704
Air gap

808
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,240
Non-clinical Network

809
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:39,264
On which two

810
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:43,872
To start innovating in and open the door to saying all of these consumer things

811
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:47,968
That we said wouldn't be need to try that in the hospital oh yeah but we can't

812
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:51,040
Now all the sudden he said well we can't Miss Israel easy we can put

813
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:57,440
Hue Lights and Sonos in Chromecast in a room and start to see if that at least provides a little bit of Creature Comforts

814
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:59,488
And kind of gone from there

815
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:01,792
Okay so did you ask

816
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:03,840
Permission before you installed the Sip

817
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,888
How did that go over

818
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:06,656
With corporate it

819
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:08,704
This is just between us right

820
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,472
Pegasus

821
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:12,800
Nobody will hear that I said all of the 25000

822
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:14,592
So we did

823
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:18,176
We're we're having a lot of those conversations now and it will

824
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:19,712
Beebe Road we didn't say work

825
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:20,992
Explicitly not going to have

826
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:22,016
Conversation

827
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:24,320
But we were tapping into I think

828
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:25,856
It's really special

829
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:27,648
Unique about our setup

830
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,952
Is we're chartered by our CEO

831
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:32,000
And part of that Charter was

832
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:33,024
Do things differently

833
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:35,328
We looked at it and said we're not

834
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:36,608
Substantial risks

835
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:40,704
One of the members of our team is a cyber-security researcher from DARPA

836
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,472
Zoe

837
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:42,496
We had a pretty good

838
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:43,776
Putting stand on

839
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:47,104
So we didn't we kind of just built this separate Shadow Network

840
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:47,872
End

841
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:50,688
Instead of having the conversation about is that okay

842
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:55,552
We had the conversation instead about what can we do for doctors nurses and patients

843
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:58,368
Add value or make your jobs or days easier

844
00:32:58,624 --> 00:32:59,136
In

845
00:32:59,392 --> 00:32:59,904
Those things

846
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:00,672
Became

847
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:03,744
More of the story than this separate Network

848
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,048
It's workout mostly we started to

849
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:07,328
Like any innovation

850
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:08,864
I think there's a point where if you

851
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:09,888
When you start to

852
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:12,192
Really create a lot of value and change

853
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:18,848
You got a bubble up over the surface a little bit then people start poking around and see will hang its make sure everything here is kind of copacetic

854
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:19,872
Enterprise in Byram

855
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:21,408
It's a good conversation to have

856
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:24,224
Okay well let's not skip ahead to that

857
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,064
Conversation let's talk about what you guys actually have done let's start with

858
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,088
Patient rooms

859
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:32,928
First of all just to say I keep going back

860
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,280
What does it do to say we've got this high speed

861
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:38,048
Robots

862
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:39,328
Non-clinical net

863
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:43,936
Networking once we started using that phrase in our own heads is it okay that opens up a lot of opportunity

864
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:45,216
In that same

865
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:48,800
That we were originally prototyping some voice stuff around when I

866
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:52,128
How do we get madhumeh connected to our Network more

867
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:55,456
And became this design-driven project who he said

868
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:56,992
How could we give somebody

869
00:33:58,016 --> 00:34:00,064
Device an interface to do two things

870
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:00,832
Let's get

871
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:01,856
Real-time feedback

872
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:03,904
So if something is going well

873
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:04,928
We're not going well

874
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:06,464
We know in the moment

875
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,488
So we wanted to have this

876
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:08,512
This way of getting

877
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:10,048
Real-time feedback

878
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:15,936
There's also something else really powerful as we were interviewing patients and families in

879
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:17,984
That deep design-driven works

880
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:24,128
We'll just have to learn what's wrong we can give people the tools in the services in the ability to control

881
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,176
And have more empowerment

882
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,456
Turns out when you get

883
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:32,320
Choice and give them control that leads to more dignity and there's this incredible halo effect

884
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:33,088
Comes with it

885
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:35,648
And so we were setting out from this path we said

886
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:40,000
The thing that makes sense is some kind of tablet interface and we didn't know if that was going to be like

887
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:44,608
Custom thing built into the bed that we would build me a box that up in

888
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:47,680
Belittle 3D printed version above of an iPad holder that

889
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:51,264
Baby clip window bed stand and ended up finding kind of fortuitously

890
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,800
Is this incredible

891
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:53,568
Partner

892
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:55,104
Who's a startup company

893
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:58,688
Makes these tablets and custom interfaces for hotels

894
00:34:59,200 --> 00:34:59,712
So you're

895
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:03,552
Checking into a hotel you walk in your room and they're sitting next to the bed stand is a

896
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:04,320
Is a tablet

897
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:06,624
It says welcome Stacy to your room

898
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:13,024
Can you tap it and you can say I want room service at this time I need a new pillow I need an Uber to come pick me up and it

899
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,352
Knows which room you're in in so it'll buys you when you were gets there

900
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:22,752
It has Pandora built-in inside had some entertainment stuff and I had to delete order Postmates and headed Bill directly to your room and he said

901
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:27,616
If we trying to coat our own version of this I will take us a year to not even do half as men

902
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:29,664
Many things is they figured out how to do at a hotel

903
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,432
So

904
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:32,736
We said would you ever come work in a hospital

905
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:34,784
And they said we don't know anything about Healthcare it

906
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,832
It terrifies us I know it's highly regulated

907
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:38,112
By the way

908
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:40,160
We can get our device on your network

909
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:46,560
Working me Centro that's where the magic comes in we're a team that can help you Shepherd you through so that was the thing that really became

910
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:49,632
Our biggest use case was he's tablets in patient rooms

911
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:54,752
To give people the ability to give us real-time feedback and have control over their experience

912
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:56,544
And it kind of snowballed from there

913
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,080
So you got this tablet

914
00:35:59,104 --> 00:35:59,872
One of the things that we

915
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:02,176
We talked about previously was this idea

916
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:04,224
That you are not solving

917
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:05,504
Medical

918
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,784
Problems

919
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,344
We talked about iot and hospitals is being

920
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,368
Part of patient care

921
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:13,440
But what you guys are actually doing is taking the load off

922
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:14,208
From nurses

923
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:16,000
Spike reading the side Network

924
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:17,280
Requesting

925
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:22,144
Yeah that's exactly it in the clinical care is in

926
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:22,912
Credit report

927
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:25,728
And their people with high levels of domain expertise

928
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:28,288
It ought to be able to focus on just doing that

929
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:29,568
But there is so much more

930
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:30,592
About being a patient

931
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:36,736
It gets not being able to do the things that you would normally do during your day in the grief you might feel of having

932
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:38,784
The ability taken away from you. Because

933
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:39,552
Cuz of the hospital

934
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:41,344
Just your illness

935
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,368
Air condition taking it away

936
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:44,672
And so giving the separate Channel

937
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:45,696
To have more

938
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:47,232
Controlling your life whether it's

939
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:51,328
And we look at reset if somebody's not on a restricted diet why can't they order Postmates

940
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:56,448
Why can't they get their favorite food delivered if your 2 days out of a knee replacement you're really in pain

941
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,728
Face but you're not

942
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:58,752
Appreciably sick

943
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:00,544
When I get your favorite meal

944
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:02,848
And little things like that

945
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:04,384
It's not clinical care

946
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,664
But it is care for the patient

947
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,432
In a way

948
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:08,224
It has a profound effect

949
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:12,064
It's beyond just what we might think of this country or service in a hotel

950
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,600
You mail the other part of it is

951
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:17,952
We're taking that burden off the nurses so they can focus on the parts of the job that

952
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:20,768
They find really rewarding that's the calling of being a nurse

953
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,840
It's the bedside care stuff if it's a win-win for everybody

954
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:26,400
So in the patient room experience

955
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:27,936
It feels like we've covered a lot of that

956
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:29,216
Now you guys have also

957
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:32,288
Done some things inside the hospital with

958
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:33,568
I think it was kiosk

959
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,896
Maybe there's a slack integration somewhere in here

960
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:39,712
Outside

961
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:40,480
The patient room

962
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:43,296
Banneker it'll tell you started in the page

963
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:45,856
And it just kind of blew up in a good way from there

964
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:47,904
We saw we recognize that if there's a number of

965
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,184
People because they might just

966
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,720
Did you sick or tired they don't want rap

967
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:53,280
Turns out it is not a Jew

968
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:58,144
We have plenty of older adults who are every bit it's not more tablet savvy

969
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,192
Then younger people

970
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:02,240
Some people

971
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:03,264
Just want to push a button

972
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,032
Swiss re

973
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:06,592
How can we create a non-clinical called

974
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:08,640
I want to push a button to have somebody come

975
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:12,480
And that person then we'll go get me food or get me a blanket or get me something

976
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:16,064
Like a newspaper we look around you said we need a Wi-Fi button

977
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:18,880
In the Amazon dash button

978
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:19,904
Was perfect

979
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,952
How are we going to know

980
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:23,232
If somebody pushes that button

981
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:29,632
Are technologist on our team said no problem I will give each button the unique identifier you will know which room it to sign to

982
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:31,680
And it'll peanuts in Slack

983
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:36,032
Are we going to know who to pick any sorry we're going to create a Google spreadsheet

984
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:38,336
And my code goes and checks

985
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:39,360
The spreadsheet says

986
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:43,712
Kind of who's on call amazing are quotes but we all take turns being on call

987
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:46,528
And so it's somebody in the room push that button

988
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:48,320
It says okay right now in the spreadsheet

989
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,344
Nick's on call

990
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,624
I get a pic on Slack

991
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,392
Everybody

992
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:52,672
I can see it and it says Nick

993
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:54,720
Patient in room so and so

994
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:56,000
Is requesting services

995
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:59,840
And then we get to go answer that neat and then we started saying what where else can we use the

996
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:02,656
These buttons and this is the cool part about having a

997
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:03,936
An integrated team

998
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:05,728
Arlene engineers said

999
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:09,312
Are you kidding me this is data collection in a way we've never been able to do before

1000
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:13,152
Today started taking Moline buttons and mocking up of the IP pot

1001
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:14,176
And mocking up

1002
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:16,480
Ways to collect data from a patient

1003
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:17,760
And the staff

1004
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:18,784
One of the first things they do

1005
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,064
It was made a little kiosk

1006
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:21,600
In our x-ray department

1007
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:22,368
It said

1008
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:23,392
Were you running late

1009
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:29,792
If so why in one of the buttons is labeled traffic one of them is I got lost one of them is Mickey

1010
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:32,352
The other something like that

1011
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:33,376
Play more like

1012
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:38,496
Because you're late you're not going get your point and it was more like let us understand what were the barriers to getting here

1013
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:40,032
So we can start to fix them

1014
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:41,824
And every time we hit one of those buttons

1015
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,384
It logs an entry into a Google spreadsheet

1016
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:46,176
And concise on Slack

1017
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:48,480
It's amazing to watch this data

1018
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:49,760
Coming in real time

1019
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:51,808
And it's one of those things that

1020
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:53,344
Healthcare

1021
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:55,648
Traditionally doesn't have that

1022
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:56,928
Skillset internally

1023
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,208
We're really good

1024
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,512
Really complex it systems

1025
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:03,328
But this idea taking something and

1026
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:09,216
Kind of quickly cobbling together a little bit of python a little bit Google API a little bit of it eight of us

1027
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:12,032
And a network that's designed for non clinical care

1028
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:14,080
Made it happen in hours

1029
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:14,848
And

1030
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:16,384
You can really valuable really quickly

1031
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:18,688
That's awesome and

1032
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:21,504
In addition to doing all this you've also

1033
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:24,320
When someone's on call for like

1034
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:25,600
Patient care needs

1035
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:30,208
Sometimes I think you said some of those are met by like interns so is by your staff

1036
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:33,792
You've also brought that out to other people in the

1037
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:37,120
I love these Ripple effects that

1038
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:40,704
Can happen when you move really quickly

1039
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,544
We say it's how do you go from years to weeks or Days Inn

1040
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:46,848
What's next

1041
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:50,432
We're getting pretty good at answering a lot of these patient care requests and

1042
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:51,712
He said who else would benefit

1043
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:54,016
We realized it was filling our souls

1044
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:58,880
Holes in a way that was really special it was giving us a reason to be in a patient's space

1045
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:00,416
And to be of service to the patient

1046
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:02,208
We looked around and we said

1047
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:03,232
There is a

1048
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:07,072
A small percentage about 20% of people who work in the hospital who are not clinical

1049
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:08,864
Or his main job duties

1050
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:09,888
Play but all of this

1051
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:11,424
People talk about coming in to help

1052
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,704
All care for calling

1053
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,544
And we started to Seroquel how could we onboard them and so we asked a couple of our

1054
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,568
Executive

1055
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:19,360
Alex if they'd be willing to take call

1056
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:21,152
We added to the Google spreadsheet

1057
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:25,504
And wish we had a prototype that so we hold their hands and we had to Shadow them so they never

1058
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,064
Garfield

1059
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:29,088
Houston

1060
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:31,136
To delivering Care at the bedside but

1061
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:32,416
Bape head for the same response

1062
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:33,184
Don't swear

1063
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,488
It's instead of going in in feeling

1064
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:40,096
I feel like I'm going in and being of service to somebody and I hope it has a

1065
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:41,120
Cultural impact

1066
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:43,168
That we haven't even started to see yet

1067
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:44,448
Okay

1068
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:48,544
What have your Executives what's changed because

1069
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,872
People are interacting with patients in it

1070
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:52,895
I am not saying that

1071
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:54,175
People don't care but

1072
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:55,711
It's very different to make

1073
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:57,247
Decision

1074
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:58,527
Running a hospital

1075
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:01,087
Versus fetching blankets

1076
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:05,439
And in one of them had that exact moment of okay I followed this project Nick on paper

1077
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:07,999
We were unsure about this it thing

1078
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:14,399
And we've been looking at the data coming in on this real-time feedback and then holy cow I had no idea I was

1079
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:19,775
Went and delivered a warm blanket in this it changed my whole day and I had no idea

1080
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:21,055
I was looking at this

1081
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:23,103
Is a system is a data thing

1082
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:25,151
It's not it's much more than that

1083
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:30,271
It's this whole week in fact it's where we going to tournaments this whole non-clinical ecosystem of care

1084
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:31,551
So what do you want

1085
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:33,087
Wow

1086
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:35,647
We're piloting a couple things that feel

1087
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:39,743
Kind of pretty practically Within Reach so particularly in

1088
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:42,047
The outpatient Cancer Center

1089
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:43,839
And if you're going through chemotherapy

1090
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:47,423
For cancer or you might go through infusion therapy for some other conditions

1091
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:48,959
You might sit in a room

1092
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:50,239
From anywhere from

1093
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:51,519
228 hours

1094
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:55,359
The average of 46 hours a year ago

1095
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:57,919
Outpatient infusion rooms on credit

1096
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:59,455
They private rooms

1097
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:04,831
I have recliners that turn into sleepers and each one has a private TV and each one has a view of the outside with

1098
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:06,623
Greenery and by the end of the day

1099
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:09,439
You're sitting there for eight hours in the middle of the day in

1100
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:13,535
Daytime TV is still Judge Judy and cooking shows and you can only watch so many of it

1101
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:17,887
I have nothing

1102
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:18,655
But love for judge

1103
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:21,983
But there's only so much of that you're also reminded

1104
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:23,519
You're F Where You Are

1105
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:29,151
Right you're being pumped full of medicine that may cause you discomfort in

1106
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:30,431
A lot of success

1107
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:32,479
Some of this stuff in that setting

1108
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,527
Because again it's just giving somebody

1109
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:36,063
Just a choice a binary choice

1110
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:38,367
Do you want to watch TV or do you want to watch net

1111
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:39,391
When is taboo

1112
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:41,695
People will often just look through nest

1113
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:44,767
Because it's a choice

1114
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:45,535
Cast in every room

1115
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:53,215
It's starting to turn a couple of those rooms into basically Smart Home

1116
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:53,983
Rooms

1117
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:59,103
And getting people full control just like they have it home but with somebody like standing there and showing them

1118
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:01,151
How you can change the lights here's how you can

1119
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:03,711
But your favorite music on it's a really cool thing in

1120
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:06,271
Is

1121
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:07,551
Playing around with VR

1122
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:08,575
So

1123
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:11,391
We said alright let's get a couple VR headsets we have done this before

1124
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:12,159
Before different

1125
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:18,559
Setting where we are talking to a patient in a room and they said it's not that I mind being here I don't mind being interviewed about how you could

1126
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:20,863
Improve my experience I just don't want to be here

1127
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,655
Anywhere But Here

1128
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:24,447
Where would you want to be

1129
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:27,263
And she said they grew up on a Seaside town

1130
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:28,031
Croatia

1131
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:30,847
One of my colleagues said I've been there I know that

1132
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:32,383
And so we went down and got

1133
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:34,175
A Google cardboard

1134
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:34,943
And

1135
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:35,711
Aspera phone

1136
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:38,527
And use Google Street View and pulled up the

1137
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:39,807
The same town

1138
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:40,575
Took it back

1139
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:41,343
To her and said

1140
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:43,391
Would you would you look through this

1141
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:48,255
And she said I don't really want to do anything technical related in simple just try it and she sat there for

1142
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:51,839
For 10 minutes looking around single I know that restaurant

1143
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:54,399
I know that oh my gosh I know that that

1144
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:55,167
Little shop in

1145
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:57,727
It was this really profound emotional experience

1146
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:58,751
For 10 minutes

1147
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:00,543
She wasn't in the hospital room

1148
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:02,335
She was in this town she grown up in

1149
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:05,919
Wait a little while and then now we took

1150
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:10,015
Tianjin got some VR kits in first thing we thought we would do is get people like

1151
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:11,039
Guided meditation

1152
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:12,831
Mother going through chemotherapy because

1153
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:16,671
Because you're going through chemo you must be fragile you're probably queasy and

1154
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:19,231
And we want to give you something to be mindful about

1155
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:20,511
It turns out

1156
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:21,791
People want to play games

1157
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:25,887
There's a great Vibe there's a bow and arrow demo

1158
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:28,191
People have more fun with that bow and arrow demo

1159
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:28,959
Then

1160
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:31,519
Anything else so the next thing we try

1161
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:34,079
We're just beginning of prototype it is

1162
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:35,615
What would happen if you had a surrogate

1163
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:37,407
So where in Washington DC

1164
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:39,455
We're full of incredible Monument

1165
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:43,295
There a lot of still very beautiful parts of beautiful things about this city

1166
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:48,671
So what if somebody was only to go down to the National Mall and walk around with a life VR camera

1167
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:49,695
360 camera

1168
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:50,719
Envy your search

1169
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:56,351
And you could lay in your bed and say I really want to go to the Lincoln Memorial I really want to go see the washing I want you to go in that museum

1170
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:57,887
And we're just

1171
00:45:58,143 --> 00:46:02,495
It's not even going to Monument maybe it's like go to your favorite restaurant with your family

1172
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:05,055
If you're going to be happy in the hospital but your family is out

1173
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:07,871
I do need the regular Friday night thing when I'm done with them

1174
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:14,527
Basically borrowing a terrible internet connection

1175
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:15,551
This over

1176
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:16,319
Over the mile

1177
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:17,855
Right yeah

1178
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:21,951
Transmitter

1179
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:23,743
Cool so how do you guys

1180
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:26,303
Pay for all this cuz what you're talking about is

1181
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:27,071
Not cheap

1182
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:28,607
We're lucky in a couple ways

1183
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:29,375
1 is

1184
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:30,143
We're

1185
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:30,911
Part of

1186
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:34,495
The heavy very small part of the operating budget

1187
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:36,031
The hospital with less than

1188
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:39,103
.01% of the operating budget

1189
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:39,871
Which is a

1190
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:42,943
A pretty small amount compared to things like life-saving

1191
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:43,711
Equipment

1192
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:45,503
All the stuff that goes into clinical care

1193
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:51,903
Have a little bit of philanthropic support but the be honest answer is a lot of this stuff it's expensive from a consumer

1194
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:53,951
But it's not that Out Of Reach

1195
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:54,719
From

1196
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:56,767
For prototyping in this kind of setting

1197
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:57,791
So to get

1198
00:46:58,047 --> 00:46:59,327
Philips Hue starter kit

1199
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:01,375
To get a VR kit

1200
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:03,679
The ark it's one of the more expensive things we buy

1201
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:05,727
But mostly our costs are

1202
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:06,495
That hottie

1203
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:10,335
Turns out to be a very expensive Endeavor to try some of this stuff

1204
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:11,615
And if it has a return

1205
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:18,271
The return in one can of little Healthcare nerdy Nuance is our reimbursement what we get paid

1206
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:20,319
Is is affected by

1207
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:21,343
Patient experience

1208
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:22,623
If

1209
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:24,671
A lot of patients have a negative experience

1210
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:25,951
We lose money on

1211
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:27,999
And patience have a really good experience

1212
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:29,279
We stand to benefit

1213
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:33,119
From that and so we look at it as saying all we got to do is affect that

1214
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:33,887
Needle

1215
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:35,935
A little bit and wheel offset our cost

1216
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:36,703
Several times over

1217
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:37,727
And have you

1218
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:40,287
We're trying to measure up for the first couple years we

1219
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:42,591
You can put off measuring it we knew that

1220
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:43,359
We would

1221
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:49,759
We were going to have to be temporarily lost in the wilderness to figure out what it is we're really good at what it is we can do

1222
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:53,087
And so we're just at the point now starting to pull that data and then saying

1223
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:54,879
Because we did these things

1224
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:56,159
We affected

1225
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:58,463
The patient experience measurement in this way

1226
00:47:58,975 --> 00:47:59,999
And that's worth XML

1227
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:01,791
It's on early days

1228
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:04,351
Let's get back to this this idea

1229
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:05,119
You're bigger

1230
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:06,655
And people are paying attention

1231
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:12,031
What are the worries that you have to dress with your corporate officers with your it

1232
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:14,079
Do you have to make this enterprise-class

1233
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:17,407
Yeah this is one of those places where

1234
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:18,943
I have a foot in both camps

1235
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:19,711
And

1236
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:20,479
The

1237
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:21,503
Optimistic

1238
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:22,783
Enthusiastic country

1239
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:24,575
Rebellious sometimes a little

1240
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:25,855
Rogar Maverick

1241
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:27,135
Innovator in me

1242
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:33,535
Wants to go hundred miles an hour against every roadblock and every Norm in in question all the things that we are conditioned

1243
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:40,703
Career

1244
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:47,615
The last thing so Hopkins is one of the top three Health Systems in the world and our patient data

1245
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:48,639
Includes

1246
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:49,919
High level

1247
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:52,991
Research National and international level research data

1248
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:54,271
Includes

1249
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:57,087
Hundreds of thousands of patients treated a year

1250
00:48:57,343 --> 00:48:58,111
It is in

1251
00:48:58,367 --> 00:48:59,135
Credibly value

1252
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:01,439
Not just from our clinical you stamp

1253
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:02,463
Magic imagine

1254
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:03,231
Target

1255
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:04,767
Adida breech for us

1256
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:05,535
With

1257
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:11,935
Be incredibly expensive from a regulatory fine standpoint it would be it would be caustic to the organization's

1258
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:13,471
Reputation in

1259
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:16,287
Frankly it's also we have a moral obligation to protect

1260
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:17,567
Patients privacy

1261
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:18,335
People's privacy

1262
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:21,407
We have to kind of balance that line and say

1263
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:22,687
We think there's no

1264
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:25,503
Rainbow putting this tablet in front of somebody

1265
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:27,551
Itani non-clinical net worth

1266
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:29,599
We think it's relatively safe

1267
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:31,903
But if we're going to roll it out Housewives

1268
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:33,439
The cross every bed in the hospital

1269
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:35,487
And then maybe to every hospital

1270
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:36,511
In our system

1271
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:40,863
And then hopefully get other hospitals to follow that are works all open source we want everyone else to

1272
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:42,399
Try the same things were trying

1273
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:44,703
If it works great if it fails let's learn together

1274
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:46,239
So we're going to push that model

1275
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:47,263
We got to make sure it's

1276
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:48,287
Free

1277
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:50,079
And it's great to have

1278
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:53,151
DARPA research on RT and it's great to have somebody who says

1279
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:56,991
I do pin testing against government government hardened systems

1280
00:49:57,503 --> 00:49:58,783
I can do this on our Network

1281
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:02,879
To ask the question of

1282
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:06,719
How can we in this is this is the way we ask it how might we

1283
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:10,303
Innovate securely and innovate with our Enterprise partner

1284
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:13,375
But make sure that it's a partnership so that we're

1285
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:14,399
Valuing

1286
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:16,191
The risks and

1287
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:18,751
Their conservative point of view in their valuing

1288
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:19,519
