Heaven

36
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:30,112
Let's get started do rocks and hugs and botnets oh my

37
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:31,904
Actually we are talking about

38
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:33,184
Security

39
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,000
Because every good home automation

40
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:38,560
Company knows they've got to get into security

41
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:41,120
We've had Lexi's SmartThings partnering with

42
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:41,888
With ATT

43
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:42,912
We've had

44
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:43,680
Ring

45
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:44,448
We had

46
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,216
Next

47
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:46,240
And now

48
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,008
We've got

49
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:48,032
Amazon

50
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,312
Looks like it's getting a

51
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,104
Into the space with a grin

52
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:51,872
New

53
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:52,640
Security camera

54
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:53,664
What do you think it is

55
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,200
Actually we should talk about what it is

56
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:55,968
Before we ask

57
00:01:56,992 --> 00:02:03,136
Yeah so this is a smart move by Amazon they're offering actually to new things and they work together one is

58
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:05,184
Is there new webcam which

59
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,536
Just cause 1 1999 and we'll talk about some add-ons that you can get

60
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:12,864
Options you can add on for that and then they also have Amazon

61
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,984
Key which is a way to use a connected lock or selling you the lock

62
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,312
And that will allow you to let Amazon

63
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:22,336
Prime deliveries

64
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,360
Right in your house

65
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,896
What do I think of that

66
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:27,456
I even work from home so I don't think I would

67
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,480
Need that

68
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:33,600
But I could see why people in the 37 Metro areas that thrilling us out in

69
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:38,208
Some of them might like this I probably would have a camera with the key

70
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:40,512
Amazon Keys what they're calling us little bundle

71
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:41,792
Just so I could see

72
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:44,096
The people that come in and deliver

73
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:46,144
Smartly Amazon also partnering with

74
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,264
Bunch of their home services so if you use Merry Maids or Rover or whatever

75
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,080
You can allow those people in your house as well as much as

76
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:55,872
And I

77
00:02:56,128 --> 00:03:00,736
I feel like this is a totally logical extension you can only actually get the key

78
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:02,272
Integration with Amazon

79
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:04,064
I'm Prime so the idea is

80
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,600
Yes Amazon's just

81
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:07,392
Shipping stuff left and right

82
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,928
Do you you put more stuff

83
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:10,976
Through Amazon Prime because why wouldn't you

84
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:13,792
Assure yourself that never

85
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:17,632
Rockets lost this is also good for Amazon because you have to deal less

86
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:18,656
Package theft

87
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,448
Shrinkage or leakage

88
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,776
Then it's a package I don't know in the retail thing it's shrinkage

89
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,848
Can I call it fast

90
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:28,384
Alright theft

91
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:31,456
So this is

92
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:32,736
It makes sense

93
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:36,576
If I were a security company that's hosting on AWS

94
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:38,368
And a lot of them are I might kind of

95
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:40,160
Be like yo Amazon

96
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,184
What are you doing

97
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,208
This is our busy

98
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:44,256
But that's kind of Amazon

99
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:46,048
Cross to bear especially with

100
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,608
I want to buy Whole Foods all the retailers are like

101
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:49,632
Let's get out of this

102
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:53,472
Yes so just so folks understand the locks are actually

103
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:59,104
Existing locks you could already buy but they are two of them Yale and Kwikset are working with Amazon

104
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,944
Ski-in home kit cost to 4999 for the lock

105
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,504
And also that includes the Amazon Cloud cam

106
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,320
You're getting the whole bundle there for $250

107
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:12,672
There's also free Professional installation which I think it's very smart of Amazon to offer

108
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:13,952
Yeah but it's okay

109
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:14,976
Everyone stays

110
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:15,744
PSA

111
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,536
Install your own lock it doesn't take

112
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:19,583
I put a video up on the side yard

113
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,351
It's not hard

114
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,119
And

115
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,423
Kevin you came up with this brilliant idea with

116
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:24,703
Is probably accurate

117
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,471
My lock

118
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:26,751
Currently cuz I have a quick

119
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,287
Set Z-Wave lock

120
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,823
I don't think that's going to work with this

121
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,359
It definitely

122
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,127
Is not

123
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,199
In my opinion it's the reason I say I say definitely in my

124
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,991
Definitely in your opinion

125
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,015
All right

126
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,039
Definitely not

127
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,575
The reason I don't think it will work

128
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:43,647
Oreck is because I look at the Kwikset

129
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,463
Lock that is included with the cloud cam

130
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,487
And the in-home

131
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:51,327
Kitty cat and that model does come in two flavors

132
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,351
One with Z-Wave

133
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:54,911
One with the sticky I have a Z-Wave on also

134
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,703
The reason I don't think is going to work is

135
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:01,311
Because the Amazon Echo Plus which is a hub does not support

136
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,079
Z-Wave

137
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,103
So

138
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:06,687
I presume Amazon a smartly using the zigbee once we can work with their hub

139
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,967
Stubs not required

140
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:09,247
You can have any other hub

141
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,527
That's fine but I just

142
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,063
Leaning towards it not working

143
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,623
They have a new stamp works with Matt Ma

144
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,671
On this as well so we'll see if it was lock

145
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:17,439
Fox github

146
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:20,767
If that's works with Matt Emmaus

147
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:21,535
Really into

148
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,583
Ectopic so I've talked to

149
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,375
Listen to Philip Rivers and this stamp is

150
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,399
Is relatively new

151
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:28,447
And it's something that Amazon has

152
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,471
Pushing

153
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:30,239
Partners

154
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,007
Affairs

155
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,031
To work with

156
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:36,383
Amazon Echo Show side what it means is your

157
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,175
To get that sticker you're going to have to

158
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,455
To show your video

159
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,479
It's on the

160
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,759
Show

161
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,039
Some partners are like

162
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:45,087
And some of them are actually

163
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,879
Concerned that this is Amazon's

164
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,415
To get more data from

165
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,207
React be true

166
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,023
It could be it right now some of them are like

167
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,583
You know do I really need a works with Madam a sticker I have a

168
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,607
Skill that's fine

169
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:57,375
That's efficient

170
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,911
This looks like a little bit more than I want

171
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:03,519
How to take on right now so this is kind of an interesting there's a behind-the-scenes thing happening

172
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:05,055
With Amazon and it

173
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:05,823
Its partners

174
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:10,943
Well and that I totally understand on the other side of the equation from a consumer stand

175
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:11,967
1.5

176
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:12,991
Showing this little

177
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:16,575
Works with Madam a it gets rid of the whole conversation of

178
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,343
Which radios

179
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:19,903
Zigbee Z-Wave you don't need that on there anymore

180
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,951
Confusing keep on saying what works and what doesn't

181
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:22,719
Kind of like

182
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,999
Dunkin logo

183
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:26,815
So I think it's rather clever from a consumer-facing

184
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,351
Totally agree

185
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:29,375
All right

186
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,679
So this is Amazon's move into

187
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:33,471
Security I wonder if we'll see them pop out

188
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,007
Sensors later on our part

189
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:39,615
Week

190
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:41,151
Wink has a new

191
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,431
Security bundle

192
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,711
For $200

193
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:44,735
It is

194
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,015
Smart Security is

195
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:50,367
Kevin as a wink owner are you excited this has

196
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,391
To open close

197
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:55,231
Got a siren and it has a

198
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:55,999
Camera light

199
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:56,767
Looking

200
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:57,791
Motion detector

201
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,071
It is not actually

202
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,119
And all this is for

203
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:01,887
199

204
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,959
Did your 499

205
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:05,727
$500

206
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:10,847
Yeah so it's interesting that they're bundling all this and

207
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:15,455
Also they're not requiring or adding on any monthly fees this is definitely for

208
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:19,807
Somebody wants security on their own they want to monitor their own stuff through their apps and whatnot

209
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:22,623
So I think it's clever of work to do I don't

210
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,671
Really need some of these things but

211
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,951
Let me grab some of the

212
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:28,255
Door window sensors to give them a try

213
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:31,327
The next thing is Wink works with so many things I still

214
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,095
SmartThings

215
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:32,863
Of course

216
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,911
I already have some of these products just

217
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,959
You know there's a way prices you can get anywhere

218
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,775
Good for first time buyers

219
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,055
Percent that seems to be a big

220
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:43,871
Keane everybody's aiming towards first time buyers

221
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:46,943
Yes I think that's actually why

222
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,503
The Amazon Echo Hub that we talked about a minute ago

223
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,551
Doesn't matter too many people that it doesn't

224
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,319
Work with

225
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,599
Z-Wave because

226
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:56,671
It's not meant for people who already have a lot of Z-Wave products

227
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:59,743
It's meant for people getting started in Smart Homes

228
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,535
As with this wink Lookout B

229
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,559
I would argue that

230
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,327
Patterson

231
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,655
And we'll never know

232
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,191
You'll never know

233
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,215
Good for that

234
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:11,007
So yes I agree with you

235
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,031
I think

236
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:13,311
Are some interesting pricing here at

237
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,335
The other thing I would

238
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,615
Be interested with is

239
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,383
Other than

240
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,687
Security I've actually tried to mess with

241
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:19,711
Emotion sensors

242
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,735
Pulled motionsense

243
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,527
Answers into my Linksys

244
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,647
I was got a little frustrated because they could do open close but a lot of these sensors have other readings

245
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:30,207
That wink would never pick up so

246
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:30,975
I'm curious

247
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:32,255
How

248
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:35,327
In adding these if wink is going to expand the

249
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,351
The capabilities for

250
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,119
For all of it

251
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,191
Because there are definitely some things that I would like to

252
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,727
I have existing

253
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,775
Window sensors that I would love to add to

254
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:44,799
Weak sister

255
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:51,199
Yeah no I totally understand that and I've seen what you're talking about any depends on the product

256
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:56,831
So I don't know if it's an all-or-nothing thing with wink I've actually gotten temperature and other things from motion sensors

257
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,367
It does depend on the product

258
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:00,671
It's basically if wink is done

259
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:01,695
Wink and

260
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,231
Device manufacturer

261
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:06,815
Exactly

262
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,863
So also on the security front

263
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,143
People have been asking

264
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:12,959
About this this is crazy and I have been

265
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:15,007
Looking under rocks for all the bad things

266
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:19,615
This is a camera for $20

267
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:20,639
From

268
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,919
A company called wise labs

269
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,199
Actually based in

270
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:23,967
Seattle

271
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:27,295
I am so suspicious Kevin will tell you that I liked was

272
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:29,343
I was clicking through on the terms and condition for the

273
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,623
The price

274
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,695
Home theater

275
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,975
Website somewhere

276
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:36,255
Just for entertainment purpose

277
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:39,071
But they don't appear to be at least

278
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,143
So the camera actually the hardware looks really good

279
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,447
I do I'm surprised

280
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,983
And your skepticism is

281
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:50,591
Well founded I'll say that right up front but I don't see any morning flag cic nice Hardware

282
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:54,431
I see a 1080p camera full HD night vision two-way audio

283
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,711
It's $20

284
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,247
It has an app

285
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:01,855
That will alert you with motion and what not depending on how you have it set up it has an

286
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:05,439
MicroSD card slot if you want continuous recording on your own which I think is

287
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,207
Great

288
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:08,767
Because if you control that but it will work with a

289
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,071
Cloud services running on AWS

290
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:16,447
And for no extra fee will actually record 10 to 15 second Clips whenever it sees motion and whatnot

291
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,007
My issue or maybe why it's

292
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:22,079
So inexpensive it doesn't integrate with any

293
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:22,847
Cubs everything

294
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:25,919
This is strictly I got a camera cameras

295
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:32,063
And I use the app that comes with it to get my alerts and so on and so forth so it's kind of limited in that respect maybe you can work with

296
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:34,111
This the night or something but

297
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,159
I don't know for $20 I may actually

298
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:37,695
Grab one or two or three of these

299
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,463
Too late

300
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:40,255
I just bought one Kevin

301
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,327
But it's on backorder

302
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,119
The okay so you didn't buy the last one

303
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:46,655
Okay

304
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:47,679
Keepin On

305
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:48,703
So yes

306
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,983
We're going to buy it

307
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,031
And tell you what we

308
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,823
Please take and if I hate it

309
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,615
Perhaps I'll even give it away in the

310
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:57,663
All right

311
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,943
Let's talk about

312
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,735
Oh that's talk about noon

313
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:01,503
Guys

314
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:05,855
This is very exciting this is a startup I actually broke the news about the start of

315
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:06,879
Like a month ago

316
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,415
Gansett actually

317
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:11,487
Yeah the CEO is Eric Charlton who is

318
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,023
Before I had a business

319
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,047
At nest

320
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,839
And there's a bunch of Nest folks there

321
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,375
And this is a lighting

322
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,399
Smart lighting

323
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,423
That is

324
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,727
Actually really interesting looking

325
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,007
You guys know that I love

326
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:23,775
Love lights

327
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:27,359
And what his company is done is they've created a

328
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,895
Light switch that you install

329
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:29,919
And it has

330
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:30,687
Croisette

331
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,455
Has a couple thing

332
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,479
1

333
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,247
It says

334
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:37,599
Oh hey what are the lights in this room so it detects the bulbs and what they're capable of

335
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:41,183
Once it's installed and then it also has presets

336
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,719
Burberry is like relax

337
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:44,767
And daylight and other

338
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:45,791
Three settings

339
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:47,583
And then it automatically hand

340
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,351
Is all of that

341
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:49,631
I think this is

342
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:50,655
Really interesting

343
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:54,495
Because as a person who's invested in lots of crazy lighting

344
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,775
Schemes colored balls

345
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:59,103
LEDs of various Hues and warm temperatures

346
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,127
Whites

347
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,407
So many

348
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,175
Light switches

349
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,455
I can tell you

350
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:05,247
Most people do not want

351
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,295
They just want to hit a button

352
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,575
And have like

353
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,599
A couple options

354
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,367
It look good in there

355
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,415
And that's what this is promising to do

356
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:18,815
Yeah that's I think the big drug you know a lot of people don't want to go through the rigmarole as you said of setting up different scenes

357
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,351
I don't really know what's up

358
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,655
Good lighting setup you know so if these are

359
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:27,519
No professionally-designed you know maybe they're going to just wow you I don't know but this interesting approach

360
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,311
It's actually a common one

361
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:33,151
So there's a startup actually in Austin Texas that works on super high-end

362
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,223
It's called ketra and they actually make

363
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,015
Crazy awesome lights

364
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,039
I would love to have them in

365
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:40,575
But I am not that way

366
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:43,391
And it's actually also something that like a Lutron

367
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,927
If you get like a professional

368
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:49,279
Install Nautica set up at the the fancy Lutron if you get that they'll have

369
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,047
Lighting design

370
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,327
Program the

371
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:55,423
So basically it's bringing that idea of having a

372
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,447
Professional lighting

373
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:58,239
Installer dude come into your house at

374
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,263
The program your stuff

375
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:00,543
Except

376
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,567
This company is going

377
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,335
To do it with

378
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:04,639
Is it $399

379
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,407
Piece of hardware

380
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,431
Yes

381
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,455
And the package can

382
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,223
Pain

383
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:11,039
Will you get one room director switch

384
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,575
Two extension switches

385
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,367
And three wall plates

386
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,671
For 399

387
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:21,023
99 if you just wanted room director switch which is the main smarts that's

388
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,839
199 99 storage room you going to add

389
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:27,935
Cost of two hundred bucks and then each extension switch for that room is 99

390
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:31,007
9 so it's not an expensive by any means but

391
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,287
There's a definite convenience.

392
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,591
Oh yeah and again

393
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,127
If I look at all that I've spent

394
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,663
If I look at my Hue bulbs

395
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,943
Four of those at 6

396
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:39,711
D-box

397
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:44,063
240 bucks so I'm halfway there and then I still had to buy some

398
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,855
I did install a switch that

399
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,135
Kept it on for me

400
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:49,183
So that's another fifty bucks

401
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:50,975
So now I'm at 300 and

402
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,767
I'm still doing the work of program

403
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:58,655
Price put it all into perspective and the master switch you put in your room

404
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,191
And then the extension switch

405
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,727
They talk to it via some

406
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:02,751
Proprietary wire

407
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,567
Of course they do

408
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:09,663
And that

409
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,431
Controlling

410
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,991
Is it like a three-way set up or is it like

411
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,015
All around the house

412
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:18,111
Build-A-Bear focus on room so you maybe you could have like

413
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:22,719
1 Portico master switch control in two rooms if you want the same Lighting in that room

414
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:24,767
But it seems to me like you're going to want

415
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:27,327
One of these in every room 101 master switch

416
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:36,287
Yeah alright this doesn't include both people should be very clear that does include both but it works

417
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,823
Text with regular ball

418
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,127
Your bulbs do not need to

419
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:42,175
In fact it's probably better if they

420
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:42,943
Arcsmart

421
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:46,271
Because a grief I test these things

422
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,063
You don't need to SmartThings

423
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:50,623
Vying for control of your lights cuz

424
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,391
They're going to fight

425
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:54,719
Smart thing plus smart thing equals dumb things because yeah they fight

426
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:57,023
Terrible why can't they just get along

427
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,071
Alright other quick cool gadgets

428
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,119
Linkee which is a

429
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,399
Touch screen

430
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:05,215
Smart panel thing for Google assist

431
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,775
Reminds me exactly of the nucleus

432
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,311
Which was a touch screen

433
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:11,615
Smart panel intercom system thing for

434
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:12,639
Madam

435
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:15,967
And it kind of reminds me of the Echo Show and that it is

436
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:17,503
Very

437
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,527
Attractive

438
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:22,879
I see why you're saying that it does look like a mini

439
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,159
Echo Show to me

440
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:28,767
Because it's a 5-inch touch screen so small and it's got the speaker Grill along the bottom

441
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,071
I'm a very small iMac

442
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,095
To me because it's the

443
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,631
That black and silver look to it

444
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,679
So you write it works with Google Assistant

445
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,727
It has a far field microphone array

446
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,775
WiFi zigbee and Bluetooth

447
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:40,799
Wireless built

448
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,079
10 +

449
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:45,663
Yeah I mean it's only interesting to me because it's the first

450
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,711
Google Assistant item with a

451
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,479
A touch screen

452
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:51,039
Answer my phone it's Unique

453
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:54,623
Wakes up your phone while I've said that Furlong were carrying all these things right around

454
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:56,927
But that's okay

455
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:59,487
And it comes with an app so you can still integrate

456
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:03,071
In all that it's $150 it's on Indiegogo we should be very clear about that

457
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:07,167
It's a project on Indiegogo early bird special start at $99

458
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:13,567
The full retail for 1 days is going to be 150 any ideas that you might put one that's standing on your living room coffee table

459
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:16,895
Turn on your nightstand light mounted to a wall around your house

460
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:17,663
Because the intercom

461
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:18,687
So

462
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:24,319
There in fact are two versions of the desktop version it stands up and there's an in-wall version see if they can pick and choose and

463
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,343
Plan ahead on this

464
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:27,647
It's only 13% of it

465
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:28,927
$30,000

466
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:30,207
Flexible goal

467
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:36,607
So I say flexible because the campaign will get all the funds raised even if it doesn't reach its goal there's a month left

468
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,655
You want to think carefully before you backup

469
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,215
Even if they don't deliver the product they're getting them

470
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,751
Your money will go up in

471
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,031
Okay

472
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,311
Yay

473
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,847
Alright let's talk

474
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,895
Such enthusiasm from Stacy

475
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,943
I like sorry sorry guys I just

476
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:51,711
I'm not excited

477
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,759
But I am excited by now

478
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,295
So there we got we all have our

479
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,343
Let's talk about

480
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:58,623
Security

481
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:00,159
Because by golly

482
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,695
There's a lot

483
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,231
Is here

484
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:04,255
Let's talk about

485
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:05,535
The Reaper

486
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:10,399
Forget the song you should fear this Reaper

487
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:13,215
I think it's bigger than my right eye it is a

488
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:14,239
Botnet is

489
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:16,543
Everything

490
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,079
But it's

491
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:20,383
It's not good so this

492
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:23,199
It's got over 2 million it

493
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,735
Webcams so IP camera

494
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,807
And digital video recorders in the past

495
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:29,343
Month according to check

496
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:31,647
So it is growing faster than Boracay

497
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,927
And the

498
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:34,207
Concern is that these

499
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,231
Devices have enough

500
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:37,535
Computing power they have enough access to bandwidth

501
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:38,303
The date

502
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,095
Create a massive DDOS

503
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:42,143
And that was

504
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:44,703
Kind of the concern with Mariah

505
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:45,983
This is very

506
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:48,287
Similar only it's a little more advanced

507
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,055
Because

508
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:53,407
This thing can really it said it's like changing passwords and having

509
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:59,039
Control this can install additional software on these infected devices and we don't know what that's awful

510
00:17:59,295 --> 00:17:59,807
4 can do

511
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:02,367
Depends on what the botnet controller

512
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,391
Wanted to do

513
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,159
This is very

514
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:06,719
Concerning perhaps more concerning than Mariah in my

515
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:07,743
Yes

516
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,791
Cuz you could actually reboot and then

517
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,071
Patch and then where I was

518
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:11,839
What's going on in

519
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:12,863
Can attack you

520
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:15,423
But here because it can actually install things

521
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,959
Run on that device

522
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:18,751
Netty persistent right

523
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:21,823
Thank you that's the word I was like they'll stay there even after it

524
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:28,735
So this is concerning and I would say it's concerning for two reasons one because it's

525
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:29,759
Could unleash

526
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:30,527
A massive amount

527
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,063
Bandwidth

528
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,855
Target but two

529
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:35,647
Because this is another thing that's going to

530
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:36,415
Tar and feather

531
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:42,303
Tea and these devices are old-school devices these are not the modern devices that we

532
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,839
We talked about so some of them

533
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:45,887
Passwords

534
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:46,911
We've got it all

535
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:50,495
Either not going to be updated over there or they're just

536
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:51,519
Out of service

537
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,823
These devices can be like 10

538
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:56,383
Years old so I think the more

539
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,407
Current modern

540
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,687
Companies are learning

541
00:18:58,943 --> 00:18:59,967
From this but

542
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:02,271
I think that we still haven't actually in

543
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:07,135
Encountered a true iot attack yet that actually takes advantage of

544
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:08,415
United States

545
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,951
I feel like this attack

546
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:11,487
Yes it targets

547
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:13,023
Computing devices that are

548
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,303
Connected that are not actually

549
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:18,143
Computers but it is still very much in line with the old models of attacking

550
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,167
Computer system

551
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,471
I think we're going to start to Sea-Doo

552
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,239
Attacks

553
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,311
They're going to be aimed at true iot device

554
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:27,103
So sensors that light up

555
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:28,895
Other

556
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:29,663
Types of

557
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,199
The physical world attacks

558
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,223
I see again

559
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:33,503
Bluetooth

560
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:35,551
Subwoofer like sound waves

561
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,087
Can disrupt your accelerometer

562
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,367
All of that it's going to be

563
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:39,391
Happening in

564
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:40,415
We're not even

565
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:45,023
Fear the Reaper the only thing I would add is

566
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:50,143
I think we're in a better place now because of what you just said those other devices are very old not to be patched

567
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:53,727
Yes we still have some issues with iot Device makers

568
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:57,311
Not offering security patches as quick as a cooler they should

569
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,079
But

570
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:58,847
Mostly

571
00:19:59,103 --> 00:19:59,871
Are updatable

572
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:04,479
Pretty easily so we got that on our side it's just going to come down to

573
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:07,039
How quickly do these device makers react

574
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,063
Yes

575
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:08,831
Okay

576
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:10,111
So there's that

577
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,391
And then there's

578
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:13,695
A possible Solution on the horizon

579
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:15,743
So this is really interesting

580
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:16,511
Arm

581
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:21,119
I am actually here at arm techcon this week I gave a speech all about iot

582
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,399
Talk about some of the things

583
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,679
We always talk about on the

584
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:27,263
You guys remember that

585
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:29,567
But they introduced something called the

586
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,591
PS

587
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:32,383
And that stands

588
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:34,175
4 platform security

589
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:38,527
So this is really interesting because arm has gathered up

590
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:43,903
A bunch of big names in the industry it is basically saying we're going to Setzer

591
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,951
Things in place on the hardware

592
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:47,231
And then you guys

593
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:48,255
Here is a framework

594
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,279
For software developer

595
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:50,303
Work with

596
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,071
Our hearts

597
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,119
And that I think is going to

598
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,679
You can't what are the issues

599
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:59,775
We have right now is companies on the hardware side sell chips with

600
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:01,567
Like secure modules and all the school

601
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:05,407
Cool stuff in it but a lot of the companies don't actually turn it on

602
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:06,943
Know if they're working

603
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:08,223
Correctly

604
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:10,015
So this framework

605
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:10,783
Will address

606
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,416
Yeah that the smartest thing here is that are MS

607
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:18,464
Kind of using an open source

608
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,232
Firmware

609
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:21,024
Call trusted firmware m

610
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,608
And that's going to support this PSA specs so by doing that instead of making something

611
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:25,632
Proprietary

612
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:28,448
And sew on a it will allow people to contribute

613
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,240
Updates to that code

614
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:32,288
Theoretically make it better

615
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,104
And be it'll be easily usable by more

616
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,688
Company said that's what arm once I mean if they're expected to ship 200 billion chips

617
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:41,248
Spy I think it was 20 21

618
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,576
And Atman 200 billion chips running in

619
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:46,624
All kinds of computing devices but a lot of

620
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,416
Obviously smartphones and so on but

621
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,952
Tons and tons of little Iowa

622
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:50,976
Multi devices

623
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:53,024
You're interesting a wide base of

624
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:56,352
Product markets and you're making it easier to do so in a secure way

625
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:58,912
Which is awesome

626
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,448
We're excited

627
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,472
Bye

628
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:03,520
Farms PSA I hope this

629
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:04,800
Is it good step

630
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:06,080
Forward and

631
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:06,848
I guess

632
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:10,176
I feel like we talked about a lot of stuff Kevin do we have anything else we want to share

633
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:12,480
Do we want to take that listener

634
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:13,248
Voicemail

635
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:16,320
I do want to take a listener question Kevin and

636
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:18,880
For those of you Dies who may not be aware of it

637
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:20,416
We have the Internet of Things

638
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:23,744
Hotline where Kevin and I will endeavor to solve your

639
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,512
Toughest

640
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:26,560
Or better yet easiest iot

641
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:27,328
Problems

642
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:29,376
And you can call us at 5 1/2

643
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:30,656

7:40

645
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:32,960
424 +

646
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:34,496
Now we have our voice mail

647
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:35,264
From

648
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,032
Derek

649
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,568
Hey Stacy and Kevin

650
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:38,592
Their fruit

651
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:39,616
Tuscaloosa

652
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:40,640
You have permission to

653
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:42,688
Use this in your shower if you'd like

654
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,088
User iluv homekit but i've been looking at that new google pic

655
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,368
And I was wondering

656
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:51,904
Is there any

657
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,208
Phone or any other operating

658
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:58,816
System that integrates home automation into the actual ecos

659
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:00,864
Besides home

660
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,168
The Google assist

661
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:05,728
Or we'll have to have

662
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:06,496
A bunch of different

663
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:09,056
If you haven't asked us

664
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:10,080
Please let me know

665
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:11,104
Love the show

666
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,128
Love you guys

667
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:13,408
I'll let you know

668
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:15,456
Old Derek

669
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:17,248
We love this

670
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:18,016
Question

671
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:18,784
What because

672
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,064
The kind of fits into the easy

673
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:23,136
Although as always with our questions

674
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:24,416
The caveat

675
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:28,512
Your mileage may vary based on the devices you have

676
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:30,560
Change your comfort with technology

677
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:31,328
Which

678
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,864
It's basically a huge disc

679
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:35,936
What I was expecting to see when I saw that $20 cam

680
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:37,984
So all right

681
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,544
There is a lot of software out there

682
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,568
It won't do it

683
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:42,848
Exactly what

684
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:44,640
Home for iOS does

685
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:45,920
So if you want it

686
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:48,224
To be persistently available on the home

687
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,016
Home screen or what is that little tray that

688
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:51,296
On your iOS

689
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:52,832
Command Center

690
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:55,136
Is that okay yeah if you want it in the command center

691
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,464
But but

692
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:00,000
But it's

693
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:02,048
It's hard to answer the question without knowing

694
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:06,912
You know all the details of this system The Hub and so on and so forth but I use wink on my

695
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:10,240
Phones Derek with IOS and Android and

696
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:14,848
That is my central repository for controlling everything seeing the sensors and so on

697
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:19,968
It's certainly not as clean as home which I also have install oh I don't have a lot of homekit devices

698
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:22,272
One thing is lacking for simple there's no rooms

699
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:26,624
Like home has like home I can see what sensors are doing in different rooms and someone saved

700
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,416
What is very clean an nli

701
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:30,720
However if you have a SmartThings

702
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:31,488
Hub

703
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:33,280
Which would work with either iOS

704
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:34,304
Or with

705
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:37,888
Android they do have room support and I find the interface

706
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:38,656
Cleaner

707
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:39,680
Then Wing kits

708
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,472
Closer to what home offers

709
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:45,824
Again if you don't have a SmartThings Hub it's at the obviously not going to help you sound like you

710
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:46,848
You can use it with other hub

711
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:51,456
Please have you seen anything any third-party type things that just suck everything in like this

712
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:52,992
So there are some

713
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,528
And their limitations

714
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,320
So I've mentioned one before called

715
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:57,088
You know me

716
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:57,856
I don't

717
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:58,880
No I don't

718
00:24:59,136 --> 00:24:59,904
Thanks.

719
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,672
It has

720
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:04,000
Was kind of the room support that you would be looking for the ability to control it

721
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:08,096
From a nap there is however a company that used to be called Alfred smart

722
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:10,400
Comedy called Gideon

723
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:11,168
Smart Home

724
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:12,960
So you can download this app on

725
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:13,984
And

726
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,032
It has the room capabilities

727
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:18,336
You can create scenarios

728
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:19,872
Controller

729
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:21,408
Huge variety devices

730
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:23,456
But in some cases you're going to have

731
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,224
Have to have the Hub

732
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:24,992
Select

733
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:26,528
Controls a bunch of insteon devices

734
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,320
For that work you're going to have to have the in

735
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:29,856
It controls

736
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:30,880
WeMo devices

737
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:32,416
You don't have to have

738
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:33,952
So it's got nest

739
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:35,232
Set Philips Hue with

740
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:37,536
That Apple gear but not all the nits out

741
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:38,304
Ogier

742
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:39,328
Sonos

743
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:40,352
It will control

744
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:42,400
Pink stuff tp-link gear

745
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:44,704
It actually control some of the week stuff

746
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:45,728
Through the wink hub

747
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:46,752
So it's

748
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:49,312
Pretty promising I tried it last

749
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:50,592
Probably about a year ago

750
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:51,616
And

751
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:54,944
It works the interface was different than what it looks like now but I can

752
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,504
Kind of expect that because he was newer in a little

753
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,040
Funky but it did do the

754
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:00,832
Controlling there was a little latency

755
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:03,136
But I would also ask you

756
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:04,160
Why do you want

757
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:04,928
What to do this

758
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:10,048
In them not trying to be a jerk but I really try very hard

759
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,072
Did not pick up

760
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:13,888
And I do that thing

761
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:14,656
Things to do

762
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:15,680
Amazon Echo or the

763
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:17,216
The home and that is

764
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:19,008
I feel like I use an app

765
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,056
You know maybe one out of every two

766
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:21,824
20 *

767
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:25,664
And I I totally I get your point

768
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:30,016
Say hi to in defensive Maybe by Derek might want to do this when I look at the whole map

769
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:35,392
I get information it's not just about control maybe I want to see what the temperature is upstairs without having to speak

770
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:37,696
Or walk upstairs or so on so forth

771
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:39,744
It's just right there like I'm looking

772
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,512
At the Home app

773
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:44,096
Occupancy detected you know when the dining room well that's obviously my dog

774
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:48,960
We probably shouldn't be on the dining room table I can see the heat down there the heat up here the temperature and so on

775
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:50,496
It's like Ike story

776
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:53,312
Get that it's the getting of information

777
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,080
As well as

778
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:56,896
Got it okay well now I understand

779
00:26:57,408 --> 00:27:00,224
And now I say Gideon will offer you some of that in

780
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:04,320
Yes on a

781
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:05,856
Semi-related note

782
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:07,136
What I think

783
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:12,256
Andy Rubin essential is promising is something like this when the essential Home Products come out

784
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:16,608
Because he just wants to apparently make it all seem listen pollen

785
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:18,912
One repository one app and so on

786
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:22,752
I haven't heard anything about that I do have an essential phone being delivered today

787
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:23,776
I'm going to see if they have any

788
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:26,080
Smart home software included in that as well but

789
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:27,360
That's something to keep an eye out

790
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:31,712
Yeah I'm excited about I know the essential phone was a bit of a bus but I am a

791
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:32,480
Excited about

792
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:34,784
And hope those are still

793
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:39,648
It's less of a bus now they dropped the price $200 that's why I bought one

794
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:41,440
Go Kevin always on the prowl for

795
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:42,976
All right

796
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:47,840
I feel like that was a really good show and we should pause here

797
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:48,864
Take a break

798
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:53,216
And then come back with our guests feel Skipper who is the head of iot

799
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:55,264
Tea at Vodafone and we are to be talking

800
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,312
About nb-iot

801
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,848
The possible convergence

802
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,432
Other cellular low-power wide area Networks

803
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:04,736
And some fun things that are happening

804
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:09,344
Expanded connectivity stay tuned

805
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:15,744
Everyone that we are breaking into the Internet of Things podcast with a message from our sponsor

806
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,536
Where is sap and I have

807
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:19,840

Sat

820
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:47,744
Technologies come together to really create that system of innovation weather is going to be blockchain

821
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:48,768
Machine learning

822
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:53,632
Of course iot and other things coming together with sap customers

823
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:54,656

Amazing

828
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:02,592
Okay so I could see some real-world things

829
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:03,616
Exciting

830
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:04,896
What are you most excited about

831
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:08,480
Working on two really interesting area

832
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:09,248
One of them is

833
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:11,552
Connected vehicles and in that space

834
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:13,088
We're really seeing the

835
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,112
Continue

836
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:17,440
Conductivity doll all the cars in the Telco.

837
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:18,976
Where they are offering

838
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:20,512
What we called the OBD

839
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:25,120
Uncle Phil making any existing cars that is still on the road

840
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:28,704
Today connected with an OBD dongcopter going to have a great

841
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:33,824
Company called muccio presenting how's that working with FTP and really offering

842
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,592
Today's

843
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:37,152
Which is the T-Mobile offering

844
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:38,432
Which is powered by

845
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:40,480
SAP connected vehicle

846
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:43,040
So that's going to be a really exciting question

847
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:43,808
Another

848
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:46,112
Is if course blocks

849
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:47,648
Boxing is another

850
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:53,024
Amazing a new technology that is evolving quite quickly everybody knows them in the context

851
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:57,120
But in the Enterprise is going to be used in other ways

852
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:58,912
Pacifically in the compass

853
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:00,192
Pics of track and Trace

854
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:03,264
And accountability and ensuring that drug

855
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:04,288
Which are beans

856
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:05,824
Distributed are affected

857
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,616

Showcasing those

862
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:13,504
Technology

863
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,528
Innovations

864
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:15,296
Really with

865
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:21,696
Sap technology being used in Veep today out there in the field of being piloted there's going to be a lot of info

866
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:22,720
Christine

867
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:24,256

We've got you on the show to talk about a couple things

894
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,400
One is to give us that European perspective

895
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:35,936
We so often lack

896
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:37,216

898
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:41,312
Low-power wide

899
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:44,896
We are all excited about low-power wide area Networks

900
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:47,200
Worth a few seconds

901
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:48,480
Explain

902
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:50,784
What the heck are these and why do they matter

903
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,552
For the internet

904
00:31:57,184 --> 00:32:03,072
This technology

905
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:06,400
Play penetration testing building

906
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:07,168

909
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:11,264
It has to do with it

910
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,528
Revolution

911
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:25,344
Okay and now you guys for your particular Network

912
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,880
Market shows in NB iot

913
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:28,928
Why did you guys choose that over

914
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:31,488
We spend alone time

915
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:37,632
Elope a lovely weekend in the NBA

916
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:47,104
Penetration very low battery life

917
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:50,176
Witches NPR cheeks

918
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:52,992
Infrastructure

919
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:54,016
Enterprise

920
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:03,744
I need China it's a big Market

921
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:09,376

Convergys

923
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:13,728
He has like

924
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:15,264
A very low data rate

925
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:17,056
Which I'm wondering if

926
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:18,336
America picked

927
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:19,104
Cat m

928
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,896
Because we're like gluttons for bandwidth

929
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:24,224
What about things like when we talk about over the air updates

930
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:24,992
And

931
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:26,528
Those sorts of needs

932
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,576
Do we need something

933
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:29,600
Better

934
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:30,368
In terms of

935
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:32,160
I think it's in the US

936
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:34,976
Knetbooks

937
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:43,936
Preseason football

938
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:45,984
You don't actually need to get

939
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:50,592
Information

940
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:52,640
Traditionally used to things like

941
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:58,528
Go to launch detection environmental monitoring

942
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,256
I choose Joy

943
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:13,888
Security technology

944
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:16,192
Okay so

945
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:19,520
Let's talk about this idea of convergence because I am

946
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:22,080
Very curious what you mean when you mentioned

947
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:26,432
And nb-iot conversion into some sort

948
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:28,736
Single standard or wheat

949
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:35,904
I think it's

950
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:42,816
Angel Food Network

951
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:04,064
I think she might well see these things becoming similar

952
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,160
I think you'll see them become

953
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:11,232
Let's talk about some of your

954
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,512
Connected device

955
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:13,280
Use case

956
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:14,560
Spitter using

957
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:16,096
Either end

958
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:17,888
I don't know something even fancy

959
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:34,272
Connect to call and internet services

960
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:36,064
Tiny devices that you might use

961
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:42,208
Chinese inventions

962
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:44,768
Use cases

963
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:48,352
The interesting

964
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,376
How

965
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:50,144
The

966
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:04,992
Technology wings

967
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:06,528
Let's talk about

968
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:08,576
Because

969
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:10,112
I saw an article

970
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:14,464
Talk about the module cost in

971
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:18,816
I believe it was someone from Vodafone that was actually saying the module costs are not low enough

972
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:20,608
So I'm very curious

973
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:22,400
When does it become economically

974
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,960
To actually put this in more

975
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:25,728
Places

976
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:32,384
How much money is January

977
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:42,624
Don't have the power to do it

978
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:51,328
When you start looking at

979
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:55,424
Applications

980
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,472
Something small tracking devices

981
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:06,176
Cheering in Chinese

982
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,456
Caldwell

983
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:17,440
Applications come to Market

984
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:27,424
Actually

985
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,384
That you're going to see come out today

986
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:39,456
Cuz what we're seeing

987
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:40,224
Today is

988
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:41,760
Mostly Subs

989
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:43,040
Corruption based beak

990
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:44,320
Has bee stings have

991
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:45,856
I think that's because that's how

992
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:48,416
Consumers and even businesses are used to

993
00:37:57,888 --> 00:37:59,936
The Simpsons that I did not see where the chips

994
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,800
Windows being broken

995
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:06,080
Spell baby baby

996
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:07,616
To replace

997
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:09,408
I think when you looked at

998
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,272
Look for instance asymptotic changing value

999
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:18,112
When something goes something

1000
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:27,328
It's going to cost you a few hundred pounds

1001
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:28,096
Looks like

1002
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:31,424
It's at that point that you can charge the device

1003
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:35,264
So wishing momotose where the hardware

1004
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,544
Where is Stitches

1005
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,384
Is the initial value so you think of the customer list of connected

1006
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:48,320
Places to call

1007
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:53,184
Animal Collective

1008
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,488
Election monitoring TV event

1009
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:57,536
Or the outcome

1010
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:01,120
Okay that's kind of

1011
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:04,960
So in that case payment comes to you

1012
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:06,496
From the glass maker

1013
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:10,592
Let me tell somebody

1014
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:11,616
And that is like

1015
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,552
It's at that point where

1016
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:22,880
Tavares High

1017
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:35,936
Stolen vehicle tracking

1018
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:37,984
If you can get called stolen

1019
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:44,384
Luggage being stolen is of no use having it returned to you

1020
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,016
Used to be hot

1021
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:56,416
Totally see where you're going in that makes a lot more sense

1022
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:58,976
Pay a monthly fee for a glass break sensor

1023
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:00,768
Cuz once it's broken I'm like

1024
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:02,048
That was my security okay

1025
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,328
Here we go do you think

1026
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:05,120
Consumers are going to start

1027
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:06,656
Ending up with

1028
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:10,496
And of course

1029
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,896
Everyday to the way we operate

1030
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:22,528
Looking at something where you'll give me action

1031
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:28,672
Whether he wants

1032
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:31,744
That becomes much easier to manage

1033
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:32,768
I think

1034
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:33,792
It will be

1035
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:43,264
Psychiatrist being sent back

1036
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:44,800
The television show

1037
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:46,336
I think it's your care

1038
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:49,152
Reading Country Club

1039
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:52,480
I know customers privacy

1040
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:53,504
Everyone benefits

1041
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:58,368
Disagree with that I just feel like there's always a lot of community

1042
00:40:58,624 --> 00:40:59,136
Location

1043
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:01,696
And you touched on security which is something

1044
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:03,488
I think license pants

1045
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:04,512
Generally have

1046
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:05,536
A little bit more of

1047
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:06,304
Sandisfield

1048
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,376
So talk to me about how you guys are

1049
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:11,680
The connectivity in the network

1050
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:12,704
Also the

1051
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:17,312
Customer data on the backend like what role do you play in

1052
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,464
Something like

1053
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:38,304
Volume teachmore

1054
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:41,120
Security

1055
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:41,888
Cool business

1056
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:46,752
Skills

1057
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:50,336
We get the economy

1058
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:54,175
Escaping security

1059
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:56,991
Because security something you have to invest in

1060
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:05,695
2 into a number

1061
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:07,231
So how do you make the device

1062
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:09,535
People

1063
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:13,375
How to make sure that the taking out knees or something else

1064
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:19,007
Turn on network

1065
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:23,615
Insecure

1066
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:30,015
Ability to use different techniques that we use to secure that piping

1067
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:59,711
Large complicated system

1068
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:08,671
Control over the conditions

1069
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:17,375
Unemployment insurance

1070
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:20,703
Distributed

1071
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:21,983
So if I'm buying

1072
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:25,823
Connectivity it sounds like I have to keep everything

1073
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:31,967
Your world so if I am on AWS

1074
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:34,271
A different Cloud platform provider

1075
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:35,551
Chant

1076
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:44,255
Will it rain July 6th I do today wsj

1077
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:45,535
Medical City

1078
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:47,071
The best security

1079
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:48,351
Elizabeth

1080
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:58,079
Coyotes in ecosystem play

1081
00:43:58,335 --> 00:44:00,127
Security

1082
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:03,199
Okay let's go back to this window maker

1083
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:05,759
Because I feel like there are a lot of really

1084
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:11,391
Technically Savvy folks like the AWS guys like you guys

1085
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:12,159
In the it

1086
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:15,231
Now we bring in this window maker who's like

1087
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:16,767
I have one at this module

1088
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:19,327
Concrete this other line of business which sounds awesome

1089
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:20,607
But then let's say

1090
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:21,631
Maybe it's

1091
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:23,167
Processor inside

1092
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:23,935
The censored

1093
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:24,959
Broken dick

1094
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:27,519
Gets hacked so there's an element inside

1095
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:28,543
Window sensor

1096
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:29,823
It gets packed

1097
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:30,591
Vulnerable

1098
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:33,663
You guys might see this long before the window maker

1099
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:34,943
Probably isn't

1100
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:36,735
Sword

1101
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:38,527
I'm not saying they shouldn't

1102
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:39,551
But they probably are

1103
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:41,343
So what is the role

1104
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:42,111
As

1105
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:43,647
Technology expands in the

1106
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:44,671
More places with

1107
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:46,207
People who are maybe not Azteca

1108
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:46,975
Wasabi

1109
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:47,999
For a company like

1110
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:57,215
Windows

1111
00:44:57,471 --> 00:45:01,311
Looking off the remote sensor

1112
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:10,271
Usage

1113
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:11,551
See

1114
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:20,255
Information that you can use on

1115
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:22,303
I'll be able to come

1116
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:28,703
I said Managed IT provider

1117
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:31,519
The network

1118
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:33,823
So we can just avoid him to be input

1119
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,127
Centerpieces prices that he wants too long

1120
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:40,479
Existing

1121
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:43,551
Our customers

1122
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,855
Into that if you like

1123
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:48,415
A lot of people are like hey the most accurate

1124
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:49,695
Will be to build it

1125
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:52,255
Ourselves and then there was this Evolution were there like

1126
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:53,279
Oh that was a dumb idea

1127
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:55,583
Let's not build ourselves as good as somebody else

1128
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:59,423
But now it feels like

1129
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:01,215
They still want to monitor

1130
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:05,311
Set data so is this just a continual Evolution back to the egg

1131
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:07,615
Do you think there's

1132
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:08,383
I don't know

1133
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:09,919
It feels like it's not

1134
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:11,455
Not many people are doing it.

1135
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:13,759
Depends on

1136
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,063
YouTube

1137
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:22,719
The large multinational

1138
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:25,023
Unable to manage those connections

1139
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:26,047
Galaxy 7

1140
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:30,399
With all platforms they cannot change location

1141
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:34,495
And see everything that is actually happening

1142
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:40,127
Simpsons people that might be making connected clothing

1143
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:44,223
Do not have

1144
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:47,295
Coming back into the business

1145
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:58,559
The company that makes the jacket work you have to have service centers around the world

1146
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:02,143
We have been servicing to alarms

1147
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:03,935
Depends on

1148
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:12,383
Dissimilar

1149
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:14,943
Businesses

1150
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:16,479
Production orientation

1151
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:20,319
Babies quite a large market for these are your team

1152
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:25,183
Barometer

1153
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:25,951
Raleigh

1154
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:27,743
What was most interesting

1155
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:33,119
People are deploying iot Solutions

1156
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:33,887
WhatsApp

1157
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:37,727
1

1158
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:38,751
Number of

1159
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:40,799
Organizations with y'all

1160
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:44,895
Actually increasing the sky right now

1161
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:51,295
A good indication that people seem to benefit

1162
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:55,135
The second one

1163
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:57,183
Changes in

1164
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:59,231
The perception around security

1165
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:03,071
Example

1166
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:06,399
Security

1167
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:08,703
We understand how to resolve it

1168
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:10,751
I don't think that means

1169
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:14,847
She sang we know that security

1170
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:20,735
With that you would keep the understanding

1171
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:26,623
Ready

1172
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:31,999
How customers are increasing the volume

1173
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:33,791
How to become insecure

1174
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:37,887
All right we turn this whole conversation but we haven't actually talked about

1175
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:38,655
Threat

1176
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:41,727
Unlicensed or the rule of unlicensed

1177
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:42,751
Low-power wide area

1178
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:46,591
Parks and I've got to ask you because I hear a lot of companies are deploying

1179
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:47,615
Network

1180
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:49,151
Works especially inside there

1181
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:51,455
Encana creating this

1182
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:52,991
Private low power

1183
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:55,295
What is your thought about

1184
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:57,343
Laura there sick Fox

1185
00:48:57,855 --> 00:48:58,623
Subway

1186
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:03,999
Wide area network

1187
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:06,559
These nuts

1188
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:16,031
Are you already saying that with some of the deportment shavings

1189
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:23,199
2g or NB iot

1190
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:31,135
Will coexist in the same way

1191
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:36,511
Now carriers have been working now for the last

1192
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:37,279
Gosh

1193
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:38,815
I want to say almost a decade

1194
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:41,119
I started reporting about you no like

1195
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:41,887
The carriers

1196
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:42,655
Wi-Fi app

1197
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:46,239
And they're definitely strategies

1198
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:47,007
5G coming

1199
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:50,335
What kind of blend licensed and unlicensed together

1200
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:53,151
Seamless

1201
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:54,175
Consumer Packaging

1202
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:57,247
So is that what you see happening with some of these

1203
00:49:57,503 --> 00:49:58,015
Is unlicensed

1204
00:49:58,527 --> 00:49:59,039
Low power

1205
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:02,367
Yeah I think you just too

1206
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:03,647
So how do you say

1207
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:21,823
What you'll come down to me it's not necessarily the technology

1208
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:24,895
Konosuba Syracuse that you got

1209
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:26,431
Where you can get it

1210
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:28,991
Under the security that comes with the offer

1211
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:33,599
Service-based differentiation

1212
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:35,391
It will be around technology

1213
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:37,439
I think that sums up the iot

1214
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:39,999
It's service it's your work clothes

1215
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:41,791
Technology is

1216
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:43,839
All right

1217
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:45,631
Thank you so much

1218
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:46,655
On the show this way
