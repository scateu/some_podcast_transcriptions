00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,488
Finally

25
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:04,768

00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:20,128
Basically Financial engineering

36
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:25,760
For the iot and getting around this whole capex Apex thing when we start selling every

37
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:26,528
Living as a server

Going to work well together

45
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:49,312
In a single app to strengthen your brand

46
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:55,712
It's a really tough so it requires the right platform and a pharaoh is the one to choose

47
00:01:55,968 --> 00:02:02,112
With a pharaoh Kenmore launch 42 smart Appliance models in 2 years

00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:06,976
Barrel customers have experienced as much as an 80% reduction in time to Market

49
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:13,376
99% pure support calls and 10x higher activation rate plus they can

50
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:19,776
We use 90% of their work from one project to the next pick up Arrow just like him more Mitsubishi Bank

51
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:26,176
D-Link did it beat your competition with a solution that your team loves to build and your customers love to you

52
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:30,784
Use learn more at a pharaoh go big

53
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,320
Rite Aid

54
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:33,600
Let's get

55
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:34,880
Heineken

56
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:35,648
Kevin

57
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,672
So

58
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:37,952
Parsnip

59
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:42,816
Let's talk about the new Z-Wave plus version 2 certification

60
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,096
Good

61
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:44,864
Lord

62
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,704
For those of you guys are like what

63
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:52,800
Z-Wave is one of the connection Technologies we talked about

64
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:55,360
It's like a zigbee and that it's a mesh

65
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:56,640
And

66
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,664
It is

67
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:58,944
Well is it

68
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,480
Proprietary I'm going to say yes

69
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:01,248
The

70
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:05,088
Chip company that makes zwave chips is silicon Labs now

71
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,136
Originally

72
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,672
And

73
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:11,488
I like it I have lots of Z-Wave gear in my house

74
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,536
Most people seem to be moving away

75
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:14,560
Play from it but

76
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:17,632
It's still out there and it will probably be out there for

77
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:18,400
For quite some time

78
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,168
I'm so

79
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:21,472
This is basically the latest update

80
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,032
This is for anything built on the

81
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,568
Next Generation Z Wave

82
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:29,664
What is has is SmartStart it is now required

83
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:33,760
And Smart Start is where you buy a device

84
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:34,528
And

85
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,808
You can connect it

86
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:37,600
Automatically is pre-registered

87
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:41,440
For your existing Z-Wave Network so if you buy something from like Amazon

88
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:43,488
It will connect to your

89
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,280
Device that Sardinia

90
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:46,816
So

91
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:48,352
Yay on that

92
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:51,424
Do you have to scan something I think

93
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:52,704
You do scan

94
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,496
QR codes right

95
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:56,800
Other thing it does

96
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:58,848
Is it allows you to have

97
00:03:59,104 --> 00:03:59,616
A light

98
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,920
So all of these devices will have

99
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:05,760
A device identification through an LED light on the product

100
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:06,784
2

101
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,136
Confirm to people that the Hub is correctly set up and pairing in that sort of thing

102
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,440
This sounds silly

103
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:18,303
But as someone who has installed and reinstalled many a Z-Wave device

104
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,863
I can tell you that that light is actually really help

105
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:24,447
I have these Jasco outdoor switches

106
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:26,495
And that you just press a button and you're like

107
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,775
I hope it's connected

108
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:28,543
I don't know

109
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:33,407
When you have the light like when I'm pairing to my wink Hub which does have a lie

110
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,455
I've always a little bit more relieved

111
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,735
When I'm pairing to something

112
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:37,503
It doesn't

113
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,271
Just like

114
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:39,807
Hope it a prayer guy

115
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:43,647
You just don't know what's happening at the time you know the app

116
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:46,207
That you're using to maybe pair this

117
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:51,071
Device it's like spending and spending there's no notification so this is a huge

118
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:53,887
Huge benefit from a setup process

119
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:55,679
And

120
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:56,959
This is

121
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:59,007
The second version of Z-Wave

122
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,543
Plus and Z-Wave Plus

123
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,567
Came out

124
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:04,895
April of 2 years ago actually

125
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:05,919
And

126
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,455
That was all about security

127
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,735
And securing your zeal

128
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,271
It's in this

129
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,039
SB

130
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,319
Z-Wave Plus

131
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,599
Persian to Dido

132
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,647
It continues with that but

133
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:17,695
Basically those two things we talked about

134
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:22,047
Which is allowing you to more easily set up these devices

135
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,327
Is WhatsApp

136
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,375
Sukhumvit Smart Start

137
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,191
Everything

138
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,471
It does

139
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:30,239
In

140
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,007
Why not

141
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,799
Sounds a lot like summer

142
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:33,823
Other smart

143
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,615
Smart

144
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:36,383
Start

145
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,175
Okay

146
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,199
So

147
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:40,223
Look for that

148
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,503
Z-Wave device

149
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,575
Okay

150
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:45,599
Morphin

151
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:46,879
Let's talk about

152
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,159
Scary hosp

153
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:48,927
Little news Kevin

154
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:55,583
Yeah it sounds scary in the surface and it's not a good thing but I don't think anybody's been actually hurt by this

155
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:59,167
Healthcare security firm cyber MDX

156
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:03,775
Has reported that the protocol and certain GE devices that

157
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:04,543
AR

158
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,079
Used with

159
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:09,151
Anesthesia and respiratory machines

160
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,943
Can kind of be hot

161
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,503
Taxi very easy Homeland Security

162
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,087
Here in the US actually release an advisory saying with the flaws

163
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:19,391
Required low-level skill deck

164
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,159
Exploit

165
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:25,791
Basically if you know your way around terminal another ride commands you could silence alarms on the machines you could alter

166
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:26,559
The records

167
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:31,679
And this is the scariest part of it although again

168
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:35,263
I'm you could actually change the composition of

169
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,031
Aspirating

170
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:38,591
Gases in both of these devices which

171
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,639
I mean I guess you can make somebody

172
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,431
Sleep a lot longer or

173
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,807
I didn't want to go there but you could probably do that by removing other oxygen

174
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:48,831
I am the evil

175
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,183
Yeah so what

176
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:56,255
Not good she is actually said that

177
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:59,583
Yeah it knows about it and they said we determine that the

178
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:02,143
Potential implementation scenario

179
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:06,751
For such a hack doesn't really introduce clinical Hazard to direct patient risk

180
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:10,335
I don't know about that I continue to do something about this

181
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,383
Even if they do something

182
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:14,175
The medical is a tough

183
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,967
Because medical devices

184
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:20,063
Even if the device manufacturer Shoji in this case fixes it

185
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,647
An issues a patch may not actually

186
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:24,671
Download

187
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:28,511
In talking to both cesos at hospitals

188
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:31,071
Companies in the medical device space I am

189
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:34,911
Kind of appalled at the lack of rigor around

190
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:35,935
Patching in

191
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:39,263
There I know for a fact that there are unpatched

192
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,311
Vulnerable devices in Benny

193
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,591
Us hospitals

194
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,895
Actually talk to somebody on the show

195
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:47,711
A few months back from a security firm who

196
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:48,991
He told us about

197
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,039
A hospital that

198
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:53,087
Discovered one of their

199
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,391
Infusion pumps was

200
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,159
Hackable

201
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,951
And that

202
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:00,767
There was a vulnerability out there that

203
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,047
People were exploiting

204
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:04,095
And they had to actually put a nurse

205
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:06,911
Next to the patient who had that particular

206
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:07,935
Pump on the

207
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,471
At the time

208
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:13,823
They mistakenly use that pump and so then they had to have a whole person sitting there making sure that

209
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,103
The patient didn't die

210
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,127
Which

211
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,663
That is not scale

212
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,199
So

213
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:21,759
The only good news and

214
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:22,527
I'm trying to make

215
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:23,807
Some good news out of this

216
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,111
Gaskin City hack

217
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:29,951
Is only on anesthesia devices sold prior to 2009

218
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:33,791
So that's a good thing however I know that

219
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:39,167
Devices don't get updated like every year in the hospital as well so I'm sure there's a bunch of these still out there

220
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,191
Oh yeah

221
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:43,519
Alright let's move to something more fun

222
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:46,847
Let's talk about why there's two big updates

223
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,383
Trump lies

224
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,919
One everyone got

225
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:50,943
Or everyone should have

226
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,991
Is the availability of

227
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,271
Person detection

228
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,807
71a tells about the

229
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,855
I actually just

230
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:03,231
Updated the firmware on my wyze cam and I should say this is only for wyze cam version 2

231
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:07,071
Were the pancam that they sell so if you have the original wyzecam

232
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,607
You do not have this feature but

233
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:10,911
Once you update your firmware

234
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,703
You get a new

235
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,775
Option to enable person detection

236
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:19,103
Which is powered by you say if they see cuz I

237
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,383
I don't want to

238
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:23,199
Axon or x n o r.

239
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:24,479
This is

240
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:27,807
On device person detection which is awesome

241
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:30,623
Something worth the edgemoore Machine Vision at the ads

242
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,927
So I have a wyzecam

243
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,719
Obviously because I update the firmware

244
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:35,743
And I get

245
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:39,583
Tons of notifications so many that I turned it off because the motion detection

246
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,351
Trips

247
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:45,471
Notification system all the time and usually it's just a car driving by my house

248
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,263
I don't care really

249
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:53,151
Frankly about that I do want to know when there are people around my house or walking up to the house and that's a person detection will do

250
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,175
And in fact

251
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:58,527
You can even just hit a button in the wyze cam app

252
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,295
Angie

253
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,831
Only see person

254
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:03,647
Notifications and events which is awesome so

255
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:07,743
I'm not going to be flooded with him and turn my notifications back on solely for person detection

256
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:11,583
Well and you know what you can also do they have an away mode in an honorable

257
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,375
You can also

258
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,423
Organize your

259
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:18,239
Notifications by that so if your

260
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,007
In

261
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,823
Non away mode it won't send you anything

262
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,615
But when you click away

263
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,919
Since I'm really never away

264
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:28,991
Oh that is you

265
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:35,647
That's just me so what you're right for people who have normal life and leave the house everyday and come home

266
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:39,231
Good idea but for me I want the notifications all the time because I'm always home

267
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,791
That's right and if you're looking for people around

268
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:42,815
Your house this makes much more

269
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,607
Alright I like him too

270
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,375
So

271
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,399
That's free

272
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,447
Just enable it on your wife

273
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,751
The other thing

274
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:54,079
Is I was one of the early purchasers of their smartphone

275
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:56,127
So I got those yesterday

276
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:57,919
And

277
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:00,479
I paid a total of 4140

278
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,503
44 bulbs

279
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,271
The

280
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:04,575
Shipping and tax return

281
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,111
Yes tax and shipping

282
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,671
Your lists price is going to be 2999

283
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:11,743
And these are tunable White

284
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,279
Bulbs with dimmer

285
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:14,559
So

286
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:16,863
I set them up their wifi-enabled

287
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,655
So you can just have

288
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:21,215
Don't even think you need a wyze camera

289
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:23,007
I wouldn't think you need

290
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,031
Annie

291
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:26,335
Hanging Minister supported by

292
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,871
Matinee

293
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,919
The chi

294
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:32,223
You should be okay with that

295
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:32,991
So

296
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:36,063
I just occurred to me I'm like I have a wyze camera so I just

297
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:39,903
But when I set it up it was just a straight-up

298
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,999
Install Wi-Fi bulbs so

299
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,535
I put the bulbs in

300
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,327
They are lovely

301
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,863
The lake quality is good

302
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,191
The Deming quality is good I don't get Flickr

303
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,471
When I'm dipping

304
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:54,751
Lower

305
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,055
Did you hear any humming

306
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,407
Check right now

307
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,687
Let's all listen

308
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:03,455
Right now

309
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:11,903
I don't hear any humming

310
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:12,927
Yeah

311
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,207
So no humming

312
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,535
You can group your lights

313
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,071
You can

314
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,351
Do some weird schedule

315
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:24,959
So here's the thing this is Early Access I think everybody will be able to buy them at some

316
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:25,727
Point soon

317
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:26,751
So

318
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:29,823
I'm hoping we see a little bit more refinement here

319
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,871
Right now I can

320
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,663
Turn the lights off

321
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:38,015
Ouran after a certain number of hours but I can't schedule something like

322
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,039
Days and times

323
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,599
So that's a little weird for weird

324
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:42,879
It it's like

325
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,159
Turn them on

326
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,951
X number of hours and minutes

327
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,999
Not like turn them on at 8 a.m.

328
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,023
Sound like

329
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:53,119
8 a.m. would be 23 hours from now

330
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,399
So that's

331
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,167
Bizarro

332
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,191
But

333
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,727
They do let you

334
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:00,543
Do scenes so you can set your

335
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,103
I created a bright day and a

336
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:04,383
Warm night

337
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,151
Scene

338
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:10,271
So and then I can activate those by talking to my Google assistant or Madam a

339
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:13,343
Because wise integrates with both of those

340
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:15,647
The other thing I can't do that surprised me

341
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:17,695
I have the wise sense sensors

342
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:20,511
And I was hoping to be able to

343
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:24,351
Do a motion detection because this is a much cheaper option than the

344
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:25,375
My Hue motion.

345
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,143
Detection

346
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,959
So I was hoping to do it so like when the light

347
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:33,055
Either when motion is detected or when a contact sensor opened and closed

348
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:35,359
I would be able to turn the light on

349
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,639
And then also have it

350
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,175
Turn off after certain time

351
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:38,943
Minutes

352
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,223
But I can't do that yet

353
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,319
Sounds good

354
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,087
Doesn't it

355
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:49,183
Because the sensors are not yet communicating with

356
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:51,487
And I don't know

357
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:55,839
The can't be a trigger event for anything but a notification

358
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:56,863
Or

359
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,399
Turning the camera

360
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,423
Honor off

361
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:00,447
Right

362
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,215
Now

363
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,751
I can't do vacation

364
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,359
If I turn that on its going to turn my wise bulbs on and off so it looks like I'm

365
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:08,639
Which is nice

366
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:11,711
I find it weird that that's called vacation mode

367
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:13,759
Yen isn't part of away mode

368
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:14,783
But you know

369
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,063
I'm just going to roll with it

370
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,855
Because I think this is early

371
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:21,183
Yeah it mean if you have Early Access end

372
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,999
The software and firmware updates just

373
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:26,047
Running to support this and also.

374
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:29,887
It sounds like there's still things in the works you could

375
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,263
Use the motion sensor

376
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,287
Where

377
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,311
EFT

378
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,591
Yes

379
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,127
I'm trying to simplify my life here

380
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,407
Are people I am not

381
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,175
I'm done with

382
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:48,063
I need native is always better and we'll talk about why a little bit actually another one of our top

383
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:49,599
So

384
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:50,623
Let's move on

385
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:52,159
Little bits of news

386
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,439
Hello

387
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:59,071
Yeah this is interesting on 95 Google routinely looks at Android app

388
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:01,119
Packages basically the software you install

389
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,911
It's called an APK file

390
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:06,495
They open these things up using Android studio and other

391
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,519
It's a software

392
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,823
And they look and see what's coming

393
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:10,591
Because

394
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:12,383
Google will usually

395
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:16,991
Put certain bits of information in there about future features to prepare for them

396
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:21,855
And the one I found was package detection which I love this I forget it

397
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:24,159
Package protection for nest hello

398
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,183
And what this

399
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:29,535
Will do according to the data that's currently in the nest hello

400
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:31,839
App with an s that I should say

401
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,631
Is it will

402
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:39,519
Tag your hello doorbell footage when it thinks a package was delivered and or picked up

403
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:42,079
So that's very cool because

404
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,871
Sometimes I get

405
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:47,711
Like I said before notifications too many notifications say from my cameras

406
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:53,599
When morning was actually very important but I can't tell the difference between

407
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:55,135
So this sounds awesome

408
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,159
It's

409
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:59,487
Not sure if this will come to pass or when it will

410
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:01,535
Looks like Google is actually working on it

411
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,071
Yay

412
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,703
Show me the nest aware subscription just so you know for this

413
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:11,263
Just just saying

414
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:17,151
Let's go for a cheaper

415
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,431
A less Rich option

416
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:19,711
Ikea's

417
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:20,991
Crabtree

418
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:27,391
I can't do it you guys I'm sorry for all the I can't people who listen or the Swedish people who listen

419
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,183
Tradfri

420
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:32,511
So

421
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,535
What do we have

422
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:40,447
We have some new products nootropic products a filament style light bulb

423
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,519
That's either a19 or e26

424
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:46,079
A19 is the normal light bulb size

425
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:48,127
The king 826 is

426
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:52,735
Itsy 26

427
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,039
Yes

428
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:57,087
So the bulb

429
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:59,903
$16 has three different color temperatures

430
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,023
Temps on porch light

431
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:08,863
806 lumens of brightness obviously works with the chakra system

432
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,911
Also a candelabra

433
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:13,727
E12 base color and white light bulb

434
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,263
$30

435
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:16,543
Yowza

436
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:17,823
That's expensive

437
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,615
Answer

438
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,151
I know

439
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,943
I know but they're so small

440
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:25,759
You should be paying less for that topic

441
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,551
Anyway and one other

442
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:30,623
Interesting I'm going to say this wrong when interesting product

443
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:34,975
The float float alt maybe it's blowout

444
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,255
Light panels

445
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:40,095
They're similar to what maybe like Nana race mix

446
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:41,887
They're bigger

447
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:45,215
Have all the cool fancy pictures of Natalie

448
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,239
Can house

449
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:50,335
But they so you can get a square Light Panel 12 by 12 for $70

450
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:51,615
You would like it

451
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:54,943
Square white panel is 129

452
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:58,783
And then finally a 12 x 35 inch panel also for 129

453
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:03,647
So against three different color temperatures Warm Glow Warm White and cool White

454
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,695
Nice

455
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,999
I think with those kind of light panels I think

456
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:09,023
Colors are super

457
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,815
But that's cuz I use mine

458
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:11,839
Art installation

459
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:18,751
Yeah we have the microphone as well which of the light panels change colors based on what it hears

460
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:20,543
Yo

461
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:21,823
Okay so

462
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:22,847
I should tell you

463
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:25,919
The wise light bulbs are 800 lumens for

464
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,711
For the people who are counting their lumens

465
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:29,247
So there

466
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:30,783
But they're cheaper

467
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,063
Yay

468
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,087
What's cheaper

469
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:36,927
They're not homekit compatible but the freezer

470
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:40,511
All right

471
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:42,303
Brighter homekit compatible

472
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:44,351
Adjust the to nobility

473
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:45,119
Is

474
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,143
Truncated

475
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:49,471
Slightly slightly joinable

476
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:52,543
Fully dimmable

477
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,335
Alright so

478
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,895
Next up also doorbell news

479
00:18:57,407 --> 00:19:00,991
Exciting doorbell news if you are a member of the ADT

480
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:02,783
Lifeshield

481
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,575
Which is beta program which

482
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:05,855
Program I don't run

483
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,927
Lifeshield is

484
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,207
A

485
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,487
DIY

486
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:15,839
Program for ADT that lets you buy products connector products

487
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,119
Dual monitor

488
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,143
Bring in that sort of thing

489
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,167
So

490
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:22,751
They have released a new HD video doorbell

491
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:25,823
Yay has 2-way audio

492
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,615
It has people detection

493
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:34,015
It has 180 HD resolution video 170 degrees weidler

494
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:35,807
That's actually pretty good

495
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:36,831
Many stop it

496
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:37,855
35 or 1/4

497
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:39,647
And

498
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:40,671
You can

499
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,207
Locations in

500
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:43,743
So

501
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,023
It's not cheap

502
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,047
It's not

503
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,071
How much is it

504
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,887
It's $200

505
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:52,959
That's that's pretty money in the nest hello is

506
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:54,239
Isn't that true

507
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,543
Where is one more expensive

508
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,079
But it also works

509
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,383
System

510
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:04,735
Right now you can get the nest hello for 189

511
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,271
There you go

512
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:11,135
If you want it if you want to try the doorbell do anything with

513
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:13,951
The lifeshield HD video don't you have to use

514
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:14,975
If it's from that

515
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:15,999
Can

516
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,023
Really do much

517
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,095
So if you've already

518
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,631
He got your own system

519
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,935
Maybe deal with either ringer

520
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:25,983
Nest

521
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,263
PayPal Amazon

522
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:31,359
It pains me to say that

523
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:33,663
Depending on Amazon

524
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:35,967
But

525
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,759
Speaking of Google

526
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:40,319
Let's talk about local home

527
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,599
Control

528
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:45,439
Yes and this gets back to what I said earlier about Native

529
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,975
Voice type

530
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:50,815
Activities at Rio Google IO back in May

531
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:52,351
They showed off

532
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:56,191
Renounce I guess I should say they're local SDK

533
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:58,239
Basically what that does is

534
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:02,847
It's a way for device makers in the Google ecosystem Google St

535
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:05,151
2

536
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:06,431
Allowed

537
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,455
Local

538
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:08,991
Processing of

539
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,783
Smart home commands

540
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,319
Weed States and so on

541
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:18,720
So what that means is instead of going out to the cloud every time to process language in commands

542
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,256
Which can take some time

543
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:22,816
It'll happen Basie on a

544
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,096
Google home device

545
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,120
Somebody

546
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:28,960
Previews out now they've already announced the early Partners which is

547
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:29,728
GE

548
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:32,800
Lifx Philips Hue tp-link and WeMo

549
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:35,872
None of those Partners have announced any local home support yet

550
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,224
Although I'm sure they got access to this before the developer preview in life

551
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:41,504
This week

552
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,808
So hopefully very soon we will

553
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:46,112
See local home commands

554
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:48,160
I would fall back to the cloud

555
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:50,208
In the Google home ecosystem

556
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,536
I'm hoping I'm going to see if I can find some time to try

557
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:56,352
INXS one of the apis for one of these

558
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,888
Device makers and

559
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:59,936
Actually test it and time

560
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:03,264
The local versus the cloud-based commands

561
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,056
Nice alright

562
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:08,896
If it's anything based on like Google's local voice transcription

563
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:10,432
That is so much faster in

564
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:11,456
It's so cool

565
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:13,248
I'm serious

566
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,272
All right

567
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:15,040
And now

568
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:18,624
I thanks to a wonderful listener thing

569
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:21,696
I have been testing an echo

570
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:22,464
Auto

571
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,792
Which I had wanted forever because I wanted the Amazon Echo in

572
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:26,560
In my car

573
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:30,912
My car happens to be a Tesla which is not play nicely with a lot of the other

574
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,728
Android 8 doesn't play nice with Android auto

575
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:34,752
Or

576
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:35,776
What's the other one

577
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:39,104
Are plecos like apples something

578
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,760
And so I was like really excited because I constantly I have questions like I'm thinking in the car and I'm like

579
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,088
What was that what date was that

580
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:50,624
Battle of

581
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,416
How many teeth does a cat have

582
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,440
Yeah just

583
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,464
Just silly question

584
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:58,560
I don't mind just never sleeps

585
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:00,352
It shouldn't sleep I'm driving okay

586
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:02,400
So I tested this out

587
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:04,704
It works basically from your phone

588
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,288
So it creates a constant Bluetooth connection to your phone

589
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:12,640
And what it does is it allows you to do

590
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:13,920
Calling

591
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:18,016
Send text messages and it has all the basic features of Madame a so I can

592
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:19,040
The weather icon

593
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:20,576
Commute times I can ask

594
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:24,160
Keep the cat hats

595
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:26,976
So all of that is available now

596
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,000
In my car

597
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,536
And it

598
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:30,816
Also

599
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:35,424
Hook me up to Spotify and granted I had this in my car cuz I have a Bluetooth

600
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,448
Connection to my phone

601
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,496
But it's really cool cuz

602
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:42,080
In might and I drive a Tesla so in my Tesla I can say

603
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:44,640
I press a button on my steering wheel and I say

604
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:45,408
Play

605
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:47,712
Mega Sonic on El Toro by Rosalie

606
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:48,992
And

607
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,272
It will

608
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:51,040
Play that

609
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,064
Sometimes

610
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,088
It's a little nip

611
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:57,440
It's a little fussy and it doesn't work from Spotify it works from

612
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:58,976
Different service

613
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,512
Recall the name of the service

614
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:01,792
The comes with the Tesla

615
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:03,072
But now

616
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,096
I just say

617
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,376
Matinee

618
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,912
Play Con El Torah

619
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:07,936
And

620
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:11,776
You don't have to have to hit the voice button on your steering wheel for that

621
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:15,360
I don't hit the voice button and it's pulling from Spotify

622
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,384
Which is

623
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:18,944
Awesome because I'm already at

624
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,736
Like I prefer Spotify to whatever

625
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:24,832
The Tesla has because it doesn't always play the song he wants sometimes a try something

626
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:25,856
Close to it

627
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:28,160
So yeah

628
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:29,184
I was really excited

629
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:30,208
Unleavened

630
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:31,488
The downside

631
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:33,536
The cost the cost is not downside itsfunneh

632
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:35,584
The downside is

633
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,864
I'm having trouble

634
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:39,936
It's only works when my phone is in the

635
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:40,704
Car repair

636
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:44,544
Amazon says I can bring in

637
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,824
Another phone

638
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,616
Like my partner's phone for example

639
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:49,664
And it will pair two

640
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,432
His phone

641
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:53,248
It basically connects to the last phone that was in the

642
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:55,552
Car with most bones are present

643
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:58,624
Into parrot you're supposed to be able to say

644
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,648
Madam a

645
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,672
Pair

646
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:03,232
That does not seem to work

647
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,000
At this moment

648
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:05,792
In time so we have not been able to

649
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:06,560
Parrot yet

650
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:07,584
To his phone

651
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:10,400
But theoretically it's possible

652
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:12,192
When I figure out why this isn't work

653
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:14,240
I'll let y'all know

654
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:17,056
Or if you have paired to phone successfully

655
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,872
I don't think that's a huge

656
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:25,760
Issue though because typically if it's your car you're the primary driver you want this

657
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:27,040
Echo 2

658
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:31,648
Be connected to your phone if I'm a passenger I can open up my matinee happen

659
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:34,720
Hit a button and do all the same things when I'm not driving

660
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:35,744
So

661
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,816
I don't think it's a huge issue but maybe others will disagree

662
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:41,120
I just think the seamlessness is now

663
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:42,656
Nice when you think you could just

664
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:43,424
Walk-in in

665
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:44,704
Works for you in it

666
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,984
We also share

667
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,264
Like if you share a car

668
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:50,592
Which we do cuz all right we've been electric in

669
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:51,616
Combustible

670
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:54,944
Gatsby c i c e

671
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:58,016
And so we tend to drive the elect

672
00:25:58,272 --> 00:25:59,296
Vehicle whatever we

673
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,320
Cancel

674
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:01,856
We don't have to get gas

675
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:03,648
But that's just us

676
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,232
It's a little specific but I know there's lots of people who do share

677
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:09,280
Like a minivan with all the car seats in

678
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:10,816
Those people probably

679
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:13,120
Don't trade the car seats out all the time anyway

680
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:14,912
Know that going in

681
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:16,960
When I figure out how to solve that

682
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:18,496
I will let you know it'll probably be up

683
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:20,288
It's part of my exhaustive review

684
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,312
So

685
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,592
Stay tuned for that

686
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:24,128
Okay and Kevin

687
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,152
Now

688
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:27,456
I feel like it's time for the voice mail what do you think

689
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:29,504
I think so

690
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,272

/ iot

716
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:22,240
This week we have a question from Jerry

717
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:24,544
Who's looking for a smart

718
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,312
Button

719
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,080
Let's hear it

720
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:52,192
Palatable

721
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,472
With my day

722
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,544
All right Sherry

723
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:57,568
Actually

724
00:27:57,824 --> 00:28:01,664
You already have most of what you need because you said you have SmartThings if you want

725
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,200
A button for scenes

726
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:05,248
Samsung actually makes a SmartThings button

727
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:07,296
It works topically natively with

728
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:09,344
The SmartThings Hub that you have

729
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:11,392
Cost $15

730
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:13,184
Which is not too expensive

731
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:18,560
And you can program it to do whatever you like could be for seeing that could be for

732
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,352
Turning lights on and off

733
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:22,656
Anything that you would like to program

734
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:23,936
So that's

735
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:25,728
Actually the way I would go

736
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:30,848
I originally had thought about the fibaro button just cuz it's a really nice-looking button

737
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:32,384
Looks more like a button

738
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,408
But

739
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,176
It's not

740
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:39,040
Natively supported that I know of you may have to install like a separate device Handler for SmartThings for that

741
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:43,904
Probably wouldn't bother that I would just go out and spend 15 bucks on the

742
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:46,976
On the Samsung SmartThings button

743
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:49,024
You can even have a bunch of different

744
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:52,608
Actions on it like a double click does one thing a single click does another

745
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,448
Press and hold or something else so one button can do multiple things for her

746
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:59,264
I was going to offer an even more expensive option

747
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,800
Just because that's me

748
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:03,104
Especially if you have a lot of

749
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,896
Of things this Airtech

750
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:05,920
They make a lot of

751
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:07,712
Z-Wave stuff

752
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:09,760
They sell a Z-Wave button

753
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:16,160
That is their minimote to it is $45 but you can control 8 scenes

754
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:19,488
If you have eight whole scenes and you don't want to buy

755
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:21,792
History of the SmartThings buttons

756
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:23,072
Actually that's the same

757
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:23,840
Cost so

758
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,376
I really don't know why you would buy this

759
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:26,656
Let's just go

760
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:30,240
Like I really flummox but if you want

761
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:33,056
A smart button that is a reliable smart button

762
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:34,080
I've used it

763
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:38,688
Control

764
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,736
Actually the problem I have with

765
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:41,504
The smart button

766
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,272
Is

767
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:43,296
A lot of them

768
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:44,832
Control many scenes and then I can

769
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:45,600
Never forget what

770
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:46,880
I'm supposed to be like

771
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:49,952
4 klicks plus a right click + left click in a shake

772
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:50,976
Turn these lights on

773
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:53,024
I just go with voice

774
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:57,376
But this one is rechargeable

775
00:29:57,632 --> 00:30:02,496
So you can either recharge it via a USB which is nice or there's a battery

776
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:07,616
And I don't know about the SmartThings one if it's rechargeable but you could end up buying a lot of battery

777
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:08,384
Hibiscus

778
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,176
Using a smart button is fun

779
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:11,200
And you tend

780
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,480
Run out the battery in

781
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:14,528
I think I run out my battery in

782
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:16,320
Bees in about 6 months

783
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:18,880
Probably this is a rechargeable battery

784
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:22,208
Cr2450 battery replace

785
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:23,744
So

786
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,768
Those are your options

787
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:27,584
There's tons of Z-Wave buttons out there there's tons of zika

788
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,608
B button spec

789
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,400
If you have SmartThings you have that

790
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:32,448
Enjoy

791
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:33,984
Let us know actually what you

792
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,544
I'm curious if anyone buys the

793
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:40,896
All right that feels pretty good for

794
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:43,712
This week show please stay tuned

795
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:44,736
For Goonies

796
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:45,504
BD

797
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:47,808
Who is going to talk about

798
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,672
How companies were trying to sell their products as a service can match their revenue stream

799
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:56,768
Dreams in the future and the role of insurance on the

800
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:58,304
Corporate Industrial

801
00:30:58,816 --> 00:30:59,584
Coyote size

802
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:00,608
So

803
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,400
All of that and more

804
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:03,424
Is coming up

805
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:07,520
After a message from our sponsor

806
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:13,920
Hey everyone we are taking a quick break from The Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor this week sponsor

807
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:16,480
Is Dell Technologies and I have

808
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:17,760
Craig Wetzel

809
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:20,064
Who is director of iot channels

810
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,088
Intel

811
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:24,160
Here to talk to you about their relationship with Dell

812
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:30,304
So Intel Works closely with Dell Technologies as they've been building their Edge and iot business for the last few

813
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:32,608
How would you describe that partnership

814
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,912
Saudi Dell Intel relationship

815
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:37,216
Has had a long history success

816
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:42,592
Starting with the first PCS that Michael Dell created in his dorm room we've worked together on

817
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:44,128
Desktops in

818
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:48,224
Servers and Anna conversion for structures in Cloud Solutions in

819
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,016
Together along this journey

820
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:52,064
It's been very tight-knit and close

821
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:53,856
And now we're moving into the iot

822
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:55,136
SeaWorld together

823
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:57,696
And this engagement with Delta critical one

824
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:59,744
Specifically when we collaborate a Numark

825
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,512
It's like a coyote

826
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:03,072
Dell has their seven individual companies

827
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:07,424
And David able to use the technology to create function-specific capabilities

828
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,960
Stickley brought together

829
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:09,984
To make complete list

830
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:10,752
Solutions

831
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:13,824
As you know iot Solutions aren't created using a

832
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,592
Single

833
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:20,992
Electronic Solutions are created by different layers of technology and products coming together which allow customer not just

834
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:21,760
To collect data

835
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:23,040
But use it for businesses

836
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:26,368
With Dell we have partnered with an organization that has the

837
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:30,208
Key infrastructure and capabilities to which our partners and customers

838
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:32,256
Can add that analytics another pieces

839
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:34,048
Jamaica complete solution

840
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:39,680
Can you give us an example of where Dylan and tell if collaborated to deliver a solution into the iot market

841
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:43,264
Actually let me give you two examples of our joining key

842
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:45,568
In one case Dylan until work

843
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:46,592
Together with a large

844
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:47,360
US city

845
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:49,920
Templum in a situational awareness solution

846
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:52,480
It will allow the city to implement a matrix

847
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:54,528
Cue components from cameras to servers

848
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:55,808
To collect and analyze data

849
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:58,880
Those analytics create actions that provide one

850
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:01,440
AC4 living and working condition for residence

851
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:05,024
To better management planning for infrastructure improvements

852
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,072
Reduce pedestrian-vehicle traffic

853
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:08,096
+ 3

854
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:11,168
Provide additional analytic insights that were needed to make better

855
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:15,776
By the city's urban planners in short the collaboration improve the lives of

856
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:17,056
The city's residents today

857
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:18,336
And for years to come

858
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:19,360
And the second reason

859
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:23,968
Still work with the US based entertainment company to develop a solution for their golfing

860
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:30,624
This solution allows a golfer to analyze their swing real time and make adjustments immediately on the driving range

861
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:36,000
This example of collaboration by Dell and Intel enable this us retailer to write Cutting Edge

862
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:37,792
Experiences for their golfers in

863
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:41,632
And what does Intel see is the main barrier of adoption

864
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:45,216
And iot market and how are Intel and Dell working together

865
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:46,240
To break through that barrier

866
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:48,544
Weixin incredible interest from comp

867
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:50,848
But almost all of them are struggling with

868
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:55,712
How can we turn data into actionable information that drives meaningful business outcomes

869
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:57,248
We are working with Delta

870
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:59,552
Deploy solutions that allow for Analytics

871
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:01,344
To happen where it matters

872
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,368
While it matters

873
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,904
And often this is at

874
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:10,304
By moving analytics closer to the point of data collection introduces latency improve real-time responses

875
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,352
And relieves Demand on network bandwidth

876
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:19,264
Thank you Craig and where can we go to find out more about the packages that Intel has created for the Internet of Things

877

The combination which I'll talk more about a insurance finance and Technology allows the traditional in

895
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:31,712
Shoe companies to really think of New Delhi models with Kinect

896
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:38,112
Such as impaired Hugo or exhale we do this a lock the mid-market

And said hey you know if you can really make things smart

907
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:20,608
We have

908
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:25,216
4 million Dixon industrial think that we would love to make smart

909
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:26,752
And get intelligence

910
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:35,712
Compressor

911
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:37,504
Today I mean

912
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:41,600
Equipment breakdown insurance

913
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:45,696
I did not know

914
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:49,280
They have 1600 + PhD

915
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:51,072
Likely right models

916
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:52,864
Do understand equipment failure

917
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:54,656
Cisco's all these models

918
00:36:54,912 --> 00:37:01,056
Coyote

919
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:02,848
Real-time data

920
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:05,152
Starting to put in the Bible

921
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:06,432
Better Solutions

922
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:07,456
That would be

923
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:08,736
Viniq liqueur

924
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:13,088
So you don't eat with us for three years really like what you doing

925
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,928
Nimble iot

926
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:20,000
Independence

927
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:26,400
Prospectors but we have the luxury of having the credibility in the balance sheet of the day

928
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:29,472
How do we help the other industrial companies to do similar

929
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:32,032
Equipment breakdown that equipment breakdown

930
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:35,360
Electrical terminal service

931
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:39,456
Real data

932
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:40,736
Disconnected products

933
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:42,528
Better

934
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:44,832
Or prevent failures

935
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:49,696
Alright so let's dig into that because the first thing I would think of

936
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:50,720
When

937
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:55,072
Listening to what you do is why do we need an insurance element

938
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:58,912
I'm in a lot of ways this is a deal between to come

939
00:37:59,168 --> 00:37:59,936
Kinesis is the

940
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:02,752
Equipment provider saying here you go

941
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:06,080
This is going to work and when it breaks down I'm going to know in advance

942
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:07,360
So I will

943
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:08,640
Send someone out proactive

944
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:09,408
Italy to fix it

945
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:11,712
Until it feels like a two-party relationship

946
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:13,760
Adding insurance why it is that needed

947
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:18,368
The first element of whether risk prevention happens on insurance

948
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:22,720
Perspective

949
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:24,512
Connecting a product and making it

950
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:29,120
Smart and connected are not sure if this is working then I'm sure they should invest

951
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:31,936
And that's the delivery warranties

952
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:36,288
Are almost giving the peace of mind for these equipment manufacturers that

953
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:38,848
They can go to this digital transformation

954
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,128
And this would work

955
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:46,528
He can't get it out of school old school machines like more than Thompson in a boilers give them a lot of confidence

956
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:51,392
II

957
00:38:55,744 --> 00:39:01,888
All services equipment I will guarantee you up time but you know because it's new to them

958
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:04,704
You're somebody else will that be playing

959
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,496
Northeast Equipment Sales

960
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:10,080
You're so confident that it will actually pay you money

961
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:17,760
That should be the two areas when insurance comes out to be a teacher

962
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:21,088
Excellent so we are going to get you those examples in a minute

963
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:25,184
But let's dig into one of the elements hair which is always fascinated

964
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,976
Which is this idea that

965
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:30,048
If I am a small to medium-sized manufacturer

966
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:32,352
And I'm making a pick-and-place machine

967
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:34,400
And now I'm selling it as a service

968
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:35,680
What happens is

969
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:37,984
I'm taking something that used to be

970
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,008
Big lump sum

971
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:39,776
Peanut

972
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:41,312
And now it's going to be

973
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:42,848
Paid out over time

974
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:48,480
And if you're Amazon in doing something like that or one of the big companies maybe you have a capital to do that

975
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:50,016
But if you're a smaller

976
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:50,784
Company

977
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,344
It seems impossible you can't turn hay

978
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,416
Products business into a Services business overnight

979
00:39:56,672 --> 00:40:00,256
The cost of making the product and then your incoming Revenue stream

980
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:01,280
Just don't match up

981
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:03,328
So is there a way for you guys to

982
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,352
Open that

983
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:08,448
Absolutely

984
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:14,848
Perspective

985
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:16,384
Spotify

986
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:22,528
I think it did something old school records our kids know we're saying that in a why not the stuffed every other Market

987
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:27,904
Discuss the big challenge with you talk about it be that expensive capital

988
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,976
So then been going off the expense of Capital Equipment

989
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:32,000
Like you just said

990
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:33,536
I got a big check up song

991
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:35,328
Lost equipment sale

992
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:37,376
The disadvantage of course is that

993
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:39,424
I only get that check maybe 10 years

994
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:45,824
Leader again and then it's kind of weird that I don't touch my customer for

995
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:46,848
Aneurysm

996
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,784
I was making a million dollars at Frankford and she treatment plant

997
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:56,576
Equipment

998
00:40:56,832 --> 00:41:00,160
And then suddenly Out start making on a 200000 a year

999
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:02,208
Which is great over 10 years

1000
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:03,744
But it's not great

1001
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:05,280
Because we won by

1002
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:09,376
Unsteady Capital heavy are large balance sheet organization

1003
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:11,424
Is some balance sheet the engineering tools

1004
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:13,728
They want to do is be take the assets

1005
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:16,032
Eliza manufactures an art books

1006
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:21,152
Create an object 70 model for the End customer temporary

1007
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:24,480
Like I said you don't want us to customers see this working

1008
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:28,832
They get the money upfront and of course you know that there is some cost

1009
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:32,416
They understand that the market will expand because the

1010
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:34,720
And you leave the state

1011
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:36,256
It would just not get it

1012
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:44,192
In the middle

1013
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:48,288
It's which the good news is that a lot of companies which I make Market on North

1014
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,336
Publicly traded

1015
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:53,919
So I'll look at it as a concern is not as much concern to show

1016
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:56,223
Explain it to the market

1017
00:41:56,735 --> 00:42:00,319
I mean that's that's how we being sold

1018
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:02,111
Technology

1019
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:04,415
Without getting this data out of these.

1020
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:10,815
On top of that we can do some Dollar Tree flea engineering to give them tomorrow

1021
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:13,631
Transition it to me and still get that money up front

1022
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:17,215
I just found myself and my leaving company

1023
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:26,687
A hundred thousand a year I'll give you the heat treatment plant

1024
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:28,479
Animal getting beat up time

1025
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:32,063
Very compelling value prop

1026
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:37,951
Excellent and what is the things that I thought was really intriguing about

1027
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:38,975
Having

1028
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:42,047
You guys involved in the financial insurance side

1029
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:46,911
Was how it helps make small to medium-sized businesses a real player in this market

1030
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:49,215
Can you elaborate Maybe by giving an example

1031
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:54,335
One of the examples close to my heart is the small company Taco Barn

1032
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:57,407
Public case study the UK

1033
00:42:57,919 --> 00:43:04,063
This is a company that sells very specialized CNC machines are diamond polishing and grinding

1034
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:07,135
These machines cost anywhere from 300 to 400 thousand

1035
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:09,695
Svn customers using cider

1036
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:16,095
Gemstones

1037
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:16,863
Spectre

1038
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:27,615
But the challenge was twofold one

1039
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:31,711
10-second was really missing out on the smaller Target segments

1040
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:33,503
The smaller binder sometimes

1041
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:35,295
Don't want to be that 400000

1042
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:37,343
Grunt when they don't know their Market

1043
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:40,415
Zoeva B&B NSB

1044
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:42,975
Create an offer now we're Coburn

1045
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:45,535
Machines

1046
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:47,583
And that coupon care is there

1047
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:51,679
These machines are interested in

1048
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:52,703
Peter collection

1049
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:55,519
Secrets in particular groups on top of that

1050
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:58,591
Which is sold as a fixed price service

1051
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:02,431
13 certain versions of that be also getting PDF.

1052
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:03,967
Coupon machine

1053
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:05,759
Uptime guarantee

1054
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:11,391
And give the end customers of penalty or like a better word it's a machine.

1055
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:14,463
So that's the first way there cuz I'm going to Market

1056
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:17,279
Hey you know

1057
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:23,679
If you have Coban care and Coburn together instead of buying a $400,000 machine

1058
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:25,727
6000 a month

1059
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:27,007
Mayport base

1060
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:28,287
Utilisation

1061
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:32,127
Like I said the financial engineering of taking these

1062
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:33,151
Kubernetes

1063
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:35,967
Used books

1064
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:37,759
Thousand

1065
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:41,087
The biggest mistake by the 6018 elation

1066
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:42,623
Everybody makes money if

1067
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:43,647
They use more

1068
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:44,927
But also

1069
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:47,999
In the Sky 5000b iot plays because

1070
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:55,423
And besides guarantee eternity acid

1071
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:58,495
This is the other beauty of having your own iot connect

1072
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:07,199
Aftermarket Revenue with Services which is never that before

1073
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:08,479
As well as

1074
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:12,575
Opex model do really expand the market

1075
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:17,695
So let's talk about elevators and you guys are helping some of the smaller operators

1076
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:20,255
On the insurance site so can you talk to us about

1077
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:21,023
What you're doing there

1078
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:24,095
Interesting

1079
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:25,887
The smallest service providers

1080
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:27,679
Not the dog Force

1081
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:34,079
But you know who serviced a lot of the older elevators after the contract with the oldest ocean that expires

1082
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:36,895
Is a target segment from their perspective

1083
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:42,527
Then this servicing these elevators by a customer services

1084
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:45,343
Hanging on of course there's a big Challenger

1085
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:51,999
Call of Duty expectedly service there's an efficiently service this without I going there all the time so we've have been

1086
00:45:55,583 --> 00:46:01,727
Analyze anything going wrong in the elevator before they go there

1087
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:05,055
Results of compliance Tango in in Germany

1088
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:09,151
I would say that are you know you need to inspect another that can yeast once a month

1089
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:12,479
I'm just going to stay

1090
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:14,271
It's once a year

1091
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:16,319
Germany's every month

1092
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:20,927
So you know

1093
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:21,695
Really helps

1094
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:28,351
Our customers in the service.

1095
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:36,031
Hotel or Hospital around Airport

1096
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:40,127
I would guarantee the up time and make sure

1097
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:43,199
Seven of the eight elevators are running all days

1098
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:48,063
And if they don't I'll pay you been up to you and that's penalties ready

1099
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:49,343
And takes the risk

1100
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:51,903
Let's hope we're going to be elevator space

1101
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:55,487
I will say this but more about

1102
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:58,047
How do you enable better service with a elevator

1103
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:01,375
Family doctor by insurance

1104
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:04,447
So they can confidently sell up time

1105
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:06,239
Wedding envelope time

1106
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:07,775
It does happen

1107
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:11,615
It's not Insurance paxton ma

1108
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:16,991
Okay so you have had a lot of experience in building out Revenue models for the iot

1109
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:23,135
What are some takeaways for small to medium-sized businesses who are looking at this and are saying

1110
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:24,927
And how do I get in on this

1111
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:29,535
What are the questions I should be asking themselves how should they be looking at their business at

1112
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:30,303
They want to try to

1113
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:36,703
