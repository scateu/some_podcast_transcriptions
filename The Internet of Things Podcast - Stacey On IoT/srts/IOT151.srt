All this Plus

15
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:36,864
We have our guest alexandros Marino's

16
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,400
Who is going to be talking about the

17
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:39,168
Best

18
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:43,264
And fastest growing iot Hardware platforms for both

19
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,800
Consumer prototyping

20
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:47,104
Consumer products at scale

21
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,128
The industrial internet

22
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:48,896
But first

23
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:52,224
Let's hear a message from our sponsor this week sponsor is

24
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:54,016
Ring

25
00:00:54,272 --> 00:01:00,416
Ring the connected doorbell and security camera maker Rings mission is to make neighborhood safer today

26
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:06,816
They over a million people use the ring video doorbell to help protect their hopes ring nose at home security

27
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:13,216
Who's at the front door but it doesn't end there so now they're extending the same level of security to the rest of your home with the ring floodlight cam

28
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:19,616
The floodlight cam is a motion-activated camera and floodlight that connects right to your phone

29
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:26,016
With HD video 2-way audio and more so you can see and speak to visitors and even set off an alarm

30
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:32,416
Rate from here I have tried the ring doorbell but I have not tried the ring floodlight cam

31
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:38,816
And I will say that I really enjoyed my ring doorbell it did its job super well with ring

32
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:45,216
You're always home so for listeners of our show save up to $150 on a ring

33
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:51,616
Ring security kit when you go to ring.com Stacey Stacey

34
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:54,432
So go to ring.com / Stacy

35
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:59,040
As you can get $150 off your ring security

36
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:01,088
Okay Kevin

37
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,368
We are back

38
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:04,160
With what are we going to

39
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:09,024
Machine learning at the edge we have to start with chips cuz that's your thing

40
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:10,560
I love that

41
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:11,840
Meet you

42
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,120
Potato chips

43
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,144
Keauhou

44
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,424
Yeah

45
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:17,216
Corn chips

46
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:18,752
Okay I'm sorry

47
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:19,520
I'm sorry

48
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:21,824
I am a little hungry but we're actually talk

49
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,848
Talking about

50
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:23,872
Doctors because

51
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:25,920
Who doesn't love a good semiconductor story

52
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:32,064
Basically what's happening is this week arm said that it is going to build a new architecture

53
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,368
For machine learning at the

54
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,136
The edge

55
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,160
In

56
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,184
This is

57
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:39,744
You don't just like mess up your architecture

58
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,024
For no apparent

59
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:45,632
But what they've decided is they need massive parallel processing

60
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,656
At the edge

61
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:47,680
At a very low power

62
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:50,496
They're doing this in a couple different ways

63
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:52,032
They're going to launch two different

64
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:55,616
Flavors of this when is an object detection flavor which is

65
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:57,664
For computer vision specifically

66
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:59,968
And then the other is just generic machine

67
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:01,504
The Edge and

68
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,784
Ho Kevin

69
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,088
Let's talk about why machine learning at the edge isn't

70
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:10,208
Well let me kick that all sin with a question to you

71
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,488
In terms of

72
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:13,024
Edge devices

73
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,400
What do you think these will find their way into

74
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,168
Cameras

75
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,984
I think also maybe some smart speakers

76
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:24,032
You probably will also see them

77
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:27,616
What cameras and smart speakers for the first initial

78
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,384
Wave of them

79
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:31,712
And I'll say that because cameras need to

80
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:34,528
If you can do object detection at the edge

81
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:37,088
And the other thing is we should say

82
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,880
There's two flavors of machinery

83
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:41,184
There's the training portion where you

84
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,976
Train the computer how to

85
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,000
Nice something in that takes

86
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,792
Typically is dead in the car

87
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,840
Because it takes massive computing

88
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:49,888
King Power massive parallel processing you should

89
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:50,656
Peter thousand

90
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:52,192
Thousands of images in there like

91
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:54,240
Learn how to recognize a dog versus a

92
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:57,312
And then there's the execution the inference

93
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:00,128
And that basically

94
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,248
Once you've trained a computer you've built a model and then that model gets executed at the end

95
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:12,160
So it's important to know that what are missing is they will actually be able to do both execution and some info

96
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,952
Prince at the edge

97
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:18,303
It is because you mentioned that you know the cloud

98
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:21,119
Approached I noticed in arms documentation

99
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:24,703
They have discussed neural network Frameworks and they

100
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:28,031
They say there no network software Translate

101
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:30,079
Google tensorflow for example

102
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,103
Which is

103
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,639
The big machine learning

104
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:37,503
Backbone of Google nearest tensorflow everywhere you wouldn't see it or hear call tensorflow

105
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:44,159
But a product delivers is coming to a lot of devices so I'm wondering and I know we don't discuss these on on the show

106
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:48,767
Show that much I'm wondering how many phone makers will integrate this and we see it first there

107
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:49,791
As it

108
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,071
Comes out to Iowa

109
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:54,399
T-Type devices the only reason I say that is because I know that

110
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:57,471
I said Huawei with their Kirin processors have

111
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:58,239
Some

112
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,775
Aai chip

113
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:02,335
In the now as well as

114
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:04,127
Who else is working on that

115
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,199
I want to say Samsung but not have any products right now

116
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,479
So I'm just wondering if

117
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:12,575
Bissell filter out through phones first and then float further to the edge

118
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:17,183
I imagine they will I also would say that we will see these for sure in 6

119
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:21,791
And possibly drones actually drones has a really interesting use

120
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:22,559
Case for something like

121
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:26,143
So I should correct something though because they have the two

122
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:29,471
Machine learning and then they have the object detection processors

123
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:32,799
The object detection processor will only do

124
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:35,871
Inference so basically that's not going to be training

125
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,407
You can't train enough

126
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,431
Section at the

127
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,527
Right so that's going to be providing the information

128
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:43,551
Royal

129
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:45,343
Rap

130
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,367
That's okay though

131
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:49,183
Weather saying this can do is they're going to have

132
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:49,951
You can show

133
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:51,743
People the direction they're facing

134
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:54,303
Hindu gesture and pose

135
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:58,655
And this is all based the object detection is based on their acquisition of apical

136
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,423
Colwich

137
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,191
I had

138
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:03,775
Talk 2 years ago was like super excited about him so pumped when are

139
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:07,103
I'm glad to see that acquisition finally met

140
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:12,735
And I don't know what else to tell you guys about this other than

141
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:18,111
They're not alone there's a lot of

142
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:24,767
In a moment this is called project Trillium so if you see

143
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:25,791
References to that

144
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:29,375
You guys we should see the object detection processor

145
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,935
We're not going to expect any silicon-based on this

146
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,983
Until mid-to-late 2019

147
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,263
At the earliest

148
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,799
So that means it's not actually good

149
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:38,591
B&N products

150
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,359
Until like

151
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,919
So this is far-reaching

152
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:44,735
Right because arm doesn't make chips they just create the

153
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,015
The architecture of that

154
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,039
Jamaica reviews

155
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,135
Call Apple

156
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:53,951
Immediate acne

157
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:56,511
Aura Plano license and they will

158
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:01,887
This might not sound like it's related but I'm going to it is something to mention it

159
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,423
Apparently the hive

160
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,727
Camera uses a first generation

161
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:08,031
OD chip from based on arm

162
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:10,079
This is the second OD

163
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:12,383
Generation chip from arm or architecture

164
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,407
From our mission say

165
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,967
Alan just wondering I'm not familiar with the hive

166
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:16,735
Camera

167
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:22,111
Send wondering what kind of object detection that has Hive is from British gas it's there

168
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:26,463
It's sold in the UK and that's because this isn't actually from our mats from Apple

169
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,743
Which is the company that

170
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,279
Icing

171
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,839
Yes it does have object detection

172
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:32,607
It is

173
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:33,631
I think it's

174
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,399
Facial

175
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,423
I think it's facial

176
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:36,959
Ignition

177
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:40,031
But I don't know beyond much beyond that

178
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:42,591
Curious hi-vis actual

179
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,359
Planning

180
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,943
They're trying to build their US

181
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,527
It's a subscription-based service.

182
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:52,319
That was so it's you get the hardware and you

183
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,087
Pay the money

184
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,367
It's lovely

185
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,927
Little bit about that okay

186
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,975
Let's move on to

187
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,535
Amazon

188
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,327
So

189
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:07,679
But Amazon is actually so the big news this week was

190
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:10,239
Last December when Amazon acquired

191
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:13,055
Blink which was the wireless the battery

192
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:13,823
Empowered

193
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:14,591
Camera

194
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:16,127
And they also make a doorbell

195
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:20,991
So when Amazon acquired blank it was a deal valued at about 90 million dollars which

196
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:21,759
Pets

197
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:27,391
The interesting thing is and I said this last December is that blink is not just a camera maker

198
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,927
It actually made a

199
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:29,951
Add imagery

200
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:30,975
Ignition chip

201
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:33,535
Ecology a video it's actually a video processing

202
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,327
Chip and

203
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,119
It did it at super low power

204
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,143
Empathize

205
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,935
Buy the chip company

206
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:43,263
Me and we're selling these chips for like five bucks to like DVD Maker

207
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,287
And this is

208
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,311
No prop

209
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,591
Just terrible business for

210
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:50,431
So they were like what else could we use this more and they decided to build a video game

211
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:52,735
I want to make use of their technology

212
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,271
And that's how blank was for

213
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:57,855
So Amazon when they bought link they got that shipped

214
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:00,415
In addition to that

215
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:06,303
The information is reporting that Amazon is developing a chip design for artificial intelligence

216
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,583
Twerk on the echo

217
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,607
Other Hardware

218
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:10,655
Powered by Madame

219
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:15,007
So is story if any information is talking about Amazon's acquisition of a

220
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,311
Company a couple years ago called Annapurna

221
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:22,943
Annapurna was doing networking chips and they were dealing primarily with a software layer of

222
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:23,967
Networking

223
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:26,271
So creating basically they call it a fabric

224
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:29,855
Fabrics are used to manage

225
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:32,415
Moving information around the chip is probably the

226
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:33,439
Best way to describe it

227
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:34,719
You think that's fair

228
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:35,999
Lancaster

229
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:38,303
Okay so Annapurna is a fabric

230
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:41,119
And when you're talk about machine learning

231
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:43,423
This is super important because

232
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:48,031
When I talk about machine learning it keeps saying the word massively parallel processes

233
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:51,103
And that's exactly how these jobs are divided up so you

234
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,127
You send

235
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:55,199
One job to One Core another job to another core in

236
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:58,015
So on and so on but you need a fabric to manage all

237
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,319
Until annapurna's good at that

238
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,343
And then we got it

239
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,111
The blink

240
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:04,415
Video processing so that makes sense

241
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,463
And then Amazon has its own chip design

242
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,231
Singer sew

243
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,791
I think we're going to see is some

244
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,839
Intelligence at the edge

245
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:12,607
Happening

246
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:15,679
And it sounds like it's going to happen both from

247
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:21,311
Companies that are traditional ship providers but also if you're going to be building consumer Hardware you're going to need to do it yourself

248
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,895
And I'm wondering a couple things about this

249
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:27,967
Totally see where this is going on agree with you

250
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:31,039
The first thing I thought I could ever was talking about Otis

251
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:34,623
Speed this is going to bring to Matt amazed responses is going to be amazing

252
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,415
Everybody kept focusing on that and like

253
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:43,071
Oh yeah but also I think there may be something here when you push a lot of that intelligence away from the cloud down

254
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:43,839
The edge

255
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,887
You improved

256
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,167
Perception of privacy

257
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:52,287
And that's something that right now all of these smart speakers

258
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,311
SAR fighting

259
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:56,895
You know nobody wants these always on microphone send me all the information on the cloud

260
00:10:57,151 --> 00:11:00,223
If you can do all of it with ML at the edge

261
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,759
And not rely on the cloud

262
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:04,063
That really helps with that area I think

263
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:06,879
It does the question then becomes what data does get

264
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:07,647
Pushed off bridge

265
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,415
Cuz you do need

266
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,719
And eventually when you can actually do

267
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:13,535
Training at the edge then you actually

268
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,559
Get the opportunity

269
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:17,375
Personalized Services until then

270
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,399
Depersonalization.

271
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,959
Right right

272
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:27,103
And the other thing that jumped out at me on this is a definite Trend you're obviously I didn't know about the on Trillium when this

273
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,383
Amazon news came out

274
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:32,479
But it relates back to that everybody seems to be making

275
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:35,039
Chips for the edge for their own products

276
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:41,439
Such as apple is using its A8 processor from the iPhone 6 or 7 I forget which

277
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,975
In the homepod freezing

278
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:46,815
Now you'll see Amazon devices eventually have this

279
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,351
Google has been

280
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,375
Talk about with

281
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,399
Creating their own

282
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,679
Soces and such

283
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:52,959
Need the visual

284
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:56,031
That's right they did they did which is

285
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,847
At the TV is exact

286
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:03,199
Exactly so it's definitely a trend and I'm wondering in Amazon

287
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,479
Case particular

288
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:08,575
Will this be limited to Amazon Hardware only and I'm going to guess

289
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,343
Yes

290
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,879
And the reason I'm saying yes

291
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:14,463
As a guess is because they let you freely use

292
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:20,095
Maddie Mae's voice services but there are very specific features and functions that are not on

293
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:23,423
Non Amazon devices with matinees voice services

294
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:26,495
I'm just under the wondering if Amazon keeps that chip

295
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,287
Feature set

296
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,311
In the house

297
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:38,015
Well it but then again they also cut off potential Hardware partner such as you know the Sonos example has Madame a in it

298
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:40,063
I can't do everything that an echo can do but I do

299
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,343
90% of it

300
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,367
What date

301
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,647
Want to

302
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,695
Check all these Hardware manufacturers off

303
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,535
So

304
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,583
That's a good thing to think about Kevin

305
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:54,143
All right I will I will think about it

306
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,679
Meanwhile

307
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:57,215
We will move on to Google

308
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:59,775
Hiring a Samsung executive

309
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:02,079
To focus on iot

310
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,103
Specifically

311
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:04,127
In the cloud

312
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:10,015
And not just any executive either this is the guy his name is in John R E

313
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:13,343
He used to be the EVP and head of Samsung pay

314
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:19,743
This goes back about two-and-a-half years ago and he was instrumental with Bixby

315
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,023
So

316
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,815
And it's interesting because I

317
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:25,631
What did I read I read something this week oh I don't know it was

318
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:28,191
There's an interview with Google Rick osterloh

319
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:33,055
There's a really good interview about getting Google AI into all of Google's product

320
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:36,639
The one question I didn't see asked or maybe was asking was an answer his

321
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:39,967
What is a think of Madame a in Bixby and other

322
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:44,063
Named you no assistance I want to name them all because I don't set a resources up

323
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:49,183
I'd be very curious to see what Google thinks but now that got somebody who's coming from the Bixby fold

324
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,207
Indeed

325
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,231
So

326
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,511
I think this is a good

327
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:54,559
Story Samsung actually has built

328
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,839
A really good

329
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,887
Cloud business believe it or not

330
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:01,471
There used to be Arctic now it's SmartThings cloud

331
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:04,287
Their focus on connecting everything

332
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,079
Is a neutral third party

333
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:09,407
It is really easy to use even I have actually use

334
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:15,295
I'm kind of stunned by that but it's a good implementation and I know I talk to people who are

335
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,063
Using them

336
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:16,831
So

337
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:19,135
To the extent of this guy worked on

338
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,671
The Knox security system

339
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:21,695
Spigen Samsung

340
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:25,791
How much time he spent on their Cloud stuff

341
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:26,559
But

342
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:30,143
If you can bring that Samsung really is trying to be this neutral

343
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:36,799
Play right so if you can bring some of that okay coming from inside

344
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:39,615
Google and I know I can talk about this plus my own just

345
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:41,151
Research into this

346
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:44,479
Samsung is very very good at

347
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,759
Acting neutral

348
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:46,783
But

349
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:52,415
In the real world at the end of the day same songs in it for Samsung and I say that because

350
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:54,975
They often recreate things that

351
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:56,767
Android already has

352
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,047
Maybe doesn't do well

353
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,351
A lot of what's in Android actually did

354
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:03,935
Come from Samsung split screen multitasking on a phone

355
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:06,495
Samsung did it first with their Galaxy Note 2

356
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:07,519
Eventually

357
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,055
Android just accepted it

358
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:13,151
Samsung's Knox which is there security system for Android devices

359
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,175
In the Enterprise

360
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,479
That was competing head-to-head with

361
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:17,247
Google

362
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,783
Android Enterprise stop

363
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:21,343
Sure enough after about 2 or 3 years of competing

364
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:23,903
Google said you know we're going to be working agreement out

365
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,695
An integrated Knox

366
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,975
Features into

367
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:29,023
Android not to still separate but

368
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:29,791
Google

369
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:33,375
Subsumes a lot of what Samsung does and obviously Samsung

370
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,655
Compensated for that

371
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,703
And I'm wondering in this case

372
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:41,567
I'm wondering if either part of their Cloud business if they got some expertise that Google doesn't have

373
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:43,359
Or with their digital assistant

374
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:48,735
If there are some things Bixby does more efficiently or or does that Google Assistant doesn't do

375
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:53,087
You watch give it a year or so and it'll get subsumed into Google

376
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,111
Okay well that's

377
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:54,879
That doesn't

378
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:55,903
Sound terrible

379
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,975
Oh no not at all not at all

380
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:04,095
No knocks when I say this I don't mean don't expect Bixby replace Google Assistant

381
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:08,703
Probably still live on its own on Samsung devices

382
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:09,983
Or unless

383
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:11,519
And best case I think for users

384
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:14,591
Bixby and Google Assistant just become the best

385
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:16,127
Read in one product

386
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:21,503
And that product would be Google Assistant course and it would go on all Samsung phones and

387
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,343
Bixby would essentially disappear inside of Google Assistant

388
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:26,879
I need weather

389
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:31,231
I have three in my room right now so yes I agree

390
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:34,303
Netflix PS3 controller systems

391
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,095
You could have four

392
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:40,191
Galaxy S8 yes but I'm not going to do that right now

393
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,215
Okay

394
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:42,495
Moving on from

395
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:45,311
Google Samsung the Mysteries they weave

396
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:48,127
Let's talk about a new radio in Wareham

397
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:55,295
Yeah this surprise me I don't really know too much I just got a press release before the show from Altair semiconductor

398
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:59,135
And they announced their collaboration with Ericsson and Sony mobile

399
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,159
What they're going to do it

400
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:02,975
Mobile World Congress is demonstrate

401
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,255
A new wearable device

402
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:09,119
Well it's a wristband for diabetic patients that connects to a continuous glucose monitoring device

403
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:16,031
The interesting part is we seen these kinds of things before they're using Altair's lte-m chips

404
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,823
Set for cellular connectivity

405
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,103
Without so you can

406
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,127
Center data back

407
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,407
Cheetah monitoring system

408
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,687
Without having your phone

409
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,991
It's always interesting because when we talk about

410
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:27,295
You know Cat 1 ml tem Etc

411
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:30,623
We talked about a lot of devices at the edge that

412
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:33,695
Run for long time on a battery so that's why

413
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:35,743
You know they use low-power radios and so on

414
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:39,071
Not wearable devices so this is kind of interesting to me

415
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,863
I agree and you fight

416
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:43,679
I mean you got your Apple watch with its own

417
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:44,959
Sim and

418
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:45,983
Is 4 G

419
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:52,127
It's not yet said at least 10 with an LTE connection

420
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:55,455
It makes sense to have this direct line out

421
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,223
4

422
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:58,271
You got to send that data

423
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,551
To the cloud to be monitored

424
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,343
And I assume

425
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,367
Especially for like

426
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,903
Elderly or children

427
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:08,767
You actually don't want to just collect in store for a while cuz if something's wrong you need to be able to

428
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:13,887
Writes the funny thing is he just only cuz you brought the Apple watch

429
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:20,543
Apps and really not been built to take advantage of the LTE Connection by that I mean I leave my phone at home and I'll go

430
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,079
Go out for a few hours at a time

431
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:25,663
Sure I get messages I get phone calls I can chat with you Stacy him

432
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:26,687
Cetera

433
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:31,551
When I go run for example all that data is captured with GPS heart rate and so on

434
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:34,367
I have to actually go back home and

435
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,927
Think it over through to my phone

436
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,975
I can't do that remotely

437
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:42,559
You can't go to it may make sense for now from ABBA

438
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:43,583
Perspective

439
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:45,887
Not a lot of data

440
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:50,495
People use anything set for phone calls use it for a phone call I can tell you

441
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:53,567
You lose 1% per minute on a phone call that's why

442
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:57,407
If you are not spending our on the phone you're going to lose 60% of your

443
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,687
Apple watch battery life

444
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:02,783
And I mean that is another example though

445
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:07,391
You're still get it's not much data but every little bit counts I mean if I start thinking

446
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,671
At the data that just goes back

447
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,207
IPhone to the cloud

448
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:12,255
Right as rain

449
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:18,143
True beauty but even so you could optimize like in a health situation cuz it's modern my my heart rate

450
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:22,751
It doesn't need to send all that heart rate data back to the cloud or anywhere until I get home anyway

451
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:26,591
Unless maybe there's a some smarts in there says hey

452
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:28,895
This guy might be having a heart attack or something right now

453
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:31,711
That day and you ain't get sent on the always-on connection

454
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:33,247
You don't have to send all the day

455
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,039
That's true and that's where we're

456
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,063
See some really cool stuff

457
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:37,855
The hierarchy

458
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,135
Activation

459
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:41,695
Is what they call it and it's basically you have a chip

460
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:42,975
It senses something

461
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:45,279
And that it's it takes the next action so

462
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:49,631
You have something that says oh this is a trigger I recognize that that is a trigger

463
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:53,215
And it's important and I'm going to wake up something else so I can wake up the

464
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:54,751
Modem and say

465
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,287
Home

466
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,615
I got to bring back the machine learning in the chips back into this

467
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:01,151
Okay

468
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:02,431
I know you're disappointed with

469
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,199
Apps

470
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:06,527
Let's talk about

471
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:09,343
Something fun that we missed last week

472
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:10,623
List two things last

473
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:11,903
1

474
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,207
We missed Intel smart glasses which were about to talk about

475
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:14,975
Into

476
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:16,767
We miss celebrating our hundred

477
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:17,535
50th Park

478
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:19,327
That's right we did

479
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,167
So let's talk about those glasses

480
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,495
Yeah and I was very interested in this only because I

481
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:29,055
Purchase. I was reimbursed for it through work

482
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,359
Google Glass back in 2014

483
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:36,223
Still have them don't use them obviously not a successful product at least in the way that

484
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:37,247
Google might have holes

485
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,527
It has been used in

486
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:40,831
Certain verticals in Enterprise right now but

487
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:41,599
Other than that

488
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:43,135
Nope can't buy everything

489
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:46,975
Intel smart glasses are similar but different and are different enough

490
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:49,279
To have a lot more potential in my opinion

491
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:50,559
Because they do less

492
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,839
What I mean by that is

493
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:52,607
They

494
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:53,631
Willie r a

495
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:54,399
A notification

496
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,679
Open system for the most part

497
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:57,471
They're also don't look like

498
00:20:57,727 --> 00:21:01,055
Anything from futuristic they look like regular glasses frames

499
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:06,687
Are all of the chips and battery and connectivity inside the side of the frames

500
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:13,087
You can't even see them there's no prism display actually sticking out from these things like Google Glass head instead there's a prism

501
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:14,367
Built into the glass

502
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,391
And IT projects

503
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:18,464
Using a low-power laser right on your retina

504
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,768
From the prism notifications

505
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,560
It does one thing and one thing

506
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:24,608
Very well and it doesn't look

507
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:25,376
Outrageous

508
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:27,936
So I'm looking forward to seeing what

509
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:33,312
Might be done with them this isn't something until it's going to sell that you're going to have a developer

510
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:36,384
Preview where people can try and write apps for it later this year

511
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:37,920
And

512
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:42,784
I'm countries have even come to Market because there was talk about until selling off its AR

513
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:45,600
Group elements I guess I will have to say

514
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:49,440
Do you know to me this I know people could be like Oar but I'm just like

515
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,976
Let's just talk about the

516
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:53,280
Power of a heads-up display for

517
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:55,328
Ito think about turn-by-turn directions

518
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:57,376
You know when you're walking around the city

519
00:21:57,632 --> 00:22:00,704
Right now my phone will vibrate but I still don't know if I'm supposed to turn right or low

520
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:04,288
I just look at the Sun

521
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:06,848
How awesome would it be to be talking to someone in

522
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,384
Have some sort of indication of

523
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,152
Who this is

524
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:10,432
That's just me cuz I

525
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:11,968
Faces really well

526
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:15,552
Well you even also need a camera for that nice have no camera

527
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:17,088
Okay that is true

528
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:18,880
You know who people are based on their

529
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:20,160
Pair Bluetooth or Wi-Fi

530
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:21,696
We're not supposed to

531
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:25,024
Best part of that privacy of

532
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:27,072
Okay so no camera

533
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,608
I will be sad I will be sad

534
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:30,912
A little while ago speakers no mic

535
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:31,936
Oh so I can talk to

536
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:33,216
I don't believe so

537
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:39,616
This reminds me of the Amazon Echo cuz when it came out very early all it did was you

538
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:42,944
Yeah

539
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:49,344
I remember the search engine so it couldn't answer that many questions I couldn't control Smart

540
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,648
I'm devices it just basically played music and

541
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:54,464
Set timers for lights why I didn't buy one man

542
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,840
You didn't buy one but enough people did in the use case became gradually soap

543
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:00,608
Compelling

544
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:02,400
Look at us now

545
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:08,032
Oh yeah once once they made it smarter you know switch on the troll that's when I go bowling absolutely

546
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:09,568
And so I I like

547
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:12,640
Having some of my favorite devices just do something really well

548
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:15,200
I think there's a lot of power

549
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:16,992
So I'm Nina on

550
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:17,760
This

551
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:19,296
Especially someone who wears glass

552
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:22,624
All right

553
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,696
Let us move on to Z home pod

554
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,232
Because

555
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:28,512
Kevin

556
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:31,328
Neither of us really wanted to order it

557
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,864
But we decided we had to

558
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,888
Because you guys

559
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:35,168
Really have a lot of questions

560
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:42,080
Either it's funny and it just goes back to what I just said I didn't

561
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:44,384
Want to buy the Echo and first came out

562
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,688
For the same reason or reasons that I

563
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:49,760
Don't want it by VIN by the homepod when it came out

564
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:53,600
There's two things to talk about with alpine obviously there's the sound

565
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:54,880
And then there's the smarts

566
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:59,488
Unfortunately in my opinion the smarts actually went into the sound meaning

567
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:01,024
Sonically engineered

568
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,560
Apple did an excellent

569
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:03,584
Excellent job

570
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,864
It doesn't

571
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,984
Doesn't blow me away like it did the early reviewers and a lot of early reviewers

572
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:13,568
Got a I'm just going to say they got a dog and pony show from Apple

573
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:20,224
An apple showed off the speaker and compare it to certain other speakers but I have since found out the set up on those was not the same

574
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,272
I'm like one of those speakers with setup for Bluetooth

575
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:24,064
Instead of Wi-Fi I mean so

576
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,392
I get why Apple does that and appreciate that but

577
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:33,024
It just doesn't blow me away it is really really good for a single unit device

578
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:38,400
I don't want a single speaker because it has multiple speakers at 7 tweeters and and 1 woofer

579
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:40,192
And it does sound good

580
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:43,264
It's got the smarts the intelligence to auto-tune itself

581
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:47,616
When you first put it down it will sample sound in the room you don't even hear it

582
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:50,944
And it will consider yourself for the room that you're in which is great

583
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,248
It'll do that again every time you move it

584
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:54,016
Unfortunately

585
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:58,368
I don't see the benefit of that because you plug this thing and you're not going to move it that much so

586
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:00,416
That's neither here nor there

587
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:03,744
Okay

588
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,280
My daughter

589
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:08,096
Takes her Amazon Echo it's in her room

590
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,680
And she brings it into the bathroom for getting ready

591
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:12,704
And bats

592
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,472
So

593
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:15,008
She actually moves her Echo back

594
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,568
Because she doesn't have a tap

595
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:23,968
That's what I do I use the tap the tap I move around all the time

596
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,296
The point there is it psychic

597
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,344
Case where someone

598
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:33,440
No doubt no doubt I don't think the majority of

599
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:34,976
Imposter going to be moving

600
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,000
Is my point

601
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:38,560
But anyway

602
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:39,328
So

603
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,400
Just one more point about the sound before I talk about the smarts

604
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:45,728
I did a blind listening test with

605
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:47,520
Different music genres

606
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:50,336
I did the best I could to make it as equal as possible

607
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:56,480
Setting the sound levels to be the same now I did it with the homepod and I did it with a pair of Sonos ones

608
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:57,760
And one of my

609
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:00,320
Tech savvy friends came over listen and he's like

610
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,344
Using two speakers

611
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,880
I am

612
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:04,416
Musical ly

613
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:07,232
Because they're the same price and he's like when you can

614
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:09,280
Put that into the equation instead of course you can

615
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:12,352
I said you have $349 to buy a

616
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:13,376
Homepod

617
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:15,680
Then you need to compare to what else do you get free money

618
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:17,728
Temperature in $49 you can get to sauna

619
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:23,104
He couldn't really tell much of a difference nobody really could affect people who had a preference

620
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,640
Amazon

621
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:26,432
It was the best speaker but it was

622
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:28,224
The preferred sound for them

623
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,784
Was actually the pair of Sonos once more often than not

624
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:33,344
So I don't know that surprises people or

625
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:36,928
Whatever but Sonos is the pioneers of smart speak

626
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:39,232
They've been doing

627
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:41,280
Similar things to this for

628
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:42,304
4 years

629
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:45,888
Yeah they have and I'll say I'll give Apple Credit here

630
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:49,728
Insulate improve the experience in terms of setup it's very simple

631
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:50,752
In terms of

632
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:54,080
Using integration with apple music obviously it

633
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:55,616
That's all integrates with right now

634
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:59,456
That just works with Sonos it does that but it kind of

635
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:01,760
There's like Steps wooden steps to do that right

636
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:08,160
So they offer more but still more complicated if you just want to drop dead simple plug it in and start playing Apple music

637
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:11,232
From a smart standpoint I am shocked

638
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:14,048
And I said this in my written review

639
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,096
Siri is fragmented now

640
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:19,168
Siri does not work the same or does it have the same features

641
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:21,216
From an iOS device to the homepod

642
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:25,824
And that just boggles my mind there are things you can't do you can't set two timers you can't

643
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,128
Access your calendar create an event

644
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:29,920
It's just really strange

645
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:36,064
It just seems like it's Half Baked and the kind of goes along with some of the other features that aren't there that are coming in that is

646
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,600
Multi-room audio and

647
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:39,648
Blinking Twitty's for stereo

648
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:40,672
That's coming but

649
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:42,464
It's just odd to me but

650
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:45,280
Siri is very responsive as you'd expect

651
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:46,304
Besame

652
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,840
A trip inside

653
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:48,864
The

654
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,656
Microphones for listening

655
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:52,448
Apple Mail. You can

656
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:54,240
You don't have to yell even if the music is

657
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:55,008
Is crank way up

658
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:55,776
It's really good

659
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:57,056
But again

660
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:59,360
If you aren't in apple music if you're not

661
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:01,408
On iOS if you're not using homekit

662
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:04,224
This just isn't going to be able to buy the father

663
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:06,016
It does not appeal to me

664
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:13,184
What the funny thing is I actually do use iOS and I am an apple music subscriber family is

665
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:16,512
But I still wouldn't buy this right now

666
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:20,352
At this is again it's just like the Amazon Echo I wouldn't buy when it first came out

667
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:22,144
It wasn't compelling enough for the time

668
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:25,728
Alright well if you have homekit questions for Kevin

669
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,776

This week

689
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:03,616
We have a question

690
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:04,384
From

691
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:07,200
Intellicast

692
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:08,224
Some sexy hair

693

Selena Quintanilla

694
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,272
What question

695
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:15,648
Teenage suicide walk to the younger one

696
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:18,208
When I went to go and set up the calendar

697
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:19,744
Spotify music

698
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:22,048
Unlimited

699
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:24,864
Change it

700
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:25,888
And then music

701
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:27,936
At the moment I'm stuck with

702
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:34,336
Oh my God

703
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:36,640
Is there a way that I can change.

704
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:39,200
Music

705
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:39,968
Sitel

706
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:43,040
I'm playlist to calendars on Outlook

707
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:47,648
Okay Sam

708
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:48,928
This is a

709
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:51,232
Pain point near and dear to my heart

710
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:52,000
Heart

711
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:56,352
Because I have been trying to use my Spotify account on Amazon Echo

712
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:58,144
Without using only mine

713
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,424
I've been trying to let my daughter

714
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:01,216
Use hers cuz we have the

715
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:02,496
Premium Spotify

716
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:04,032
Has multiple accounts

717
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:05,312
By golly it doesn't work

718
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:08,640
So I hate to tell you this you're going to have to either lie

719
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:09,408
Or

720
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:10,176
Supper

721
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,296
Depending on their ages

722
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:16,576
Depending on their ages

723
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:20,928
So my daughter is under the age of 13 so the only thing she can be

724
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:22,720
In the Amazon Echo universe

725
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:23,744
Is

726
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,768
Part of my household

727
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:26,304
But she can't actually

728
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,888
Have her email affiliated with anything except for allowances

729
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:31,936
And her Kindle like

730
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:33,984
The free time Kindle Freetime stuff

731
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:34,752
So

732
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:35,520
I can't

733
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:37,568
Associate her email address with

734
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:39,104
The calendar or with

735
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,128
R Spotify

736
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:42,176
Because she's underage

737
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:43,968
After she's 13

738
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:46,784
Cuz of the Copa act the

739
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,064
Children's online

740
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,856
Protection privacy protection

741
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,416
Danny Amazon can take her email

742
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:53,440
I guess start

743
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:55,232
Mission Mater

744
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:56,768
Then she can use it

745
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:03,168
So in that case all you have to do is register those devices for each of your daughters

746
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:04,704
To their account

747
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:07,520
So you would have to have an Amazon account

748
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:10,848
You would register those devices and then you would link

749
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:12,384
All of your accounts is a

750
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,152
Family

751
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:17,504
Kind of complicated but to register the device you go into the

752
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,528
Anime app

753
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,320
You going to settings

754
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:23,904
And you're going to see all of the different Amazon Echo devices in your

755
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:24,672
Household

756
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:25,952
There

757
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:29,024
It's Going Down Under about it'll say the device is registered

758
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:29,792
Burgess Owens

759
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,584
If it's registered to you

760
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:34,912
Because which it probably is if you bought it just deregister it

761
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:36,704
When you do that

762
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,984
You're going to

763
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:38,752
Connected to

764
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:39,520
Your daughters are

765
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:42,592
And I did actually brings up a point that I

766
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:44,384
Probably should have mentioned in the homepod

767
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,664
That because

768
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:52,064
This is a lot like iCloud in Family Sharing iOS I wanted to mention that the homepod only supports one

769
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:56,160
User One Voice one iCloud account right now so multiple people in the home

770
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,952
Will not be recognized

771
00:31:58,464 --> 00:31:59,488
Everybody's one user

772
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:01,792
And that's a problem for your personal information

773
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:02,816
Oh that is a problem

774
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:04,608
And you find the

775
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:07,936
Household like you find the area about who you're at a household with

776
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:09,984
Under the same settings menu

777
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,776
But instead of going to each and

778
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:15,104
Official twice she keep scrolling and scrolling until you get to

779
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:17,152
There's a section that says in a household

780
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:18,432
With these people

781
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:21,504
I believe you have to set up your household

782
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:25,088
From the Amazon account itself on the web

783
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,368
You can't do it for

784
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:27,136
Fitness app

785
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:28,928
So that is

786
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:32,256
That is how I've done it I don't see a way to do it otherwise

787
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:35,328
I may be wrong but it makes sense actually the

788
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:36,864
Tear

789
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:39,680
And I believe it has to be mutual

790
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:41,728
Excommunication but

791
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:43,008
About setting up

792
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:46,080
The benefit is you can share your Kindle books

793
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:49,152
Guess that's

794
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,992
That is our answer for you

795
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:55,040
If any of you have questions

796
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:57,088
Give us a call at 5 1/2

797
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:58,112
6 to 3

798
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:59,648
742 4

799
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:00,928
And now

800
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:02,976
I believe it is time for us to

801
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:07,328
Say goodbye to each other Kevin and move along to our guests this week

802
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:11,168
Who is Alexandra spiritos the CEO of resin IO

803
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:12,448
It sounds esoteric

804
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:15,008
It's he doesn't his company does containers at the edge

805
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:16,032
Basically

806
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:19,104
The whole conversation is about what people are using

807
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:21,920
To build their iot devices on

808
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:24,480
And what it takes to actually create

809
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:27,040
Something that's resilient enough for the Internet of Things

810
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:29,344
Musical guest so stay tuned

811
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:39,072
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast

812
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:41,888
This is your house Stacey Higginbotham

813
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:45,472
Is Alex burritos who is the CEO of

814
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:46,752
Resin IO

815
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:56,224
I am super excited because

816
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,832
Is super pumped because we're going to be talking about development platforms

817
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:03,648
Industrial Enterprise

818
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,952
And there's a whole lot of stuff change

819
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:07,488
Like a whole lot of stuff on the market now

820
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,560
Before we get into that

821
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:15,680
We want to let people know who you are so why don't you tell us a little bit about resume

822
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:16,704
And

823
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:17,728
What you're doing there

824
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:20,544
Tono Rosario is a

825
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:22,592
Containerized payloads

826
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:24,640
Two embedded devices attached devices

827
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:27,712
So we built all of it to again

828
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:29,760
You need to really get

829
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:31,296
Golang for structure of the way

830
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:34,112
And just deploy code to your devices wherever they aren't

831
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:37,696
The big idea here is containers at the edge

832
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:40,512
And we should probably explain a little bit about

833
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:42,048
Why that matters so much

834
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:43,328
Coyote

835
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,352
Oh absolutely

836
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:45,888
We were

837
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:46,912
Developers at work

838
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,216
Focus on cloud Technologies

839
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:51,264
We kind of had landed on this project

840
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:55,616
What we call today as confused and this was a biggest problem with sound

841
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:57,408
Updating this device is managed

842
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:00,480
Incredibly difficult

843
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:02,528
While in the cloud we had this

844
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:03,296
Credibly

845
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:04,576
Great experience

846
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:06,880
Wish you no single command so if they ever

847
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:08,160
Everything at the same time

848
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,952
The devices we actually we're back

849
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:12,512
The eighties we were literally going around

850
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:13,536
USB sticks

851
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,608
Egg containers

852
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,400
We found essentially the loop

853
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:19,680
Well that allows us to

854
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:22,496
Through that half all of us

855
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:24,032
Toddler clothes that we know and love

856
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:25,312
Tootie's devices

857
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:27,360
So which containers we can update the device

858
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:28,896
Without rebooting them if something goes

859
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:29,664
What's wrong

860
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,200
You can put update them again

861
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:33,760
There's a host operating system underneath

862
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:36,320
If anything goes wrong

863
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:37,600
And that level of

864
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:39,136
Virtualization react

865
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:40,928
It's for my personalization that we

866
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:42,208
We're never able to have

867
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,744
Previously on his devices

868
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,280
It really

869
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:46,304
Changes development

870
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,584
Entirely

871
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,376
Feel while not identical

872
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:51,936
To Cloud developments that's feel a lot more like it

873
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:55,008
Flexibility a little bit of

874
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:56,544
Comfort

875
00:35:57,312 --> 00:36:00,384
I want to say certainty because nothing really

876
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:01,920
Miss World

877
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:06,272
Who are they

878
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:08,064
Who are our customers with

879
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,368
Colton Fleet owners they are people

880
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,392
We're like

881
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:12,928
Used to be house

882
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:14,464
$100,000

883
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,048
They need to manage and they are

884
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,072
Geographically

885
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:25,472
So they have this problem on their hands and honestly they don't want to focus on if they have other things they need to

886
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:28,800
Development of the machine learning or the digital signage or

887
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:31,616
Tidal turbines or whatever it is that

888
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:32,640
Pair device

889
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:33,664
To do that software

890
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,432
Not

891
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:36,224
Focus on how do I get my

892
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,040
Container from A to B how do I make sure I keep running

893
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:43,904
So when you guys started out one of the cool things that you did was reported a doctor

894
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,440
Container to arm basilica

895
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:46,976
Talk to me about

896
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:48,768
Is determined

897
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:50,560
What does audience mean

898
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:52,608
We were very privileged

899
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:53,376
Because we

900
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:54,656
Really we're building for RC

901
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:58,752
So our initial Vision was actually we need to build Heroku variety

902
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,032
We need this one command

903
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:00,800
That you

904
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:03,104
So baidu

905
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,664
Pulling on that thread will realize the Roku was using

906
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,200
Innerstand docker

907
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:08,992
Was very early days anyway

908
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:10,272
0.40

909
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:11,296
6 I mean

910
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:12,320
2013

911
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:13,600
So we found that

912
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,928
When you that this was going to be big but it wasn't

913
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:17,696
Support arm

914
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:18,464
So

915
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,488
We essentially

916
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:22,560
Are we going to do our own thing or are we going to try to make

917
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:25,120
We decided we were a small teams in

918
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:26,912
Want to really reinvent the wheel

919
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:28,960
So

920
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:29,984
We decided to just

921
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,264
Primate Docker work

922
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,544
That's that's what we do

923
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,152
Time again

924
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:38,432
And that's really how I

925
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:39,200
People start noticing

926
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:40,224
Because of her

927
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:40,992
Got sort of

928
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:42,784
The first Sterling better container

929
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,064
It's okay if working

930
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,600
Of course in the beginning

931
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:46,880
Confused about why would you even

932
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:48,672
I want to do this

933
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:50,464
I like now we know why

934
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:51,744
Cuz now we're all

935
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,048
Absolutely

936
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:58,144
So right now you're in a unique position to see

937
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,448
What people are put in your platform

938
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:03,520
As they try to start building

939
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:06,592
So what kind of development platforms are

940
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:07,616
Using

941
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:13,760
So we would definitely see something that I think a lot of people are seeing but maybe you're not realizing how intense it is

942
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:15,808
Which is at the Raspberry Pi is just in

943
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:16,832
Incredibly

944
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:19,392
So we will see you at

945
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:20,672
Of course I mean

946
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:22,208
Basic projects

947
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,232
Makers

948
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:24,256
Universal students

949
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:26,304
I will also see it in the biggest companies

950
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,096
In the world and prototyping

951
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:28,864
We will see you then

952
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:29,632
In startups

953
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:31,168
And then we see it in product

954
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:32,192
Tamuct production

955
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:35,520
Let me see it a lot further along than anybody ever imagine

956
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:37,824
So that's definitely something that if you

957
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:40,896
UCR for athletes that start with B

958
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:41,664
A very visible

959
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:42,944
But stand out

960
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,480
There is definitely

961
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:47,296
Another Trend there around the in Tillamook

962
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:48,832
Which is something that Intel did

963
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:51,648
Thinking about it exactly this way but this is

964
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:56,768
To the space if you just things that nobody thought cut that way this is used when you want more power

965
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,304
More processing power

966
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:01,632
Look you know what size 5x7

967
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:02,656
Computers

968
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:09,056
Yes in French

969
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:10,080
See

970
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:13,152
Exactly I think it needs a next unit of computing

971
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:14,688
That is exactly what it mean

972
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:20,064
See another very exciting

973
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:21,856
Picking up which is

974
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:23,136
Around the Nvidia RTX

975
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:24,416
Pontiacs to family

976
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:25,952
So you have it

977
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:30,048
Essentially a fairly powerful arm chip but then a very very powerful GPU there

978
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,328
Baidu deep learning

979
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:33,632
These ones haven't scheduled yet

980
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:35,168
So we have a lot of people were

981
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:35,936
Working on them

982
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:37,472
First stage of the project but

983
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:39,776
Velocity we see behind that is something

984
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:40,800
That's a mistake

985
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:43,616
We do not see that other device types other than

986
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:45,408
And the on the pie

987
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:46,944
And so if I tried

988
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:47,712
Divide these

989
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:48,992
If I'm doing a

990
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:53,600
Prototyping early stage

991
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:56,672
Device or is this something that's actually being used

992
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:57,440
Real production

993
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:01,024
Me realize is that

994
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,328
People will push prototyping

995
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:04,352
Out into

996
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:05,376
Production as far as

997
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:11,776
While yes canonical EBC it in prototyping we actually do cereal product build battle

998
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:13,568
Include a Raspberry Pi inside them

999
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:16,384
Multiple Raspberry Pi's depending on the

1000
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,944
But we do we kill the people going out with hundreds

1001
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:19,712
Sometimes.

1002
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:21,248
Raspberry Pi

1003
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:22,016
This is

1004
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:24,320
Surprising but I never left

1005
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:28,672
Are there downsides to that I mean like when I think about Raspberry Pi

1006
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:30,976
It's a basic arm chip I don't think of it as

1007
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:32,000
Particularly Harden

1008
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:34,048
For a security perspective

1009
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,888
Right I mean the issues with the Raspberry Pi really are

1010
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,680
Three and they're kind of big

1011
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:40,704
There is the

1012
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,984
Working aspect

1013
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,264
Support 5 gigahertz

1014
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:44,544
He works a lot of busy

1015
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:47,104
Is a power aspect

1016
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,640
You know you have a USB

1017
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:49,920
Mini

1018
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:52,224
High voltage

1019
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,272
And then of course there's a story.

1020
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:56,576
Take whatever you have an SD card and I might get lost

1021
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:58,624
Corrupted you know all of that stuff

1022
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,904
Which all of these

1023
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,720
Perfect sense what are Raspberry Pi Foundation

1024
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:05,536
They're trying to make an educational classroom

1025
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:07,072
Spread the love

1026
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:08,608
Computing we should have succeeded

1027
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:12,448
Exactly

1028
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:14,752
On the security front

1029
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:17,312
Yes there are three high does not have you know that

1030
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:18,848
TPM Awards

1031
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:19,872
Computing

1032
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:20,896
Extensions

1033
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:23,456
I mean exposing at least to the users

1034
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:24,480
But then again

1035
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,040
It's not like

1036
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:29,088
Most others in the mud are in The Spinners

1037
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:30,368
Play

1038
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:33,184
Appetizers capabilities but there are subtle flaws that make them

1039
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:35,744
Usable I think over the next few years will

1040
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,280
Phoebe thinks I'm out I really

1041
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:39,072
We're really excited for them

1042
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:41,120
But I wouldn't say that they're at the Raspberry Pi

1043
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:43,424
Significantly worse State than

1044
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:44,960
Most of the classes

1045
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:48,544
So that's the pie so

1046
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,568
People are using it

1047
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:51,616
Little walkie

1048
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:53,407
With the the Intel Nook

1049
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:55,199
Have you seen this

1050
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:59,551
News from the early days

1051
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:00,319
People

1052
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:01,087
Really

1053
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:05,439
Industrial context you know if your in the universe

1054
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:09,023
Press your arm you probably will grab a Raspberry Pi

1055
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:12,351
If you're in an industrial setting in

1056
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:15,679
I literally call it the Raspberry Pi of the Industrial

1057
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:19,519
It's it's very accessible price point which is like

1058
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:20,543
Get it for me

1059
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:22,335
$300 or something like that

1060
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:25,663
What's the basic models are out

1061
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:27,711
Is very accessible for an industrial pump

1062
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:29,247
Set reminder

1063
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:32,063
The number so they make him available to their engineers

1064
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:32,831
Send a lot of

1065
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:34,623
Project.

1066
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:36,927
Also for

1067
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:38,207
Digital signage

1068
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:39,487
Which needs

1069
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:42,047
A lot of GPU power

1070
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:48,191
One screen to screen in a 4K Graphics all that stuff also the Nook is very very popular

1071
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:51,263
Oh that makes sense that they just in January

1072
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:54,847
Said that they were doing a new one with the graphics card

1073
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:57,919
It's pretty impressive that can do 4K and

1074
00:42:58,431 --> 00:43:00,991
Some other fun stuff I was wondering why you needed all that

1075
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:04,319
Machine learning but

1076
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:05,087
I didn't think about this

1077
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:07,647
Weather

1078
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:14,047
But a lot of the cases that we see in resin are actually what I kind of

1079
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:19,423
Call

1080
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:20,191
Time it's just

1081
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:21,471
Already there

1082
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:23,519
Digital sign smart meters

1083
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:25,567
Industrial Equipment that's been there for decades

1084
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:27,359
And just bring it to the next level

1085
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:28,639
In the next level in that

1086
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:32,735
Internet-connected having containers

1087
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:37,599
Operating a lot more like a server in a Datacenter than a old-school embedded my

1088
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:40,671
Efficient

1089
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:41,695
I remember

1090
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:44,767
How many people it took to manage

1091
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:48,351
1 to a hundred used to be amazing

1092
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:51,167
Lord only knows what Google

1093
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:52,703
It's probably pretty

1094
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:58,591
Exactly minutes that. Same curve is playing out at

1095
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:03,967
Yes we must come at the edge

1096
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:06,015
DS

1097
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:07,807
Exactly it is either or you to

1098
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:09,343
Guitarist Ora

1099
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:12,671
Let's go to India

1100
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:15,743
And machine learning because this is

1101
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:19,327
This feels very much like the future so I really want to dig into

1102
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:22,911
What types of applications are they doing that with who's doing it

1103
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:23,935
What can you do

1104
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:25,727
Coming back to you.

1105
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:27,519
German what it means

1106
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:28,799
A lot of people

1107
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:30,591
Essentially started

1108
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:31,359
Because they wanted to

1109
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:33,919
To filter data between

1110
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:35,455
Small and cheap devices that work

1111
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:36,991
May be dispersed

1112
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:40,319
Around the factory or something like that and Cloud so they

1113
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:41,599
I couldn't eat it all.

1114
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:44,671
Too much they would put these the gateways in

1115
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:47,487
So where's the Nvidia boards come in and really make

1116
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:48,255
Another

1117
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:49,023
Is

1118
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:50,047
When you can do learning

1119
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:53,887
Or at least deploy machine learning model that you have pretrained somewhere else

1120
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:56,959
Because you can actually intelligently choose what the

1121
00:44:57,215 --> 00:45:00,031
The cloud needs to know you know what is interesting out of all of these

1122
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:01,567
Closest Mission I got

1123
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:04,127
You can compress if you can filter it without a technology

1124
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:06,175
But I using Universe kind of

1125
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:07,199
Rotational power

1126
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:10,527
You can actually start doing applying models to it and doing a lot more

1127
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:14,111
Before it ever reaches the cloud and sometimes

1128
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:15,647
You can't even make decisions on

1129
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:18,207
If something is looking really strange

1130
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:19,487
You don't have time

1131
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:23,839
From the clouds you can make a decision yourself

1132
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:24,863
Anzac

1133
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:25,631
Yusuke's

1134
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:28,191
Is actually one where we live the tx2

1135
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:30,495
Tupac running boards really well

1136
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:34,335
Is for driving in a smart cars and all that stuff

1137
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:36,127
You caught really think about it

1138
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:37,151
Very intuitive

1139
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:37,919
Call Kuwait

1140
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:39,711
To decide what you going to do

1141
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:42,015
With your car until there to the cloud

1142
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:45,087
You have to make a decision on the spot with

1143
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:47,391
Serious intelligence if you have was in the car

1144
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:48,671
That is true

1145
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:49,439
And that

1146
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:50,463
Latency

1147
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:51,743
Everything would be terrified

1148
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:52,767
Tariff

1149
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:58,143
Exactly medicine going into tunnel vision connectivity and then

1150
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:00,191
Where is Ski Apache

1151
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:01,471
To travel really slowly.

1152
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:12,991
Like you could only go to take you places

1153
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:13,759
At 20 miles an hour

1154
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:18,623
Exactly once people start deployment

1155
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:22,975
What are some of the pitfalls the things that they're trying to do

1156
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:24,255
Walden University

1157
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:25,023
Sweet sweat

1158
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:29,119
You're going to have her Roku for the edge what are the things you're going to first try to do

1159
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:33,215
The first thing you do no problem you haven't actually won one of the place

1160
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:38,335
I'm so happy I found you guys because I was really not sure how it go

1161
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:39,615
Going to do this is in the fact

1162
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:41,663
Even for you get out there how do I

1163
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:42,687
Classes device

1164
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:44,223
Each one is unique

1165
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:44,991
Which one is

1166
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:48,575
Tagged in a way that when it starts up in my customers

1167
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:49,599
Factory

1168
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:53,695
Or wherever it is intended to go buy it actually checks back in its

1169
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:55,231
Authenticated I don't have to do

1170
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:56,767
Maneuver

1171
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:57,535
What's my customer

1172
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:00,351
Show all of that died of the

1173
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:01,119
Work clothes

1174
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:03,935
Can get really complicated if you haven't really built it.

1175
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:06,239
Timer

1176
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:12,639
And then in production it's really a lot of the same things you kind of want to do with server spread you want to

1177
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:14,943
Unless you want to bring them up in an orderly fashion

1178
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:17,503
You want to make sure that is

1179
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:18,527
Something

1180
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:21,087
Goes wrong either in your code or maybe so

1181
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:23,903
New Linux kernel exploit gets published

1182
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:26,207
You need to update yesterday

1183
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:28,767
Do that really well

1184
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:30,303
Having button down

1185
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:31,583
The next thing you wanted

1186
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:33,375
Application performance

1187
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:36,447
Is anything unexpected happening and that's where you want to see

1188
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:38,751
The logs and as you figure things out

1189
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:41,311
You learn things you don't no plan survives contact

1190
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:42,847
Also

1191
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:47,711
Software and devices to ask you learned you want to keep

1192
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:49,503
Evolving that software

1193
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:51,551
Update my devices

1194
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:52,575
Something that is

1195
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:53,855
Is one of the core

1196
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:55,903
How to use S4

1197
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:57,439
Okay how is it not

1198
00:47:57,695 --> 00:47:59,999
Like servers what is unique about industrial Eren

1199
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:00,767
Enterprise on fire

1200
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:05,119
Commence this is actually one of the questions we get a lot and then one of them

1201
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:07,423
Because I really don't

1202
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:08,703
You can't really just

1203
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:09,727
Hate technology

1204
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:11,007
Transplant

1205
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:13,567
Resync it for the edge

1206
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:14,335
Think about it

1207
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:15,615
It's like you're taking

1208
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:20,991
Machines that lets say they would be in a Datacenter but you are standing at the center to call cover the whole globe

1209
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:23,039
Turn Down The Walls in your sort of

1210
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:24,319
Growing at 5000

1211
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:26,367
All the sudden you have

1212
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:29,439
Challenges one is at the machines themselves are not as power

1213
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:31,231
Muffuletta server

1214
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:33,535
Is not as powerful as what runs innovative

1215
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:36,863
It's further away

1216
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:41,727
How much longer can you could also be you know some kind of dodgy Wi-Fi connection

1217
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:42,751
Which Yukon

1218
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:44,799
So you have to start thinking

1219
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:46,847
For yourself

1220
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:47,871
Make sure

1221
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:48,639
It can react

1222
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:49,663
Do opossums

1223
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:51,967
Situation without knowing that I can get back

1224
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:54,015
Then the other thing is

1225
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:55,551
Climate

1226
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:57,087
You don't have guaranteed powers

1227
00:48:57,855 --> 00:48:59,135
Pull the plug on me all the time

1228
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:00,671
Which again are sings that are

1229
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:02,463
Unheard of

1230
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:05,791
So there's only sort of environmental situation

1231
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:09,631
You need to think about it differently and then the other part is more so

1232
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:10,911
Philosophical

1233
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:12,959
Heard before of the cattle versus

1234
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:15,263
Analogy where you know

1235
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:17,823
We used to have our servers like they were pets

1236
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:20,895
And then with mutual's now like kubernetes

1237
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:23,455
See the message

1238
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:25,247
Undifferentiated CEO

1239
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:26,271
Purchasing power

1240
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:29,343
And if one goes down it doesn't matter we can bring up another one

1241
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,391
Etymology doesn't actually

1242
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:33,951
Work for the edge right when I have a Smart Lock

1243
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:34,719
My house

1244
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:35,999
I don't want

1245
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:38,303
The container that's on it to have less

1246
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:40,863
And it's gone somewhere else because the somewhere else

1247
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:42,143
Free actually want

1248
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:43,167
Zap device

1249
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:47,263
Specifically to keep functioning all the time and if something goes wrong with it

1250
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:49,311
The company that told me that lock

1251
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:50,079
Cannot

1252
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:51,103
Press the button

1253
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:52,639
I make another one up here

1254
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:54,943
They actually have to ensure it's working

1255
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:57,503
All the time NZ small

1256
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:02,623
Perspective that we should have higher regards

1257
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:03,903
I'm not sure

1258
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:09,535
Maybe somebody

1259
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:12,095
And then you're out

1260
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:14,399
It's kind of that

1261
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:18,751
We should also be nice

1262
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:20,031
Nicer to cows

1263
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:23,871
Okay well Alex thank you so much for

1264
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:24,895
For coming on the show this

1265
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:27,455
I really appreciate it

1266
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:31,039
Thanks for having me that's it for this week

1267
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:37,439
Thanks so much for listening and remember if you'd like more iot news sign up for my newsletter at Stacy on

1268
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:38,719
Coyote

1269
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:45,119
Will see you next week
