00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:29,696
In

10
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:31,232
Possibly Elon Musk

11
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:32,768
Crazy new idea

12
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,352
We're also after that going to have our guests who is Matt

00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:39,424
Talk about

15
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,728
Finding money for your iot startup

16
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:44,800
Supposed to be

17
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:45,568
Enthusiastic

18
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:50,944
Extremely difficult after Korean BBQ and karaoke in New York City

19
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,248
Goldie got half of

20
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,344
Fairy guy

21
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,112
I'm pretty sure

22
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:00,160
Let's hope so

23
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:04,768
There will be no singing on the show don't worry

24
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:07,072
No I'm all sung out trust me

25
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,352
What's your go-to

26
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:15,776
I don't have one because I don't do karaoke so I got roped into this last night and fairness that the team did

27
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:17,568
Choose several Beatles songs in

28
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:18,592
On my behalf

29
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:19,872
Appreciate that immensely

30
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:22,176
Next I still can't sing but I do appreciate

31
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:23,200
I also

32
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,504
I'm with you I do not have a

33
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:27,552
So all right

34
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:28,576
Let's talk about Pluto

35
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:30,112
Yes

36
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:30,880
Last

37
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:32,160
They

38
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:32,928
Announce

39
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:34,720
Said they were going to do their Bluetooth

40
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:35,744
Five Points

41
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,512
Oh

42
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:38,048
Beijing the Sig

43
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:39,584
The special in

44
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:44,448
There's a respect you special interest groups that actually

45
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,984
Like is a special entry

46
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:48,544
But my interests align with these guys soap

47
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,568
I like this

48
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:50,592
I don't know

49
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:51,872
Some of the standard things

50
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:55,200
Is that really good for us what will that mean for users

51
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,528
Let's go

52
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,576
A little bit

53
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:04,160
4.

54
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:07,744
To I believe and so they decided that

55
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,512
The four dots

56
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,816
We're done with the forced removal

57
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:11,840
So

58
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:16,960
This is also Bluetooth low energy so the Bluetooth 5 is going to work over Bluetooth low energy

59
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:17,984
Which is

60
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:20,032
Good in that used to be called Bluetooth

61
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:21,056
Smart in case any

62
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,848
Oh

63
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:27,200
A couple name changes yeah

64
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:31,808
And we all kept calling a Bluetooth low energy cuz I was supposed to

65
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:32,832
Feature in Fallujah

66
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,624
Mysmartmove

67
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:35,648
Exactly

68
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:38,208
You're at least three-quarters of a

69
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:39,744
Mostly I mostly

70
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,280
Alright so

71
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,048
Here's what you need to know

72
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,328
Basically

73
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:45,120
Increase the distance

74
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,912
So now we're talking about from

75
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:48,960
Right now it's about 30 to 50

76
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:51,264
And it's going to go to 200

77
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:57,920
Enough to cover your house cuz right now at last week when we talk about these light bulbs that ran Bluetooth

78
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:01,760
You know if I'm downstairs in the light bulbs on my roof

79
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,040
I don't have the mesh Network

80
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,904
That's like theoretical best possible case

81
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,000
Strangers I don't I wouldn't want people thinking you can literally be 200 meters away

82
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:14,816
Maybe in an open field with no other radio interference

83
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:21,728
Eat while you're going through that's going to hurt your signal cell rearrange

84
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:23,776
It's still good though

85
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:29,152
The other thing is speed

86
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:31,968
We conferred sending one megabit per second data rate

87
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:33,248
To 2 megabits per

88
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:36,064
Which means you can send more information over

89
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:38,368
You're still need to be able to transfer

90
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,392
Free HD movie

91
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,184
Yuan

92
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:41,952
Do that

93
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:43,744
Try but you

94
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:45,536
So

95
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:48,352
That's good news I think that more is like a

96
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,376
Kokua file sharing

97
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,472
Yeah I mean it's

98
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:55,520
Obviously iot devices

99
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:59,360
She has small bits of data are obviously covered here so

100
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:01,152
I'm trying to think of a smart home

101
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,176
Perspective

102
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,712
For maybe and I am

103
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,784
Industrial perspective what you might want to be sunny

104
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:09,344
Good chunk of pipe there

105
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,160
It is I mean you probably going to send

106
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,440
Video but maybe

107
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:14,720
Still

108
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,512
Yeah that that could work

109
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,047
You know just images

110
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:20,351
Snapshots you know a JPEG file

111
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:23,679
Not super high-resolution yeah

112
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:25,215
That would happen in a second or two

113
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:26,239
So

114
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:28,799
We'll see how people

115
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:29,567
Use it

116
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:32,639
Is in this is the big deal thing

117
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:34,687
I'm just saying is

118
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,247
When you're broadcasting data over Bluetooth

119
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,527
It supports more data

120
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:39,807
So

121
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:43,903
What's Happening Here is instead of just like it's it's mostly for Beacon

122
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,183
So instead of saying

123
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,535
Now it's going to say things like

124
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,559
Here's a URL

125
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,607
I'm here you're so other day that you might

126
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:53,887
Your side still that I can

127
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,447
Physical Webster

128
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,471
Physical web

129
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,519
Is kind of the first thing I thought of

130
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:01,311
Is Google is Google actually isn't ever

131
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:04,639
We should mention that Kevin works for Google

132
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,407
Yes

133
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,431
Chrome

134
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:11,039
At work on Android for work but I will mention

135
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:16,927
Yesterday as I was walking around the office in New York City I did get a little pop up about Peter the physical web next

136
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:17,695
Nearby

137
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:20,767
I couldn't find it so I must walk too fast or too far but

138
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:22,559
Devastating

139
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:31,263
I should have just went retraced my steps and everything else was on the way to a meeting in like I missed it.

140
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,287
That I don't know I'll never know

141
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:34,847
Inside

142
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,383
The idea is

143
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,223
He would walk by something like maybe you're waiting for a train or

144
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,503
You know an office

145
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:46,367
It'll pop up hey there's a physical weathering and you click on the link

146
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:50,463
And it'll give you information so if it's a train station it's going to send you to like

147
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:54,047
Oh you're next trains could be at this time here's all this other relevant information

148
00:05:54,559 --> 00:06:00,703
So it's just an easy way to give you information about the world around you that you may not otherwise be able to fight

149
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:05,055
Dad's in this is one of the key things I've always said with iot and smart devices it has contacts

150
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:07,871
Use your walking past something you may not even know that you're walking

151
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:08,639
Cast it

152
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:13,247
Something may get pushed to you to let you know that you're walking past something that may be interesting

153
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,271
Are useful to you

154
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:16,063
Now the downside to all of this

155
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,087
This is advertisers

156
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,159
Yeah

157
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,207
There's pros and cons

158
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:24,255
We'll have to see much like the internet

159
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:27,839
We will just have to see how people use this because

160
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:29,887
I really don't want

161
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:31,167
To be bombarded with

162
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:33,727
All these ads now you do have to have an app

163
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,007
That reads

164
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,543
You know the beacons

165
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:39,103
So this isn't like your phone is suddenly going to

166
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,407
Well

167
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:43,967
You're mostly right I think but see

168
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:48,063
I'm just using Chrome in my Android phone and I've allowed

169
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,623
Prone to have access to the locations

170
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,647
Permissions

171
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:54,975
And that's what triggered when I walk past the physical web Beacon

172
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:57,023
That's what triggers there was no action

173
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,071
Strap in that particular case

174
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,863
I'm thinking like

175
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:03,167
The retail case but you're right so

176
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,703
Maybe we should

177
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:10,335
Check was supposed to see if we can get someone from Eddystone to talk about like how they're going to control for things like that cuz

178
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:15,199
We don't want Minority Report or whatever

179
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:18,015
Total Recall I guess it was worth me to walk past often

180
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,039
Personal ads

181
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,831
Cameron do you know

182
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,623
I do not want that

183
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:23,903
Do not want

184
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,439
No alright

185
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:26,975
In the finals

186
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:29,791
You get all of

187
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:30,815
And it

188
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,607
2.5 *

189
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,143
Less energy

190
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:37,471
Basically better power consumption with all that which is

191
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:42,591
Quite nice for everyone building things that run off batteries so ye Bluetooth Sig

192
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:47,711
This is expected in about 2017 the sit the Sig

193
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,551
Is basically said hey this what we're going to do so now they got to finalize the standard

194
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,831
What should happen later this year

195
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:53,855
Early next

196
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:57,951
And then the chipmaker's actually have to build new hardware to support all this so

197
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:02,303
Which means your current devices are not going to get all these G whiz-bang features

198
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,071
Right

199
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,095
Monogram

200
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:10,239
That's that's all part of the cycle we know that we may not like it but we

201
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,007
We know that

202
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,543
And this is all

203
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,847
And talk about Bluetooth Mesh networking this is separate from the

204
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,407
Here's the update on the match

205
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,687
Mesh Network

206
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:19,967
King stuff is actually

207
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:22,015
For 4 and 5 but

208
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,295
That's expected

209
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:25,087
It's on a separate development track

210
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,879
So they're going to have a

211
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:29,695
Detailed update sometime in the September timeframe

212
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:31,487
Deployed

213
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:32,767
In 2017

214
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,815
Like on the earlier side

215
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:35,839
They said

216
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:36,607
So

217
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,399
Pay attention to September

218
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,167
For the mesh

219
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:43,007
Will be part of you can add that

220
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:46,335
To Bluetooth 5 and they're also planning out at 2

221
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:47,615
4

222
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,663
So the mesh Network

223
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,967
Wingstop actually compete in your existing Bluetooth

224
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:53,503
Devices

225
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,831
So that's the mess

226
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,111
It's a little

227
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,671
There's a lot going on

228
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,231
It's gone from just being a

229
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:07,327
Almost like a single-use case kind of thing to a lot of different things and

230
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,607
Super important iot

231
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,959
Alright let's move on to

232
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:13,983
This is last

233
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,775
Switch big news but Kevin and I had to

234
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,567
Early

235
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:21,151
Before WWDC yes

236
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,431
It's totally worth talking about

237
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,455
Because we were like

238
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:25,503
What's happening with homekit

239
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,783
Sad sad sad

240
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,575
Apple basically said

241
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,111
Alright here's what's happening

242
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:31,903
I'm going to give you

243
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:32,927
Home

244
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,463
Which has its own application

245
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:37,023
Group all of your homekit stuff together

246
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,863
Basically added support for video

247
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:41,887
Which was a big deal

248
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:43,935
And

249
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:44,703
Announced

250
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:46,751
New devices that are

251
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:50,335
Along with that home app the IOS app

252
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:53,151
Home where you can control your devices

253
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:55,455
Like I said they proved everything all your controls

254
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,223
Babe

255
00:09:56,479 --> 00:10:01,599
Front and center in iOS now have an install the iOS 10 beta but once I do

256
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:04,159
I will be able to drag up from the bottom of my screen

257
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,951
Just like I do today with control center

258
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:08,511
And then swipe over and there is my presets

259
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,535
For my home app

260
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,327
So we are much quicker access

261
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,631
And all those presets and such

262
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:14,399
And controls

263
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:18,751
Will also be available in the home app for the Apple watch so

264
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:23,103
They make it a lot easier to control things which is what one of the things they needed to do

265
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,383
Yes and

266
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,407
It's also going to be sick

267
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,175
Supported

268
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:31,039
With the Apple TV which means you when you leave your house this was a big

269
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,319
Question mark for every

270
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,855
Not for me

271
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,903
Aeropostale a year ago

272
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,439
Yes

273
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,975
With apple you never know

274
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:43,839
That's true in furnace it was only Apple never announce this

275
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:46,399
Until just this year so you are correct the last year

276
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:49,727
They updated the Apple TV support page to say that it would be

277
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:52,031
A Gateway for your home kit

278
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,055
Teresa soap

279
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,103
Kevin do

280
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,383
Now the rest of us

281
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,663
Saul

282
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,199
If you didn't believe Kevin

283
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,735
Cherokee

284
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,551
Not always not after karaoke

285
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:07,391
I should also add that it's not the only Gateway device

286
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,415
I don't know if you called this

287
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,695
IPad

288
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:12,511
Yes that's correct so you do not need an apple

289
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:16,607
TV to remotely access your homekit devices when away from home

290
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,911
If you have an iPad which I guess has to be

291
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,447
On in your house and

292
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:22,239
Can I get to your network while you're away

293
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:23,775
You know what's interesting here

294
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,311
Is a lot of

295
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,847
Cydia type Developers

296
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,639
They actually will

297
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:30,687
Retrofit and iPad in

298
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,455
Pappadeaux's

299
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:33,247
Your wall in your wall so

300
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,015
That's actually kind

301
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:34,783
Never really smart

302
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,063
Yes it is

303
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,343
Penguin

304
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:39,135
Be bad on iPad sales

305
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:42,207
That would be like another use case

306
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:45,279
We actually have two iPads

307
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:48,863
If we were better they would all run the same apps but that's kind of impossible

308
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:49,631
And how many things

309
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:52,959
I'm in and out of my house but parkour apps

310
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:53,983
It's nice

311
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,007
Because everyone

312
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:59,103
You can always find something and when I have gas I just give him one of the iPads and I'm like here

313
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:06,783
So now I mean I could somebody in a cup of coffee or a drink 66 here would you like an iPad when somebody comes to visit

314
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:10,111
What is there hot

315
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,183
This is Terraria

316
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:17,279
I am not just any of the keys to my home I'm heading you

317
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,815
My smart home

318
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,119
What day would I have better

319
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,143
I'd like more of a budget

320
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:25,983
Or maybe just a die

321
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:33,663
I can play their music

322
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,199
I am I am a nice

323
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:38,527
I would say that you should open up like a smart home B&B

324
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:42,623
Alright so

325
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,159
I have not played with this yet

326
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:44,927
Because

327
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,207
Hey I don't have

328
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:51,327
Might my husband's not like him to hand over his stuff to be so I'm going to have to do it on the iPad

329
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,631
So it's going to be a slightly different user experience

330
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:56,703
But in watching the videos that people are making

331
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,983
This

332
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:00,799
Apples

333
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,079
Worldview on this

334
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,103
Sister give you the

335
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,895
Away in Homestead

336
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,431
What's I could buy

337
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:08,479
Good morning the modes is what a lot of

338
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:11,039
Companies call this and then they give you the things

339
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,063
To control

340
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,855
And that is a very

341
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:14,623
Xiamen

342
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:17,183
Kind of architecture for building these apps

343
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:19,999
And I was a little disappointed because

344
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:23,071
I didn't see anything like truly innovative

345
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:23,839
On the

346
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:28,703
Making automations controlling individual devices it felt like apple just kind of looks like

347
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,751
Capitulated to the status quo

348
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,543
Yeah

349
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,311
You're like no

350
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:34,847
No no

351
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:37,919
Did but that doesn't surprise me and the reason being

352
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:42,527
Apple standard operating procedure is typically to wait for a market to develop

353
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:43,551
Watch

354
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,343
How people react to it

355
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:49,951
See how manufacturers and device makers kind of screw things up either through UI or

356
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:50,975
Capabilities

357
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,511
Or instability

358
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:58,655
And then they come in and say we're here to save the day we can fix this it did with the MP3 Market they did it with the phone market

359
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:05,311
Even you could say tablets good tablets have been around hello PCS first one and two thousand one so yeah I'm not surprised that they did

360
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,103
Well you so to speak

361
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,895
But what they done is made it

362
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:09,663
Intuitive

363
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,711
Easy and hopefully stabling

364
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,735
Simple to use

365
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:15,295
I think what struck me is how none

366
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,063
Intuitive

367
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:19,135
Things are because this isn't

368
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,439
It's actually not that into

369
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:24,255
It's intuitive if you were familiar with

370
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,023
With the space

371
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,071
Is a normal person coming in

372
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:27,839
I feel like

373
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,375
I'm not saying that's apples

374
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:31,167
Fault I'm just thinking

375
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:37,567
A truly intuitive interface by play with a lot of these software things would actually ask you probably a few

376
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,847
The questions and then

377
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,895
Start trying to do

378
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:46,015
Right and I think there's like a big divide between I want to

379
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:46,783
Control it

380
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,063
Just kind of the early adopter

381
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:48,831
DIY

382
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:55,999
True and then and I don't know how apple is educating a

383
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:56,767
Customers

384
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:59,071
In regards to homekit in the new home app

385
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:01,375
I don't have a homekit any homekit devices

386
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,655
Avenues the home app

387
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,679
So

388
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:08,287
I guess I should get one and go through this person see maybe there's some guided bits that

389
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:10,591
Trying to explain the magic you know

390
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:14,175
Here's what you can't have that happen automatically and here's why that helps yuan

391
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:17,247
So I'm usually there messaging is very good

392
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,551
It could just be the

393
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:22,111
I haven't used it and I do have good messaging I don't know

394
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,647
Yes but I am also going

395
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,719
We'll get there probably

396
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,351
I won't get there for the next show is next after that cuz I don't have any device

397
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:34,143
And I'm moving all next week

398
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,447
Nope I'm not assigning

399
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:37,983
Nope not this time

400
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:40,031
I will choose not to accept it if you do

401
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,311
All right

402
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,335
Quit music

403
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,359
So Samsung

404
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,919
Who said this week that it plans to

405
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,199
To invest one

406
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:48,223
Point to

407
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:49,759
Weatherby

408
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:50,527
With a B

409
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,087
In the US over the next 4 years

410
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:55,391
Boost the iot vision

411
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:58,207
A lot of money

412
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:00,255
It is a lot of money

413
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,535
And I guess the biggest

414
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:02,815
News

415
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:05,375
Part of that investment they've purchased joint

416
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,655
Yes

417
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,959
Giants yes

418
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:11,263
So what we got here is it looks like

419
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:13,055
Samsung is getting serious

420
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,847
About 4 minutes

421
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:17,919
We've seen kind of like was it bought smart things back

422
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:18,687
2014

423
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,991
Twitter million dollar acquisition

424
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:24,831
I thought it was a great move because SmartThings was so open in Samsung 8

425
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:27,391
CSN 2014 hit just got

426
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,927
Through telling us how Lake

427
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:30,463
Amazingly open it was going to

428
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:38,399
You and I went to the Consumer Electronics Show and they touted Anastasia to Kino and that was going to say 2015

429
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,167
15

430
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:39,935
Okay

431
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:43,007
Open

432
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:47,359
Samsung kid actually a couple months ago announced it

433
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,127
Arctic

434
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,151
Cloud

435
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,943
What are they doing with art

436
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:55,551
That's like a whole that's hardware that's a bunch of pieces

437
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:56,319
So there's

438
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,391
Vegan Arctic

439
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,463
A cloud called Sammy

440
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,743
Saami

441
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,791
Which basically was like a data

442
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,583
Data Lake like a place where you can put

443
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,119
Your data escrow

444
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,655
I just edited

445
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,935
Corporation

446
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,215
Someone's hosted on

447
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:16,287
Cloud you just throw all your data here and you can share it

448
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,567
It's got all kinds of policies

449
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:19,359
And then

450
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:21,663
They built on top of that article

451
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:22,687
Which is

452
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:23,711
The cloud

453
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:25,503
It start to Cloud it's

454
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,783
Going to have

455
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:31,647
And it's unclear how much of this already has a good iot Cloud should have a way to

456
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,927
Get devices

457
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:33,951
Sending data

458
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:34,719
The cloud

459
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,743
It should have

460
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,791
Ways to manage those devices at

461
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,071
Scalable easy

462
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,607
It should have

463
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,887
Ways to control

464
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,167
Those devices like

465
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,191
Wasted

466
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:46,239
Connect to other clouds

467
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:47,519
Control other devices

468
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:52,383
I'm not sure

469
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:53,919
What all the Arctic

470
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:55,455
Cloud House of those thing

471
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:59,039
But that's what he's trying to build with choice

472
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:03,903
Basically it gets a massively distributed architecture to the

473
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:05,695
Dildos

474
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,999
I'm enjoying it has

475
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:13,375
They're a bunch of old son guys in a few remember son history you know distributed computing was

476
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,143
Like they're bad

477
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:18,751
We'll see

478
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:20,799
What happens here at the outside the arch

479
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:21,567
Modules

480
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,103
Is a specialty

481
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,127
That's

482
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:30,015
That's what I'm looking at right now there are three modules the one the five and the Ten of various sizes and capabilities

483
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:34,623
And the basic saying this is Sino everything you need from Harbor perspective to get started

484
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:37,695
Developer documentation online tons of it as ice

485
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,719
Scan through here

486
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:42,815
You know developer guys on connectivity and audio video and

487
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,863
Wireless networks USB

488
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:45,887
So

489
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,471
Tons going on

490
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:52,799
We can try to get Samsung to come on the show and talk about all of that if that's something

491
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,079
39

492
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:58,687
Well considering how much they're spending and how much of a player they want to be in this market

493
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:03,295
I would love to hear more when they're done

494
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:04,575
Samsung TV mod

495
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:10,719
Player in a TV is a great place to Papa Hub they actually already did SmartThings on their smart

496
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:11,743
TVs

497
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:14,047
And they added a zigbee and Z-Wave dongle

498
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:15,071
Just plug it in and

499
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:20,447
And all the TVs run their own Mouse at their own butt

500
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,471
Generally open source

501
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,239
Kaizen

502
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:24,543
Tizen platform and that's

503
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,103
What's going to tie everything together they say so

504
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:30,431
Yeah I'd be very interested to hear more about this from them

505
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,199
Alright we'll see

506
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:33,247
I'm a little fun thing

507
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,271
Is Elon Musk

508
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:38,879
Crazy wheel

509
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,415
So many of them

510
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,463
Fungi

511
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:43,999
Tesla

512
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:47,327
Type with rockets in space

513
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,607
SpaceX I can't remember if you

514
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:52,447
I hate V Rockets into space is what I tell my kids

515
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:55,007
The key part is he

516
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:55,775
Lance them

517
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,055
Intact

518
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:58,335
So most the time

519
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,103
Some of the time

520
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:01,407
He

521
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:04,479
Is on the board of a company called SolarCity that makes solar panels

522
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:05,759
And

523
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:10,623
Has his crazy bottle for financing solar panels and making solar panels more accessible to everyone

524
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:14,719
And his cousin is actually the CEO and what happened is on Tuesday

525
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:15,487
Elon says

526
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:16,255
You know what

527
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,583
Cuz we can

528
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:25,727
Well it does make sense and the finances are going to be very interesting cuz I thought

529
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:28,031
This is like a 2 and a quarter billion dollar deal

530
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:30,335
I don't have the numbers in front of me but it was a big number

531
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:34,943
But it makes sense I mean solar energy and I can I can attest this personal you know

532
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:39,295
We have 41 solar panels in the current house I will miss you when I'm gone solar panels but

533
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:42,879
We also had an electric vehicle and it was just a perfect marriage

534
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,927
To just plug in our car and

535
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:47,999
You know recharge from the Sun are everyday and

536
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,023
Save money

537
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,327
Just make sense

538
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,863
Just sits a good integration

539
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:55,167
For everyone who's thinking about this

540
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,447
And it's a 2.52

541
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:57,471
3 billion dollar deal

542
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:58,495
Right on the money

543
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:03,871
This makes sense this is actually very similar to what GE is doing with its current spinner

544
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:06,687
The idea is it's creating a truly connected

545
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,991
Supply chain for energy is

546
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:11,039
Think about it

547
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,831
It is trying to work with

548
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:13,855
Power generation

549
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:14,623
Companies

550
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:16,928
It's also thinking about rechargeable battery

551
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:20,512
And Dennis working on the demand side with

552
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:22,304
Sensors and Lighting in

553
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,840
Commercial areas

554
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:27,936
And basically trying to help manage the flow of information in the

555
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:28,960
Control

556
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:31,264
How much people are paying

557
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:32,544
2

558
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:33,824
Use electricity

559
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:34,848
So

560
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:37,920
When you apply this electric cars are one of the

561
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:38,944
Going to be a

562
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,968
Huge draw

563
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:40,736
On the electric grid

564
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:43,040
And if you think about it that way

565
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:44,320
Pouting

566
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:45,600
Insight into

567
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:52,256
When to charge them based on the availability of solar power because again solar power is not constant we haven't been

568
00:21:54,304 --> 00:22:00,448
Most people have solar panels do not have battery back-ups and such I tried but I couldn't do it and then I did try to get in

569
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,984
The Powerball thing with Tessa

570
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,032
Which is a battery destroy that energy

571
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:07,616
But because of my system though it's configured I actually couldn't do it

572
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:08,896
So

573
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:12,992
It may make sense right now a lot of people charge their cars over

574
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,040
Goodnight but it makes more sense

575
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:21,696
It to have that intelligence right now

576
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:22,720
Electric car

577
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:23,744
In

578
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,024
I think that's going to be

579
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:27,328
An essential piece of info

580
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:28,096
Information

581
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:29,632
For kind of building like

582
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:32,192
Some people called the internet of electricity

583
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:35,008
A real toy

584
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:41,664
You have to shift the demand or the supply because let's face it solar power is awesome

585
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,688
For half of the day

586
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:44,736
Thrift near at night

587
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:46,016
Skinesis oh

588
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:49,344
They've got to figure it out they got the tools to do it with the powerwall

589
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,440
SolarCity installing the panels and then you got the car for your demand

590
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,976
Thinking intelligently

591
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:55,744
Shipt

592
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,512
When

593
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:58,048
Are you charged or when

594
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,584
Power is available to you and

595
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:01,120
It sells the whole problem of

596
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:04,448
Quote about using solar power at night

597
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:10,848
I maybe they'll just you know jet your new Tesla over to you on a rock at night

603
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:35,680
We're breaking into the iot podcast

604
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:40,800
From our sponsor I've got with me Todd Alice got the CTO of wolf SSL

00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:42,080
His company provides

606
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:44,384
Security inside over a billion devices

607
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:46,688
Toddy is here today to tell us

608
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:50,272
Why you should use SSL for securing The Internet of Things

609
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,576
The short answer is

610
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:56,672
It is the web security protocol Congress currently used

611
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:58,464

00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:06,400
SSL TLS provides

616
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,424
Privacy

617
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:08,448
Integrity

618

Complication

Drop on you

620
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:16,640
Forgery by messages on you and most importantly

621
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:27,648
Does it cost extra to add

622
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:29,952
SSL from a processing overhead

623
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:37,120
It does a little bit and that's been an excuse in the past not to do it but then things I talked about integrity

624
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:39,424
I think those things out way

625
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:43,520
The slight increase in a resource processing

626
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:44,800
All right and how can we

627
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:49,664

A survey of the iot industry

637
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:20,640
I think I saw past me like 18

638
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:28,832
Let's get started with the status

639
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:31,392
Venture Capital Industries

640
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:33,440
That's who you are for the internet

641
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:37,024
What has changed since you publish that

642
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:44,704
I think they c2f think we are in an uncertain cycle for the ventricles

643
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,984
Going to stream General

644
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,776
Can we hold strength of your ads

645
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:51,360
What is happening in some of it is rated to the ups and downs

646

David Natural Market

647
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:53,920
That's it

648
00:25:54,176 --> 00:26:00,320
So pretty clear that the market has cool down quite significantly since Maybe

649
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,600
Las Palmas

00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:04,160

The impacts of the general

Cooling down on the internet 06 industry is

653
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:13,888
Significance

654
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:20,544
TV internet of things like many other emerging areas and maybe that includes other wolves

655
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,104
You know Bitcoin and blockchain for example

656
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:29,504
Internet of Things was a an emerging area that in some ways I think was little bit of an acquired taste

657
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,528
Four letter v

658
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:34,112
PCS meaning that people wear curious and

659
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:36,160
People were excited

660
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:36,928
2

661
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:37,696
Look at

662
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:39,232
New iot Ventures

663
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:41,024
And we're willing to

664
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:41,792
Experiments

665
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:46,144
But that thing is the market closed down people tend to Natural retreats

666
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:46,912
Towards

667
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:48,704
What areas of Tallahassee

668
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,984
Experimental

669
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,264
Berkeley what's happening

670
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,824
Right now so if you're venture-backed startup

671
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,152
Or any startup so we'll start with people who've already raised some money

672
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:59,200
People who are they

673
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:01,504
What do I do

674
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:03,040
What would your advice be

675
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:04,064
Companies who

676
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,344
Have raised money

677
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,624
And are trying to get their products

678
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:12,512
Companies that have raised money in the name of the game is quite often to get

679
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:14,560
More money and the

680
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:16,608
You're very practical by theories

681
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:17,376
2

682
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:20,448
Take money from wherever

683
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:26,848
1 Cam and that means that one should not have to leave the focus.

684
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,128
Getting money from

685
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:34,528
The brand name VC me that happens with so many great and by all means they are as chilling number of tough name

686
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:35,552
Beaches.

687
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:36,832
Storage space

688
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:40,160
The same time the great news for the space I thank you

689
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:43,488
What's the corporate investors and stretchy investors that beat

690
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:44,256
Reactive

691
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:48,608
And quite frankly compared to a lot of your

692
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:53,472
Average BC some of the Strategic investors can bring almost mold value

693
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:59,104
Especially those investors I was catching investors are in areas that are immediately accretive

694
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,152
2 startups whether they are

695
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,688
Manufacturing

696
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:04,224
Or insurance

697
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:08,576
I think those are great sources of money in one should actively engaged

698
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:09,600
Wizards players

699
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:13,696
I think he knew the Shinto strategy can corporate investors

Contra Dance

701
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:17,280

4

704
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,912
To finance your inventory in knots

705
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,192
You just financed

706
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:25,728
Extension of your Runway

707
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:29,568
You have the key learning hero the key lesson

708
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:32,896
Is that one should be overdramatic and state rate

00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:35,200
How to get money from Whataburger

710
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:38,016
They can't they are still sources of my

711
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:39,040
Okay

712
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:43,392
Thinking of starting what if I feel like oh my God no one's made a connected

714
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:45,696
Don't actually do

715
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:47,744
If I'm looking for money

716
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,768
Where

717
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:50,560
Should I give up hope for what should I do

718
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:54,144
I think one consequence of the Venture Capital markets

719
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,448
Cooling down at 1 should be

720
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:57,984
Stickley careful

721
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,312
Insult for when starting a new venture

722
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:03,616
Indeed there is a question

723
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:06,688
Around availability of the product

724
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:10,016
And the business model that one cheats

725
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:11,040
Think through

726
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:12,576
Perhaps more than

727
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:13,344
In the past

728
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,880
I think there is less

729
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:16,160
Solvay

730
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:19,232
Immediate needs to rush to create a new product

731
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:21,792
Recent you got completely excited about

732
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:27,168
New products in Indonesia and the potential of the products

733
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:28,960
I think you should

734
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:31,008
Work very hard time getting the best

735
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:32,032
Possible

736
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:32,800
Team

737
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:34,848
There was

738
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,920
During the last couple of years maybe more

739
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:39,200
Torrentz4

740
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:42,016
Teams that have never done Hardware before

741
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:45,856
But so I could to the figure it out especially with the help of some

742
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:48,416
Third-party provider

743
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,440
Some incubator

744
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:55,584
Because the bar is hiring now you should definitely optimize for

745
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,864
Getting the rights

746
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,448
People on the team that includes the people who've done Hardware before

747
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:04,800
Funding is a very viable option

748
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:07,616
I think we have all learnt in the last couple of years back

749
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:09,664
I want to be careful with crowdfunding

750
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:16,576
Because creates a lot of pressure on the entrepreneurs and I think the time to launch applied funding campaign

751
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:20,416
He's probably much closer to actual shipping date

752
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:22,208
Other people stop before

753
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,816
It looks like about exits because they've actually been a lot of exits

754
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:28,096
In the last

755
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:29,632
Gears 4

756
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:33,216
Comedies that had started really early and I'm curious

757
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:36,800
A lot of them are small they're not very well publicized

758
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:37,568
Some of them look like

759
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,872
Sears Buy

760
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,712
Airbnb

761
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:44,736
Sproutlings

762
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:45,760
Acquired by Mattel

763
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:47,552
What is this tell us about

764
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:48,832
The exit Market

765
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:55,488
The market has been somewhat confusing so there was a first wave of very large acquisition

766
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:58,816
Send Hangouts Dropcam and

767
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:05,728
In the first place that the very beginning of the cyclic rate of the excitement because the

768
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:11,616
The time between Christian of the company and then and then very large exciting exit was very short

769
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:15,200
That was the first wave and that was some of the head fade because

770
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:20,064
Just that created more and more excitement than the market probably warranted

771
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,160
I think we now in that second phase of the closest Market Square

772
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:28,256
So

773
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:34,656
Whole wave of companies that are funded maybe in the last couple of years that raise the AC ground or

774
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:35,680
Sometimes

775
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:36,448
Small

776
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:39,520
To reserve that are now getting to the stage where

777
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:49,248
The market or defend a position in the market

778
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:55,648
That makes for interesting checking acquisition from water companies that also feel the need

779
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:01,536
To play in the space but I know Natalie willing to invest hundreds of millions or billions

780
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:03,840
In the company so we sing that that whole wave

781
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:04,608
Now

782
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:07,936
I think the next logical wave he's probably

783
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:13,312
234 years away that's when the larger companies by

784
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:15,104
Startups that have grown in a

785
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,200
Quizlet revenues large teams

786
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:22,016
X 1 2 or 3 products allowed

787
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:23,296
That will take

788
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:24,576
Another

789
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:26,368
That's a good cutting from a nap

790
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:27,648
Acquisition stand for in

791
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:29,952
I think the

792
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:32,768
Pool of potential acquirers is

793
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:34,048
Large

794
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,072
Not afraid

795
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,352
Type of acquired

796
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:40,960
Suggest yes but that was one of the always one of the questions for Hardware

797
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:47,616
How companies is who buys you and what was interesting to see in the last two or three years was that some of the large

798
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:51,200
Internet companies which so far I've been

799
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:53,504
Completely software companies

800
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:59,904
Showed an interest in the in buying our company so specifically Google for example that

801
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:00,672
You can think of

802
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:04,000
Companies like Amazon that I'm starting to play

803
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:05,280
In this case as well

804
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:07,584
In addition to the large

805
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:13,984
Companies the traditional industrial and manufacturing companies

806
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:14,752
Also stunning

807
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:15,776
To show

808
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:18,592
Plug in chest into space a because

809
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:21,152
They don't come from a good nav

810
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:22,432
Are we going to have

811
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:26,016
To buy a little bit of some companies to bring in

812
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:26,784
Challenge

813
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,064
And products

814
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:33,952
And graduates was formed themselves into companies that will be one more software

815
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:34,976
Bass

816
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:36,256
EQ project

817
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:38,560
2 3 4 5 years old

818
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:43,680
Then my guess is that you'll see a lot of non-traditional Lee soft

819
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:44,448
Square

820
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:45,728
Bass companies

821
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:47,520
Hardware

822
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:49,568
So I just filled in a device companies

823
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:50,848
Buying one more

824
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:51,616
Tech companies

825
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:57,248
Yes I've seen a lot of people in the retail people in the entertainment space getting here

826
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:58,528
Let's talk about

827
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:00,064
The industrial internet

828
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:05,696
Versus kind of the smart home and maybe some of the other connected-car somebody's other trends

829
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:08,768
Where do you want to place your money now

830
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,560
What's growing what's the

831
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:11,328
The status of

832
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:15,168
Guess what I'm personally

833
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:19,264
More excited by the Enterprise and Industrial side of things

834
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,848
I am in Smyrna I'll explain the wife in a second but

835
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:23,872
From my perspective

836
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:30,016
Enterprise energy spiritual includes both the actual and present industrial plays

837
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:31,808
A whole range of

838
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:34,112
Enabling Technologies developed to play

839
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:35,392
Data plays

840
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:39,232
Elite Enterprise in additional time for example

841
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:42,048
Helium which is a full stack

842
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:43,328
Intuitive Solutions

843
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,352
For the Enterprise

844
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:45,888
They provide a very modern

845
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:47,168
Take on the

846
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,216
Surprisingly insult problemos

847
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:51,264
Keypoint sensors and getting

848
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,032
Data

849
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:55,104
Are things in a way that is very developer-friendly

850
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,640
And Best of You scalable

851
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:59,968
But you know that thing is going to be a whole range of

852
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:02,016
Signs to go vertical specific

853
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:02,784
Platforms

854
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,368
Two Souls comparable problems for example in oil and gas

855
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:09,440
I also think there's going to be your whole

856
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:11,232
What range of Appleton key you around

857
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,048
Security plays for the Internet of Things

858
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,376
Turn around data plays I think this whole set of Interest

859
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:19,424
Things are possible when

860
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:24,544
One industry that I am excited about Vivitrol drone

861
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,128
Industry which I think he's part of into the other things if you think of it.

862
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:28,896
Connected

863
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:35,296
Hardware I think they are going to be about the casements around collecting you forms of

864
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:36,832
Data using

865
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:37,856
Drones

866
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:42,464
Agricultural data of utilities data organelle pipeline inspection

867
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:44,256
And this whole range of

868
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:48,352
Enabling Technologies for drones but also for robots

869
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:52,448
Did you offer some general that

870
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:55,008
Okay let's talk about the consumer friend

871
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:59,872
So MD consumer from that personally find the category of bit more tricky

872
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:01,408
At least as of right now

873
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,992
As is at least to me it feel so bit more like a hit

874
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:05,760
Business

875
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:09,344
GRCC Detroit area that I look for in

876
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,648
Consumer iot plays

877
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:14,208
Three of them

878
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:17,024
First one is that I like

879
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:19,072
Show me plays that

880
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:20,352
Are mission critical

881
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,680
Which doesn't mean it's only mean that they are mission for

882
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:29,312
Nicole to everyone at all times but I believe the product should be mission-critical and I must have

883
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:31,872
For a large enough category of people

884
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:33,408
At least at certain points

885
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,432
In the life

886
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:35,200
So

887
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:38,272
Mission critical categories for ground pool

888
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:39,040
Include

889
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:40,576
From my perspective

890
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:41,344
Security

891
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:42,624
Who's health

892
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:43,648
Although

893
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:49,280
Not health care of because it's tricky because of the fda's involved and because pairs involved

894
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:50,816
Let's go digital health

895
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:54,400
Believe the family category is interesting

896
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:56,192
Meaning selling products

897
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:57,472
Two parents

898
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:58,240
That

899
00:36:58,496 --> 00:36:59,264
Have to do with a children

900
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:01,568
Possibly their own aging parents

901
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:06,688
I'm so products around babies are interesting because

902
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:13,088
People become temporarily price insensitive around the time to have babies and are willing to change the consumer

903
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,392
That's a nice way of saying insane

904
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,536
That bad happens to

905
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:24,608
As a parent I'm like I went through that

906
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:27,680
$400 for something that will last for like

907
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:29,216
3 months

908
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:33,824
Sorry

909
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:37,920
What you mean mission-critical also includes products where

910
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:40,736
One of these days in the early obsessive Behavior

911
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:41,760
We can be quiet

912
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:44,320
Selfie can be music and can be gaming

913
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:47,136
Consumer products

914
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:49,952
Leading to very deep and repeated engagement

915
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:51,744
I'm so over this for me is isthmus

916
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,512
Pretty cool

917
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:54,048
Musically

918
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:55,584
Excludes gadgets

919
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:56,864
Stuff that

920
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:00,960
Icing sold first world problems and that's my perspective

921
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:06,848
Timber Products in the connected home category which I think is an otherwise very interesting category but there are a number of products that

922
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,384
Fall in that category

923
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,152
Pennsylvania

924
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:10,176
Problems that

925
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:12,480
You know you didn't really know you if you had

926
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:17,344
Christmas 2014

927
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,624
Consumer products that I

928
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,648
Really better

929
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,952
Because of their internet connectivity

930
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:23,744
And even better alike

931
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,048
A consumer product that simply cannot exist

932
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,328
If they were

933
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:28,608
Not connecting

934
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:32,448
My Circle K area is at like quite frankly a lot of units

935
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,472
Space

936
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,752
I look for products

937
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:38,848
Where are the reschedule value Beyond Hardware sale

938
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:40,128
Could you go around

939
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,968
Kitchen subscription services and and data plays

940
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:50,112
I think it's been a little tricky with bad luck categories that takes a long time

941
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:53,184
Gets to the stage where you have interesting data plays

942
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,208
And

943
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:56,256
It's been one of these shoes that I think

944
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:58,560
Investors I've been grappling with

945
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:00,096
Hey it's your because

946
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:00,864
Text

947
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:05,216
While for a consumer connected products

948
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:07,264
To gain critical mass

949
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,824
What's the shipping then to get critical mass

950
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:12,128
By the time you have a

951
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,712
And I get to company to you as an excuse be in tonight because I'm serious

952
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:16,736
See that

953
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:21,600
Data plays not in Indian slow motion just yet so it requires

954
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:26,208
I'm sure he's going to receive that screws to be sometimes a bit more

955
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:32,608
Believers in division that description the ER as Leaders take investors that for sale for PlayStation 2

956
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:34,656
To be otherwise very metrics-driven

957
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:36,960
And let's talk about the difference between

958
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:37,728
Products

959
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:40,032
And infrastructure

960
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:41,056
Terms of building credible

961
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:46,432
I think we still in the early days of think the

962
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:48,736
Core connectivity problem is

963
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:52,576
Surprisingly unresolved committee that he will be resolved

964
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:53,856
Tune button

965
00:39:54,112 --> 00:40:00,256
It is sold to some extent in the home through Wi-Fi and Bluetooth

966
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,608
Somewhat souls for long-distance connectivity which

967
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:06,912
Sounds like it's going to be increasingly

968
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:07,680
Cellular

969
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:08,960
Connectivity

970
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:10,752
Price of silver connections

971
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,800
Seem to be going down at least four

972
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:14,592
Connected devices

973
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:17,920
I think this whole range of connectivity issues in

974
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:18,688
Between

975
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:20,992
Delivery near connectivity and the

976
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:22,784
Connect

977
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:24,832
Lachlan soul to the oranges

978
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:25,600
Players

979
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:27,904
Sigfox addressing

980
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,696
Connectivity issues but

981
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:36,096
You know if there are number different circumstances where I need your contacts where there are temperature

982
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:42,496
Curry shoes and Community shoes and wear the machine so the assets that you wanted monitor are in the basement working

983
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:44,288
Activities not sold

984
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:47,872
Unimpressed with your phone. I think there are plenty opportunities around

985
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:49,408
Security

986
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:50,432
Amvets

987
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:54,272
He's going to be a very important need at the same time for meeting.

988
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:55,040
Respective

989
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:56,576
Impurity have

990
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:57,344
2

991
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,880
Believe in the market because

992
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:01,184
The current security needs

993
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:01,952
AR

994
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:02,720
Just

995
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:04,256
Emerging

996
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:07,328
Security in many cases for

997
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,864
IG blockers

998
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:11,168
To look it up an afterthought

999
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:15,520
So is investor insecurity plays you have to believe that the problem is going to

1000
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:18,592
To be a merchant very quickly and in a very drastic way

1001
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:24,992
And you have to be willing to invest in companies that quite frankly don't have traction just yet because they don't

1002
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:27,296
Have no a very large and

1003
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:28,320
Well founded

1004
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:29,600
Customer base

1005
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,440
I also think it's Securities interesting because

1006
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:35,232
It feels like we need a new sim

1007
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:36,768
For the internet

1008
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,840
And it's still up in the air how we're going to actually do

1009
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:42,144
Do it so it's awesome

1010
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:43,680
But if you don't

1011
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:48,288
12

1012
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,848
No no no

1013
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:53,151
He's coming to the territory of

1014
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:55,967
Inari station Vassar you have to

1015
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:58,527
Do cows have some sense of

1016
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:03,903
Where did you take having a season surround its and then you have to be fortunate enough

1017
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:05,695
Define debris

1018
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:06,975
Best people

1019
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:13,631
In the specific segments so I'm trying to solve that problem and that the end of the day you have to

1020
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:18,239
Lyrics intellect and their ability to adapt to changing market conditions

1021
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:22,079
Quite frankly and support them as much as

1022
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:25,663
You can't but that's a that's a life of an artist Asian dresser

1023
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:26,687
I would never be able to do

1024
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:30,015
I can barely I can barely trust myself

1025
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:33,087
No face

1026
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:33,855
No face

1027
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:37,951
Alright what Matt thank you so much

1028
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:40,767
I really appreciate you coming on the show I have learned a lot

1029
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:41,791
It kind of makes me

1030
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:42,815
Feel good about not being

1031
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:44,607
So

1032
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:46,911
Any final words of wisdom

1033
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:50,751
Stepping into short-term life

1034
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:53,055
For Internet of Things entrepreneurs

1035
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:59,455
And the VC's bad back them he's going to be a little tricky and challenging at the same time

1036
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:05,855
That's what encouraged everyone to continue to be enthusiastic and certainly not lose faith I think the

1037
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:12,511
Can you teach self continues to be gigantic and exciting I continue to think that it is a

1038
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:14,559
A fundamental paradigm shift

1039
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:15,583
Happening in

1040
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:16,863
Computing in general

1041
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:20,959
I absolutely believe that the world is going in the general direction to work

1042
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:23,775
Everything will be connected to the internet

1043
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:25,311
One way or another and that open

1044
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:32,991
Teas to build large infrastructure companies but also to build new consumer companies that

1045
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:37,599
Will essentially becomes a new branch of tomorrow so I think the the reality of the approaching the

1046
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:40,415
Continues its are going to happen over the next 10 years

1047
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:43,231
Cleansing markets go up go down

1048
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:47,071
But if you end of the day great companies are created in Old Cycles

1049
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:49,631
So what I've been crate show everyone to

1050
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:52,703
Just to keep the face

1051
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:54,751
Thanks for having me Stacy and really enjoyed it

1052
00:43:55,007 --> 00:44:01,151
Thank you that's it for this week's show please join us next week on the Internet of Things podcast
