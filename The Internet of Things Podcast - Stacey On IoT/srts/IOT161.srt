Kevin

57
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,200
Big news today

58
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:56,736
Actually big news last week

59
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:57,760
I think was last

60
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:59,040
Amazon

61
00:01:59,296 --> 00:01:59,808
Announce

62
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:00,576
Blueprints

63
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,368
Basically this is

64
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,928
Templates that allow you to make

65
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,208
Custom skill

66
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:08,256
And I would do this and I was like

67
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,584
The rest of you guys made

68
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,608
Maybe like this is stupid

69
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:14,144
But what you can do is

70
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,936
You basically set one of these

71
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:17,984
Quiz template

72
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,752
And you can

73
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:20,032
Build your own quiz game

74
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:22,592
You can also do a fairytale one

75
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:23,616
You can do it

76
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,384
Trivia one

77
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:25,408
And

78
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:26,944
You can actually even do like

79
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:29,504
Cards for like foreign languages or anything else

80
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:31,296
I chose

81
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,576
The template for

82
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:33,344
Houseguest

83
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,904
To try to help them understand

84
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:36,928
My connected

85
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,208
So it's

86
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:39,488
Very easy it walks

87
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:40,256
Through every

88
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:42,560
You are limited by the types of quest

89
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,352
Selwyn house

90
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,912
Where can I find

91
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:50,752
Whatever you wanted them to find

92
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:51,520
And then

93
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,312
Anime with answers

94
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:55,616
They also had how do I

95
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:56,384
Was one of the eye

96
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:57,664
And then I had a car

97
00:02:58,944 --> 00:02:59,456
So

98
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,224
I filled out

99
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,760
One I did notice

100
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:02,528
That

101
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,320
It's very hard to guess what someone

102
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:05,856
So

103
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:07,392
I did a very generic

104
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:11,488
How do I turn on the lights cuz I didn't want to do 20 commands for turning on all the lights

105
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:13,280
Variations of a

106
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,096
And how do I work the thermostat

107
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:18,400
The other thing I noticed is that

108
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,448
When it came time to name my skill cuz

109
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,008
Would actually using

110
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:24,288
This would actually go in

111
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,080
Madam

112
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:26,848
Open

113
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:27,616
I wanted it to be

114
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,408
Stacy's helpful house

115
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,432
But

116
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,712
Was way too complicated for

117
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:32,480
Madam

118
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:33,760
And it warned me

119
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:35,040
So I just called at my house

120
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,344
If you walk into my house

121
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,112
And you say

122
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:40,416
Turn on my helpful house

123
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:43,744
You'll get this prompt from Madam and you can customize this

124
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,024
It says hi

125
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,048
Valpo house

126
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,096
What can I do to you can ask me

127
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:48,864
The following

128
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:50,912
So

129
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:52,448
It took me all of five minutes

130
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,520
It wasn't like the most well considered skill probably

131
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,800
But very easy

132
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:59,104
And I don't know if it's going to help people or not

133
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,128
Well I think

134
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:06,528
I don't know if it's going to help people or not but obviously the potential is there and I think it's brilliant of Amazon to make it easier to create

135
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,808
Skills mean

136
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:10,368
Anything they can do to add more smart

137
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:16,768
Sandra personalization to these devices is going to help and now they don't have to rely on developers to do that when you can do this

138
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:19,071
Is yourself in a relatively easy format

139
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:25,215
The houseguest one is a perfect ones probably the one I would have started with two because I remember my dad whenever he would be at my house look like

140
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:28,031
Hey before you go like he would watch the house when we went out

141
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,823
He would say how do I change the channel

142
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:35,711
Because of the technology we had in the house that he didn't have any these are the kinds of things that can really

143
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:37,247
Add benefits of

144
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:43,135
It's all about personalization and expansion of the echo ecosystem from a service standpoint I think it's

145
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:45,439
Again very very smart ass Amazon

146
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:47,231
Agreed and I wonder

147
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:51,071
Because as they get into business they're actually letting businesses do

148
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,095
Their own custom

149
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,119
Skills for a business

150
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:53,887
When is this is

151
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:54,911
India similar

152
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:55,935
Format for that

153
00:04:56,447 --> 00:05:02,591
It could be I mean just because it's simple and easy but I suspected businesses maybe they don't have an IT department

154
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,639
Probably yes businesses that do have

155
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:06,687
A lot of Technical Resources

156
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:09,503
They'll probably just use the regular skills apis and such

157
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,111
Because you can program them very easily and those folks would understand how to do that so

158
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,391
Yeah makes sense

159
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,695
Well I got excited about

160
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,463
Blueprints

161
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:20,255
Amazon has also

162
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:22,047
Bloomberg actually discovered that

163
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,095
Building

164
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,119
Robot

165
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,399
Making Kevin and I

166
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,167
Super psychic

167
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,447
Cuz we were just talking about

168
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:30,495
Tell us a little bit about

169
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,519
Amazon Vesta

170
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,287
Well that's

171
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:37,407
We don't know much for sure this is all reporting out of Bloomberg as you mentioned a code name of the robot

172
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,943
Effort is Vesta

173
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:45,343
Which is the Roman goddess of Hearth home and family so that kind of gives you an indication of hopefully where Amazon is heading here

174
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:48,671
Appears that this will be a mobile

175
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,695
Roving type

176
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:55,071
Robot that can navigate self navigate actually among different rooms based on early prototypes

177
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:59,167
I would imagine it has it's exactly what I said to two or three weeks

178
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,959
Exactly exactly

179
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:07,615
And people may think this is a little crazy but to be honest Amazon bought a robotics company

180
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:09,663
Back in 2012 I think it's called

181
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:10,943
Kiva systems

182
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,479
Yeah it is

183
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:16,831
775 million dollars and Navy use that investment to create

184
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,111
Robots in their warehouse

185
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,135
Does any have

186
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:19,903
As of

187
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:23,487
Early 2017 have 45000 of these

188
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:26,559
Amazon design build robots that

189
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:32,191
Move pallets around the warehouse is in such they're not picking items for delivery because they don't have the fine motor

190
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,215
Skills to do that

191
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:34,239
And I don't think

192
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:40,639
The best iRobot will do that either and I know that makes you sad Stacy because two weeks ago you said I want a robot with arms

193
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:44,223
I agree with you I do too many think we're there yet I don't see this as a

194
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,759
Task-based robot

195
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,807
The fold laundry and iron your clothes

196
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:50,367
I see this is more than informational

197
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:53,439
Robot that could help with presence detection in the house

198
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,719
Customize

199
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,487
Different

200
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,279
Settings in the home for you

201
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:59,071
Expected will have a camera with

202
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,607
Computer vision

203
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:03,679
And it'd be an information source that can do no

204
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,959
Follow me around and

205
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:08,543
I don't mind a camera in the house provided I have control over it

206
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:14,943
I don't want a camera in every room though so this to me is perfect as I can say robot go away I don't want you looking in here

207
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:17,247
Sitting here in my

208
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,039
PJ's watching TV whatever

209
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:21,599
I'm excited by the potential of us that's all I

210
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:22,367
Inside right now

211
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,671
Sure

212
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,975
You know how's it going to handle

213
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:27,743
Stairs

214
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,023
Facebook

215
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,071
Yeah

216
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:33,631
I'm not as excited as possibly Kevin

217
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,423
That's not

218
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:36,959
Actually kind of funny

219
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:40,799
Kevin was not a fan of the original Echo

220
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:41,823
And then

221
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,871
Okay I can see this being is

222
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,943
The original Echo had very little

223
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:52,575
Final bit of news on the echo

224
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:54,111
There is now a

225
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,647
New Amazon Echo

226
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,927
Kids edition

227
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:02,559
I've used the Kindle Freetime app when my daughter is younger on

228
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,351
Kindle Fire tablet

229
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,655
And that was the most aggravating

230
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,679
Confusing interface

231
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,215
I think I've really ever

232
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,519
So I don't know if I'm thrilled about this

233
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:18,431
Yeah I did my kids are older so we don't use any of the free time type things on the Amazon devices but you know

234
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,479
This is an $80 Echo.

235
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:22,015
It said I got a case on it

236
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:24,831
It also includes the free time

237
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,623
I'm not as bad as you would said

238
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:30,207
If you want you can actually just add

239
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:34,303
Free time on near existing. For $3 a month

240
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,607
She don't want to buy the new.

241
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,375
Basically

242
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:39,167
What does is ad

243
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:44,287
Specific content that kid friendly such as certain skills audible books and other things

244
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,055
You can

245
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,079
Keep track of

246
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:49,151
Limit their music in a knot

247
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:52,735
Share explicit tunes and so on and so forth

248
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:53,759
It's from the anime

249
00:08:55,807 --> 00:09:01,951
Will a lot of your right and a lot of the echo focus it presupposes that you're a a Prime member bu

250
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:05,791
Subscribe to everything that Amazon offers and so on so forth so

251
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:12,191
Yes it does it could be though that you could limit adjust the Amazon music service as part of the parental

252
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,215
You know

253
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:16,031
South exit is a logical extension of what

254
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:18,079
Amazon already has with the echo

255
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:22,943
I don't think they needed to come out with a new device cuz it's really the same device just with a little case on it

256
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:29,343
But it's a way for them to customize it for a different market segments they've been very specific about the privacy

257
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,391
That's obviously an issue when it comes to kids

258
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:38,047
They said that no data is collected for advertising purposes the only date it that's used is used to make the product

259
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:40,095
Better I still wonder about that from a

260
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,887
Copper standpoint here in the US

261
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,935
But they haven't said anything about that

262
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,727
Okay

263
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,263
And now moving on to her

264
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,799
What caused the university be

265
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:49,823
Because we've got some

266
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:50,847
Some crazy fun news

267
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,383
First step is

268
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:55,967
Smart walls from Chris Harrison who is a professor with a human can

269
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:56,991
Computer interaction

270
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:58,783
Carnegie Mellon

271
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,087
He's got two projects out

272
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,623
One is a digital interact

273
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,391
Out of paper

274
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,671
But the second one

275
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,439
Is something I could

276
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,207
Sienna smart

277
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:07,999
It's called wall

278
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:08,767
Plus plus

279
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,303
And basically it

280
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,583
Turns your wall into a

281
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,351
Positive

282
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,119
Touchstone

283
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,911
In the cost for this

284
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,447
So far they estimated

285
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,471
Just about $20

286
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:18,495
Per square meter

287
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,031
So it's not exactly cheap

288
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,311
But it's not like in

289
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,079
Insanely expensive

290
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,871
And you can do without tools so you just

291
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:24,639
Put the substance

292
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:26,175
On wall and then yuan

293
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:28,735
Paint over it and then you attach sensors to the baseboard

294
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,527
And your wall becomes this

295
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,295
Capacitive touch

296
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:32,831
From there you can

297
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:33,599
Can build

298
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:37,439
Psoriasis on top of it like apps that will say hey I'm touching the wall here this may

299
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,207
Means that

300
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,743
It can figure out

301
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,279
What electronic

302
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:44,095
Objects are in a room and if they're on or off like lights

303
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:46,655
Computers are televisions and

304
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:49,983
This just seemed to really intriguing it was not where I thought of Summer

305
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,007
Smartwall would go

306
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:55,871
I can see that so you can just walk in and slap your wall and turn things on

307
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:56,639
Or you could

308
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,663
Touch your wall

309
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,967
I got to say that I do not like the other PDF

310
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:02,783
But

311
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:09,439
Yeah you don't have to actually touch the lobby so you get finer resolution in terms of the sensors if you are touching them all but you're so

312
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:11,231
Standing close enough to it it can actually do

313
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:13,535
Determine your pose and so on and so forth

314
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:17,631
It's an interesting approach to mean basically these are little squares

315
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:20,959
That each one is a pixel essentially like a pixel in a display

316
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:22,751
And you just

317
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:29,151
Set these up in a crisscross pattern and then connect them all up with some wire in the sensor then you got a touch-sensitive Wallen

318
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:35,039
I agree with you this didn't go the way I thought it would I didn't think the smart why would be a sensor I thought I'd be more of a display

319
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:37,599
Lick with a projector or something like that but

320
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:38,623
This was

321
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:41,695
Kind of interesting and I'd be curious to see what people can do with it

322
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,463
Yeso

323
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,255
Will put his link to that in the show notes

324
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,023
And

325
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,047
Can a baby with Chris

326
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,327
Montauk in the shower

327
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,351
The fun project

328
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,911
Alright other crazy news

329
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:53,983
In the University of Washington has created a

330
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,007
A way to train

331
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,031
Transmit video

332
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,055
Using

333
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:57,823
Less power

334
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:00,383
Basically what they've done is

335
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,151
They're using

336
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:03,967
Backscatter and I should tell you the University of Washington

337
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:06,527
Has a really impressive Wireless wreath

338
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,063
So

339
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:08,831
They have

340
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:11,135
Done research on light detecting wear

341
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,159
People are in a room

342
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,439
The destruction

343
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,207
Your body's make

344
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,231
NRS

345
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,535
Dickinson other cool things around the

346
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,815
Wireless power

347
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,095
Transmission so

348
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,119
These people

349
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,399
University of Washington

350
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,679
They got their Wireless down

351
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,959
So basically what you

352
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:26,495
You can do is send

353
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:27,519
Full color HD

354
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,287
The signal is

355
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,311
60 frames per second

356
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,591
For less than a y

357
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,127
What is still huge

358
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,175
Samsung 4 battery power

359
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,735
But you can also send a 7:20

360
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,527
Image at 10

361
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:40,063
Per second that can be sent

362
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,343
4 under 80 microwave

363
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,135
And that gets a lot closer to

364
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,695
So maybe it's like

365
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:46,975
Grainger doorbell

366
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,791
Shoot the video from the doorbell

367
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:50,815
To screen

368
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:51,583
Without having

369
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,351
Go

370
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,119
To the cloud

371
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,143
Swepco

372
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:59,775
And because it's low power it could be a battery powered device at that point

373
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,567
Yeah there's some really cool things

374
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,847
The tech is already lights

375
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,383
Jeeva Wireless

376
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:06,431
So you might be able to see this

377
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,455
Intake

378
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,295
Woo

379
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,343
And final cool Universal

380
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,367
Princeton

381
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,135
University

382
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:16,415
Was kind of a letdown

383
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:23,839
I mean it's a letdown to me only in that I can actually use the tool that they came out with its called the IRT

384
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,119
Inspector project

385
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:32,031
Basically the project tries to figure out what your attitude devices talk to what information is gathered

386
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,567
And are the devices hacked

387
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:34,847
12 very important things

388
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,639
Fortunately they're going to

389
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,431
Open source this tool

390
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:43,295
To let you inspect your own iot devices and you have to email them to join a waitlist but

391
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:46,623
I mean that's the only let down to me is that I can't get it right now I'm just curious what

392
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,903
Information provides

393
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:51,999
And when I find out

394
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:56,863
Hopefully we'll be able to tell you more about

395
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,143
Play my devices

396
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:01,215
But you guys try not to

397
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:02,495
All right

398
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:03,519
News

399
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,335
There is a social media law

400
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:07,871
Brought to

401
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,407
And

402
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,175
I read it

403
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,199
I'm sad

404
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,479
I'm sad because this is

405
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,783
Sewickley for online platforms

406
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:17,087
And it doesn't look like it's going to help people

407
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:19,903
In the iot it doesn't look like it's going to deal with collecting I

408
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:20,671
Iot data

409
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:23,743
So the rule will deal with covered online platforms

410
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:24,511
And that means

411
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,303
An online platform that collects

412
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:29,375
Data during the online behavior of a user

413
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,399
The online platform

414
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,423
Which

415
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,959
I'm not online with my nest

416
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:33,983
Collecting data about me

417
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,007
Meandering

418
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:36,799
I'm not online

419
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,079
Where am I

420
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:44,735
You are not that your devices are like when you're asleep for example and things are being sensed and recorded in motion is.

421
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:47,551
Detective because the dog walk past a camera

422
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:51,391
The device like I said is online that is online you are not

423
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:52,415
So yeah

424
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:55,487
In the term online platform use any public face

425
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:57,023
Website web application

426
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,559
Digital application

427
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,095
Including a mobile

428
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,119
Includes

429
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:01,887
The Social Network

430
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:02,655
Add Network

431
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,679
Mobile OS

432
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:04,447
Search engine

433
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,215
Email service

434
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:07,519
Again

435
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,567
I want some clarity here for iot

436
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,103
I think they belong in the

437
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:13,407
Digital

438
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,431
Protection

439
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:16,735
The rights in here are not great

440
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,783
Basically saying look at

441
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,879
What you're collecting

442
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,415
And give them a chance

443
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,207
Opt out if they opt out

444
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,999
They just no longer they don't have to

445
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:32,351
Which is different from the gdpr because I believe you can opt out of data collection

446
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,119
Still use

447
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,167
Which

448
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:36,959
Or just different

449
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,007
So this

450
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,543
Proposed legislation

451
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,335
Is very far from

452
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,615
Coming along so we may never

453
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,431
It seems like the beginning of

454
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:47,967
Gdpr effort

455
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:48,991
Us

456
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,015
See where it goes

457
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,039
And hopefully

458
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:54,367
Anywhere

459
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,391
Comcast

460
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,415
Just a little update

461
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,951
Because they reported earnings they now have

462
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:58,719
One point

463
00:15:59,231 --> 00:15:59,743
2

464
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:00,767
In Xfinity

465
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,047
Subscriber stats

466
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,327
About 44%

467
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:04,863
End

468
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,655
That's really all I have to say about that

469
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,495
Xfinity home

470
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:12,543
Custom is one of the larger players

471
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:19,711
They're making progress I have a feeling a lot of it has to do with potential bundling of service

472
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:22,527
I don't have anything more to say about it than that other than

473
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:24,831
Not the fact that they can do that as an advantage for them

474
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:25,855
Yes it is actually

475
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,647
Ashley helping them even if they lose cable

476
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:28,415
Subscribers

477
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,695
Their revenue

478
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:30,975
Producer is still up

479
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:32,511
So looking for

480
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,791
Increase broadband

481
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,071
But also

482
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,119
Opposite to me

483
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,679
Same or more

484
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,215
Money-making ability as

485
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,543
Right so Canary

486
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:51,967
I don't know how many Canary users there are out there but I am one so I just want to mention to ask Canary folks that

487
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:56,575
Recently Canary devices got person detection that I think it was back in February

488
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:58,623
Now with the latest Apple update

489
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:01,951
You can set your devices to record all motion

490
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:08,351
Just people only or not to record it all and motion alerts themselves can be configured for all motion people on Leon

491
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,119
Or nothing so

492
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:13,727
This kind of cleaned up some of the noise in the canary timeline and notifications

493
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:18,591
Systems the people detections actually pretty good although it still recognizes nor my dog is up first

494
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,127
But that's right

495
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,663
Donut he is

496
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,455
I can't argue with that

497
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:26,271
Alright other little gadgety updates

498
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,039
Google

499
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,063
Assistant.

500
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:28,831
Two new partners

501
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,111
Sensi the Sensi home

502
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,391
Stat from Emerson

503
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,671
Sun and and also

504
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:33,695
After I

505
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:34,975
Complain about it two weeks ago

506
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:36,767
Tradfri lights from

507
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,559
Ikea are now also

508
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:39,839
Supported by

509
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:40,607
Google home

510
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,143
Probably should have to

511
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,727
I was just going to ask you're going to put them back

512
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:46,495
I am

513
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:47,775
What kind of begrudgingly

514
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,823
I'm not turning back in my husband's bed

515
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:50,591
Side table lamp

516
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:51,871
That really makes them

517
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,687
All right

518
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:55,967
Let's see there is a

519
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:58,015
Really popular chip out there

520
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:01,087
Now that people are using for building iot device

521
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,623
Expressive

522
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,647
ESP

523
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:04,415
82

524
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:08,511
So this is a chips that a lot of hackers and fun

525
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:09,279
People kind of you

526
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,815
Can I play around with

527
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:12,607
End

528
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:13,887
Harry Potter

529
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:16,703
And it just the new version of it has now Wi-Fi mesh

530
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,471
Networking

531
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:20,799
So now you can use mesh WiFi stuff for your Gadget

532
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:21,567
Is that your building with

533
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:22,847
And it is

534
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,383
Makes it a little bit more

535
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:27,711
I don't have much to say Beyond this but I know there's a certain subset of our list

536
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,783
So excited

537
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,575
And finally

538
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:34,367
Who's has a new mesh Wi-Fi assist

539
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,159
And it's got built-in

540
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,439
Insecurities from Trend Micro

541
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:41,279
I think so I mean the fact that

542
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,047
It has begun

543
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,583
Security through trends

544
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:49,983
Micro work basically hits their Cloud database of known malware sites and Sachin else protect you from them witches

545
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:50,751
Constantly updated

546
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:51,775
Which is nice

547
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:57,919
You have that service for the lifetime of the products or it's not like a subscription it's not like you get for 3 months

548
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:00,735
You have for lifetime of the product which I think is very nice

549
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:07,135
These are kind of interesting mean we seen Odyssey mesh Wi-Fi routers and access points before

550
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:09,951
These are a little unique in that they almost look like

551
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:14,303
Cheese irons that you would use to iron your clothes there like a pyramid in fact

552
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:19,167
And the reason there a pyramid is because the antennas are aligned to send the signals

553
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:20,191
Horizontally

554
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:26,079
And vertically so that helps with multi-level homes this is also three-by-three mymo which

555
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:30,175
Is 3 antennas in each unit so that should help with coverage as well

556
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:33,503
299 on pre-order at Amazon

557
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:36,831
And I'm trying to see when I think they come out in May

558
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,111
We don't have long

559
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:41,439
All right

560
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,207
And now

561
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,743
I have been waiting for

562
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,023
Kevin Hayes

563
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:45,791
It's made

564
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,583
Well

565
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,351
I'm not up

566
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:50,399
Set about my home

567
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:52,959
Smart home right now but I'm not happy with it

568
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:57,055
All the unhappiness aim for me to start when I went over to SmartThings

569
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:57,823
And we just

570
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:58,591
Talk about

571
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,359
You know which

572
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:06,015
Smart home hubs are available which ones are the best which ones are the ones we recommend for most people and we typically do recommend either

573
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:11,391
SmartThings or wink and I've had both that I know you've had booked Stacy I'm going back to wink

574
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:12,159
Because

575
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:14,207
The SmartThings software just

576
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:19,071
Doesn't if not as responsive as waiting for one thing it just seems like it always has to refresh

577
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:21,631
For 2 seconds every time I open the app and check

578
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,679
Device States and so on and so forth

579
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:25,983
Even if the app is open in the background

580
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:32,383
I don't know I know you can do more with SmartThings if you want to get into device handlers and custom things have but I'm over that

581
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:38,783
So I think I'm going to move everything back to wink which is kind of a shame because I just moved everything over to SmartThings couple weeks ago

582
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,343
So I don't know what maybe it's just me what do you think

583
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:46,463
Could you please. Yeah I think you're actually right so and you actually did you some of the device Handler

584
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,231
To play with some

585
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:50,047
I think for

586
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,839
Everybody who does not want

587
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:54,143
If you don't have some weird device you're trying to say

588
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,423
Support or some

589
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,959
Grandiose automation

590
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:59,519
This game that you're trying to support wink is the way to go

591
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:00,799
I just worry

592
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:03,103
Now that it's owned by William

593
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,639
I don't know what's going to happen

594
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:06,431
Do it but it's a great platform

595
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,455
I'm still for

596
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:08,479
Everybody

597
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:11,039
Yeah we've had concerns about wink as a

598
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:13,343
Product line for a while because

599
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,416
They were kind of in limbo and yeah they were

600
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:20,000
Quirky + GE and then sold there still around

601
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:26,400
So I mean that doesn't mean any for the future but maybe maybe we were worried about it for nothing I don't know I should also point out and

602
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:27,680
State Cinema if you saw this

603
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:28,704
We

604
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:32,800
Got a comment on our Facebook page about the news

605
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:37,664
SmartThings app cuz they do have two apps right now they have classic and then the newer one

606
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,224
And in the new one it's

607
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:40,992
Says

608
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:43,552
In the FAQ is that you cannot

609
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:45,856
Connect Madam a Google home

610
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:47,904
Or Cortana if you try to connect

611
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,952
And even for the first time using smart

612
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:51,488
This is under the new app

613
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:56,352
If you've already been connected with those digital assistants in the classic app and then you update

614
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:58,144
You can use those devices

615
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,936
I don't know if that means

616
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:05,056
They're getting rid of that support once you get for new users on the new app or not

617
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:08,384
Okay so I sent an email to Alex Hawkinson

618
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,664
Who's the CEO of SmartThings

619
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,432
When I saw that

620
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:12,224
I sent him a comment and I was like

621
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:12,992
What

622
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,040
Is this really true and he says

623
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:16,832
It's definitely not true

624
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:20,416
He says we are planning to be even more open

625
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,952
And he promised to talk to me

626
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,256
Now I am in Sweden so it's very difficult to get ahold of

627
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:27,584
So I will have more clarity

628
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,864
Before you guys on this

629
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:29,888
Next episode

630
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:30,912
Cuz I saw that I was

631
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:31,936
What what

632
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:33,984
I think that was your like bread-and-butter say

633
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:34,752
Samsung loves being

634
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,080
So guys take that with a grain of

635
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:41,152
That's good news I mean

636
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:43,712
It kind of sounded like they were just going to go to Bixby

637
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:44,992
And that is not

638
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,784
Obviously not open and not what

639
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,808
Everybody wants

640
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,600
The odd thing to me is

641
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:53,440
It's right there in the app if it uses I double checked it myself so

642
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:55,488
They can resolve their own issues right away by

643
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,280
Fixing that FAQ page

644
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:58,304
I agree with you

645
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:02,144
That's why we're to have a follow-up conversation when I'm back from Sweden

646
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,192
So stay tuned on

647
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:04,960
Bat

648
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:05,728
Right

649
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:06,496
Now

650
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:08,288
Time to go to our hotline

651
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,568

Schlage electronic lock

You make life so much easier and more

663
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:32,864
No more keeping track of extra house keys

664
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,424
Each member of your family can have their own access code

665
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:37,984
Does he was possible is it schlage.com

666

To learn more

667
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,848
And here we have our question of the week from Dan

668
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:44,640
PlayStation Kevin

669
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:46,432
This is Dan from North Carolina

670
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:49,504
I'm a longtime listener but a first-time caller we're having a

671
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,064
Complete kitchen makeover done this summer on our house

672
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:54,624
Including knocking over wall new cabinets

673
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,904
Appliances everything

674
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:57,696
I'm a SmartThings user with about

675
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:58,720
20.

676
00:23:58,976 --> 00:23:59,744
Two things currently

677
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,024
Besides considering

678
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:01,792
Smart Appliance

679
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:03,584
This is like the June oven and others

680
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,120
What are the top few ice

681
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:07,168
Do things you'd recommend I do in the kitchen

682
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,960
Given that I'm in that uniques

683
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:11,264
Situation of a clean slate to work

684
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:14,848
Smart switches on overhead lighting are a definite for me

685
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:15,872
Summer to do that

686
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:17,152
Do you have any other recommendations

687
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,176
Thanks again

688
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,200
Oh

689
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:20,480
Dan I

690
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:21,248
So

691
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,528
So envious of

692
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:24,576
Love you I hope you're going for one of those big farmhouse

693
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:26,880
Because personally when we did our kitchen

694
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:27,648
I said

695
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:29,184
No I don't need anything like that

696
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:30,976
Credit everyday

697
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:32,512
Don't let this happen

698
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:34,304
Do you accept on your smart stuff B

699
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,352
Because I guarantee in five years you're going to be like

700
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,144
Probably made the wrong choice

701
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,168
Just because it's strange

702
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:41,216
My first recommendation

703
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:42,496
Into you is

704
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:44,032
Yes smart switches

705
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:46,848
Pick your favorite I'm going to offer to you

706
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:50,176
If your kitchen is an open floor plan cuz you mentioned you were

707
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,456
Knocking out a wall

708
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:54,528
I might actually take that opportunity to try the noon

709
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:55,296
Smart

710
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:57,856
Home lights because I've been really intrigued in this

711
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:59,904
The product it designs the lights

712
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,672
It's for you

713
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:03,232
It detects what kind of lighting you have and then

714
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,512
Built-ins around

715
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:05,792
Before you automatically

716
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:07,328
I think it's kind of compelling

717
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:11,168
And kind of expensive but wrapped in a Renault it could definitely work

718
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:11,936
And

719
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:13,984
It all depends though if you're doing

720
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:15,008
Open

721
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:18,592
If not then go with the straight up I recommend Lutron because

722
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:20,384
They're my favorite you will need a hub

723
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,152
But

724
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:23,968
I would also install some smart Outlets

725
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,504
With USB ports in

726
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:29,344
If you're going to go with a smart outlet a zigbee or Z-Wave should be just fine

727
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:31,904
You may depending on your current host

728
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,952
System chooses a day because

729
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,536
Their support for it from like the Amazon Echo has

730
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:38,304
Automatic

731
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,328
Recipes for dinner

732
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,864
But I don't think it really matters

733
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:43,424
And that way you don't have to have these Outlets cramming

734
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,448
Things up

735
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:46,496
Still have that ability to turn Appliance

736
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:49,056
How to charge your car

737
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:49,824
Connected devices

738
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,592
Yay

739
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:52,128
Casper Smart Appliance

740
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,152
This is

741
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:53,920
Hard for me

742
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:55,200
Because I

743
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:57,504
You know I would love for you to install the June oven

744
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,808
It's awesome and they do have a in wall oven

745
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:00,832
But

746
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:02,624
There's a lot of compelling

747
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,160
Use cases are arguing

748
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:04,928
Commence for

749
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:05,696
Buying

750
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:06,976
Appliances all for one

751
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,024
And that kind of makes me feel gross

752
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:15,680
I don't know but they didn't match in that comes in big as a nice looking for you has good resale ability so

753
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:17,472
GE has

754
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:20,032
Probably worked the hardest

755
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,824
I'm building out like

756
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,592
Integration

757
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:25,920
And thinking about the kitchen is an in

758
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:26,688
Integrated whole

759
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:29,248
So they've done a good job

760
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,296
I don't particularly know about there

761
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,112
Quality though and I don't think you should

762
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:35,392
You should choose your Appliance

763
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,416
Is based on

764
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:37,952
How well they function is there me

765
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:39,744
Main function not is how well they

766
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,512
Play function with

767
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:42,560
Smart stuff

768
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:45,632
So that's a ten

769
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:46,656
Kevin anything else

770
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:47,680
You would install

771
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:51,264
I don't know that I would install it but I'm very disappointed Stacy

772
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,336
Because you did not mention the one thing I thought you were going to mention

773
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:56,128
Ceiling mounts for MS

774
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:58,432
Ace

775
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,200
Smart

776
00:26:59,456 --> 00:26:59,968
Faucet

777
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:00,992
For your sake

778
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:02,272
I forgot about that

779
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:05,856
Okay two things

780
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:07,648
Because you're putting it into the delta

781
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,928
Capacitive touch

782
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:09,696
To its touch

783
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:11,744
2 hour touch O2 faucet

784
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:13,280
Speaks to

785
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:14,816
Because it's

786
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,608
And if you don't want to do that

787
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:20,960
Just going to capacitive touch faucet your first couple days you could be like why did I do this

788
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:23,776
This is weird and then you're never going to want to turn on your closet any other

789
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:24,800
This is my

790
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:25,824
Pledge to you

791
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:27,360
Santo Rosario

792
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,664
I do I kept you around for

793
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:31,200
Yes

794
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,272
All right

795
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,064
So those are thoughts there Dan

796
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:37,344
Wish you luck

797
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,392
I'm sad that I can't think of any other off

798
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:44,512
But there's a number of smart scales and

799
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:46,304
Smart pots and smart

800
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,840
Other devices

801
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:50,400
They're all stand-alone kind of thing for the most part

802
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:54,752
Maybe some smart blinds

803
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:57,312
You know sometimes I like to wash dishes at night and then

804
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,336
People looking at me

805
00:27:58,592 --> 00:27:59,360
Okay

806
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:01,152
Venetian we've got the

807
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,432
It's called smart blinds

808
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:04,736
Venetian style blinds that flip open

809
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:09,856
Clothes for you we don't really have we have to Hunter Douglas in the Lutron Serena Shades if you

810
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:10,624
Wanted to go out.

811
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:12,416
Traditional

812
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:13,184
Shades

813
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:13,952
And yeah

814
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:16,256
Alright then good luck with your kitchen renovation

815
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:17,280

And now

828
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:36,480
Stay tuned

829
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:37,504
Message from

830
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:42,880
One of our sponsors and to hear more about designing products that are connected and sustainable

831
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:49,536
And a bit of more about the keys product we are taking a break from the internet

832
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:55,936
The thing is podcast for a message from our sponsor cuz we sponsor is for trop and we are going to talk about privacy

833
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:58,240
Is brand Equity with Ben Goodman

834
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:00,800
VP of strategy and innovation

835
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:03,872
Ben first off let's remind people what for truck

836
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:05,920
Is it

837
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:09,248
Send our scale of flexibility let's our customers

838
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:11,040
Movie on the traditional

839
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:16,160
Identity use cases that people use me Enterprise so things like provisioning employee access

840
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:17,184
We do a lot more

841
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:18,720
One of our biggest difference

842
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:21,536
Is that we've focused really heavily on

843
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:22,304
Privacy

844
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,072
So we have

845
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:24,096
Craft the standard

846
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:25,632
Call user managed access

847
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:29,216
Which helps users gain control of who has access

848
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:30,240
Personal data

849
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:32,544
We were the first commercially available products

850
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,312
Incorporated

851
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:34,848
Uma really is a

852
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:36,896
Great framework for building

853
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:38,432
Privacy and consent program

854
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,992
And I can help customers with things like

855
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:41,760
Gdpr

856
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:42,528
Compliance which is a

857
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:45,856
Standard in the European Union for privacy and consent

858
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:49,952
We haven't talked to you in the last few weeks about Cambridge analytica and what it means to

859
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:55,328
Give consent to the use of your data you explain to me that you actually think this was a breach when a lot of

860
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,608
People are trying to make the de

861
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:57,376
Distinction that it

862
00:29:57,888 --> 00:30:01,728
Yeah I think it's time that we really reimagine what makes up a bridge

863
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,080
I mean if someone gets access to our data in a way that we didn't

864
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:07,360
Anticipate

865
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:08,384
Consent to

866
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,408
That is a breach

867
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:14,016
For example just because Cambridge analytica was working with in Facebook's terms

868
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:14,784
Service

869
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,064
It doesn't mean it wasn't a breach

870
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:20,160
When someone misleads me to do something like taking online trivia test

871
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:22,976
And uses that to harvest my personal data

872
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:24,512
And the date of my friend

873
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:26,048
How can I be anything but

874
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,888
This really is a modern social media version of a phishing attack

875
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,704
Okay so do you think this is going to change how

876
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,472
Consumers

877
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:35,008
View consent

878
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:36,800
I hope that this really does

879
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:38,336
Create an Awakening in the end

880
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:39,104
Consumer

881
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,176
I think for the first time people realize that

882
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:43,456
If they're getting a service

883
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:47,296
Jeffrey dende and their data are the actual product

884
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:50,624
Respect that people are going to suddenly start reading 50

885
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,440
Epays terms of services or end-user license

886
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:55,488
What I do expect

887
00:30:55,744 --> 00:31:00,096
Text is that there's that now collect a lot of data are going to have to find ways to

888
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:05,728
Surface what they're doing with people data in a way which is much easier for them to consume and understand

889
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:06,496
And how does

890
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:07,264
Ford truck help

891
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,568
We believe that identity is a

892
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,104
Privacy

893
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:16,480
You know you really have to understand a person and their attributes in order to provide privacy

894
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:18,528
As I mentioned the beginning

895
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,904
Was really designed from the ground up to be a key supporting technology

896
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:24,928
Before any further

897
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:28,000
And we were the first commercial product

898
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:29,536
It support this user managed access

899
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:31,328
Which citizenship

900
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:33,376
Privacy and consent dashboards

901
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:36,192
That can be added into our customer

902
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:38,496
Products to help them as a brand

903
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:42,336
Who's quickly to show that they care about a customer's privacy

904
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:43,360
Protection

905
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:45,664
And really give a customer the levers

906
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:48,224
Have a control over their own personal data

907
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:48,992
Sounds good

908
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:50,272
So where can we go to find out more

909
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:51,552
Define amorous

910
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:52,320
Pacifically about

911
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:53,856
Stufful doing with privacy

912
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:56,160
Please go to www

913
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:58,208
Ford rock.com

914
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:00,768
Flash privacy

915
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:14,080
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham and today I have not one but two

916
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:15,616
I am here at

917
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:17,664
Kids headquarters in Elmhurst

918
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,432
Sweden

919
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:22,528
And I am learning the correct pronunciation for trustee and eating meatballs

920
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:26,368
So let's get this started we got to guess we got Rebecca

921
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:28,160
Tori man who's in charge of the

922
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:29,696
Tradfri products

923
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:32,000
Okay I will let her say it

924
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:33,280
Wow

925
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:34,304
Okay

926
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,888
And then after we talked to her for a little bit we're going to talk to

927
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:38,656
Rihanna

928
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:43,264
Call back who is in charge of Designing and Manufacturing products

929
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:46,336
So I am super pumped about all of this

930
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:49,920
So Rebecca by the end of this maybe I pronounce this correctly

931
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:53,504
Alright so

932
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,552
I purchase the lights and

933
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:56,320
Apparently

934
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:59,136
A couple weeks ago I put mine away for awhile.

935
00:32:59,392 --> 00:32:59,904
Twerking

936
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:05,280
But for all of those if they've been out in the market for a year so let's talk about what you've learned

937
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,816
Since they've been out in the market

938
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:09,120
Our customers finding them

939
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:11,680
Do they come in asking for them at the store or do they just cut it

940
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:12,960
Buy them by

941
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:14,752
Running across them what is that process

942
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:16,800
I think when we start to develop

943
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:19,104
Bismarck shooting range

944
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:19,872
Two feet

945
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:26,272
The normal Eye Care customer that is also take gate usually and that's also we're about all of this technology that that exist

946
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:27,552
And we learn

947
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:29,088
Is that we attract

948
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:30,112
Many new type of

949
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,976
So many customers that I love Ben and I care for a couple of years and now they have actually read

950
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:39,584
That we have something that is connected and they are coming but we are also that in the track

951
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,864
Our normal

952
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:46,240
The one that doesn't know that there is something that is called zigbee or connected lighting

953
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:47,264
It just once

954
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,032
Steam daylight

955
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,616
I have been very fun to see that

956
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:53,920
We got traction from both of those types of

957
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:59,296
Because that is so wasted just a cold Manchester

958
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:00,320
Try and

959
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:01,088
Work

960
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:07,488
And they also said a lot about Sarah because people also want to be able to steer their products away via

961
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:11,584
Of course also when you get to get to get the connection supplement and Amazon

962
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:15,424
Google so I'll spread to all of our customers

963
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,776
And you have a sense of how many customers

964
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:23,104
Hi their stuff back to Amazon or Google or

965
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:31,040
So when customers buy these from the store

966
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:35,136
How do you educate them about what they can do how are you selling this

967
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:35,904
In the market

968
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:36,672
Exactly

969
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:42,304
We have an education package.

970
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:48,960
Wheels have of course location in the store so she can do and then if you have by the age and of course browser

971
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:51,520
To do we don't have so many things yet

972
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:57,920
We have of course individual steering we have the ability for stability

973
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:58,944
To do timers

974
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,992
And then they seem to get ratified

975
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:04,064
The back is fine but then of course when it comes to these equations

976
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,088
Now we talk

977
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:10,720
Both into storage sign of course our partners also talked about that now it's possible to go connect to switch

978
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:12,256
Flights to this in this area

979
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:14,560
So you guys are done lighting so far

980
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:16,608
You've done wireless charging that everyone

981
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:17,376
So excited

982
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:18,912
And you done

983
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:20,960
New Bluetooth speakers what's next

984
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:21,728
4

985
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,264
HomeSmart

986
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:26,080
Yasso lighting is very important

987
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:28,128
Important so we're adding on

988
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:29,152
Products and features

989
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:31,712
So when we are then them

990
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:34,528
Hopefully morning in the whole month of our customers

991
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:37,600
We're also not to say we have also launched the Bluetooth

992
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:38,368
Speakers

993
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:40,672
Cannabis

994
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:43,488
Sound that's what it's like to use a very

995
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:44,256
Important

996
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:46,304
Components to create a go.

997
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:48,096
So it would also then

998
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:50,912
Continue the journey towards some plastic sound

999
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:53,216
And we're doing back with some of them.

1000
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:55,520
What are you doing with soda

1001
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:58,848
So many secrets you guys

1002
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:00,384
Cheer in Sweden

1003
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:04,736
Okay and what are other areas that you're excited about

1004
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:07,808
There's sound obviously you mentioned earlier hell

1005
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:14,208
Insecurity is another kind of Maslow's hierarchy of needs

1006
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:14,976
Perspective

1007
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:18,048
You know we're looking into them what could either area

1008
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:22,912
But we're not entering those areas if it is not soda profound very good music

1009
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:29,568
Surfers looking at the customers racing okay what are the pinpoints what do they want to have and then we are creating then

1010
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:36,992
Preston sport. NECC security maybe not so much for us while the safety National cleaning safe

1011
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:38,272
Very important

1012
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:39,296
Peace of mind

1013
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:41,088
Could be about 10

1014
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:42,368
Aunt is also set

1015
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:45,696
Very interesting process if we could do sings there when it comes

1016
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:47,232
Free sample to sleeping

1017
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:53,888
Esther how could we support people to do that so there are very many interesting areas so we're looking into it doesn't have

1018
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:55,936
To be with connected products

1019
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:59,520
Shouldn't say easier but that but without the types of products

1020
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:01,824
Package to the point that you have

1021
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,128
Just hammered home with me today it's

1022
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,408
Smart doesn't mean

1023
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:08,480
So in some cases smart could be

1024
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:09,504
I don't know

1025
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:10,528
Wireless charger

1026
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:13,344
Wireless charging that's smart without really being connected to

1027
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:16,160
To make something smart what are your attempt design

1028
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,720
What does it mean to make something

1029
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:23,840
Yeah we are at all of those talks about their under the umbrella

1030
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:29,984
And when we traded HomeSmart we didn't create smartphones we're going to tell smart so we put the home first very important for us

1031
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:32,032
So I think in order for us to pray

1032
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:34,080
HomeSmart products or a smart car

1033
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,640
When you should take King

1034
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:41,504
I think Moana to component that we are done tweaking a normal eye care product

1035
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,552
Way to be better

1036
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:46,368
So then would like thing we added on

1037
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:48,416
Connectivity migas Dan you have

1038
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:51,232
Many other ways that you can atop otherwise

1039
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:55,328
Stair Lighting in to have the Fantastic atmosphere that we want people to be able to

1040
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,144
So another

1041
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,192
Music it that we couldn't do otherwise

1042
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:01,984
And that's why we think that it's mine

1043
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:05,056
When you think about Partnerships with other companies

1044
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:07,360
In this area how do you evaluate your

1045
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:08,384
Partnerships what do you look

1046
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:10,944
Pressing stat

1047
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:15,808
We are not doing currently at the other people or other partners than are doing back there

1048
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:18,624
So for some people working with Sonos gives us

1049
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,648
Company.

1050
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:20,416
Nose

1051
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:24,000
Unlocked and have a great experience into sound and the really gives

1052
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:30,656
Working with our partners in Amazon and Google and I put of course gives our customers the ability to

1053
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:34,496
Two boys are the products of course I don't have the types of products that we don't have

1054
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:36,800
And to have that they go system if they want

1055
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:41,408
So it's to create other types of music is it that we aren't currently offering them

1056
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:45,760
Alright guys I was Rebecca

1057
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,112
One day

1058
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:54,720
Okay let's move to Liana perkovich

1059
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:55,488
Men

1060
00:38:55,744 --> 00:39:01,120
I am so disappointed right now and iot because we are just not talking about to me the big issues where this could really help

1061
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:04,704
So we'll start with Ikea obviously

1062
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,472
Picture

1063
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:09,568
One of the challenges and Ikea Ikea has been a really innovative

1064
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:10,848
Company about managing

1065
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:12,896
Supply chain in designing its products

1066
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:14,688
To recycle to reclaim

1067
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:18,528
What is the philosophy at Ikea just big nature around us

1068
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:23,392
I think first of all is starts with the design actually and because the sign will also its

1069
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:29,792
Precept a lot of the other environmental impact or the social impact for that matter where you actually producer products

1070
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:34,400
We have an approach where we say everything is within democratic

1071
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:40,800
Define democratic design for Ikea is that everything you do we have to think about five Dimensions is for its

1072
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:41,568
Function

1073
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:44,640
Is low prices quality energy sustainability

1074
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:46,176
And it is actually Define

1075
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:47,712
The perfect solution there

1076
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:51,296
Sustainability is part of the design principles right away

1077
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:52,832
Which attempt receptive course

1078
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:53,600
What is

1079
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:54,880
What we call

1080
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:59,488
I'm building sustainability is what comes for the Prada

1081
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,536
It's the material you select

1082
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:05,376
It's how you produce it's how you transported them everything around it

1083
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:08,704
Then we have the function which is also a sustainable Park

1084
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,496
And that function could actually be

1085
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:16,128
Perfectly improving your life or it could actually make you become more sustainable or it could use

1086
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:18,688
Alot of energy and it could be the opposite

1087
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,760
So when you look at it you really have to look at it

1088
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:25,088
I should ask for everyone listening that Ikea put

1089
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:29,184
Security and a focus on security as part of their quality

1090
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,208
Part of that design

1091
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:31,744
No everyone wondering like

1092
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:33,280
But are they secure

1093
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:34,304
Apparently so

1094
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,376
Given that that's your design process

1095
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,216
What are the risks of adding technology to everything

1096
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:41,984
Is

1097
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,008
Some of these

1098
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:45,312
Materials are toxic or not

1099
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:49,152
So how do you think about designing those into products

1100
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:51,968
My ultimately feel a little disposable event

1101
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:56,832
First of all I think it's extremely important to look at it both from an input point of view

1102
00:40:57,088 --> 00:41:02,976
So when you design the product actually decide what are the materials that should be in the product as such

1103
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:08,864
There's a lot of things that could be done there just very being smart in your selection of the materials also in electronic components

1104
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:12,192
Antibiotics that you're using and everything around it

1105
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:18,080
So think about it from the beginning then on the other hand you can't really decide if the material is

1106
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:21,408
Switch from a sustainability point of view if you don't know the function

1107
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:25,504
You always have to look at the function and sustainability at the same time please

1108
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:30,368
Smile about it because we say that you know if you would only look at the materials you would end up to have it

1109
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:34,464
Kitchen sinks out of paper and the other types of materials that wouldn't really

1110
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:37,536
Function at all

1111
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:41,376
But they are highly recyclable but not very durable and long-standing

1112
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:42,400
For the function

1113
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:47,264
But I think when it comes to enter Electronics you are pointing out a very critical

1114
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,824
Discussion first of all if you embed

1115
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:55,967
And the electronic part in a piece of furniture we need to think about whether this is a platform where you could actually

1116
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:57,503
Exchange it and which part

1117
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:59,039
Is actually living longer

1118
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:01,087
It's not necessarily so

1119
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:07,487
Parts it could be that the battery lives longer than the lamp and another cases is the laptop live longer than the battery

1120
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:13,887
Because the life length of some of these factories are very long now so how you design it will depend on course how long

1121
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:14,911
Is the lifeline

1122
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:19,007
The product and then also what is the biggest satellite most likely

1123
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:20,543
Solution for it at the end of life

1124
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:21,823
Okay so

1125
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,359
Let's hit the battery-powered lamp

1126
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:26,175
I don't have any battery power

1127
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:28,479
What is this thing she's talking about

1128
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:34,879
But that were thinking about the if you have solar panel if you have any other kind of rechargeable at you can actually have a

1129
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:38,975
Battery in that it's more the possibilities than our backs you making sure that

1130
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:39,743
After you recycle

1131
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:45,631
So in this case it would be the battery would last longer than the lamp so that the battery

1132
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:47,167
Recyclable is part of

1133
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:49,471
You make it to Quick come if you don't

1134
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:52,031
Remove the very small battery that disappears

1135
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:58,431
Very easily at from the recycling so but you actually maintained it in the lamp so it's taken care of at the end of life

1136
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:05,343
Use of thinking that the battery is the one that's going to be changed it

1137
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:06,367
Thanks many times

1138
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:09,695
But you actually have to look at it and some cases it's the opposite

1139
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:13,023
When the light blinks becoming very long and in that case

1140
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:14,303
I would just return it

1141
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:15,071
2

1142
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:17,887
Ikea or is there a recycling programs that

1143
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:19,423
That's the other thing

1144
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:24,287
Right now I haven't really have a big old bag in my closet

1145
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:26,591
And I bring it to

1146
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:30,687
My electronic recycling center and I don't know what happens to it

1147
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:35,807
When we start thinking about like your lamp example if I brought the lamps of them they probably just be like

1148
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:42,975
They should take care of it everything but that's just

1149
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:49,375
But no I think the trust of course the infrastructure of recycling in many countries since we're a global company.

1150
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:55,775
There is a many different possibilities of the infrastructure some of its really good and some still ways to go and will you have it

1151
00:43:56,031 --> 00:44:00,639
Different setups depending on where we are globally to support that in some cases it the enforcer

1152
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:06,271
Picture is so good that we are supporting they Society the recycling system in another we actually collected ourselves

1153
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:11,135
But maybe the most important part 2 also is to enable the possibility of our products

1154
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:17,535
To actually be prolonged in society and right now we are designing the products according to what we call the circular principal

1155
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:24,191
So what is the material that is it possible to repair the product is it possible to make it this is

1156
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:30,591
Assembled and make it possible so that we have a lot of these design principles that were thinking into the product design right

1157
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:33,151
When dealing with technology

1158
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:34,687
I have to imagine that

1159
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:36,223
The life of Technology

1160
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:38,015
Matters is part of this design

1161
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:42,367
How do you think of like your lamp example kind of throws me because I like

1162
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:46,463
What the battery lasting longer than that lamp itself that's crazy talk so

1163
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:50,559
If I'm thinking about more traditional technology that I'm putting in things that might last

1164
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:52,607
25 or 30 years

1165
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:53,887
How do you design

1166
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:55,167
For that summer

1167
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:56,703
Modularity seems to be

1168
00:44:56,959 --> 00:45:00,287
Modularity is key and also to prepare for that day

1169
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:01,311
Could be completed

1170
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:06,943
Technology of course it was interesting though I think is that the life length of a project when you talk

1171
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:13,343
Do Ikea is by Italy you have everything from something in the paper napkin that lasts very shortly

1172
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:14,879
Sterilize things

1173
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:21,279
Table or a couch that maybe last 400 years depending on what it actually is so of course again you have to

1174
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:22,559
Looking to where is

1175
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:25,631
Is the application where is the function and how does this fit

1176
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:31,775
Atlanta it can be a very long living loud like we should also think about it that it could be a short

1177
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:36,127
If it is a bit shorter lifelinks we have less material invested in it

1178
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:37,407
And it should be highly recycle

1179
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:38,687
Okay and how does

1180
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:41,759
Bradley not just in products for the consumer home

1181
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:44,319
How does IKEA think about using

1182
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,855
Iot to help

1183
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:48,415
Push sustainability or push efficient

1184
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:52,767
I think it's really interesting journey and I think we're really in the beginning on this one

1185
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:57,887
And I think if you look at it where we are right now it's been a lot in the talks about

1186
00:45:58,143 --> 00:45:58,655
Efficiency

1187
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:02,239
So the starting point of course efficiency we talked about health

1188
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:03,775
Safety

1189
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:05,311
But you can also look at

1190
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:08,383
If you start to look at that that's a better product solution

1191
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:10,943
Investor home

1192
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:17,343
We're now starting to see how this connects to behavior in the home and if you start to think about behavior in the home assistant

1193
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:18,879
Consumption Nissan

1194
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:20,415
Lifestyle

1195
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:23,487
There's a whole other perspective into what this could do

1196
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:25,023
And there were just looking into

1197
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:26,047
At the moment

1198
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:31,423
See with the two Dimension though all the time not to be mixed up there is

1199
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:37,823
Disability and sustainability agenda that we will be very strict on we will not compromise on our efficiency and our way

1200
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:41,663
Designing products with the materials we select and how we produce them

1201
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:45,503
We will also look at the function and the combination of that

1202
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:48,575
Could be the greatest possibility when you log into new homes

1203
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:52,671
So is my smart lights I can never expect my smart lights from Ikea to be like

1204
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:56,767
Burn more fuel stay on all the time I'm looking for more things that

1205
00:46:57,279 --> 00:47:00,863
We were brainstorming things like 5 minutes

1206
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,911
Things I'd like help you

1207
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:07,775
What is your process for trying out new technologies is it developed in Alice to go to Partners

1208
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:14,431
Are we both I mean we're not doing I think the interesting thing now is of course looking into the whole creation of Pi

1209
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:19,807
Possibilities not only think that we are the one that can solve everything but actually go great with others

1210
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:23,647
Open up alot to see you a kind of everything from how we mix

1211
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:30,047
New materials and find out new production technology for recycling for example to a function of a product

1212
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:34,655
Two ideas in good ideas so it's opening up I think a lot and it's

1213
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:35,423
Synopsis

1214
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:39,007
Awesome alright so thank you so much thank you

1215
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:40,799
That's it for this week

1216
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:42,335
Thanks so much for this

1217
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:43,359
