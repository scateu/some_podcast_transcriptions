I mean apologize in advance because it's possible that I don't

13
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,048
I probably should

14
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:36,608
But in good news I am

15
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:37,888
Primacoustic panels

16
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,168
On my way

Studio walls

18
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:44,032
I have a fancy new microphone so hopefully

19
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:45,568
I'm going to sound awesome

20
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:48,640
And Kevin always help

21
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,808
British accent yet so that's good

22
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:58,880
I'm working hard on not having and keeping my U-Haul

23
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:02,208
Alright this week we've got a lot to talk about as usual

24
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:04,256
Amazon news

25
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:06,048
Low-cost.

26
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,328
Lunch in the UK

27
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,912
We're going to talk a little bit about

28
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:12,192
Connected sex toys

29
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:13,472
The Department of Justice

30
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:16,544
And their creation of a security study group

31
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:22,944
And then we're also going to say goodbye to Microsoft band possibly hit on Apple's new news cuz we didn't talk

32
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,712
Got it last week

33
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:24,736
Because that was

34
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:30,112
And we're also going to do a review of the Kevo 2nd gen lock

35
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,416
Philips Hue motion sensor

36
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:34,464
Which we promised in

37
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:36,512
Always go with me forgot to get to

38
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:43,168
In between that all of our news and our guess we're going to have a message from our sponsor macadamia

39
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:45,472
And they're talking about how they built a

40
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:49,056
Medical device that actually integrates with the Alexa voice services

41
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:52,640
And then finally we have Adam justice of connectsense

42
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:57,504
If you are cast this week talking about homekit and the home

43
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:59,552
App on iOS 10

44
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:00,320
Cool

45
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,112
It's going to be awesome

46
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:04,160
Let's kick it off with

47
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,440
Amazon news

48
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:08,000
Yay yay

49
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:15,936
It's kind of a muffled ear because it's not huge to us but it's it's a huge price reduction on a new.

50
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:18,752
Yes a. Normally cost

51
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:19,776
The $90

52
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:26,432
I thought it was cheaper than that but yeah I guess I did pay $90 but now the new. We all knew. That kind of looks like the o

53
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:29,248
Is priced at 4999

54
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,808
I'm totally taking one of those up for my daughter

55
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,112
I've been I've been waiting for something like

56
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:36,672
Because I can plug it into her Sonos Play 5 speakers

57
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:37,440
And

58
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:38,976
That will that will work

59
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,000
It will be awesome

60
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:40,768
Michigan

61
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:41,792
Talk to her

62
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:46,144
Will you buy her one in black or the new white color

63
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,984
I'm thinking probably White

64
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,824
Looks nice look shiny

65
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:56,640
It's always good not always good but

66
00:02:56,896 --> 00:03:02,784
On the inside apparently Amazon has what's called a new Echo spatial perception technology so

67
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,832
That should help

68
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:07,904
If you have multiple echos are. Sore

69
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:10,720
Well the cap wouldn't matter if we have to press the Papas

70
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,792
So apparently the new technology will help

71
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:14,560
.

72
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:18,144
Determine which room you're in so to speak so they are all

73
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:21,216
Talk back to you which happens to me all the time in my house actually

74
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:24,288
The people complain about that a lot

75
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:26,080
Very rarely does it

76
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:27,360
Separated by 2

77
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,640
Respect you

78
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:30,176
And that's that second

79
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:36,832
That's actually going to be available to the older devices as well so that's good because they're kind of stink if one was smarter than

80
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:38,368
Then the rest of them so to speak

81
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,136
So

82
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,672
Looks like software updates coming

83
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,208
Eventually

84
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,488
When will probably

85
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:44,768
Be smarter than the other

86
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:49,376
We got hopefully a little bit of a ways all right and then also

87
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:51,168
Anybody listening in the UK

88
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:54,496
We're recording this on Wednesday to collect tomorrow but Wednesday

89
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:56,032
Amazon launched their

90
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,104
You kick it like availability for the echo in the UK

91
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,152
So everybody who's always asking me about that

92
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,736
Today is your day actually be in Germany as well

93
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:06,784
Adam Germany

94
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:13,184
I'm not in Germany I'm not I'm not focused on the excitement there until you swing by and pick one up there

95
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,256
The people in London

96
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:18,047
Are very excited

97
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,327
Okay

98
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,863
Enough silliness

99
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,143
Let's talk about

100
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:24,447
TV underbelly of The Internet of Things

101
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,287
Department of Justice created and ioc study group

102
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:33,407
I don't know what we think about this this this basically is a 10 to 15 members

103
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:38,015
A group of people that have created a threat analysis team to

104
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:41,343
Talk about the threats posed by self-driving cars

105
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,623
Medical devices

106
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:43,903
Other interconnected

107
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,999
I think I want to make sure that

108
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:53,119
Jessica's going to say I think they have to do this isn't somebody has to do this I'm going

109
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:56,703
Glad to see an orthopedic justice department but that's

110
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,983
Neither here nor there

111
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:00,543
We talked so many times about

112
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:03,103
Different hacks and tweaks and things that

113
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,639
Have

114
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:08,223
You don't given personal information through Internet of Things devices and

115
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:08,991
There's

116
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:12,575
Obviously cyber security issues going on in the world today so

117
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:14,367
I think it's a good thing though

118
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,927
I think it's a good thing

119
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,207
I always worry because

120
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:20,255
You know a lot of these things that they

121
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,279
Get together

122
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:25,375
They research things for like a good year so and then

123
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,167
Report and then nothing happens

124
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:29,983
That will have you know I have two cars

125
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,055
Problematic and then we'll have

126
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,103
A flurry of activity

127
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:38,175
Ignores most of what was advised in that initial

128
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:40,735
Report and then we'll get some laws that filled

129
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,295
But maybe I'm just cynical

130
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:46,879
No I don't think you're cynical I think you're being a realist and

131
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:50,975
And you're you describe accurately what typically happens with these groups but

132
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:54,047
I guess it's better than nothing so to speak

133
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:57,887
We should get some good information of bacon actually heal

134
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:59,423
If you Department of Justice you cancer

135
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:01,471
Subpoena automakers and sadism

136
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,239
Hey

137
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:05,567
We are looking at that so we want more information and

138
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:08,383
Automakers pretty much have to give it to him so

139
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:10,431
I feel like we could get some

140
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,199
Important

141
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:15,295
Stop coming too late and just the fact that they're under some sort of scrutiny

142
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,575
Hopefully we'll get them to

143
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,343
I think

144
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,111
Ben

145
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:18,879
We really should

146
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:21,439
Pay attention to this even though I know

147
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:23,743
Felipe

148
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,791
Okay today

149
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,071
The other

150
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,351
Little piece of news that

151
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:31,935
Against dark seedy underbelly of Internet of Things

152
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,799
Isabel connected sex toys arstechnica has a story that

153
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:40,383
Yes it's true interest in sex toys so it's connected vibrator

154
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,943
It actually is a lawsuit

155
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,015
Filed by the owner of the We-Vibe connected

156
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,039
Typewriter

157
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,063
Poo

158
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:51,135
Basically says that the company because it's

159
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:51,903
The word

160
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:55,743
How long her vibrator was used for and the vibration settings

161
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:56,511
She used

162
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:01,119
And send that data to their servers in Canada that they were violating her privacy

163
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:04,959
Big cheeser is basically the lawsuit

164
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,519
Terminology

165
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,847
And I feel like

166
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,127
On one hand

167
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,991
Any connected device you have is going to send your data back to manufacturer in their store

168
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,551
But on the other hand

169
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:26,207
It sounds like she didn't really get much of a privacy notification and she certainly if she did didn't get it until after she had purchased the Prada

170
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,487
Which is incredibly

171
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:33,887
And that's why I was just going to say that's the key and that's pretty much the norm for all these devices unless you really real

172
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:37,471
Really digging around before you purchase an iot device

173
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:38,751
And check

174
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:41,567
To see maybe on the website with the privacy

175
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:45,407
I'll see you at your place we buying something and then you're finding out

176
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:49,247
You know during the setup process perhaps order needs deletion or whatever maybe

177
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,039
Yeah

178
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:52,319
I don't know if

179
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:56,159
How to change that quite honestly how does the industry change that

180
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:59,999
Well I think we need probably some sort of

181
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:02,047
We need some sort of federal intervention

182
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,863
Or a lawsuit may be a judge

183
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,655
Judicial intervention that says

184
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:07,679
Hey

185
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:08,703
You know what

186
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:10,751
For like a physical product

187
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,055
That you guys are selling people

188
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:16,639
You can't retro you can't basically after purchase

189
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,991
Force them into these onuris privacy conditions

190
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:21,759
Or

191
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:25,343
Arbitration clauses or insert whatever kind of

192
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,135
Issues it's right there

193
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,159
In

194
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:30,207
With software people

195
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:32,511
Allow that to happen even though judges

196
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,535
I just hate you

197
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,095
They're like well you can

198
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,911
Alita install at whatever

199
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:40,447
With apps

200
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:42,239
Eunos ideas

201
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:47,871
It's free you just get rid of it if you don't want it which is kind of silly because it's not like you're not going to use Google because you didn't

202
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:52,991
That's probably the way this

203
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,783
Please out if we want to

204
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:55,551
Stop this

205
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:56,575
The question is

206
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:57,599
Will

207
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:59,135
The federal government or

208
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,671
Consumer organizations

209
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:05,279
And I think probably not at least not for awhile

210
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,815
And I think

211
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:10,911
A lot of the burden is still on a consumer to understand how cloud

212
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,959
Cloud enabled devices working

213
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,263
Let me know pervert example

214
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,799
In this particular case

215
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,335
You could if

216
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:22,175
You bought one of these connected vibrators your partner

217
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:24,735
Could be run the world and control the device

218
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:25,503
Right

219
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:29,855
That doesn't happen over over Wi-Fi it's happening through the cloud and servers and so on so

220
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,903
You know that going in I think

221
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:35,487
We have to collectively raise the mainstream

222
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,023
Intelligence about

223
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:41,887
Peyote and cloud and then so on unfortunately in and I hate to say that because but

224
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,447
People need to understand this stuff

225
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:47,775
Because it's changing the world is changing the way we live

226
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,591
And yes you are going to give up some privacy

227
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:51,871
So you need to know this going in

228
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,663
I would also say

229
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:57,503
Like this could be deemed quote-unquote sensitive information and maybe they could

230
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:04,927
Medical devices that are connected those things are governed by like HIPAA

231
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:07,487
Maybe we think about legislation that

232
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,815
Glasses devices that are

233
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,351
Personal

234
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,887
I don't know I mean

235
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:16,191
But I would also say the rest of the world isn't always a

236
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,727
This freaky is the us about sex

237
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:18,495
So

238
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,263
Just Beat It

239
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:22,591
Even something as mundane as like a pill tracker

240
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,895
That's going to know what medicines are on

241
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:28,479
That might be covered by hippos that it might not be

242
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,575
Against

243
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:36,415
We'll keep an eye on this because it is interesting especially given the

244
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:38,719
Companies don't always protect their data and

245
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:39,999
Yet

246
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:42,303
That's a problem over the cat act

247
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:46,911
Kevin you brought up

248
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:47,679
Microsoft

249
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:53,823
So for folks who don't know Microsoft does have health tracker

250
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,151
The Microsoft band it's been out probably for two or three years now

251
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:00,991
I did purchase one when it first came out really liked it it's cross platform

252
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:05,855
I know an update to it the Band 2 came out maybe last year

253
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:10,975
But it's looking like the band to maybe the last band

254
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:16,351
For Microsoft looks as though according to Mary Jo Foley zdnet

255
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:18,143
Who's very knowledgeable eyes

256
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,935
Great sources

257
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:22,751
It sounds like the band Hardware is being

258
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,287
I guess discontinued

259
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:27,359
They're going to sell the current inventory but

260
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:30,175
It doesn't look like they have any plans to make a new band

261
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:36,319
There's discussion about the team behind the actual band has since been disbanded no pun intended

262
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:41,695
But instead of getting out of house tracking what they're going to do is they're going to focus on their

263
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,999
Microsoft health platform

264
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:47,839
Which you can use to track your daily activities exercise

265
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:50,143
Y'all different metrics and so on

266
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:52,447
I have use Microsoft health

267
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:54,239
Cloud platform

268
00:11:54,495 --> 00:12:00,383
At the time it was not totally impressed by it but it has been a while so I don't want to say anything about the current state of it so

269
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,687
But it looks like another another

270
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,223
Hardware

271
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,271
Dismemberment hear of

272
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,551
Microsoft

273
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,855
About dismembered

274
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:10,879
Pretty strong

275
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:13,695
Lychee we've now lost

276
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:16,511
How many bands like we've lost the FuelBand for Nike

277
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,047
Was killed

278
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,071
Jawbone

279
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,095
When is in

280
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:24,959
Disarray is probably the kindest frailing for that the maker of

281
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:25,727
Connected Fitness

282
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,543
Bam and Missy

283
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,311
We got

284
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:31,103
I got the Under Armour store

285
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:38,527
And I actually action glad you mentioned that somebody sent me a message on Twitter yesterday saying the

286
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,319
Under Armour

287
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,599
Health kit box

288
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:44,415
Which I think was was $400 at the time

289
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:49,535
What is available at Target for $120 which makes me wonder is that going away

290
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,351
I was thinking about that I feel like

291
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,375
Because

292
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:57,471
I can easily pull in information from other sources it feels like

293
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:00,287
And because if you look at Fitbit

294
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,567
And what it is.

295
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,335
With the market

296
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:07,199
People are probably like you know but the engagement should be at the app and you can

297
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,479
Bring all the stuff in

298
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:10,783
So why don't you leave Fitbit the low in

299
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,855
Band business better phrase

300
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,135
And

301
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:18,207
Just focus on the software experience of building any coaster

302
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:19,999
Which

303
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,047
It makes sense

304
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,863
This is kind of how I figured a lot of this way

305
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:25,887
Play out

306
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:28,447
Almost feel probably have like Garmin and

307
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,239
Polar

308
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:35,359
Fitness trackers for really intense people absolutely

309
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:41,247
Absolutely actually next time on the show I'll have to talk about my polar m600 Android Wear watch

310
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,551
Suu admissions

311
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,599
So yes that's

312
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,927
And we should mention

313
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:51,743
But we won't go too far into death because our guest is going to

314
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:52,767
Really going to death

315
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,303
With iOS 10 butts

316
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:59,679
Wechat iOS 10 and last Wednesday is when the iPhone 7 launched

317
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:04,287
With the airpods and that sort of thing so

318
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,335
I feel like we should probably talk

319
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,103
Momentarily

320
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:09,663
Play about it I I will say that I did a story

321
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,199
Last Friday

322
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,991
On what I think I feel like

323
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,551
Putting Siri in your ear

324
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,367
With wireless audio basically gives you

325
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,159
Siri in your ear

326
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,951
Control of the Internet of Things

327
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:22,975
For the future

328
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,255
Not today

329
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:26,815
This is very much an interim step the power

330
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:27,583
Consumption

331
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,375
Texas to hired battery life

332
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,911
Whichever

333
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,447
Everyone think of it

334
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:34,751
And it sounds like the audio quality on these things

335
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,079
It's probably

336
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:41,663
Probably about the same as the wired quality

337
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:44,991
But yeah you raise an interesting point or many in that article

338
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:49,343
I think Siri has a ways to go before it becomes the end-all-be-all

339
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,391
Your assistant

340
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,439
Not to screw

341
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:55,999
You purchased

342
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:57,791
Have you used

343
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,071
Can you purchase the airpod

344
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,607
I did not

345
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:04,959
I did not purchase the airpods because I just don't see

346
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:06,751
The

347
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:11,103
I just don't have the need for it I have other wireless headphones at do

348
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,639
That will work just fine

349
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:14,687
They're including the lightning

350
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,455
Wired

351
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:18,271
Earbuds in the phone with the phone

352
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,575
And frankly

353
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:26,975
It sounds silly but I Twilight I'd agree that Apple has Salve pairing problem for Bluetooth headphones

354
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,511
You only

355
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:30,559
Typically paired them once

356
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:35,167
So it saves me maybe 30 seconds of frustration and then

357
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:37,727
I move on I just did you seem like a very

358
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,543
I don't know what's it's

359
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,335
Typical Apple product

360
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:45,663
I'm going to say in a wireless World pairing is

361
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,431
A pain point

362
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,735
And you can see they put the

363
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:53,087
Same attention to detail in the caring process and getting things online

364
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:56,159
You basically use your phone

365
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,439
A picture of the device

366
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,463
And

367
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,743
It connects to your phone

368
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,119
And

369
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:11,519
What's Happening Here is there just like I think they're chipping away a lot of problems that we really know we had at that make

370
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:15,871
Normal people do I didn't think about what they did with

371
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:21,247
What airport did they bathe they just made it really easy to set up like a Wi-Fi network

372
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:25,855
And we're finally getting to the point where the rest of the night she's like oh hey we should probably do some

373
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:27,647
So again

374
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:28,927
I think it's a problem

375
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:31,487
It's not a huge problem but Apple doesn't

376
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,535
Necessarily have to tackle the huge problem

377
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:41,471
Not very very true I agree and it shows a lot of innovation on their part to create a new Bluetooth chip

378
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,751
The WW1

379
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:45,311
Which they said they're not going to license

380
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,335
I'm so beat

381
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:48,127
Specific to Apple products which

382
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:48,895
Shagging

383
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:53,247
Typical

384
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,527
But

385
00:16:55,295 --> 00:17:01,439
So an endless are airpods do work with any other device over Bluetooth just you've done

386
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,463
Repair themselves

387
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:05,535
Just want folks understand that they're not specific to the iPhone

388
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:06,559
Sparta

389
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:08,863
Yes you could have airpods

390
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:12,447
You too could have airpods

391
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,215
Yes

392
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,263
Tell us how they were

393
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:16,799
Alright so

394
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:20,127
Let's talk about the Philips Hue motion sensor because we

395
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,175
This is

396
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:26,527
We must this is Phillips lunch this two weeks ago I've had it in my house

397
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:27,551
In various rooms

398
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:28,831
Playing with it

399
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,879
This is a 3995

400
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,415
Motion sensor that will

401
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,439
Basically

402
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,463
Turn your Hue Lights On

403
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,047
And it will be available in October

404
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,119
And having lived with it I really like this

405
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,655
The motion sensor solved

406
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:44,447
A specific problem that I've had in

407
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:46,751
In the bathroom problem in the bathroom

408
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:48,287
And that is

409
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,335
When you go to the bathroom at night

410
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,127
Turn on the light

411
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:53,663
2B and it blinds you and

412
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,687
You're awake hysterical

413
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:57,759
So I wanted a light that dims automatically

414
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,807
After I went to bed basically

415
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:01,599
And then the rest of time it would be lovely

416
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:02,879
And

417
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:06,975
This is so sad

418
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:09,023
The Hue app lets you said

419
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:12,095
Times for the motion sensor when you setup the motion sensor

420
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,119
You can say

421
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:15,935
During these times I would like my light to be

422
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:17,471
This color is

423
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:18,751
This level of brightness

424
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:21,055
During these times I would like to be

425
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:24,383
And then I would like it to go off

426
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,151
After certain

427
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:30,271
They didn't have the option of going off like

428
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:31,295
Saying

429
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:35,135
During the day leave it on for 5 minutes and drink the night leave it on for only 1 minute

430
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:36,927
Pikachu

431
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,719
I love this

432
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:42,303
Because I'm going to use the song I think I'm going to buy this

433
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,911
Or a couple rooms were exempt those kind of rooms are usually in clothes

434
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,215
Something to put it in the bathroom

435
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:52,543
I'm also going to put it in our laundry room cuz I'll often times

436
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:54,079
That switches are weird

437
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,127
Spot even though I did move it

438
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:58,687
Using Lutron

439
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:00,991
Remote on the wall

440
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,015
Switch

441
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:04,831
I'm going to have to take those out because you can't use hue light switch

442
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:07,135
Lutron dimmers

443
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,927
But I'll take that switch out

444
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:11,231
Motion sensor in there any time I open the

445
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:12,767
Laundromats going to turn on

446
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:15,839
Your hands are off in full

447
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:18,399
We often leave the light on

448
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:19,679
So

449
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:20,447
Closet

450
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:21,727
12

451
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:25,055
Maybe if you have kids I'm trying to think of that would really be

452
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,335
Crates

453
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:30,431
I have an open floor plan downstairs and I try to get out there and I didn't like it

454
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,199
There

455
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,735
Simply because

456
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:35,551
Which is always moving back and forth down there the lights

457
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:40,159
That's the Hue motion sensor

458
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:42,975
Goodbye I will say though if you don't have Hue Lights

459
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:43,999
The stack

460
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,023
Lights

461
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:48,351
Have the motion sensing capability inside the bulb

462
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:52,447
You do need a hug Kevin so you will not like this

463
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:53,471
Buttfor

464
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:57,567
For $90 you can get a traditional a19 kit

465
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:01,663
How much is a normal light bulb or for $100 you can get a starter kit for

466
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:03,455
Downlights

467
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:04,735
Par30s

468
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:06,015
Impose

469
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:08,063
Oh that's two light bulbs in the hub

470
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:13,183
If I didn't have the Hue system already in my house I probably actually choose this

471
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:14,975
The staff lights as

472
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:16,255
Because they can do the same thing

473
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:19,583
Except you don't have a motion sensor wandering around

474
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,119
That's the review

475
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:21,887
For you

476
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:24,447
You can also run 12u motion sensors

477
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,215
On

478
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:25,983
1

479
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:33,663
Sounds like a good solution for very specific use case I don't think it would take out my whole house with a bunch of motion sensors

480
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:38,783
No I mean it's it's not really worthwhile in the motion sensors themselves

481
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,343
Are not particularly Innovative they're not like

482
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,623
Small order

483
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:45,183
Motion sensor

484
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:49,023
Now I will say I have

485
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:49,791
I think

486
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:53,119
5 different ways I can turn my Hue Lights on and off now in my house

487
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:54,655
Yes

488
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:56,703
That's right it's almost scary

489
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:58,751
Isn't it though

490
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,031
All right

491
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:02,079
And the other review we have is

492
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:04,127
The Kevo 2nd generation

493
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:04,895
Smart Lock

494
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:07,455
And this is a Bluetooth Smart Lock

495
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:09,503
But I insulted my house and

496
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:11,295
The key feature is that you

497
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,063
Touch

498
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:12,831
Unlock it

499
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:16,416
In I'm not having a lot of success getting that to work

500
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:17,184
But

501
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:20,000
I will say that the lock install

502
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:20,768
Easily

503
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:22,048
I did a video on

504
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:23,584
Hoping to post it for you guys but

505
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:24,864
King in London

506
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,400
Fixing a little fun and hard

507
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:27,168
Aaron's

508
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,704
So install is easy

509
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:30,496
The software is easy

510
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:32,288
It doesn't have

511
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,336
A lot of features in

512
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:36,128
The second generation

513
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:38,688
The new features they have is a

514
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,480
Smart key

515
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:43,040
And what it is basically is

516
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,600
It's just extra security around

517
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:46,624
The Walking Dead

518
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,464
The smart key is All Souls are wreaking feature

519
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,536
Ocado you can rekey your locks using

520
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:54,304
Smart key

521
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,632
I have not done that yet I pulled the instructions out

522
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:02,496
I was kind of a little overwhelmed by it will try and see how that works but

523
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:03,776
I'm not sure

524
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,848
I'm not sure that there's a lot of extra

525
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,384
Value here

526
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:12,224
Well if the touch feature work and I'm assuming

527
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:13,760
It means

528
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:14,528
Sometimes

529
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:15,296
Okay

530
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:17,600
Okay cuz so so and what that

531
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:20,416
Explain to me what that does that when it works so it

532
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,464
If you touch the lock

533
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,048
And then check to see if phone is in proximity that it unlocks

534
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:28,096
Yes

535
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:28,864
Okay

536
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,656
Some of it

537
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:32,192
Might be

538
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:34,496
I installed this and

539
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:39,872
I may have been a little too rapid fire and going back and forth this was on my back doors

540
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:42,432
We don't actually use that door very often

541
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,480
The pros of it are

542
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:46,784
Kwikset lock which is a

543
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:48,320
Daily Standard blog

544
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:51,392
If you've already got Kwikset box at your house

545
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:56,000
Probably going to fit so that install should be pretty easy it works most of the time

546
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:58,048
I will say there is a bug with

547
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,584
IOS

548
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:01,632
10 coming out that

549
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:03,168
The touch to Rockwall

550
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:05,984
Work until the issue affects which they expect

551
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,312
I feel like

552
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:11,104
I wouldn't rush to buy this product

553
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:14,432
And you know if you're looking for a Smart Lock

554
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,992
Like this is a Smart Lock

555
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:19,296
It didn't feel like

556
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:23,136
I need to have product it did not change my life in any way

557
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,208
You can buy an extra key fob

558
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:28,000
So you can buy a key fob

559
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:30,816
Quick fats for $25 that

560
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:35,936
But again

561
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,264
Doesn't seem you're not a must-have at this time

562
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:46,944
If you have specific questions about the locket would like me to

563
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,992
Do something with it I am happy to

564
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:49,760
Do that

565
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:51,552
Eva fans now

566
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:54,368
I think that wraps up our news for this week

567
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:55,648
K24a cast

568
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:58,976
Who is Adam justice of connectsense will be talked about homekit

569
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:01,536
Some fun tips and tricks and things you could do with

570
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:02,816
Home app

571
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:06,912
Before that stay tuned for a word from our sponsor

572
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:13,312
Everyone we're going to take a break for a message from our sponsor this week sponsor is macadamia which is an iot

573
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:16,128
User experience design and software developer

574
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:20,480
We have rain and Taemin from Macadamia talking about

575
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:21,248
Healthcare

576
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:27,648
50% of your business is actually Healthcare and I'm really curious what's happening right now at the intersection of

577
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:30,208
The Internet of Things

578
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,304
Clevescene explosion in healthcare and iot and it's

579
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,840
Read me about

580
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:38,400
Connecting devices and apps

581
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:39,936
Applications and data

582
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:46,336
And that's really where we're seeing a lot of exciting new project submerge both in the on the clinic

583
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:47,360
Girl facing side

584
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:49,152
Sew-in hospitals and

585
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:50,432
Clinicians offices

586
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:52,224
And on the consumer side

587
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,504
What if you guys built

588
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,272
For this Market

589
00:24:54,528 --> 00:25:00,672
One exciting project that we worked on deals with implants there's a sensor in the

590
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:03,744
Implant during surgery the surgeon can

591
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,280
Manipulate

592
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:11,680
Depending on where the implant is to figure out the appropriate placement or the ideal placement to ensure that

593
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:18,080
Got the outcome postoperatively will be beneficial and then postoperatively when they're doing patient phone

594
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:20,896
They can actually turn the sensor on

595
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:27,296
And get real-time data and Trends data that they used to correlate with patient

596
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:31,392
Recorded information about potentially you know activity levels and they can

597
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,160
Sakura.

598
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:38,560
What they see is happening to the sensor and make appropriate adjustments to their care plan or their

599
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:39,584
Rehabilitation

600
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:41,888
More on the consumer front

601
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:44,704
We're working with a client building a really neat

602
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:47,008
Kojak product leveraging

603
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:50,848
Alexa voice services and its product actually help seniors live

604
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:53,408
Longer and more independent lives at home

605
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:55,968
So for instance when mrs. Jones wakes up

606
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,320
This device will actually ask her hello Martha how well did you sleep

607
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:03,648
And we'll find out whether or not she yes she slept well

608
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:08,000
Will reminder if she's taking her pills if she hasn't because they upset her stomach

609
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:10,560
That will be recorded in that information

610
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:13,632
Can be provided not only to the physician in charge

611
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:16,448
But also to send her daughter

612
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,264
Who is primarily responsible for her care

613
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:21,824
What do you need to know about working in

614
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:27,712
Patient privacy and security as the opportunity to take this

615
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:30,272
Solution to the cloud is happening

616
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:33,088
Architecting that solution in a way that helps

617
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:35,904
Healthcare companies maintain their hitrust

618
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,440
And HIPAA certification

619
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:39,744
Cure connecting a device

620
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,840
And sending information to a mobile device

621
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:48,704
Because it's being used for clinical reasons if it needs to be FDA-approved

622
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,752
As we mentioned in last week's podcast

623
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:57,408
The user experience for these medical devices is critical in many instances they won't be used by people who

624
00:26:57,664 --> 00:27:01,504
Add experience with an iPhone or a mobile device

625
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:06,624
And we'll be looking for a very natural way to interact and communicate with that device

626
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:08,416
I can't wait to learn more

627
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:14,816
To learn more about Macadamia and its Healthcare Solutions go to Macadamia. Com Health Care

628
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:21,216
Hey everyone this is Stacey Higginbotham and we are

629
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:26,080
The Internet of Things podcast today's guest is Adam justice of connect

630
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,384
Hi Adam how are you

631
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:30,944
Hi thanks for having me today Stacy

632
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,992
I am super excited so

633
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:36,320
I told Adam for really long time because connectsense

634
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:37,856
Started out

635
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:38,624
Man

636
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:41,696
Three four years ago making wifi-connected

637
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:45,280
Outlets and sensors when did you guys start this atom

638
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:49,632
Yeah we launched that brand in 2013

639
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:51,424
In the Wi-Fi Center business and

640
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,192
Since

641
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,984
Expanded from there

642
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,288
Getting into homekit with the outlets at

643
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:58,848
Yes so

644
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:01,408
Adam was last on the show back in

645
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:04,480
June of 2014 when Apple launched

646
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:05,248
Homekit

647
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:10,368
And I thought it'd be great to have him come back because he's been doing his video interviews are these

648
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:11,648
I guess they're not interview

649
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:14,464
Is there there video demonstrations of

650
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,256
What is excited about with homekit

651
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:19,072
So before we start talking about that

652
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:21,120
Adam just give me your take

653
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:22,656
Apple's approach to the

654
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:23,936
I'm so far

655
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:26,240
Yeah I mean I stink

656
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:29,824
You know we were very excited when last time I was on the show and

657
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,104
Finalize apples

658
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,640
Doing something about homekit

659
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:36,480
And you know that took a little while to get off the ground but

660
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:41,600
We finally started to see it on products shipping last year you know in quantity

661
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:44,160
And it started to gain momentum

662
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:45,184
And

663
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,208
Now with

664
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:51,328
Everything you're doing an iOS 10 it really feels like apple is finally endorsing this

665
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,680
Putting its full weight behind it and I think it's a really exciting time

666
00:28:56,192 --> 00:29:00,032
Brung it but for the industry in general and kind of home automation

667
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:00,800
In general

668
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:05,664
Why are you so excited about the industry in general cuz right now I feels kind of like worth it

669
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,200
Trough of despair

670
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:12,320
And people are question

671
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:15,904
So many competing standards than efforts and

672
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:19,488
I kind of look around my house in like God some of this is just junk

673
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,816
So why are you excited

674
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:29,728
So I think this is really a moment for the industry where you know people are going to install iOS 10

675
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:31,264
And this week and

676
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:37,664
They're going to see this new app on their phone and start to think alright what can I do with this you know maybe that brings them into an Apple Store

677
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,456
Best Buy or somewhere

678
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:42,528
I got to see that homekit logo and really start to get

679
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,320
You know what idea of what they can

680
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:47,392
Do it. And I really think it comes down to

681
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:49,440
Consumers having that one

682
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:50,720
Great experience

683
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:52,256
And you know

684
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:53,536
Comcast says a lot of things

685
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,304
Right

686
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:58,144
To get that first kind of wow experience and I think once you have that

687
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:00,704
It leaves you wanting more and

688
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,496
That's one of the nice things about

689
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:05,056
Don't get experience as a you add more

690
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:05,824
Products

691
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:07,616
To your home

692
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:09,152
1 + 1 is

693
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:09,920
Is more than

694
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:10,688
2

695
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,736
You might be for 5

696
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:14,016
460

697
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:15,296
Okay so

698
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:18,112
Listeners who are not well-versed in homekit

699
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:24,256
Basically to get certified as a homekit device you have to have a special Apple Certified Wi-Fi

700
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:25,792
Work Bluetooth chip IP

701
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:26,816
Init

702
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:28,864
In the device basically being

703
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,400
Mfi certified

704
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:32,704
And that allows Appleton

705
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,752
Ensure the security between device

706
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:37,824
That's important so every home kit

707
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,640
Device out there has this special chip

708
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:42,176
And

709
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:43,968
Let's see what else do you need to know

710
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:47,040
The other thing to note is that

711
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:48,832
Are the standard in general

712
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:50,368
Memes that if you

713
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:53,696
Buy multiple products that bear this logo

714
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:57,280
I'm you're not going to have to worry about trying to figure out how do I get these

715
00:30:57,536 --> 00:31:00,096
Things to talk to each other or how do they coexist

716
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:01,888
That's just kind of comes natively

717
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:04,704
Awesome so

718
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,032
Last year these devices started hitting the market but you could

719
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:14,176
Control them individually through the apps for like the elegado Spencers or for the Hue Lights

720
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:17,504
What's happening now with iOS 10 is

721
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,784
Apple is releasing

722
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:19,808
Home

723
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,392
Which is an app to control all of this together

724
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:25,440
Now third-party companies had

725
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:28,256
Released these types of programs before but

726
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:30,304
As Adam pointed out these are

727
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,584
It's far different

728
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,632
And far more mainstream when apples like

729
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:35,424
Here it is

730
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:36,704
And

731
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:39,264
I don't know if it's actually going to be right on your

732
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:41,056
What's that screen called where you

733
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:42,848
Pull it up with your finger and like

734
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:43,872
You get your

735
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:44,896
Flashlight

736
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:48,992
Can your Wi-Fi settings you scroll over to get music and then scroll over that you get

737
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:49,760
Home

738
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,832
Yeah so that's called the control center

739
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:57,952
And I really think I just put out a video in the last week

740
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:01,280
I really think this is one of the killer apps for iOS 10

741
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:02,560
And homekit

742
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:03,840
Because

743
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:04,608
You know

744
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:10,240
That home app or you know Siri are great ways to access stuff but being able to

745
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,520
Just flip up that

746
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:12,544
Control center

747
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,080
Do something really quick is

748
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:15,616
Really nice and elegant

749
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:16,640
Got it

750
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:17,664
Okay so

751
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,688
Let's talk about

752
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:19,712
I played with

753
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:20,480
Home

754
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:25,344
In iOS 10 and you have to so let's talk about some of the features that you know

755
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,880
We think are really cool

756
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:28,416
Ashley Let's help people

757
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:31,488
Let's start with adding homekit certified devices

758
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:32,768
How would we do that

759
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:33,792
How is this differ

760
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:41,216
So that's done there's a little plus button up in the upper right-hand corner of the home app

761
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:43,520
And that's where you would go to a device

762
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:44,544
And

763
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,592
So some of the things that

764
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:48,896
Apple does here to make this Annie

765
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:49,920
Easy process

766
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:55,296
Is they have a a process for Wi-Fi accessories called Wireless

767
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:56,064
Accessory

768
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,856
Configuration or wack

769
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:59,392
So that means

770
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,440
For a certified accessory

771
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:04,256
You don't need to go find that little

772
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:07,584
Piece of paper that has your Wifi password on it

773
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,632
If your phone is already

774
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:10,912
Talking to

775
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:13,216
Your Wi-Fi access point

776
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:14,496
It will just pass those

777
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:15,520
Details write down

778
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:16,288
Statics

779
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:17,824
So that's a really nice

780
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,104
Simple way to get

781
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:23,968
Devices on to Wi-Fi and then from the security perspective

782
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:29,344
I'm you're just going to use your camera to scan a code that goes with every accessory

783
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,880
And then boom you're done

784
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:32,160
Enough from there

785
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:34,464
Customize it kind of put it in a room

786
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,768
Decide if it's a favorite accessory or not

787
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,328
The things like that but the set of processes

788
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,608
Is pretty elegant

789
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,144
Pretty easy

790
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:44,960
So when I first start

791
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:45,984
With this

792
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,776
You know if I'm imagining myself

793
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:50,848
I'm excited about

794
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:53,664
Do you have any advice on what the first device

795
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,944
Someone should get is

796
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:57,504
How to even think about what they should be

797
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,576
Either the first device

798
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:01,856
Is always

799
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:04,928
A hard one but I think you want to solve it

800
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:06,976
Easy problem so or kind of a

801
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:07,744
Convenience Center

802
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,512
Your life

803
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:12,096
Shows this can be as easy as like I want to turn on this lamp

804
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:15,424
You know he's away your you know I want to run this on a timer

805
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:16,960
Like that so

806
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:20,544
In a frog getting started device I really like something that doesn't

807
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,312
Acquired

808
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:24,384
Too much install you know like are smart Outlets

809
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:27,456
Where it it just fits over an existing Outlet

810
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:30,528
And then you know once you get a feel for what

811
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:31,552
It's all about

812
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:33,088
What's going on then you can

813
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:34,368
Going deeper with some

814
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:38,976
Sound like a door lock or thermostat or something that's going to require a little bit more

815
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:39,744
Install time

816
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:44,096
Got it yeah I'm always like light bulbs are good Outlets are good

817
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:45,376
And other things

818
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:46,144
They're a little bit more

819
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:51,264
What else like when first homekit came out

820
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:54,848
People kind of got frustrated because it was hard to tell Siri

821
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,640
What things to turn on

822
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:57,920
And there's very

823
00:34:58,176 --> 00:35:01,248
Real naming conventions that you need to follow

824
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:05,856
Do you want to give people some advice about how to name things for homekit

825
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:07,392
To avoid Lake

826
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,744
You know I I remember actually I had this issue when I got my Amazon Echo

827
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:14,560
And connected it to my lights it was like

828
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:17,632
Kitchen light

829
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,192
It was a little ridiculous

830
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:21,216
So

831
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:25,056
What about what makes it easier or

832
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:26,336
How would we do that with him

833
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:32,992
So there's a ton of different ways to kind of give Siri commands to something

834
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:35,552
The most basic would be what you name a device

835
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:37,600
I think something that's

836
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:39,648
Easy to remember and

837
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:40,416
Easy to under

838
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:41,184
Stand

839
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:43,232
Is definitely important

840
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:44,256
And

841
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:50,656
Also that you know Series going to understand it too I think there were some issues early on that this is God

842
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:54,240
Way way better as time has gone on

843
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:57,056
Even throughout iOS 9 and definitely more in Iowa

844
00:35:58,336 --> 00:36:01,664
You don't have to memorize a script book of phrases

845
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,224
You know things you would naturally say us you know

846
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:08,064
Turn on the bedroom light or turn on Adams bedroom lamp for

847
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:11,904
Something like that it's going to make sense and however you're going to phrase that

848
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,696
Siri will be able to figure that out

849
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:15,744
When you add a light bulb

850
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:18,816
Example to a room or lamp it gives you the

851
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:20,096
The option of saying

852
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:22,144
Hey this is Anna living room this isn't it better

853
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:26,496
And you should actually take the time to group your lights if you're doing

854
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:29,312
Several rooms at a time or one room at a time

855
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:31,360
Because then you can just

856
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:32,896
Say hey turn on the bedroom

857
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:34,176
And then that will have

858
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:35,968
Yasso

859
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:40,832
Definitely setting up rooms is a great way to command a bunch of devices at once

860
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:41,600
So then

861
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:45,184
You also have this concept of services so like all lights

862
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:45,952
RS Turbo

863
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:47,488
So then you could say things

864
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:48,256
Like

865
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:50,048
Turn off all the lights

866
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:50,816
In my bedroom

867
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:52,096
And that will

868
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:57,728
If you want to get him more cost of you can also program was called the scene so you can

869
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:59,776
Group together multiple devices

870
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:00,544
All at once

871
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:04,128
I haven't seen them like goodnight is a great example of one that

872
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:04,896
Built-in

873
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:07,712
Default and so you know

874
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:10,016
Whatever you want to do lock the doors

875
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:11,296
Turn off the lights

876
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:13,088
Set the thermostat down

877
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,880
When you say goodnight

878
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:18,976
Making program that all into that one action and then Siri understands

879
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:20,000
You say

880
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:21,280
You know hey Siri

881
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:24,352
Goodnight then it's going to program that scene

882
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:26,656
Set your house for whatever you sent there

883
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:29,472
All of our podcast listeners their house just went dark

884
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:32,800
Apple really did something cool here I think

885
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:34,848
Actually I first saw this with Sivan

886
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:35,616
Which is a

887
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:36,896
Can a higher end

888
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:38,688
Home automation company

889
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:40,224
But they actually let you

890
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:46,112
If you get if you basically set your lights up and maybe your thermostats perfect maybe

891
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:49,184
The dimness is great everything's perfect

892
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:52,512
You can actually just tell it to take a snapshot of that

893
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:53,536
Create that scene

894
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:55,840
Which I think is great cuz

895
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:57,376
You may be like hanging out

896
00:37:57,888 --> 00:38:02,240
You know doing something to eat, look up and you're like you know it this is pretty nice I'm very comfortable

897
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:04,032
This is how we watch movies

898
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:05,824
Let's just make this our movie watching

899
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,360
You don't have to go back in life

900
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:09,408
Figure out how my lights are

901
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:14,272
20% or anything like that my air conditioner at 75

902
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:15,040
You just

903
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:16,832
It knows and I think

904
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,136
Those kind of touches are

905
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:20,416
Very Apple

906
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:23,488
Like actually I used to call Savant the apple of home automation

907
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:25,792
Now that Apple's doing

908
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:26,560
I don't know what I'm doing

909
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:31,168
Let's see what else do you like or is worth talking about

910
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:35,776
So I mean I think beyond the basics in the whole map

911
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:38,336
You know once you get diondoes

912
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:39,616
Initial things

913
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:45,504
Definitely getting into that automation tab is where you can start to do some more advanced stuff

914
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:48,064
So this should be where you kind of run

915
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:53,440
I do a lot of kind of scheduled stuff so my front porch lights are tied to this

916
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:54,720
So I have a

917
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:58,816
Daily automation to turn those off at a certain point and turn them on at

918
00:38:59,072 --> 00:38:59,840
At sunset

919
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:02,144
You can also say

920
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:03,424
You know when

921
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,960
This device does

922
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:05,984
Something

923
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:06,752
Then

924
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:08,288
It'll trigger the scene

925
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:10,848
So cool example I like a V

926
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:11,616
To be like

927
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:13,920
Is there something you're doing anyways

928
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:17,504
That would say I'm going to bed so let's say

929
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,272
You turn off

930
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:19,552
Your bedside light

931
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:20,832
You could actually

932
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:23,392
Make a automation that would say

933
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:25,696
When I turn off my bedside light

934
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:26,976
Send trigger that good night

935
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:29,536
So instead of having to kind of be

936
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:30,816
Commanding of it

937
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:33,120
Just do that activity that you do anyway

938
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:35,168
In your regular routine

939
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:36,960
And I think that's where it starts to get

940
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:39,264
A little bit more while a little bit more

941
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:46,432
Senator tell everybody who tries to do this as someone who once spent six months trying to create the right

942
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:48,480
Automation for going to bed

943
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:51,552
I'm not sure it can be done if you live in a household

944
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:56,416
But I started with turning off my bedside light but then I ended up turning off

945
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:57,184
You know

946
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,976
Everything downstairs while my husband

947
00:39:59,232 --> 00:39:59,744
Can we still down there

948
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:02,816
So then I was like okay

949
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:04,096
Let's say

950
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:08,448
Let's what I turn off my bedroom light and there's no motion downstairs for 15 minutes

951
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,752
That was not great because then

952
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,800
For 15 minutes afterwards like

953
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:14,592
Nothing would happen

954
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:15,360
And I was like

955
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:16,384
Go to sleep

956
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:17,408
So

957
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:19,456
I played around with a bunch of different things in

958
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:20,480
I finally gave up

959
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:24,064
So if anyone else has some creative ways to indicate that feel free

960
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,624
My other thought was just stick up button on the bed and just

961
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,392
Prescient

962
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:29,440
But I got an echo when I just tell her

963
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:31,488
What do you do

964
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:32,256
Worse

965
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:34,560
Do you have more successful automations Maybe

966
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:37,632
I do a lot of timers that I'm running

967
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:40,192
I do some automations

968
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:41,728
Stuff like that

969
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:45,056
You could also get pretty complex you could kind of give it

970
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:46,336
Some variables of like

971
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:47,616
Only do this

972
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:48,896
When

973
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:52,224
You know this light's not on or something like that so

974
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,016
How to take it account that

975
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:55,552
That scenario

976
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:57,088
But yeah I mean I think

977
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:59,392
The important thing to remember to hear is like

978
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:01,184
They're just getting started with this stuff

979
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:07,584
It's definitely going to get more elegant and more advanced overtime kind of got to build a foundation for

980
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,352
Somewhere

981
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:10,912
So I think it's a great place to start and

982
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:12,704
It's only going to get more exciting

983
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:19,872
I feel like right now I'm having the same sort of feelings conversations and whatnot that I had probably too

984
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:21,920
Two or three years ago when all of like

985
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:23,712
SmartThings and

986
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:26,528
Staples connect Hub in the Lowe's Iris Club

987
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:28,320
Hub came out

988
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:29,600
Which was all around

989
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:32,416
Kind of programming an Automation and scenes

990
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:35,232
What is different this time around

991
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:37,280
I would say the

992
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,584
Big difference is that

993
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,656
Certification PC talked about earlier

994
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:44,192
It's really important for

995
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:45,984
Security but it's also

996
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:50,080
Ensuring that all those products are going to work together so

997
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:52,128
I don't know that some of those other systems

998
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:54,687
Go to as much of an extent

999
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:59,551
To certify products it's more like you know that product builds in integration and

1000
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:00,575
An Hayward

1001
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:02,879
This is pretty deep

1002
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:03,903
Level

1003
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:05,183
You know integration

1004
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:10,047
And I think as we move Beyond in a home automation where it is

1005
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:11,327
Today 2

1006
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:13,631
You know more of the kind of conscious home

1007
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:15,167
Concept where

1008
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:19,263
Enter your home is kind of adapting to you as you move through out at throughout the day

1009
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:20,799
That's where this kind of

1010
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:23,359
Deep level of integration between devices

1011
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:24,383
Really going to matter

1012
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:28,223
Another thing is how people might use apps

1013
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:33,087
So you know if you're like me and you have dozens of connected devices you also have you know

1014
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:36,927
Doesn't have to buy apps on your phone for those connected devices

1015
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:42,047
Part of the promise of Home seems to be that I don't actually have to open those apps anymore

1016
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:45,887
And I'm curious as a company that's making a device

1017
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:47,935
Is there a way for me to like setup

1018
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:49,215
Do I need to even

1019
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:51,263
Download The Connect Sense app to

1020
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:53,055
Connect a

1021
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:54,591
Connectsense

1022
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:55,359
Outlet

1023
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:56,127
To home

1024
00:42:57,407 --> 00:43:01,503
So certainly we would still love you to download our app but as a

1025
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:02,783
It stands today no

1026
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:04,063
You wouldn't have to download it

1027
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:08,415
For anything other than a firmware

1028
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:12,255
So that's something that you wouldn't be able to do in

1029
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:15,071
In-app so we definitely still recommend to our customer

1030
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:17,375
Samurai pain there

1031
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:18,911
Especially for that

1032
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:20,191
I'm one of the cool things

1033
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:21,471
Home does it do

1034
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:25,823
Is that if you dive into the details for an individual device

1035
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:28,383
Is it'll actually linked you out to that man

1036
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:29,407
Facture app

1037
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:31,967
So I think any time you're going to have

1038
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:34,783
Middle set up or maybe troubleshooting or

1039
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:36,319
Even some more advanced

1040
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:39,391
Can't go into too much detail but we're working on

1041
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:42,975
New features for our smart Outlets that you're not going to see in home

1042
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:44,767
You know home is at basics.

1043
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:47,071
You want to be able to turn outlets on and off

1044
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,607
We're going to build

1045
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:52,447
Some deeper cooler stuff that you're only going to be able to do in are at so

1046
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:55,519
I think there's still a place for manufacturers apps

1047
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:58,335
Home becomes kind of that

1048
00:43:58,591 --> 00:44:00,127
Default everyday experience

1049
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:04,479
How many people do you think will want to go that much deeper

1050
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:06,527
Is it feels like to bring

1051
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:08,063
This into the mainstream

1052
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:13,439
Homekit is addressing a lot of the issues like it's hard to get things connected

1053
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:17,023
You know there's so many features that's hard to figure out what you want to do with this stuff

1054
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:20,095
So in a way home is like a nice entry point

1055
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:23,167
And the hope is you people will go deeper

1056
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:25,983
How many people do you think

1057
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:26,751
Really well

1058
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:31,103
Yeah I mean I think you've got your mainstream user and

1059
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:32,127
And they're probably going to

1060
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:33,407
Stick mostly to home

1061
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:34,943
Most manufacturers I think

1062
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:37,503
Probably will recommend set up through their ass

1063
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:38,271
You know a lot

1064
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:39,039
Do

1065
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:42,111
Special things are going to have some special sauce they need

1066
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:43,647
Setup process

1067
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:48,767
But that's fine but you know I think you have also your your hire end-users that are

1068
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:49,535
You know

1069
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:50,559
More

1070
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:53,375
Going to want to do more complex things and I think that's it

1071
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:55,423
Interesting place where manufacturers

1072
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:56,959
Can still be Innovative and

1073
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:57,727
Bison

1074
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:58,495
Other unique

1075
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:00,543
Queso

1076
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:06,175
Most people feel like Hardware is going to be kind of commoditized in the space overtime

1077
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:10,783
Are you guys worried about Apple kind of taking over the customer relationship for y'all

1078
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:14,111
I'm not particularly worried about it I mean I think

1079
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:15,903
It's still

1080
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:17,951
They're going to help bring it to

1081
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:19,487
To the mainstream and

1082
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:21,279
That's good for Hardware companies

1083
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:22,047
And

1084
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:27,935
You know we are still going to look for ways where we can differentiate and provide great hardware and Grading

1085
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:28,959
Experiences

1086
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:31,519
And you know to me is it's a partnership

1087
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:34,079
So I was excited when I saw

1088
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:35,615
Stall mats I saw it as a

1089
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:39,199
Endorsement I'm not seeing it as a threat to anything we're doing

1090
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:40,223
Okay

1091
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:44,831
All right things got a little dark there why don't you tell me your favorite thing to do with home

1092
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:46,367
I would say my

1093
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:47,391
Favorite things

1094
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:50,463
Do is probably set up favorites

1095
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:52,511
And then like I mentioned earlier you

1096
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:53,535
Use those favorites

1097
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:54,559
Control center

1098
00:45:54,815 --> 00:46:00,191
As of uses throughout the entire beta process that's probably the one thing I find myself using

1099
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:02,751
The most cuz it's so quick and easy

1100
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:04,031
And

1101
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:05,567
Just gets whatever you're looking new

1102
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:08,639
Get turned on or off for control Done Quick

1103
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:10,175
Do you Siri very off

1104
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:15,295
I do I still use it from time to time that's probably one I use more so for

1105
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:16,575
Scenes

1106
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:20,415
Quick control of another individual devices control center

1107
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:21,183
My go-to

1108
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:23,231
Okay and we should also mention that

1109
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:25,279
When you're out of the home

1110
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:29,119
You at will need an Apple TV to actually

1111
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:32,191
Heard like timers and things that you said so scheduled items

1112
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:36,287
You'll need an Apple TV to make sure those run when your phone isn't around

1113
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:37,567
Or an iPad

1114
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:38,591
So

1115
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:41,151
I assume you have something like that in your house what is your

1116
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:45,759
I do I use the Apple TV the latest

1117
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:47,039
Greatest thing as Apple

1118
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:48,063
Before

1119
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:51,903
Contact us at HUB but I was really happy that they also gave that

1120
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:53,695
That option for an iPad

1121
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:54,975
In the settings field

1122
00:46:56,255 --> 00:47:01,375
Sitting for a lot of people iPads kind of a couch device that doesn't necessarily leave the home alone.

1123
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:02,911
So that makes a ton of sense

1124
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:04,447
Gives people some other out

1125
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:06,495
Oh shirt yeah I've got

1126
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:10,079
Who say I have iPad scattered everywhere

1127
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:11,103
Mom so now I

1128
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:16,735
Anything else you want to tell us about him

1129
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:18,783
I know I meant think it's in

1130
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:20,575
Exciting times definitely think

1131
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:23,391
People should check it out when they upgrade to iOS

1132
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:24,415
