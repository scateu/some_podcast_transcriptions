00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:02,976
And she and I had a really good conversation

26
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:06,048
About what gdpr means for iot

27
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:07,072
And for consumers

28
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,352
But first

29
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:09,888
What's have a message from Mars

30
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:17,312
This week sponsor is building an iot device or solution start ahead with a Renee Smith's energy plant

32
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:30,112
Iot Solutions quickly with the AE Cloud One kitten connect to Amazon web services Microsoft azure

00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:53,408
Cloudkid

38
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:54,944
Kevin

39
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:58,016
Let's get this show on the road

40
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,552
Let's talk about Strava

41
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:00,832
Let's summarize

42
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:04,160
First for those of you guys who've been living under a rock

43
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:05,440
What happened

44
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:08,256
Let's tell me what Strava is for sex

45
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:13,632
Exercise tracking applications been around for a long time I've used it in the past four foot certain

46
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:16,192
Smart watches and obviously with phones

47
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:22,592
When you run or exercise you can track your location to GPS and I do this kind of thing with a different app called

48
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:24,640
RunKeeper that way I can see where I ran on

49
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:26,176
Elevation salon

50
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:28,992
Oops trouble puts out heat maps of

51
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:32,064
All of the runners data and it's all anonymous

52
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,136
Stencil on what it was recently found out that you could

53
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:40,000
C on the heat Maps if you search for say a nuclear facility or

54
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,024
Army base

55
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:41,792
See

56
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,328
Strava users

57
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,096
Around

58
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:46,912
That area which is a obvious privacy

59
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:47,680
Problem

60
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:51,264
At a very high level and recently had a very lower level

61
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:57,152
Was found out that you could even get the names of people find their heart rate and so on you knew how to do so

62
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:59,200
That information came out of wired

63
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,992
Just earlier this week so

64
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:07,648
That's a big problem and I know strawberries looking into this they had a post on their company blog from the leadership there

65
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,440
It's an issue

66
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,464
It's a big issue

67
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,000
Yes it is

68
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:12,768
And

69
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:14,560
We talked about it a little with our guest

70
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:15,584
So that'll happen

71
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,424
But the big thing that we got to keep in mind here is

72
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:20,448
1

73
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:23,008
Apart of these people share their data voluntarily

74
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:29,664
Top 10 things in place what they didn't account for is what happened to the data what was combined with other

75
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:34,528
I think what does tells us

76
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,552
Is that

77
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:38,112
It is impossible to see what you search

78
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:38,880
Your data is going

79
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:46,816
Really unnerving when we start thinking about how we can combine information and different ways to

80
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:48,608
Help people or two

81
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:50,400
Discover new things about

82
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:51,936
It becomes

83
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,472
Searchable online

84
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:54,240
And

85
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,008
It stays there for

86
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:57,312
Yeah you're absolutely right

87
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:03,712
Again I like with Strava does in theory with the heat map is showing people you know it's Community where people are running

88
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:06,528
Exercising like if I travel say to a London

89
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:11,136
And I'll go look for a running route it's very easy to go to Strava and say hey a lot of people run

90
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:13,952
Right here and nice 5 Mile Loop

91
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,256
So it's useful to me as a user

92
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,024
But

93
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,911
Obviously that data can be used in other ways and like you said you don't know how it's going to be used and

94
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:27,007
It is voluntary to provide that data I actually again I use RunKeeper

95
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:31,871
I share my map dated with my friends on RunKeeper people that I know and trust

96
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:34,943
Crunchy person put out heat Maps or anything but if they did

97
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:37,759
You know what's the policy there because I'm not

98
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:44,159
Sharing my information publicly would they not use it in their heat map I don't know it's a lot of questions here on how the baby is you

99
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:44,927
You said you would said

100
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:45,951
And

101
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:46,975
You will learn more

102
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:48,255
This whole conversation

103
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,279
It's not a way for me to

104
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,839
Pumper next guest

105
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:52,863
Something

106
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:56,191
There was a really good article in the New York Times about data being

107
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,215
Treated as a

108
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:58,239
Public good

109
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:01,311
Because not only is it my data is at risk but

110
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,359
Because of this particular instance

111
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,151
It's also National

112
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:05,919
Security data

113
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:10,015
Or if you think about a town that maybe has a lot of pollution

114
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,807
Insurance companies

115
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:14,367
Look at that see it Based on data

116
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:16,159
Variety of other sensors

117
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:18,975
And say hey we're going to charge everybody who lives there a lot

118
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,023
So we're going to start

119
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,583
Conversations emerge where

120
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,863
It honestly

121
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:30,495
In America because we're such an individualistic society and we put a lot of Burden

122
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,519
Only individual

123
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,567
I'm really interested to see how this will

124
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,335
Play out

125
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,103
Because

126
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:37,407
This is kind of a community

127
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,175
Good

128
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:38,943
Evidence

129
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,479
Soar Community problems

130
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,295
Evolution

131
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:46,367
To a new talent that Madam a half

132
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:47,903
We tested this

133
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:48,927
Morning

134
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:51,487
From your Android phone you can send

135
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:52,511
An SMS text

136
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,047
Using

137
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:57,375
Madam so all you have to do is say not Ma

138
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,399
Send a text

139
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:00,959
Message to and pick someone in your contacts

140
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:01,727
Next iPad

141
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:02,495
Kevin

142
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,263
So I said

143
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,567
Send a text message to Kevin tofel

144
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,335
And

145
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,103
She said

146
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,639
Kevin tofel right

147
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:09,919
And I said yes

148
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:10,943
And she said

149
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,223
What is the message

150
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:13,759
April the message

151
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:16,319
And lo and behold a moment later

152
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,087
Received it

153
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:20,415
I received it and I also got a little link

154
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:24,767
To hear the actual audio of your message as well so what you recorded or

155
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:27,583
What she recorded you saying I got that as well

156
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:30,399
Which is useful because maybe something doesn't transcribe properly

157
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:32,959
Play so it is only working with

158
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:38,079
Android phones for USA sender as a recipient I got it on my iPhone but I could not

159
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,615
Reply back or send

160
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:42,687
Being mad at me I would have to do that in my messages app

161
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:43,711
Okay

162
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:44,479
So

163
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:45,503
Other music

164
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:47,551
She is not

165
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:48,831
Getting ads

166
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:51,903
Anytime soon according to a story in the information

167
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:52,671
So

168
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,695
The story ran

169
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:56,511
Earlier this week and basically Sony

170
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:57,535
Apparently was

171
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,303
Complaining to

172
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:02,399
Anime that works really hard on his Jeopardy game and it can't make any money from it

173
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,167
In

174
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,215
Amazon folks are like well

175
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:05,983
We'll see what we can do

176
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:09,311
And what they're thinking of doing is making basically

177
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,591
Premium type of off

178
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,359
So

179
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:15,711
You can use the Jeopardy skill but maybe you pay extra like a buck 99 a month

180
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:16,735
Extraco

181
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,039
If you're a hardcore Japanese lover

182
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,575
You're running out of questions

183
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:21,599
Get more

184
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:22,623
Just for tuba

185
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:26,207
Don't know if that's going to work but would you pay for something like that

186
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:32,607
I would I do that I do a lot of in-app purchases for extra features on my phone so I probably would if I really like the skin

187
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:39,519
I don't think I would do it for Jeopardy personally but that's just me but I do like this better than what we thought was going to happen cuz a few weeks back

188
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,055
Backward recording on

189
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:41,823
Pyramid

190
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:44,895
Companies like Procter & Gamble and others were going to

191
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,687
Potentially Hadlock sponsored

192
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:48,223
Slots on

193
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,759
In search results on a

194
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:50,783
An echo device

195
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:55,391
And it looks like that's not going to happen either now because Amazon's kind of saying look we know

196
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:59,743
The ads are a distracting thing in a conversational user interface so

197
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,279
And we're thinking no ads

198
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,815
And I have to agree with

199
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,351
I do not

200
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:07,679
I did take a picture the other day

201
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:12,287
Because you know how if you cut the Echo Show there's a little thing at the bottoms like ask

202
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,311
Not of age

203
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:15,359
To do this how to say good morning in Japanese

204
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,639
Which was a reason

205
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:18,687
One that I was like yes how do you say that

206
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,735
So maybe they could run an ad there

207
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:21,503
But that was about it

208
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,551
That's not a lot of people have Echo

209
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,111
Okay

210
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:26,879
Next

211
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,415
Google Assistant

212
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:33,535
I'm going to tell you guys right now we're going to do a little update unsolicited update on the Google

213
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:34,815
Assistant experiment

214
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:37,119
It is not going well

215
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,143
But

216
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,983
Google only half the time does Google recognize my voice which means

217
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:44,287
Only half the time can I turn on my television

218
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,311
So

219
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,335
Frustrating

220
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:49,151
Cuz that is status through

221
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:52,479
Next riot

222
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,015
So that's for sure

223
00:08:54,783 --> 00:09:00,927
Let me ask you this is it just not recognizing the commanders at your voice meaning you've got multi-user

224
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:01,695
Set up

225
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:05,535
I don't actually even have multi-user setup but I do the voice

226
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,559
Taproot like I did

227
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:07,327
I have it recognized my

228
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,119
I still want it doesn't it's like

229
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,655
I don't know.

230
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:12,447
Right

231
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,727
It's about

232
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:14,495
50/50

233
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:18,335
So what device does that occur is it a home or is it a home Mini

234
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,103
It's a home

235
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,127
It's a home

236
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,663
Straight home

237
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,431
And

238
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,199
Yeah

239
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,991
Tip not loving it

240
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:26,015
So far

241
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:28,575
Now I did get some lovely

242
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,343
Lovely

243
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,623
Bubbly recommendations

244
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,415
Clairaudience who said Stacy

245
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:34,975
If you don't like Harmony talking to you in the middle and who would

246
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:36,511
Why don't you run it through

247
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:37,279
You know me

248
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,559
Or stringify

249
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:40,863
Or any of these other things and so

250
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:43,935
That is a great suggestion I did run it through you know me

251
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,215
And that is helpful

252
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,519
And now I do no longer have to listen

253
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,287
Harmony

254
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:53,407
Righty Paisley cut out the middleman Bots

255
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:59,039
But it's less disrupted from a user

256
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,063
Experience because

257
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:02,367
You're not having something else talk to you now

258
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,135
It's a better

259
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,183
Right so yes

260
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,719
So that is where that

261
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:07,743
Hole

262
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:08,767
Experiment stands

263
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:09,535
My family hates

264
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:13,631
And I'm not sure how long it's going to continue

265
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,703
We're still there

266
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:20,031
That was the unsolicited update

267
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,055
Where is

268
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,847
What we were supposed to be talking about

269
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:27,455
Custom hot or maybe getting custom hot words

270
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,991
Dual calling on

271
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,527
Smartscreen switch Kevin Love

272
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:32,063
How to buy and

273
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,087
I think that's it

274
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:39,487
There's a couple things in here but those are the two main ones as you said an innocent all comes from a teardown

275
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:42,303
Hey Google I'm sorry 95 Google

276
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:44,863
Went and looked at the latest Google app

277
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:51,263
Paisley model around the code to see what's in there and they can see the strings for creating custom hot words for the Google assist

278
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,799
Stenton and so on

279
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:55,615
You have to train the hotword have to see about that

280
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:59,711
But also in there yes Google Duo for smart displays I do want that

281
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:03,807
Smart display that we saw at CES that was the without Lenovo or LG

282
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:04,575
Yeah

283
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,135
Yes

284
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:11,231
Yes what you can put in portrait or landscape I just really like the design of that

285
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:16,607
I don't think I'd use it for duo and main reason is I don't know anybody using Duo so

286
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:21,727
Oh absolutely anyone almost always could

287
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,519
IOS Android emulator

288
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,543
No no I thought you

289
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,335
What do a without

290
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:27,871
Them having

291
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,407
That could be

292
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,711
I don't see again I don't use because

293
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,503
I don't really know anybody who does

294
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,783
But we'll have to try it

295
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,063
See you guys Kevin never

296
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:36,831
Calls me

297
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:39,391
I know but Stacy sends me text messages

298
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:40,671
Compare Echo

299
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,439
Exactly

300
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:49,119
And you will have to see if these all come to pass it's very common for Google and any company really to put things in there

301
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,167
Software for potential future features

302
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:53,727
But we'll have to see if he's going to pass out

303
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:57,055
It keeps them up with Amazon I mean right now

304
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,079
Jack.

305
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:02,943
The Amazon calling between Echo switch I've never use cuz I don't know anybody else with the show

306
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:03,711
So

307
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,503
Right

308
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:06,527
In other news

309
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,295
We've got

310
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,319
Details

311
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:11,391
On how many echos at home devices are out there

312
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,159
And

313
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:12,927
So far

314
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:18,047
Unsurprisingly Amazon is ahead with 69% of the market share according to

315
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:22,143
Yes they consumer intelligence research partners

316
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:28,543
They put out a new report based on survey data and see us only and basically it's like set

317
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,847
Seven out of every ten smart

318
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:34,175
Speakers made by either Amazon or Google is sold by Amazon

319
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:40,575
I kind of question this a little bit only because the numbers they have from the survey they're saying that us installed base

320
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,111
They estimate about

321
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,647
31 million

322
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:47,743
Amazon Echo devices vs 14 million Google home devices

323
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:54,143
I get us only it just seems really low to me on the Amazon side just because they've been around much longer and

324
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,495
And I realized it took a while for people to understand what an echo is and there was

325
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:01,567
It took time for Amazon to come out with the dot on the top

326
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,615
31 million just seems

327
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,895
Loaded me if

328
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:08,735
Assuming the Google home figure is correct at 14 million I just I don't know

329
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,015
I just seems like to me

330
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:13,343
I don't know if this is super low or not

331
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,367
I don't have a sense

332
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,391
But we did

333
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,159
See

334
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,439
Earlier this month

335
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:21,791
And survey from NPR that said that there were about 39 million

336
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:22,815
People

337
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,095
In the US

338
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,375
16% of America

339
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,935
So it's about 39 million

340
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,215
So that kind of

341
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,239
Funeral

342
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:33,823
Well

343
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,151
Clean out my thought process is how many people just buy one

344
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,431
Well that is true

345
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:39,711
So

346
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:41,759
Yes 6

347
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:42,527
Canzona smart

348
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:45,855
There are going to be able to just have one

349
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:49,695
Homeworld one Echo and I get that you want to get started

350
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:52,767
But with the low prices of the dots in the minis

351
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:59,423
And the fact that you might use them in different rooms your house I'm in kind of people are going to put one in every room like we might do

352
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:01,727
I think there's more people that have

353
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:02,495
Multiple

354
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:04,287
Smart speakers as opposed to

355
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,567
People that have just one

356
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:08,639
Which Casey's numbers would be low

357
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:12,479
The thing is we have to guess at it because these companies don't share these numbers really

358
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:16,319
Frustrating quite honestly from my perspective but logically it seems love

359
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:19,647
And it doesn't even count

360
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:23,231
For what I think is really interesting is putting you know

361
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:26,047
Assistant or Echo into other devices

362
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:27,839
Assistant

363
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:30,655
Is just getting started here but Echo you know you

364
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,679
Buy thermostats

365
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,703
Bipolar

366
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:36,031
Actually maybe you can buy light bulbs you can buy light switches

367
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,639
The fire TVs with the remote

368
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:41,407
They all have

369
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:44,479
Voice

370
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:48,575
Yeah there you go by the keeper make such a great refrigerator

371
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:50,111
Put that next to your cute cat

372
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,135
There we go

373
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,671
Okay so

374
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:55,487
We're still not sure but there's some more information

375
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:58,815
Simorgh estimates on echo.and home devices out in Market

376
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,095
And that means there's

377
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,375
Plenty of room to grow

378
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,655
If people want that

379
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,447
So now

380
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,495
Move to subdue as pets

381
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,263
Starting with

382
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,287
Sad news

383
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:15,199
This kind of follows along something we talked about you the last show of the show before because we were mentioning that

384
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:17,759
I can tile had some layoffs recently

385
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:20,831
And this week we heard that tracker

386
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:24,415
Which makes a similar product Bluetooth tracking device has laid off

387
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:28,255
Approximately 42 employees that's according to sources talking to

388
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,023
TechCrunch

389
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:32,351
Yeah they just raised about 15 million dollars in August

390
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:34,655
Tracker did and I know they're trying to get there

391
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,959
They're trying to expand their product into

392
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:39,263
A service that will work when you know and

393
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,287
Other small

394
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:42,847
Things like key holders are pens and whatnot but

395
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:46,175
That's what I said last week you know you have to have a broader

396
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:48,223
Product-based adjusting Bluetooth tracker

397
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:52,575
I think I'm not saying that's the cause of this but that's my gut for the long-term

398
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,599
And yes

399
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,391
You're probably right

400
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,671
It's going to come down to just

401
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:58,975
Okay

402
00:15:59,231 --> 00:15:59,743
Davos

403
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:03,583
Otherwise known as the world economic Forum you guys probably

404
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,375
Are very familiar with it or at least have

405
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,399
Clocked it

406
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,167
On Twitter

407
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,191
Dallas

408
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:11,519
Big Focus there was the Industrial internet-of-things

409
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,799
With the world economic

410
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,591
Squirrel adding more centers

411
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:15,615
4

412
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:19,711
The fourth Industrial Revolution or industry 4.0

413
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:21,759
All those are fancy ways of saying

414
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:22,783
Industrial iot

415
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:23,807
Yes

416
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:27,647
So what they are doing is they had more than 400 sessions

417
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:30,719
And they're really freaking out everyone's freaking out about

418
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:31,999
Sensors everywhere

419
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:33,791
What is going

420
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:34,815
4

421
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,095
Best case

422
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:42,495
I'm less worried about that I think we've got a long way to go before we actually start implementing this stuff at any sort of scary level it's

423
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:46,335
Still very difficult to do that open to Center in Sanford

424
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,615
Francisco for

425
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,639
The fourth Industrial Revolution

426
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:49,919
And now

427
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,967
They're opening new centers in India

428
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:52,735
Japan

429
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,015
And the UAE

430
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,039
And the Earth

431
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:59,903
Also are announcing a fellowship for postdocs to work in any of these centers

432
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:03,231
Trying to figure out issues associated with the industrial

433
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:03,999
Iot

434
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:06,047
And it is created three councils

435
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,375
One is called the global artificial intelligence Council

436
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,727
The other is global iot

437
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:15,519
The internet

438
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,847
It kind of feels like

439
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,383
All the hot buzzwords

440
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:26,015
The goal is to identify ways to regulate these

441
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,551
Share learnings about

442
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:30,879
Different groups around the world it's the basic

443
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:31,903
World economic

444
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:34,975
Together we shall probably think

445
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:36,767
He's out because

446
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:37,535
The world

447
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,327
Have a wall built around Chino

448
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,351
Where is Countryside

449
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,631
Work radiator cap

450
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,191
I thought that was interesting

451
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:51,615
Curious what comes out of it I would like to see what comes out of especially like the postdoc Research into all this

452
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,151
Maybe nothing will but you know

453
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:56,479
Smart people are finally thinking about all of this and

454
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:59,295
Government officials are finally thinking about it and

455
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:01,343
Talking about it whether they'll take action

456
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,111
I don't know

457
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:04,415
In other industrial news

458
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:06,463
PTC and Microsoft have

459
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,487
Teamed up

460
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:10,303
At first I was like is this really a thing

461
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,863
Actually it is because PTC thingworx

462
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,679
Which is a platform for The Internet of Things

463
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:17,215
So you can basically

464
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,751
Implement all kinds of

465
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,031
Sensors

466
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:21,567
Automations on top of it

467
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:22,847
It now will run

468
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,127
On

469
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:26,687
Usher so we offered as a managed service on top

470
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:30,271
This is important because many

471
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:31,551
Industrial client

472
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:34,367
Anson figure named clients are little leery

473
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,159
About using AWS

474
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:37,951
So azure

475
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:39,999
Is familiar to their it Department

476
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:40,767
Love it

477
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:43,071
And I'm sure actually has some really strong

478
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,375
Strong iot offerings

479
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:47,423
Both of the SAS and the pass level

480
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:51,519
I remember few shows back when we were talking about where's Google

481
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:57,919
Iot platform we compared it a little bit to Microsoft which has a lot of great tools and ways to implement and manage device

482
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:00,991
Isis in a couple weeks I'll actually be able to tell you something

483
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:06,879
Etsy yes a company that is building out a massive iot Solution on Google Cloud

484
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,183
I know so

485
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,975
Apparently it's there and exist

486
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:15,071
And this person actually told me that one of the reasons why they did it is because

487
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:16,351
Google's really

488
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:18,143
Pushing hard in this area once

489
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:20,447
Good clients so they're really working

490
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:23,007
Yay

491
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:24,799
To learn more about that but not for a

492
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:29,407
And let's see what other news item

493
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,687
Pulling out here

494
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:31,711
This is

495
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:33,759
Missed it is a company that makes

496
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:34,527
Wireless

497
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:35,551
Access point

498
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,343
Spit off of Wi-Fi

499
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:41,695
But they also let you do things like establish virtual Bluetooth beacons

500
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,999
And a bunch of other services on

501
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,023
So

502
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,815
It's a very powerful

503
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:48,863
You know probably a decade ago

504
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:51,935
Can I go I was really excited when

505
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:53,215
Rocky King

506
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:56,031
It was a whole new way of thinking about Enterprise WiFi

507
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:59,103
Well I feel like missed is kind of like the Moroccan

508
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:01,151
Of what Wi-Fi needs to be

509
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:03,199
Within the internet of Things

510
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:05,503
So excited to see that they have been out

511
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:09,343
Cathay pacific

512
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:12,159
I'm not so it's like Mavis Beacon

513
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:12,927
And

514
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:14,719
Jarvis had a baby

515
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:15,487
And

516
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:18,303
But you can

517
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:22,911
Network questions it questions like how many smartphones are on this

518
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:23,679
Explorer

519
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:25,727
How many computers on this floor

520
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:26,751
Linux

521
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:31,103
All of these questions why is Bob smartphone behaving so poorly

522
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,895
And apparently Marta switch

523
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:33,663
Be able to

524
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:35,967
So

525
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:37,247
Free cool

526
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:39,295
That would be good so I could use that help

527
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:42,879
I'm not going to get into my fiber troubleshooting issue right now but I could use that help

528
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:45,183
Yes Kevin squeezing a battle

529
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:46,463
New gigabit

530
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:51,583
Well it's labeled gigabit but it is so not too bad

531
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,887
We won't go there right now

532
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:55,423
It's not going to spend a lot of time

533
00:20:57,471 --> 00:21:00,031
I've spent a lot of time on that

534
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:01,567
That's true

535
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:03,359
Okay

536
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:04,383
Let's move to

537
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:06,431

And now for the voicemail

559
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,832
Hi my name is Doris cast

560
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:47,392
I love the show and I just wanted to ask

561
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,928
How do you know if your

562
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,464
Google home

563
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,744
Or it could be like

564
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,048
If it has been hacked

565
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,072
And

566
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:56,608
If so how do you

567
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:59,936
Get rid of all removed the person being are your

568
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:00,960
Device being hacked

569
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:03,264
Bright lights and my name is Isaac in

570
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,032
Have a great day

571
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:07,872
So that's a good question from Isaac wondering you know how would you know if

572
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:10,944
Your smart speaker was hacked and what can you do about it

573
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:15,808
I'm not so sure you really ever know that's the one tricky bit here

574
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:20,160
I mean if you wanted to try and like Trace network data and all that it might be able to

575
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,184
Find out what

576
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,208
I would say this

577
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:25,536
If you feel that your home or Echo device has been hacked

578
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:30,400
Concerned the thing that I would probably do I would factory reset it because any kind of hacks

579
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:37,056
Are likely things that have altered software somehow or maybe they are capturing Network output from your

580
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:43,200
Device so I would probably just do a factory reset on my speaker just to make sure

581
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:46,528
But again it's so hard to determine if it's truly been hacked

582
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:54,208
Winnacunnet but you know It's Tricky that some of these hacks we don't find out about until somebody who has

583
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:55,744
Ashley created a hack

584
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,096
And then told the company manufacture the products hey you got a flaw here

585
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:01,120
And then it's

586
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:01,888
Hopefully fix

587
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:03,424
And then publicly announce so

588
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,752
That's why I say it's very tricky to find out if one of these things has

589
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:07,520
In hat

590
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:13,152
Chances are though if if that device has been hacked has probably come to your network and you probably have a bigger issue I would say

591
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:15,968
Yes in now that a larger question

592
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:18,272
Which isn't actually your question but I'll tell you about it anyway

593
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:20,320
You can actually

594
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,088
Is there a

595
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:24,672
Devices you can attach to your network that will monitor your traffic

596
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:26,208
And see if it's behaving up

597
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:29,536
Anime stop stalking to

598
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:31,328
Amazon and start stalking

599
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,608
Something in Shenzhen

600
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:33,376
Maybe

601
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:34,144
There's an issue

602
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,424
And it will flag.

603
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:39,776
So you could even go higher level you could just see if when your device

604
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:43,104
It when you're not using it if a lot of network data is being

605
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,408
Sent to work from that device

606
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:46,688
Yes that is true

607
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,992
So those are

608
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:52,320
Those devices Cujo is one think bitdefender has one

609
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:54,368
There's a bunch of router type

610
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:55,392
Products that

611
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:58,208
Attached to your router or there's actually routers that have

612
00:23:58,464 --> 00:23:58,976
This feature built

613
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:00,512
2 Euro has acid

614
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:02,048
Security offering that you can

615
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:02,816
Pay for

616
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:04,352
Or if they're going to announce

617
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,888
What actually does Google have

618
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:06,656
Something like that

619
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,496
I don't believe so

620
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:16,896
Pretty basic I mean may have things going on in the background like just this morning I found out has a built-in firewall which obviously it should

621
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:20,480
But you don't have access to it and you wouldn't know it by looking at the apps

622
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:23,040
In a lot of back and stuff in there

623
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:29,440
So I don't know that anything I don't want to say they don't because I don't know but I haven't seen anything that indicates I do

624
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,488
Okay so

625
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,512
That

626
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:39,168
That's all the help we can provide here I also will say that some of these and this is something I've been looking at more in the Enterprise space

627
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:40,448
But I think it's coming to the

628
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:41,472
Consumer space

629
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:44,544
Actually Comcast showed off something like this at CES

630
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,080
Coming out later this year

631
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:51,712
Is it not only will it warn you it will actually automatically quarantine the device or take it off the network

632
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:54,272
So I thought that was actually pretty cool

633
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,296
Cuz then what you'll get it

634
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:56,576
This is notification

635
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:57,344
It says

636
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,624
This guy

637
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,696
Not only was weird it was weird in a way that was

638
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:02,464
Approve with

639
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:04,256
Malicious and so we just

640
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,024
Pop-up blocker

641
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:06,304
And I think

642
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:08,352
That's interesting if something's weird they might

643
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:10,400
Hey your kids laptop

644
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:11,936
Is behaving kind of funny

645
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:12,704
You may want to

646
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,336
So thanks Isaac for calling in and as a reminder that number is 512

647
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:19,360
6 to 3

648
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:21,152
Temperature to 4

649
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:22,944
As I had a momentary brainlab

650
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,968
Boxer

651
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,296
Stay tuned now for a message from this week sponsor

652
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,320
Decentraland

653
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:29,600
For our guest

654
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:30,368
Kiara

655
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,392
Stitches

656
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:33,184
Who is going to tell you

657
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:39,840
Why gdpr is good even for those of us in the US

658
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:46,240
Taking a break from this week's Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor this week sponsor is point Central

659
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:49,312
And I have Sean Miller president of pointcentral here to talk to her

660
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:50,336
So quick

661
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:52,384
Let's remind our audience what it is

662
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,152
The point Central

663
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:59,808
So pointcentral is a subsidiary of alarm.com enterprise-grade home automation Solutions

664
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:01,088
As a business tool

665
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:06,976
The short-term and long-term managers of single-family and multi-family properties

666
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,512
From the writers point of view

667
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:10,560
What does life in a smart apartment

668
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:12,096
As we've seen her last

669
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:16,704
Computers and home automation has grown in adoption amongst mostly homeowners

670
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,752
Renters have been left a little bit the Dust

671
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:20,032
Austin place over there

672
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:24,640
Reasons for get left in the dust are common with people who are buying home automation for the home such as

673
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:25,408
Just Coster

674
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:28,224
Install and setup fears develop a problem with

675
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,504
How to deal with the landlord

676
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:33,344
Cuz the landlord wanted to install these things what happens after they move out

677
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:39,744
What we've done is make sure that our solution again is not only a tool for the property manager but it's also really an acid in half

678
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,768
That's been for that recipe

679
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,584
For the resin perspective that really starts when they first

680
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:49,216
CA unit that's on occupied that they're thinking about renting will that be a single-family home or an apartment

681
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:51,264
Building and it really gives him a wow factor

682
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:56,896
If you look at the demographics of a lot of ranchers today Millennials tend to dominate it and Millennials also tend to be some of the biggest

683
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:59,968
Enthusiast of home automation tax when they walk into a

684
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:01,504
A unit and see that

685
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,808
The thermostat there locks their lights

686
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:05,600
All controllable from an app

687
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:10,976
And from one app that tends to get them excited and then there's opportunities to add a little more wild to it

688
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:12,768
We've had certain partners that will say

689
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:19,168
Add a voice control unit in there so when someone's touring the home they could just see how quick and easy it is for them to use their voice

690
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:20,704
And control things around their house

691
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:21,984
And once I am in

692
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,776
Impressed then I go live there

693
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:24,544
What are the advantages

694
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:28,640
The first benefit residency when they move in is Energy savings

695
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:30,944
Other Heating and Cooling bills from having a Kinect

696
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:36,320
Thermostat what we see is residents typically see a savings of about 10 to 50% off their monthly bills

697
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:37,856
The next benefit residence

698
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:39,648
She is wearing a sanax

699
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,208
And while this may be a little for it first

700
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:44,768
What wasn't really start to love and enjoy his

701
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:45,792
Now that get

702
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:51,168
Download control who has access to the home from the palm of their hand or from a website but also no

703
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:54,496
Just at home when and where the weather be a child

704
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:55,776
A pet Walker

705
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:58,336
Or friend visiting and Couchsurfing for the week

706
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:01,152
You can control and know who came in and when

707
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:06,016
All from right there within the app as I mentioned in the app how to see one big benefit is

708
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:12,416
Of the Energy savings and access to many other services we offer the residents all these Services come together in one app

709
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:14,464
For the residents of the not worried about

710
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,000
Messing with multiple apps

711
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:17,792
At all the hardware is already set up and go

712
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:22,400
Configure so they essentially move in and get to use this system right away and all the data

713
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:24,448
That these devices are generating

714
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:26,240
Is being encrypted and transmitted

715
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:28,544
To our hearts and cloud or we have a very robust

716
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:32,128
State of policy to make sure that all the consumers data is protected and secure

717
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,152
The sounds great

718
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:35,968
Where can I go to find out more about

719
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:39,552
To learn more about essential oils benefits for both

720
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:41,088

Haley would welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest is

723
00:28:55,936 --> 00:29:01,312
Kiara Richie and independent analysts covering gdpr and privacy

724
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:03,104
Hi Kara how are you doing today

725
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:07,200
Husky say I'm fine how are you

726
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:11,040
So I really excited I've been waiting for like 2 months to get

727
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:13,600
A gdpr expert on the show

728
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:16,416
Let's get started with a quick overview

729
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:17,952
What is gdpr mean

730
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:18,720
4 can soup

731
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:22,560
Thunderman

732
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:25,376
Shoes it is essentially

Content management

928
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:07,360
It's crazy

929
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:09,664
If it is

930
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:11,712
Nutcracker

931
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:12,480
The resident

00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:15,040
Ruby station so they do understand that please

933
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:20,672
Yet at the same time though take-no-prisoners and

00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:25,536
Buying setting

935
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:26,560
Customized date

936
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:29,632
Come down on you

937
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:30,912
In the US

938
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:31,680
Obviously

939
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:32,704
Several

940
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,728
Business

941
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:35,520
Change

942
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:37,056
A lot of business models

943
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:38,080
Baseball

944
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,896
And it will require

945
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,944
Creativity no tomato

946
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:46,272
Phone number customer information request

947
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:50,368
You can see this

948
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:52,160
Going around

949
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:53,440
Right

950
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,768
Deployment

951
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,304
Machine learning

952
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:01,120
Address to predict what altitude

953
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,192
Start a pitching machine in the human

954
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:09,312
You mentioned enforcement so we should probably talk about what this is going to look like

955
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:12,896
I mean I'm a 26er bunch of coming

956
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:15,712
You are totally not

957
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:16,736
The coordinates are these

958
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:18,528
Are there any lawsuits

959
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,832
Well depression

960
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:23,904
Strategy strategies

961
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,840
We're here to

962
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:32,864
How to get it right

963
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:34,912
Favoritism number of steps

964
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:38,240
The ultimate in the signs

965
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:39,520
Financial

966
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:41,056
Turn to the Flying

967
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:43,104
They can send me give advice

968
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:47,200
Southern Cremations

969
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:48,992
Question answer you start seeing

970
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:51,808
A lot of communication coming out to companies

971
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:57,184
Come out of the very nature protection authority for example

972
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:01,024
Forget that the sensible information The Regulators

973
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:06,656
Lights

974
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:12,544
Data entry

975
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:19,200
Is it supposed to look good for accountability first and also I need the guide

976
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,528
Great to meet you guys and daughter then

977
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:26,112
Vacations

978
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:33,536
One thing that I am looking forward to is actually journalist across the EU looking

979
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:37,120
And requesting their data so what day do you have on me

980
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:43,008
And once people start to see that I'm very curious like we just had this Strava

981
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,544
I'm sure you saw the guard

982
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,152
Basically showing anyone

983
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:51,968
Where military US military bases

984
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:52,992
Based on

985
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:55,808
Those people's exercise soldiers exercise habits

986
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:57,600
So I looked at that and I was like

987
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:58,880
Actually maybe not

988
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:00,928
What's Travis for you

989
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:03,744
Use it to show people your runs in your routes

990
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:10,144
But you don't mean that context becomes problematic so I'm like oh does the military set rules against that

991
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,128
Two-sided nature of the Beast rating Pittacus

992
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:23,968
OMG that's a sharing platform of consent involved

993
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:33,440
The world of data Schlitterbahn intended consequences and so frankly is the date of the world of this regulation

994
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:34,720
2

995
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:36,000
We try to do our best

996
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:37,280
I'm sure

997
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:39,072
People who signed up to

998
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:40,352
The service

999
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:42,400
Nutrition data

1000
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:44,704
What they probably didn't know that

1001
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:51,104
Get cross reference without a date

1002
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,128
Nobody quotes

1003
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,151
Combination

1004
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:55,199
Combinations of data points

1005
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:55,967
Can identify

1006
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:58,783
State precisely

1007
00:41:59,039 --> 00:41:59,807
Can identify

1008
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:01,343
You know you're Italian

1009
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:05,439
What date does

1010
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:06,719
When it sheds

1011
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:15,423
Because of manufacturing is because the biggest change now is that by default

1012
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:18,239
2 and Pregnant

1013
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:20,287
Catchphrase

1014
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:23,359
Is that you really have to

1015
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:25,151
Side

1016
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:26,175
How much

1017
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:26,943
Trisha

1018
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:27,967
What it means to

1019
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:31,807
Deformed granular

1020
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:35,903
You never find yourself in a situation where you're over sharing

1021
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:37,695
Don't understand

1022
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:42,559
Should be set to do not share

1023
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:43,583
Presumably

1024
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:45,375
Military personnel should have been trained

1025
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:46,143
Say okay

1026
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:52,031
I do not open to the sharing.

1027
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:54,079
Kind of information

1028
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:55,871
Results from a combined

1029
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:02,015
Right and I would say maybe Strava in combining

1030
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:06,879
Fitness data from everybody with geolocation to create these beautiful Maps

1031
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:09,695
Maybe they put that out as a marketing

1032
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:10,719
Effort

1033
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:14,559
Primarily encouragement for their user base but also a marketing effort look at

1034
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:16,863
What people in Strawberry doing you could be them two

1035
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:19,935
So from that standpoint Maybe

1036
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:21,727
Be a part of the fault lies in

1037
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:25,567
Did you really need to use that to Market you could have just kept all that there and lived

1038
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:26,335
People share within the

1039
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:27,615
Community

1040
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:29,663
That just makes it a little little

1041
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:30,687
More difficult

1042
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:31,455
To start

1043
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:32,479
Creating a struct

1044
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:33,503
Competition cycle

1045
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:34,527
Okay

1046
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:37,343
I'm going to go he mentioned that this isn't just about

1047
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:38,111
People in the EU

1048
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:39,135
What did you mean by that

1049
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:41,439
Okay

1050
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:44,255
About Timothy you have these rights

1051
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:47,327
Your bone in your pinyin

1052
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:55,775
You need to have some connection with your opinion I thought you'd have some connection with your opinion but

1053
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:58,335
It's nothing to do with your citizenship States

1054
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:00,383
So let me give you an example

1055
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:02,431
You have

1056
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:04,479
Personal data

1057
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:08,319
If you are

1058
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:09,855
Continue

1059
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:13,695
You're not going to eat you but you're dating

1060
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:15,487
Handled by business database

1061
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:19,583
Or even not even you know your

1062
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:23,935
Kendall Electric

1063
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:26,495
Got the business that makes the decision

1064
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:27,519
How you doing

1065
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:30,079
Should be collected handle manipulative

1066
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:33,663
Is based in European Union without using too much

1067
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:35,199
Jogging butt

1068
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:38,015
Or the best

1069
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:40,319
Netflix Adesa auto business.

1070
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:42,111
Make the decision about this

1071
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:43,391
Collected about how this

1072
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:46,975
Summer connect

1073
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:49,023
Then

1074
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:54,143
Territorial scope

1075
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:55,423
Because you can think of

1076
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:57,727
Outfit ideas without

1077
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:58,751
Source data

1078
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:00,031
India

1079
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:03,871
All the major corporation to go to operations all over the world

1080
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:05,663
And this is from

1081
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:07,711
Did the service call centers

1082
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:08,991
Alyssa

1083
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:11,551
But

1084
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:13,343
I thought you were

1085
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:15,391
Same time

1086
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:17,951
Companies report into major

1087
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:18,975
You Beast

1088
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:20,255
Nationals

1089
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:21,023
Lego

1090
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:22,047
They will

1091
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:23,327
Quotes

1092
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:25,631
Netflix

1093
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:30,751
The data wherever this data is in the world

1094
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:32,031
There is one connection

1095
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:34,079
Piety Street

1096
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:39,455
Wow so everybody who's got their based in France

1097
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:42,271
Those who have Whiting / Nokia gear

1098
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:43,807
Also based in the EU

1099
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:45,599
All of that data suddenly

1100
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:48,415
Wow

1101
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:56,607
See how that works

1102
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:59,423
Let's talk about the implications for innovation

1103
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:02,239
And we touched on this a little bit a lot of

1104
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:06,079
Google's efforts when it comes to computer vision in Facebook's efforts there

1105
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:08,639
Have been because they've been using

1106
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:09,663
Photographs

1107
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:12,735
You know they created this amazing image database

1108
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:14,271
Of crowdsourced

1109
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:16,575
Photos from us their users

1110
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:21,183
In some cases I don't know if people know what they're going to do with

1111
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:23,743
Potato sets one thing but the second is

1112
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:30,399
Some of these services are incredibly handy and I don't know what it means I mean we profile what a

1113
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:33,727
The point of teaching a computer how to see is profiling in a lot of

1114
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:37,055
