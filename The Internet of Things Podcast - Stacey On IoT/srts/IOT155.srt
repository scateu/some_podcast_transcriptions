00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:45,312
We got some funny stories from Kevin

16
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:47,360
Any creepy conclusion to this segment of

17
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:48,896
But then

18
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:52,224
We light it up with our guests Toby meet up from bear

19
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,808
Who's going to be talking about iot and agriculture

20
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:58,880
Put lighter and how it relates to insect

21
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:02,720
And we'll have a message from our sponsor Samsung artik

22
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:04,256
Add how it secures

23
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:06,304
The internet of things so

24
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,632
Let's kick this off with the message from another one of our sponsors

Shamanism

38
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,368
Oh goodie

39
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,416
Let's kick it off with

40
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:06,208
Qualcomm and broadcom

41
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,488
The deal

42
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:08,256
Is

43
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,280
Dead

44
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:13,120
It's done the deal is done but not in the way people expect

45
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:13,888
Give it to me

46
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:16,704
So Kevin and I have actually been going back and forth

47
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,520
Before we record the show actually talked about it this week

48
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:20,288
I know

49
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:27,456
So we held off we talked about it when it first was announced back in November of last year

50
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:32,576
Because this was a huge consolidation of chipmaker's especially related to the

51
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:35,648
Broadcom makes the chip

52
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:36,928
In the Raspberry Pi

53
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,976
WiFi chips

54
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:40,512
Yes they also have networking

55
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:41,280
Capability

56
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,304
He's a swell but

57
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,584
Our purposes

58
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,376
Broadcom iot

59
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,680
Qualcomm however has been getting

60
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:48,704
Into

61
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:53,824
The iot and most of its chips because they were focused on mobile for so long and

62
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,360
Did so well there

63
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:57,152
A lot of its ships have just been

64
00:02:57,408 --> 00:03:02,528
Popped into iot devices are actually working really hard to make things like

65
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,832
Embedded module of snapdragon

66
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:07,136
The Snapdragon 820 that we talked about

67
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,416
I think a few weeks back

68
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,464
This deal with

69
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,232
Consolidated

70
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,256
A significant amount

71
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,024
So

72
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,096
I'm actually glad it didn't happen because broadcom is

73
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:20,704
Private Equity play they are just mooching together lots and lots of Chip companies in

74
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,240
Frankly

75
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:24,032
I don't think

76
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:26,336
Did they have the focus on innovation

77
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,616
Qualcomm has had

78
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,384
Forever

79
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,456
Broadcom used to have big focus on integration but

80
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,480
That is

81
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:33,504
Subsequently

82
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:40,672
Died the most of their I don't want synchros but I use it for lack of a better word has come from Acquisitions and

83
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:44,000
Just getting into different markets as opposed to developing

84
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,280
Existing markets

85
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:49,888
Such as IRT in Solana that just agree that electing qualcomm's no more innovative

86
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:51,168
Their mobile chips

87
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:55,776
I can prove that but those are too powerful to use too much battery for

88
00:03:56,032 --> 00:04:01,664
A lot of IRT type devices and sensors so they need to re innovate in that area which they're doing

89
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,480
The whole reason we didn't even say why the deal is off is

90
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,248
Because

91
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,648
The u.s. president has said they would raise security concerns to have a Chinese company with that typos

92
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,208
Power in this particular segment

93
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:15,488
Yes which is ironic

94
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:18,559
Because prior to the deal being announced back in November

95
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:22,399
I believe is the end of October that President Trump actually met

96
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:24,959
With he appeared on the podium next to

97
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:26,239
Broadcom CEO

98
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:29,311
Hock tan and talk about jobs growth

99
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,103
Trump broadcom in the Uso

100
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:32,383
I'm sure

101
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:37,759
Right because this deal for cording to broadcom just you would have brought more jobs and because

102
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:41,087
And this is happening anyway broadcom is going to re

103
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:42,111
Established

104
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:44,671
Headquarters in the US which it had done about

105
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:47,231
Three two or three years ago and moved overseas

106
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,279
So it meanwhile

107
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:51,839
We should just introduced this meanwhile

108
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:52,863
Qualcomm

109
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,167
He's still trying to buy nxp

110
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,007
Major semiconductor

111
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:04,127
To get more it be more Automotive capabilities and that microcontroller

112
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:06,175
Welcome is current

113
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:15,135
Yeah there's an XPS billion NFC chips as well which I would use the most mobile devices use NX

114
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,671
P4 NFC

115
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:17,951
Yes

116
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,743
Right

117
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:21,791
If that weren't crazy enough

118
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:33,567
Broadcom deal where to start looking serious and tell him I come in with a

119
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,591
It's owned by iota

120
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:38,687
Which then begs the question of now that this is done

121
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:40,223
What happens

122
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,527
Intel is it content

123
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:44,575
Just sit there and say you know what we're good

124
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,623
We don't need any mobile chips

125
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,391
Because we're

126
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,439
I don't even know

127
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:54,815
Cuz we had those with exhale and we sold them off right before mobile phones came out

128
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:56,607
Yeah

129
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:57,887
So

130
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:58,655
This deal

131
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:00,447
The broadcom Qualcomm deal

132
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:01,983
Not happening

133
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,263
Xvideo

134
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,287
Who knows

135
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,055
Intel

136
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,335
Also who knows

137
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,639
So we'll leave it at that and

138
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:09,919
Yeah

139
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:15,551
I would also talk about anymore they store debate over should we talk about

140
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:16,575
Yes

141
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,599
No more debate

142
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,623
Okay

143
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:21,183
So moving right along to

144
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:23,743
Oh this is a really fun story you guys

145
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:24,511
Except

146
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:25,535
Scary story

147
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,071
I shouldn't I shouldn't set you up

148
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,095
Like that

149
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:28,863
To worry

150
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:31,167
It's so scarier than we talked about before

151
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:31,935
It's true

152
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:35,519
All right I was reading in ABA Journal

153
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,567
Which is a business law publication

154
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:39,103
The panel occurred last week

155
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,639
And it was basically

156
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,663
It was called

157
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:44,223
Madam is this evidence

158
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,271
Savannah News madam

159
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:47,807
Mystery

160
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:51,647
Basically these guys talked about law cases

161
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:55,231
Where Internet of Things devices such as a Fitbit

162
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:57,023
Vitamin A and

163
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:59,839
Other things other connected devices were used

164
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:05,727
To Arsenal's personal devices insurance

165
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,519
Device in someone's car

166
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,055
It was used in

167
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,335
A murder trial

168
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:15,199
And this is a murder trial in Wisconsin the victim was a woman named Nicole vanderheyden

169
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:18,271
And her boyfriend was a suspect but

170
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:21,087
They looked at his Fitbit data and they decided that he didn't do it

171
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:22,623
However

172
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:25,183
They found this other guy who apparently

173
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:28,511
Was suspicious sending those data from his Google Dashboard

174
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:31,839
It placed him at relevant locations

175
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:32,863
Around her death

176
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:36,191
And they also looked at his search history which is not

177
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,727
New and

178
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:41,311
The woman who is murdered actually had snapshot which is

179
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,847
Connected car devices

180
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,383
Progressive Insurance

181
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,407
And

182
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,687
They use that to

183
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:48,735
Please her whereabouts prior to the murder

184
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:49,503
So

185
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,807
The attorneys noted that this was not

186
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:52,575
Direct

187
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:54,367
Cooperative

188
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,135
In

189
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:57,951
Yeah but it's still a little scary so

190
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:02,815
Yeah it is scary. I will talk a bit later about some probative evidence that I gathered

191
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,607
For an issue at my house

192
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,375
But

193
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:11,007
You know we talked about how these types of devices that data goes into the cloud the

194
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,031
Companies

195
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:17,663
Yeah that the Privacy policies but they're going to comply with local laws and and subpoenas and so on and so forth and

196
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:23,807
I don't think it's going to stop people from wearing smart watches fitbit's talk into their Echoes and so on

197
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:28,159
But we need to be aware we is as consumers need to be aware that

198
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:33,535
Even if you're not cortical giving up your privacy with these devices it still can be used against you

199
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:37,887
Yes and he suggested that lawyers actually asked

200
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:43,775
Consumers what iot devices they have when talking to them so they can understand the possibility of

201
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:46,847
Evidence basically what could you come out against you

202
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:50,431
And they also said that this might lead to a new class of

203
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,711
Expert Witnesses

204
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:57,855
Where people can be disputing like how accurate is the Fitbit data I don't know which that could be fun as well

205
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:04,255
That's a someone I don't plan on committing inverter anytime soon

206
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,791
Whatever

207
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,583
Let's be clear

208
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,751
But it is a little disconcerting because as a journalist I'm not doing anything

209
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,055
Controversial now but what if I

210
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,335
Decided to get into some

211
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:22,687
Controversial I think my iot devices might be the first things out the window in that case

212
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:26,015
Keep this in mind privacy fans

213
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:31,391
We got a new type of edge Computing out there cloudflare which is a security company

214
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:34,719
They help protect against DDOS attacks that was there

215
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:35,487
Original

216
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,255
Incarnation

217
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:39,583
Now because they have such a massive network of

218
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,351
Edge

219
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:46,751
They call it Edge devices Edge servers there really more like Edge in the sense of a CDN being an edge they're not

220
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:47,775
The edge

221
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:48,543
Of

222
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:53,663
Like a little tiny nose and sensors

223
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,711
But they're actually offering

224
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:56,735
Shooting

225
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,271
At their Edge

226
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,295
Which

227
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:03,391
Pretty compelling it'll be deployed at there at just called cloud

228
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,415
Workers in

229
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:08,511
I bring this up mostly because it's a cool offering but

230
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:13,119
It really drives home the point that not everything is going to happen in the

231
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,935
Cloud when it comes to the Internet of Things

232
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:16,959
It can't

233
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:18,495
We talked about this a lot

234
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,775
But it's worth bringing up

235
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:20,799
One more time

236
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,847
And this is also

237
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:27,199
Very similar to what the telcos are trying to offer with their Edge computing

238
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:29,503
Efforts which is at the edge of the telconet

239
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:33,087
So you can kind of look at those as parallels

240
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:33,855
And

241
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,135
You know I would

242
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:40,255
This is kind of interesting to me if I were a true developer I'm a newbie developer but

243
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,791
I mean you

244
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:46,143
Mention CDN is just to further explain example like if you watching Netflix

245
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,495
You're not watching it from Netflix as main servers they've got servers all over

246
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,519
The world

247
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:54,847
That have the content so you're going to the closest server

248
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:57,151
What cloudflare is doing is they're putting

249
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:02,015
JavaScript processing at the edge kind of like Netflix does with its content

250
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:05,343
So if I'm developing an iot device

251
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:07,903
I can get to the closest Cloud Player

252
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:10,207
Server to process things

253
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:13,791
In a process sensory information in return a result or making action happen

254
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:16,351
And they claim you know that no latency is like

255
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:19,167
Practically not zero but pretty darn close it's much quicker

256
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:24,799
You don't have the processing on the device you don't have the processing at a centralized cloud storage place

257
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:28,639
But it's all over the place it's kind of interesting from a developer standpoint

258
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,407
I agree

259
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:33,247
It does look to be some smaller developers are complaining about the prices

260
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,295
Because there's a $5

261
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:38,623
Covers your first 10 million requests and its / domain

262
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,415
So I can see

263
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,719
Okay if you're going to if you're going to have

264
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:45,023
A massive user base

265
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,095
And devices that are doing something all the time with data I

266
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:50,911
Get that but it was I thought it was actually pretty cheap

267
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:54,495
I think some developed if you have multiple domains this could get

268
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,263
Crazy fast

269
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,287
Yeah

270
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,823
So I think that

271
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,103
That's the issue however

272
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,151
It's awesome

273
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:04,479
Earth

274
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,527
Let's move to the home for a little bit

275
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,295
Because

276
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:09,855
Google Assistant routines are now

277
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:17,023
They are live in the US and you may not see them yet I actually do not have an older version of routines in my Google

278
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:22,911
Just an app from what I've seen if you don't have it yet you can go to a Google support page that we are linking to in the show notes

279
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:28,799
I'm a little disappointed because it takes a lot of customization and flexibility out of it

280
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,591
The routines are really

281
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:36,223
Preset 6 different options such as good morning goodnight and so on and so forth

282
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,759
When you configure these in your app

283
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:41,343
You have a set of checkboxes that you can choose from

284
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,623
Siri it's not like you can

285
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,415
Customize completely to your

286
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:46,719
Needs I don't know I haven't used it yet cuz I don't

287
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:53,119
Haven't yet but I'm a little disappointed by that but you raise a good point Stacy or just here for the show

288
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:56,959
The reason for this

289
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:57,983
I mean

290
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,007
One of the big

291
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:01,311
Complaints we've always had about

292
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:05,151
Programming your smartphone is oh my god it feels like programming your smart home

293
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:08,735
Checking off boxes is far easier than saying

294
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:12,575
Okay when this happens let what should my good night routine be

295
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,367
Is someone suggest things for

296
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,647
It's a lot

297
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,951
True very true

298
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:19,231
Now I don't have it

299
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:19,999
Either

300
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:24,351
And I will say if you want to do my suggestion to Kevin was if you want to do

301
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,887
Something super custom

302
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:29,215
Go with shortcuts which is the Google option where you

303
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:31,519
You say what you want to say and then you

304
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:32,799
Just tell it what you

305
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:33,823
Wanted to do

306
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,615
The downside there is

307
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:37,919
I have shortcuts that have never run it will never run

308
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:38,943
Because they don't work

309
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,735
Google doesn't actually tell you

310
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,271
What does work about them

311
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,575
Fixing them is

312
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:52,255
Yeah well and hopefully they'll develop this further expand it no Google Iowa is coming up in May

313
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:54,047
I really do expect to see a lot of

314
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:58,143
New information features and functionalities on the IRT side from Google

315
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,191
I'm going to hope so because

316
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,215
Men Maybe

317
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:03,007
Maybe we'll get boring Google things

318
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,079
All right

319
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:12,735
Let's do some quick news events fitness app Strava has decided that maybe it shouldn't

320
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,015
Joe Whitesell

321
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:14,783
How much data

322
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,575
You guys might remember

323
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:18,879
Couple months ago

324
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,439
Strava did is heatmap in

325
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:27,327
Suddenly everyone realize that military bases in other clandestine operations or kind of obvious

326
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:32,703
The areas where there weren't a lot of Strava users and

327
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,727
Yuka's in

328
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:36,031
Third world countries in the Middle East in

329
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:38,079
Suddenly you could see o

330
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,871
Here's a couple Strava users

331
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:40,895
Going right here

332
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:41,663
End

333
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,431
That was no good

334
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,455
So

335
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:45,503
Now they have a new version of the heat map

336
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:50,623
And in the bars access to street-level details to anyone except registered Strava users

337
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:53,183
Right and if you set your

338
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:55,231
You can do this in the app if you set your mapping to

339
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:55,999
The private

340
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:58,047
What they'll do is they're going to wipe those

341
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:58,815
Private

342
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,863
The private data every 30 days

343
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:04,703
So it won't be a long-term history of this type of information

344
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:09,823
Yes and Roads and trails with little activity will not show up on the revised map until several

345
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,871
Current users upload workouts in that area

346
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,407
So

347
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,175
Pretty good

348
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,199
And

349
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,223
It's a step

350
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:17,503
Latest Apple series

351
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,527
We'll see what happens

352
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:22,367
And you know in the meantime I think the military kind of

353
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,903
Came to a wake up call

354
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:25,951
Maybe we should check with RP

355
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:26,719
People are using

356
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:33,375
That would be a shame and very ironic if we got better privacy thanks to

357
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,143
The military

358
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,423
For iot device

359
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,007
Alright other news

360
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,543
Samsung SmartThings

361
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:41,823
Hoof

362
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,711
And well I think it was only in North America so this was not worldwide

363
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:53,087
But it was earlier this week around 2 p.m. eastern time and it lasted

364
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,879
Depends on who you ask

365
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:57,695
Sun and obviously different users in different areas might have

366
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,719
Experience the

367
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:01,023
Issuing While others did not as it was being fixed

368
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:04,863
But to me it looks like the last about 18ich hours and

369
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:11,263
I mean if this happens if I get it there outages for every cloud Base Service

370
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,543
Known to man

371
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,359
People were complaining about Samsung's transparency

372
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:17,663
The other issue this raises is

373
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:23,295
You know with everything being done not everything but a lot of things being done in the cloud for iot

374
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,599
That's a chokepoint that's a problem and

375
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:27,391
SmartThings outside some local

376
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:30,207
Things that can run Onyx Hub as does wink

377
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,743
But it really

378
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,023
Priests of the question

379
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,607
To me of you do we need hugs and why I think we do

380
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:40,191
And I made a case for Google to actually make its own Hub earlier in the week

381
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:42,239
I got some interesting responses from that

382
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:44,799
Some people said hubs are just hacks because

383
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:48,127
That you know people are using standards but I don't I don't agree with that at

384
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,663
Hubs will help

385
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:53,247
Bridge different radio protocols for examples that are using standard

386
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:57,599
I hope so also have the processing power and stores to actually

387
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:58,623
Store your

388
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,391
Automation

389
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:04,767
Things like that and when I said that's the cloud for that and I said

390
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,303
So well that works so

391
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,095
I think we still need hubs

392
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:11,423
I don't know what you think Stacy but I think is a good example of why

393
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:14,239
I think it's ironic that you of all people

394
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,519
To hate hugs

395
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:16,287
In bridges

396
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,311
Baidu

397
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,591
Blackmore hubs

398
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:20,895
But no I only want one

399
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,967
That's the thing I don't want multiple hubs

400
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:27,551
I'm happy with what I've got a wink of I'm happy with having one

401
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:30,111
1 is fine as long as it works with all my devices

402
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:31,391
But

403
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:35,231
To get rid of it completely there are ways to do that but it's a challenge

404
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:39,839
I am I in the conversations I have with people on this is all on Twitter and Google Plus I said

405
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,911
So you want every device available talk to every device

406
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:45,983
How does one device know what devices I have in the house

407
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,263
Does every developer

408
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:53,151
How to know about all these other devices that are on the market because once I add one has to talk to that one

409
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,687
So that's a challenge

410
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:56,735
I think a hub can do the work

411
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:01,087
I agree I think the challenge we've come up with is

412
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:02,879
We never built

413
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:04,415
Standards for the internet

414
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:09,791
We have yet to do it everyone instead decided to build their own standard

415
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:14,911
And so what we've got are these little silos of information works with programs and

416
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:18,239
We will be there for probably all of time is my feeling

417
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:20,031
I don't know baby I'm just

418
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:22,591
Pessimistic so we will need a hug

419
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,871
Given the way the world

420
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:24,895
His evolved

421
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:25,919
Didn't have to evolve

422
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:27,455
Chopra

423
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:33,855
Here we are all right should we talk about all the new toys out on the market yeah let's do that I'll take the first one

424
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:36,415
Because I got me excited there's a new Raspberry Pi

425
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,183
Pi

426
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:40,255
The Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+

427
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:44,095
It is on sale for $35 which of the same price as the old

428
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:44,863
Raspberry Pi

429
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:45,887
3B

430
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:52,031
What's new here is Nevada dual band wireless so you have a tour to 11 AC

431
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:56,127
Both in 2.4 and 5 gigahertz you got Bluetooth 4.2

432
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:56,895
You've got

433
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:58,175
Gigabit Ethernet

434
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:03,039
Now and also if you add on a module I don't want the prices going to be

435
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:05,855
You will get power over ethernet support

436
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:07,391
What you want to ask about a second

437
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:10,207
What else do they have I think those are the main things

438
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,999
So I guess I'll just ask her right now

439
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:18,143
Power-over-ethernet why should people be excited over that way this Raspberry Pi

440
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:19,423
Pro community

441
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,727
Power-over-ethernet is something

442
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:25,055
That Pro installers of consumer electronics

443
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,591
Usually ask for

444
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:28,639
Because it's more reliable

445
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:31,711
Get your doorbell cam it's faster

446
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,479
Until

447
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:33,503
Cameras

448
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:36,831
Doorbell cams those are kind of the things that end up going on

449
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:39,647
Also alarm type systems

450
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:41,951
So I would think that if you were

451
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:43,743
Interested in building

452
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:45,279
Something custom

453
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:51,167
That has that kind of reliability this would be an awesome thing for you so I think it's actually a really interesting

454
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:51,935
Option for

455
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,215
People who are interested but smart

456
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,007
I agree

457
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,799
So that is the new

458
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:00,895
Which by the way we are recording this on Wednesday which is Pi Day

459
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:03,199
Yes it is Happy Pi Day

460
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,527
Next item

461
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:08,063
Is actually one of our

462
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,087
Listeners

463
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:11,647
Brought this to my attention it is the Abode

464
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:12,927
Iota

465
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:15,231
And this is a

466
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:17,023
I'm just going to call it a canary like device that

467
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,559
Is built for the Abode

468
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:22,143
System so upload is a security system

469
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:24,447
I've had several people

470
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:27,007
Talk to me about this and they love their boat systems

471
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:31,615
It's about a $300 initial install it's a Gateway and sensors and all this other

472
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:33,919
It's super easy to use

473
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:35,199
What they've done now

474
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:36,479
Is they've created a

475
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,503
Camera device

476
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:41,087
With sensors that you just plug in and it acts as a gateway

477
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:43,647
You can use it with your existing about stuff

478
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:46,463
But I think this is actually to get to the

479
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:51,327
The rental market the layperson who's like

480
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,863
Checking out something fancier

481
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:55,935
Involved so this is like hey there's a camera

482
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:56,959
Funk it down

483
00:20:57,471 --> 00:21:00,287
If you want to get fancy or you can start buying some sensors

484
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:03,103
Works with zigbee Z-Wave

485
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:03,871
And

486
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:05,407
I'm actually kind of excited

487
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:07,455
It's $329 which is Kai

488
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,015
Anniversary

489
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:11,295
It's not out yet

490
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,831
It will ship sometime

491
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:14,879
They say the first quarter of 2018

492
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:16,159
No matches

493
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:22,048
So

494
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:26,400
Yeah I just thought this was a really interesting device I may actually try to

495
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:27,424
Pick one up to play with

496
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:31,264
I wanted to try out the original Abode security

497
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,080
Based on all the positive feedback that I have gotten about it

498
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:35,872
But I never did

499
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,176
Security systems are not sending a

500
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,992
I'm probably boring these

501
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:41,760
Chunk it down

502
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:42,528
Forget about it

503
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:50,208
It's some folks might be excited about this as opposed to the canary because this has a MicroSD card slot as well.

504
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:51,232
Presumably

505
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:55,072
Not everything has to go to the cloud or could be at least retrieve and stored

506
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:56,352
Locally so

507
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:58,400
That may be of interest to folks

508
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,424
Yes

509
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:00,448
All right

510
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:04,544
There's also a brand new light switch out

511
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,312
Switch

512
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:06,848
It has

513
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:09,152
A motion sensor and Madame a

514
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:11,200
You guys are probably familiar with ecobee

515
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:11,968
Cuz

516
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:12,992
Holy cow

517
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,528
It makes a thermostat

518
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,552
Including one

519
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:17,600
Now it's just moving into light switch

520
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:19,136
Send I have a theory is

521
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:20,672
Would you like

522
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:22,464
I would I would love to hear

523
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:23,744
Okay

524
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:28,608
Light switches are ubiquitous in your room if you want to get good presence detection

525
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:30,912
Having a light switch with a motion sensor

526
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:31,936
And

527
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:32,960
T-shirt matamata

528
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:35,264
Great is a great way to go about

529
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,288
Because

530
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:38,336
Again light switches every room

531
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,616
They have power

532
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:44,736
They are in a compact form factor so if you really hate the idea

533
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:45,504
You don't have a nose

534
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:47,040
Hockey pucks everywhere

535
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,320
You don't have to

536
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,088
Just be like

537
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:54,208
I am getting one to review so I'll let you know things like hay

538
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,744
Does it really work

539
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,792
Something in your wall and talking to it

540
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:59,328
And getting response

541
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,096
Dancer

542
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:01,376
May surprise us

543
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,400
So

544
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:08,032
I thought this was interesting ecobee did just recently get 61 million dollars in funding including

545
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:09,056
More from the

546
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:10,848
Man of a fund

547
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:11,872
So

548
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:12,896
This makes a lot of

549
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:18,272
Yeah interesting although matinee has built-in as one would expect since they built into the

550
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:20,064
Tend to their last thermostat

551
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,392
Just like the ecobees recent visit work with homekit

552
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:26,464
Also works with Google Assistant SmartThings and

553
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,232
EFT

554
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:32,864
So it's don't feel like it's an Amazon only kind of thing that you could

555
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,400
Use this if your

556
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:36,448
Not using Echoes for example

557
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:38,496
Yes now it is $99

558
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:40,288
Switch has a lot to pay for a light

559
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:47,200
Well you're getting a light switch getting motion sensor that can automatically activate that light and you're also getting

560
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:48,736
If it's important

561
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:50,272
And you can have that in every room

562
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:52,320
And this fact when I saw this

563
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,856
It reminded me

564
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:55,648
Again to harp on this

565
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,720
When is NVIDIA coming out with their little

566
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:05,120
Google Assistant microphone and speakers that you just supposed to plug in every room of your house that was to see Elsa's ago

567
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:07,168
14 months ago

568
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:08,192
Another

569
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:12,032
Cuz that's what this does is that in the speaker and the microphone to every room

570
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,824
Maybe they're busy

571
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,848
Making chips

572
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:17,664
It's for cryptocurrency mining I don't know

573
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,456
But that's probably more profitable

574
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:21,248
All of the market sound but still

575
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:26,880
I'm very upset that there's been no news on that but so this appeals to me for the same reasons actually and I'm not a light switch

576
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:28,672
Guy on my balls

577
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:30,208
But I am interested

578
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:32,256
Maybe I should send a

579
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:35,840
I should also mention that it does.

580
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,656
And humidity relief

581
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:42,240
There are some

582
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:43,776
Constraints to this one

583
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:45,056
It will not work

584
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:48,384
The 3 way switches which means wherever you have

585
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,408
Multiple switches that

586
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:50,176
Control

587
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:53,504
One light will also need a neutral wire

588
00:24:56,832 --> 00:25:02,976
Shop and it works with LED and CFL lights and also

589
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:03,744
At work with that

590
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:06,048
And then it works with incandescent light

591
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:08,608
There you go

592
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:09,376
It doesn't

593
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:11,424
I'm looking to see if it's a dimmer

594
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:15,264
Because it works with CFLs I wonder

595
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:20,896
Yeah I don't see that it's it doesn't say that it's a dimmer I just see on off so it may not be a dimmer

596
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:22,944
And if that's the case

597
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,968
That may or may not

598
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:27,296
Right

599
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:30,112
And we have this week

600
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,136
It is

601
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:32,416
The rachio

602
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:34,208
3rd generation

603
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:34,976
Sprinkler

604
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:38,048
And rachio smart Sprinkler Company

605
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:40,608
You actually install this at your

606
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,656
Where your sprinkler brains live

607
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:47,008
And it controls things and you can control stuff from your phone

608
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,592
They had talked about adding soil moisture sensors

609
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:53,920
That process is still incredibly complicated so I

610
00:25:55,968 --> 00:26:00,832
Now they have the rachio 3 smart sprinkler controller and rachio 3 wireless flow meter

611
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:02,112
And fees

612
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:04,672
Will sell for 249

613
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:07,488
The irrigation of things is not cheap

614
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,864
Nowell the actually I think the second generation was about that much

615
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:17,472
Much my father-in-law actually installed one and has it and he loves it

616
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:19,264
He thinks it's just fantastic

617
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:20,800
AC is not

618
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:23,360
He is not perhaps the most sophisticated smart

619
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:24,384
We did

620
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:26,688
Tie it to a Nifty integration for

621
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:28,224
For weather but that was about it

622
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,760
And he was just kind of

623
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,552
I think I made it

624
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:37,440
Now the insulation of supposedly easier there's 5 gigahertz wireless

625
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,720
Compatibility and

626
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:44,096
A new long-range radio to connect with the first-ever residential wireless flow meter

627
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:47,680
So basically this tells you how much water is being

628
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:51,008
Used and it will detect when leaks happen

629
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:52,544
And it shuts down your water supply

630
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:56,640
This is really important cuz sprinkler leaks happen all the darn time

631
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:57,920
And you don't know about it

632
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:01,760
And you're just like unless you get a swampy patch on your ground to your like

633
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,576
So this is really important

634
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:09,952
Is fits within roggio's whole we want to save the Earth by using less water effort

635
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:10,720
And

636
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:12,000
Also I mean

637
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:14,816
I helped them install it the second generation

638
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:15,840
It was easy

639
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:20,192
The biggest challenge actually for us was getting wifi to the garage

640
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:23,264
And once that was taken care of we were all good

641
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,592
Pre-order

642
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,640
And like I said it was 249

643
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:29,408
So

644
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:31,200
249 99

645
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:32,480
Hookah

646
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:35,808
That is all the new toys out this week

647
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,600
Well it may not be all of them

648
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:38,880
Those are the ones we saw

649
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:39,904
And got excited

650
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:43,744
Yeah one of my old toys actually help me out big-time this week

651
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:45,536
Tell me more Kevin

652
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:49,888
So I won't get into all the details but essentially we woke up

653
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,424
Late last week

654
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:56,800
I guess was Friday and my wife went to her car which is parked on the street and our townhouses complex

655
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:58,336
Inside big tent

656
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:00,128
And scrape in her vehicle

657
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:05,504
And lots of Parts all over the ground not from our car but obviously from another car

658
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,832
And nobody left a note or anything but somebody hit the car

659
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:15,232
So I went back and scoured all of my Nest cam footage cuz I have an indoor Nest cam

660
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:18,304
Winking Outdoors since we're not allowed to have outdoor cameras

661
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:19,840
And sure enough

662
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:23,424
At 6:11 p.m. the night before

663
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,472
We saw a neighbor pull out of their driveway Quest

664
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:29,056
Street and back into our car so I got the evidence

665
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:33,920
I work with the local authorities and talked to the neighbor who isn't really

666
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:34,944
Sure that she

667
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:35,968
AR car

668
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:38,016
She thinks somebody hit her car but

669
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:38,784
Saturday

670
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:40,064
Whatever hot

671
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,368
No big deal she doesn't have video and I do so

672
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:48,768
Yeah we're using that Nest video footage with the police and also our insurance agency so big help right there

673
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:50,560
Well there you go and

674
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:54,656
Clear desk purchase has

675
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:59,520
If they claim is covered by their insurance company

676
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:00,288
And then some

677
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:03,104
Okay and Kevin

678
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:07,712
Kevin took a trip on the dark side we were talking about it this morning

679
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:10,784
About this the story I'm sure many of you saw it

680
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,088
But it was MIT technology review

681
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:13,856
Road about

682
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,904
Is a y combinator startup

683
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,720
Can you upload your

684
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:20,256
Yourself

685
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:23,328
But it is 100% fatal and

686
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:29,472
This is Freaky Deaky what the heck does this have to do with the internet of things other than

687
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:32,032
You're right other than its

688
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:34,336
Just to clarify the startup

689
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:39,712
Is preserving brains for the moment that's what they're going to do with the hopes of actually

690
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:42,016
Being able to upload all of them

691
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:44,320
All of you in the future

692
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,856
And the reason they

693
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:48,928
This is fatal is because they have to keep your brain Preserve

694
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:52,256
And alive so to speak so you kind of pretty much got to be dead

695
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:53,536
That's one

696
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,328
Whole freaking out about it but

697
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,632
Normally I wouldn't even brought this up

698
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:58,656
But

699
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:04,032
You said something pretty profound once before on the show how many times but in particular

700
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:08,896
You would said once your data is uploaded to the cloud or company etcetera

701
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:11,456
You don't control what they do with it

702
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:14,528
And I thought about that as it applies to this and if

703
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:19,648
Date this company actually does succeed and I'm not saying they will but what if they did

704
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:23,232
My entire brain data would be

705
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,768
In their hands

706
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:28,096
What would be done with it I got no control over cuz I'm already

707
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:28,864
Ted

708
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,400
And that's really scary

709
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:31,936
Yep

710
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:34,240
Alright so now none of us are going to sleep tonight

711
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:39,872
And I'm sorry

712
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:40,640
I lied to

713
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:42,432
Because we're actually going to end the note

714
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,456
On one of our

715
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:44,736
Iot

716
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:45,504
The star hotline

717
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,576
Instead of a hotline this week

718
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:50,112
Nobody called us

719
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:51,136
You guys

720
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:54,208
512-262-3742

721
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:55,488
You for overload us with

722
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:56,256
With your questions

723
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:57,024
However

724
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:58,816
We do get lots of email question

725
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:00,352
So we took one of those

726
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:04,960

00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:19,040
And this week's

732
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:19,808
Email

733
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:20,576
Not hot

734
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:24,160
Michael

735
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:24,928
Ask

736
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:31,584
What are the best books to read are other forms of information I can learn from for someone who is new to the world of iOS

737
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,608
Multi sensors

738
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:37,728
1 Starter book would be great but also a few follow-up resources that will take me from learning the basics

739
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,008
Like an introductory book

740
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:41,312
To having a good understanding would be

741
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:45,920
Depends on what you want to do I think

742
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:47,968
And I say that because if you

743
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:53,088
The center that you can purchase today that work with iot hubs and such

744
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:57,440
Are pretty easy to use pretty easy to install and so on so forth

745
00:31:57,952 --> 00:32:02,304
However do you want to learn how these things work and make them work yourself

746
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:04,096
I would do one of

747
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:06,912
Two things I know you got some recommendation Stacey but

748
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:10,240
I would get an Arduino kit and some sensors

749
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,008
Very simple

750
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:13,056
Sensors could even be buttons

751
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:15,616
And walk through some of the

752
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:17,920
Step by step instructions on how to make them work

753
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:18,944
Literally

754
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,552
Make magazine is a great resource and actually have a book it's a little dated

755
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:27,648
But they have a book from 2011 called getting started with the Internet of Things

756
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:33,024
And they will walk you through either using a pi or Arduino board and some sensors to

757
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:37,376
Literally make events trigger events and make things happen so that's that's

758
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:38,912
One thing I would look at

759
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:42,240
Do you have any other thoughts depending on how

760
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:44,288
How advanced you want to

761
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:47,616
Just to get a feel for this if you have sensors

762
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:53,248
I always agree this is actually what I do with my own daughter is I just take sensors and light bulbs

763
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,272
And I

764
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:56,320
Hook them up together via if

765
00:32:56,576 --> 00:33:00,160
Or via the SmartThings Hub gift is beneficial because it's it does

766
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:00,928
Does it cost money

767
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:03,232
We just show what happens when you trigger thing

768
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:04,768
Thanks right so that's

769
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:08,864
One option the other option is if you want to get a little fancier this actually works

770
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,656
4 kids and I'm not trying to insult you

771
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:13,472
I actually use it this way to is little bit

772
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:15,520
If you buy a little bit

773
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:16,800
Can you get

774
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:20,640
A lot of sense or so if the idea of an Arduino scares you and it should

775
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,968
Some people do get scared with arduinos

776
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:26,272
Start with a little bit skid and

777
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:27,552
You can do it meme

778
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:30,368
You can pick them thermostats with those things

779
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:33,952
They're very capable devices starter sets of devices absolutely

780
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:37,792
And the other resource I would offer to you is 8A fruits website

781
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:40,352
So it's a d a f r

782
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:41,376
Uit

783
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:45,728
And they have if you go into their learn section

784
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,544
You will see so many

785
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:52,128
Products and they're really what the lessons that they have

786
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:53,664
Explain what's happening

787
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,968
Explain how to do it and you can buy like

788
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:57,504
The kit to get started

789
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:59,296
So this is a great way

790
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:00,320
To just

791
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:01,856
Start playing with Hardware

792
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:02,880
If that's

793
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:03,648
What's interesting

794
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:05,184
So sensors is a huge cat

795
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,232
Like I don't know if he wants

796
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:12,352
Like Arduino level stuff or if he's just like hey I want to play with my life

797
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:17,984
So this should get you started I wish I wish there were like a book that was really compelling but

798
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,264
I so far haven't really

799
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,032
Found one

800
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:20,800
So

801
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:22,080
I would say

802
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:23,360
Start with those kind

803
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:24,896
Those are good resources to start

804
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:26,176
I agree

805
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:28,224
Okay and now

806
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,248
We shall

807
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:32,576
Hear message from our sponsor and then go to our

808
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:35,136
Guest this week's guest is Toby Mena

809
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:35,904
From

810
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,208
Bayer Ag and we're talkin about

811
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:41,024
Agriculture in The Internet of Things in

812
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,864
He's got some great startups that he talks about he talks about

813
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:48,704
Building a new business model for iot and he talks about using lighter

814
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:50,240
What attract insects

815
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:54,592
So you're going to want to stay tuned because it's pretty cool

816
00:34:54,848 --> 00:35:00,992
Everyone we're taking a break from The Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor sponsor is Samsung

817
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:05,088
Can I have John Jefferies head of iot marketing for Samsung artik

818
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:07,648
How to talk to us about how they handle security

819
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:10,208
Remind us of what Samsung artik does

820
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:10,976
To focus on

821
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:13,024
Samsung artik provides

822
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,560
Comprehensive security

823
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:15,584
From the edge

824
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,352
To the cloud

825
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:17,376
R modules

826
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:18,656
Numerous

827
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:20,960
Security and safety features built into them

828
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:25,824
And they are also tied to the SmartThings passed through mutual Authentication

829
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,616
Last week we talked about as much

830
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:32,736
Trustmark for iot devices

831
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,064
That idea comes from both the work that

832
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,600
Underwriters lab is doing

833
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:43,744
And what I saw at CES I noticed at CES this year many of the OT devices were sporting

834
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,816
Works with Alexa

835
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:49,632
Under boxes I think that consumers would benefit

836
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:53,984
By looking at the boxes if the devices that they're buying where infection cure

837
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,032
And one of the things you talked about was

838
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:57,824
Securing over the air update

839
00:35:58,336 --> 00:35:59,360
Why is this important

840
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:04,224
Well Stacy this is important to me because the very first iot devices I bought

841
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:07,040
I've thrown away because they were not upgradeable

842
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:07,808
Okay

843
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:08,576
And

844
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:10,112
With over the air updates

845
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:12,160
What do you need to do to make sure that there's

846
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:18,048
Daisy over there updates are more complicated than they sound soccer package itself needs to be created sign

847
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:19,584
Protected by the manufacturer

848
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,864
Send a message to be sent

849
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:24,448
Received in a secure Manner and once it's finally deliver to the device

850
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:26,752
The device itself needs to verify

851
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:29,056
That it was signed by an aesthetic

852
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,592
Creator of a software

853
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:32,128
The manufacturer that device

854
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:36,224
Let's say an OTF isn't secure what are the risks that that

855
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,784
Until what are several points of risk

856
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:39,552
Stacy

857
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:40,576
Even when the

858
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:42,112
Software packages in motion

859
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:45,952
If the implementation of SSL or TLS

860
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:49,536
Doesn't include for privacy ideas lesson 1.2

861
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:52,352
It's acceptable to eavesdropping it by man in Middle attack

862
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:57,216
So in addition to the concerns about authenticity and integrity of the software package

863
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:59,520
There's also risk of a downgrade attack

864
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:03,104
When older authenticated software update can be rolled back

865
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:07,968
Enabling vulnerable versions of Wi-Fi or Bluetooth protocols

866
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:08,736
That were

867
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:10,016
Officially sign

868
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:11,808
Yet are still vulnerable

869
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:13,344
At a fundamental level

870
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,416
Manufacturers should ensure the authenticity and integrity of

871
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:19,488
If there's no way to verify that there's no way of

872
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:20,256
Verifying

873
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:22,048
Sadness after you received

874
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:25,632
And just upgraded your new iot device to is in fact

875
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:26,400
Genuine

876
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:27,424
And created by the Minnesota

877
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:30,496
That all sounds great and a little scary so

878
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:34,592
If you want to learn more about what Samsung are takes doing on the security

879
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:35,360
Is it

00:37:55,840 --> 00:38:01,984
Everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast

885
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:07,104
Minna from Fair

886
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:08,896
What is arsenic

887
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:12,736
And we're talking about

888
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:17,088
Farmers

889
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:17,856

You drive me today

892
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,696
So let's just get this started

893
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:25,024
The Internet of Things

894
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:26,816
Agriculture

895
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:30,144
60 miles farmers of facing a lot of China

896
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,728

Visiting

899
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,432
So our ambition is

900
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:44,480
2 letters, perfect you know

901
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:45,248
Where would we

902
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,528
Growing My Wish

Without traveling Moss master

905
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:53,952
We have a couple gas in the show

906
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:54,720
Who are in the

907
00:38:57,536 --> 00:39:00,608
Increasing the efficiency of farms and helping make

908
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:01,632
Workers more productive

909
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,960
In from your point of view what needs to take place for that

910
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:08,288
Farming operations

911
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,080
Things happening

Really bring home

918
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:21,856
The complexity of

Good economic decisions

920
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:26,208
It is very much around

Lifting

922
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:30,560
Good decisions and making them available across field

923
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:35,168
Increasing labor machine efficiency

924
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:36,448
As well as other input

925
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,216

Here you guys are demonstrating so

928
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,360
Something you're working on with botched

929
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,920
Is computer vision identifier

930
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:47,712
And then sprays it

931
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,248
Little bit different

932
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,296

Existing equipped

941
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,896
Our technology so they can operate their existing equipped

942
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:19,200
That they can go with their existence

943
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:20,224
And

944
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,504
Safe input

945
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,272
At the same time

946
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,112
People to

947
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:27,648
You know stay with their existing equipment

948
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:30,208

950
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,768
We talked about

951
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:34,048
Some of the things

952
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,352
Doing with startups because you're not just doing

953
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:38,912
Weed management but you're working with a couple other

954
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:40,704
Projects

955
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:45,056
For example

956
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:48,384

00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:56,576
I think that's really cool stuff

963
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:57,600
And especially helpful

964
00:40:57,856 --> 00:41:00,416
Visit the field everyday

965
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:01,952
But there's really no

966
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:03,744
Which insects are there

967
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:04,512
If they are hung

968
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:06,304
And how many are there

969
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,840
My favorite part about this guy

970
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:09,120
Is how

971
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:10,400
Do you identify

972
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:11,680
Insects using lighter

973
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:14,752
We understood that

974
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:17,056
Love you to measure the wind

975
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:19,104
Frequency of individual insects

976
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:23,968
Turn out to be more strict than we expected because depending on what incited

977
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:26,528
Frequency is slightly changing

978
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,624

A lot of companies doing soil moisture is in the ground

999
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:11,327
Talk to me about why you guys

1000
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:14,143
With space instead

1001
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:16,447

What is the cost

1013
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:43,583
From my farm we did some experiment

Salt sense

1015
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:46,911

So all of this

1023
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:03,551
You get away with when using data

1024
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:05,855
