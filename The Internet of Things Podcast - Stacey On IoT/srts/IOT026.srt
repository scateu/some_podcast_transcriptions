00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:12,032
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast I have your hoes

2
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:14,592
And this is your co-host

3
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:15,616
Kevin tofel

4
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:16,896
And today

5
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:17,664
We have some

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,200
Sad news for

7
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:21,504
All the wink lovers out there which means

8
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:24,576
It's just me I'm the only one

9
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:26,624
Emma wink Fanboy all by myself

10
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:28,928
It's it's only you well the news

11
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,720
Tuesday morning

12
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:36,096
Quirky the company that owns wink filed for bankruptcy they file for chapter 11 bankruptcy

13
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:38,144
Which means they're trying to restructure

14
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:39,424
As part of that

15
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:43,776
Agreed to a bid from Flextronics

16
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:45,568
Which now goes by Flex

17
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,664
To be accepted flexes bid for 15 million

18
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,944
For the wink

19
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:52,992
Home automation subsidiary

20
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,272
So

21
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:55,296
You may be wondering

22
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:57,088
What does that mean for you

23
00:00:58,368 --> 00:01:01,696
Exactly wondering that what does that mean for me not the listeners are near me

24
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:04,256
What does it mean for me if I love my wink

25
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:06,304
The only one in the world who loves their wing

26
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:09,376
But you know I'm actually running a wink right now so

27
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:11,936
I I wonder what it means for me

28
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:12,704
Running away Inc

29
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:13,984
The answer is

30
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:14,752
For the neck

31
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:16,288
60 days or so

32
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,104
Your wink should still continue operating

33
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:21,920
What they're going to do as part of the bankruptcy process

34
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:22,688
Flex

35
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:26,016
Has made what is called the stalking horse bid so that means

36
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:26,784
That

37
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,552
Quirky

38
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:29,088
Likes flexes bid

39
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:29,856
The best

40
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:33,696
And if any other bidders come along that offer more money and appear to be

41
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:35,232
Better for the creditors

42
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:36,000
End

43
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:38,816
Winks business is an ongoing concern basically

44
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:45,216
The bankruptcy court in the trustees would say Hey you know Flex do you want offer more money otherwise we're to take this other company

45
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,568
I don't think that's going to happen they've been trying to sell wink for

46
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:50,336
4 months

47
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:56,224
Yeah it's it's a numbers problem written up the story when the news broke and

48
00:01:56,992 --> 00:02:00,064
It sounds like they were between fifty and a hundred billion dollars in debt

49
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,600
AR

50
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,624
Yeah

51
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,464
So Corky has between 50 and $100 in debt

52
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:11,328
They have between 10 and 50 million in assets when I spoke to Ben Kaufman

53
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:14,912
The CEO the he's now the former CEO of Corky

54
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,448
All the way back

55
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:17,472
July

56
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:20,032
He said that 40 had about 2 million

57
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:22,336
Recite 12 million dollars in cash left

58
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:25,408
So that's that's not a lot of

59
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:26,176
Cashland

60
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:32,576
No and according to the bankruptcy filing you had said Flextronics is the biggest predator

61
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:34,368
They're owed about almost

62
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,720
What's 19 million as it is so you know 15 million there just trying to

63
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:41,280
Recoup as much as I guess as possible and then

64
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,840
May they do if they get

65
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:45,120
The bid accepted

66
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:49,984
So they get the bid accepted their goal is probably to keep it going as

67
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,776
A legitimate business

68
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:52,800
So

69
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,080
Flextronics

70
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,872
It's actually made the wink hub

71
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:56,896
4

72
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:57,664
Cricket

73
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,688
So

74
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:00,224
It behooves them

75
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:03,040
Actually keep it operating for a couple reasons

76
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:07,648
One there's all these wink Hub still out there on the shelves in the relays

77
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:10,976
And then there's a whole ecosystem of devices and partner

78
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:12,512
It also

79
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:13,792
Are Flextronics

80
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:18,912
Text customers to be quite honest their contract manufacturer

81
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:19,936
They also

82
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:22,752
Work with startups through their lab 9 division

83
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,056
Building a lot of connected products

84
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:26,336
So

85
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:29,152
Having a big black eye in

86
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,688
In terms of wink failing and

87
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:31,712
These Partnerships

88
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:32,480
Integrations

89
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:33,760
Mine is probably not in there

90
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:37,088
Keep this going and maybe

91
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,160
Maybe turn the business around for Wink in terms of

92
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:42,720
Continuing to sell products Maybe

93
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,304
Can you sell the other Wing products that are on the shelves and

94
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,096
Recoup some of that money that would be great for the

95
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,888
Yeah well I mean that's

96
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:56,288
From a consumer standpoint of me and you might be might be able to get a deal on the wing Hardware in the near future

97
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:58,336
But you don't know what it's future is of course

98
00:03:58,848 --> 00:03:59,360
Right

99
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:02,176
And so I sat there and I emailed

100
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:04,224
I'm a wing spokesman and he

101
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,248
He said

102
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:08,576
Quote this does not impact how users experience wing

103
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,136
And they will continue to receive the same support

104
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,416
After the process

105
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,184
This is finally

106
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:17,536
So that implies that after the 60-day period for the bankruptcy

107
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:19,071
Proceedings is over

108
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:22,143
That Wing is going to continue as a going business

109
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:24,191
That's My Hope

110
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,215
I'm going to

111
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:31,359
I've also reached out to a bunch of the wink partners because wink has these Partnerships with Lutron

112
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:35,199
What's Philips with Amazon with ramberlyn with nest

113
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:38,271
All these companies that have these Integrations in

114
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:42,111
That's actually why I'm still using my wink is because it

115
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,391
It has these relationships

116
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:46,975
I depend on his part of my home automation scheme so

117
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:48,255
My Hope

118
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,071
Is that all these companies are like yes this is a

119
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:53,119
The setback but we love working with wink

120
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,399
Love it

121
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:59,007
Blah blah blah Kevin tofel is a fanboy we will continue to support Wii

122
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,823
So here's a question

123
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,871
Yes or no we don't take into detail

124
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:07,199
Have you talked to the SmartThings people about this

125
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:12,063
Not talk to anyone I have Ivory shout at this point to a lot of pee

126
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,343
Chia

127
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,367
Cluding smart

128
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,159
7

129
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:16,927
Secrets

130
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,975
I mean if I had my wish

131
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:20,255
Would be like some

132
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,535
Other established

133
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,583
Company that's already in the space

134
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,631
Kind of absorb it and continue it

135
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:28,959
Or some iot Consortium of companies say

136
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:31,775
We decided all together let's just work together and

137
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:36,127
On a platform Hammer build off of this I don't think that's going to happen that's high in the sky but

138
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,919
But smart things I could

139
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:41,247
CEO Samsung Maybe

140
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,783
So here's the irony

141
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:43,807
Irony alert

142
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:44,831
I know I'm like

143
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:47,647
When we say that there should be like a red flashing light

144
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,183
That would be awesome

145
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,767
Yeah my lights just flash dreads

146
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:53,535
There you go

147
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:57,887
So we were going to talk to Kevin and I were going to talk about this actually last week on our

148
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:59,679
Show who should buy wink

149
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,959
Because to me it's like this

150
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:04,287
Sad asset running around out there and I could very nervous about would happen

151
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:10,687
So I was going to go with Amazon because I had talked to sources who is said that Amazon had looked at when can the

152
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:13,247
Then backed off because of the security glitch way back in

153
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,783
And I thought

154
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,063
With

155
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,599
The integration with Alexa

156
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:23,231
I'm sorry everybody who's who trying to call you. Just went off I apologize

157
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:29,375
So with the integration with the Amazon Echo I thought that would be a really nice kind of software platform

158
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:32,447
It would bring a lot of really interesting functionality to Amazon

159
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:39,103
And I don't disagree with you but I don't know that Amazon wants to be that player in this market I think they're high

160
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,383
Happy being

161
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,223
An interface that connects then a gazillion different things

162
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,271
The week is kind of that's what we wants to

163
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:49,855
I absolutely princess switch

164
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,135
I mean it

165
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:53,183
The echo ADS-B

166
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:55,743
Voice functionality but I don't see a real big dipper

167
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:56,767
Is there really

168
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:57,791
Turn off

169
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:00,863
I don't want to disagree with you

170
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:07,263
But I'm going to subtly disagree with

171
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,031
You are

172
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:10,591
Another surprise to me

173
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:14,687
You obviously knew this but I did not get the third largest creditor for Corky

174
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:15,967
Is UPS

175
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:17,503
You know

176
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,063
I was looking at that you know I saw that would be

177
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,671
Why because do you remember again that security glitch back in May

178
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:30,303
What happened was they basically bricked all their devices with a upgrade

179
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,839
A certificate upgrade

180
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,631
So if your device was

181
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,399
Sprint

182
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,167
WinCo

183
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,191
Let you

184
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,471
Ship your device

185
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:42,591
Back to them on their dime and then shipped it back to you after they reset it

186
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:45,151
What was kind of funny is all

187
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,711
But I shouldn't say all you had to do was

188
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,783
Basically go to your router and reset the DNS

189
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,879
And then upgrade the device and then turn your DNS settings back

190
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,695
That is not something everybody knows how to do and totally understand

191
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:04,095
Yes but they did put up a website and let you in told you how to do it and it wasn't it wasn't terribly intimidate

192
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,911
As things go but

193
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:08,703
Apparently a lot of people took

194
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:09,727
Come up on that offer

195
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,799
And I think that's probably what that

196
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,335
That UPS bill is

197
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:16,895
1.3 million dollars who am I

198
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:17,919
If you know there's

199
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,711
I got a lot of brown trucks

200
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,759
Welder shipping also

201
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,039
Product

202
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:27,647
Yeah they're in that there's there's actually some of the other creditors in there

203
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,927
Where are shipping related

204
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:29,695
As well

205
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:30,719
Zodiac

206
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:32,511
DL Industrial

207
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,559
Oh I'm sorry Eastfield

208
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,327
Lighting

209
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,607
Is actually a

210
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:37,631
Asian

211
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:38,655
Shipper

212
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:45,311
So I thought having been Kauffman who is the CEO of quirky on there as a creditor

213
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:48,383
Is an unsecured creditor was really interesting as well

214
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,919
That seems very rare

215
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:53,759
Later on in the list is also a former president

216
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:54,527
Calf Corky

217
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:55,807
Who is listed

218
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:59,391
I hate to see it all kidding aside

219
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:05,023
The wing is actually works really well for me and I know other people have had different experiences I totally understand that

220
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:07,583
It's my Hub of choice right now

221
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,607
And I guess

222
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:15,263
Going out on a limb I mean if I was going to buy a house right now I guess I probably would not buy a wink Hub because the Futures on sir

223
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,567
So which one would I buy

224
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,383
I'm glad you asked

225
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,455
I am in the same boat

226
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,223
Because

227
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,015
There are things that I

228
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,575
What the wink Hub has offered me

229
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,879
Is Lutron support

230
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:33,183
Switch not a lot of other

231
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:33,951
Jobs offer

232
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:35,743
So

233
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:40,351
That has been kind of killer for me because SmartThings would be my automatic

234
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,143
I was put back to smart

235
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,471
Thanks so if you're like me and you have Lutron support

236
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,775
Dang it I love Lutron

237
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,847
Your your other options are going to be

238
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,383
The Staples connect

239
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,151
Hub

240
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:55,199
Which does have Lutron support

241
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:57,759
Or you can go with the honk

242
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,039
Support

243
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,575
If you're a big Apple user

244
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:04,927
What homekit support

245
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:06,463
You're going to

246
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:08,767
When does 60 days are up and we don't know what's

247
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:11,071
If we if everything goes to hell

248
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,119
Then you know you can see

249
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:13,887
But

250
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,167
If all else fails

251
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,447
Tomcat will have

252
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,471
Lutron set

253
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,263
Plus other devices

254
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,823
Or you can do Staples connect

255
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,359
And they have Lutron

256
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:24,383
Plus other device

257
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:26,687
Not exit the devices don't match up

258
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,223
Like device-to-device

259
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:30,271
Write the other option

260
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,575
Like Staples connect doesn't have

261
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:34,623
An Amazon Echo support

262
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:39,743
Is Amazon Echo is the most important item

263
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:42,303
SmartThings SmartThings is you're going

264
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,071
Have your back

265
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,351
And I

266
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:46,655
I've told the Lucian people I beg to them

267
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,447
How to get me a Lutron dongle

268
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,519
So we can just plug that into the back of SmartThings

269
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,079
I don't know if that's going to happen or not

270
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:57,919
Well we will have to say I'm already on the SmartThings Hub

271
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:01,247
Page 99 bucks I'm not buying anything right this second

272
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,015
But

273
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:04,831
I'm going to have to have a backup plan

274
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:07,903
And it's going to SmartThings as a good backup because

275
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,439
This is a good Segway

276
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:12,511
It the nest 2nd generation hub

277
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:16,607
Has Intelligence built into the Hub so not everything is cloud Reliant

278
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,911
And I know

279
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:21,727
Yeah because well we know why because

280
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:26,335
It was the cloud you lose your smart on basically and that is pretty much exactly what happened this week

281
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,359
Again

282
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,639
This time

283
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,919
Instead of Ness going down

284
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,967
Although I did hear that Nest may have

285
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,247
Have had some issues to

286
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,527
What happened was

287
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:35,807
Amazon

288
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:36,831
Web services

289
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:40,159
AWS

290
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:42,207
When is happens there people in the

291
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,231
Community Grill

292
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:49,631
What so many people use Amazon web services because it's so inexpensive

293
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,167
It is and it's

294
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:53,471
It's actually quite reliable

295
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:56,799
Except except for the Ashburn Virginia Data Center

296
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,335
That that thing I don't know what's

297
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,127
So

298
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,919
What is brought home to me

299
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,967
You probably were sitting there going up

300
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:04,991
Everything in the cloud

301
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:07,295
It's bad there was there was an override

302
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:08,831
I believe on CD

303
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:09,855
I'm sorry Kevin

304
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:11,903
Picking on your site that's okay

305
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,439
There is a gentleman who is

306
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,463
My Amazon

307
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:17,023
Echo went haywire it caused Mayhem

308
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:23,935
And the Mayhem I saw was that basically his dog woke up at 5 in the morning and you can turn on the

309
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:24,959
Light switches Echo

310
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,775
Yeah I mean okay to get used to a certain

311
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,567
Convenience factor in Holiday

312
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:34,175
I guess you could construed as Mayhem but no I was inconvenience that very night because

313
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:39,551
My echo will not play music or controlling my lights either so Ed Sheeran

314
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:40,831
Hit the light switch so

315
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,879
Mayhem it was not for me

316
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,159
We had the same issue

317
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,463
Mayhem was not the word I chose

318
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:51,071
I was like what the heck is happening was the extent of my

319
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,375
But since

320
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:56,703
Since mine is kind of sometimes not working I just assumed it was

321
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:58,751
Ghost in the machine kind of thing

322
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:07,199
Leslie Cloud Reliance for The Internet of Things it actually got me thinking about how many services actually run on Amazon

323
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:09,247
Because a lot of them do

324
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,527
And if not

325
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:12,575
The winged Cloud runs on Amazon

326
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:13,599
Obviously

327
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,391
The echo has Timberland sunny

328
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,159
Amazon

329
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,183
But a lot of

330
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,719
Even Cloud products like

331
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:21,279
Electric imp which provides the

332
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,607
Connectivity + cloud services for things like

333
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:27,679
The rachio sprinkler head they actually run

334
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,959
On Amazon

335
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:31,519
They now offer an on-premise device but

336
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:35,103
Ala which is kind of it more of an industrial

337
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:37,919
Cloud provider also runs on Amazon

338
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,199
And the list goes on

339
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:43,551
I used to I used to track which once ran on Amazon and which didn't but

340
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,599
It became kind of silly because most

341
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,879
Devices actually

342
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:52,767
Amazon so that's one of those problems that people don't really talk about I mean everyone kind of acknowledges

343
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,143
Yeah

344
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:58,911
I mean

345
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,727
They that got built-in redundancy and

346
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:04,543
Your data centers all over but it mean when they have something that

347
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,847
XM widespread level

348
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:12,991
The only redundancy that you could have in places have your service is running on a separate companies cloud and that's expensive

349
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:17,599
Batman you fall back issues and someone

350
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:19,135
Text for 2DS

351
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,439
You're another company's Cloud doesn't look

352
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:25,023
Quite like Amazon's cloud and it's not like you can actually architect

353
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,559
A Wonder one solution have

354
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:28,095
Optimized

355
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:31,423
So I totally get it. But we've said this

356
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:34,751
I think probably for the last two episodes in a row

357
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:37,823
Having IRT solar line upon the cloud

358
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:38,847
Brings

359
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,639
Challenges and

360
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:43,967
I still keep going by right before the show we were talking about the hubs

361
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:49,343
Because my favorite husband all that actually might the do-it-yourself insteon Hub that I ran here in my house

362
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:51,903
Not connect to the cloud but everything here

363
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,695
Was running on a headless server

364
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:58,047
That's it I thought you know I didn't worry about Amazon web services or anybody else's cloud

365
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,071
Oh my God

366
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,863
So like the cloud

367
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,911
That were proselytizing

368
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:03,935
We have become

369
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:04,959
Redundant

370
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:10,079
My lights just went red again

371
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:11,615
Oh yes

372
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,639
Yes I sure like

373
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,503
We're not going to talk more about this

374
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,295
Because there's really nothing more to say so

375
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:22,111
Since neither of us are offering a service nor can we really

376
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,903
I really can't think of an option

377
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:25,439
They helps people

378
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:27,999
But if you guys listeners have an option

379
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,535
I'd like to know about it

380
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,815
Because this is

381
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:32,095
This is a continuing problem

382
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,423
You did actually given option of that was

383
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:39,263
At least I consider the SmartThings Hub which the new one does have some

384
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,311
Smart's new logo

385
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,103
In case the cloud is not excessive

386
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:47,455
You know the Amazon Echo has some smarts local

387
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:48,735
So

388
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:49,759
You know I think

389
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:52,319
Your counterpart is eating at talked about

390
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:54,623
The alarm is being said inside

391
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:55,903
The echo

392
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:58,463
What are some local stops yeah yeah

393
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,487
So

394
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:01,535
Hybrid

395
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:04,351
There's a hybrid approach but you know no one is going to be

396
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,143
No one is happy when their stuff is

397
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:08,703
You're always going to want that

398
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,263
Always

399
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,031
You know it's like

400
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:15,359
Unless unless you're like in a life-or-death situation

401
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:17,663
And you're kind of stupid thing is you don't see the cloud

402
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,431
Right you know it

403
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,991
It's like when your power goes out in your

404
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,527
Curses power

405
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:23,807
You know your

406
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:24,831
Like my only income

407
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:27,647
Convenience food like in the middle of a hurricane or something are like

408
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,951
Volcano the power's out but

409
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:30,975
But at least I have

410
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:31,743
My family

411
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,791
We're safe but this is not that

412
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,583
This is like

413
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,399
I have to get up to turn my lights lavender Ahab

414
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,447
I don't know where I go

415
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:41,983
Let's talk about smart

416
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,775
Let's talk about presents

417
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:44,799
Because

418
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,079
Did you get me presents

419
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:49,407
Oh wait what kind of presents

420
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,991
I cooked I got the smart plugs

421
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,527
It's from a company called zuly

422
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:55,551
And

423
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,855
I got to tell you Kevin we have talked about

424
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:01,439
Presence and Bluetooth for god it feels like years

425
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:03,231
Trevor

426
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:04,511
And

427
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:06,047
Now that I finally tried them

428
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:07,583
You like it don't you

429
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,679
I do like it but I'm also like once again this is so hard for me

430
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:17,055
Right it's like Christmas where you're like Christmas is Christmas and then Christmas comes in your like

431
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,615
Okay well yeah that was

432
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:21,151
I guess yeah that was cool

433
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,711
Which makes me feel like a little ungrateful

434
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:25,503
So silly in this

435
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,527
Julie is fine

436
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:28,063
Julie makes the smart plug

437
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:31,135
They sell for $160 for a 3-pack

438
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:33,951
Which is what you're going to need to actually do presence in your home

439
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,743
Or $60 for

440
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:36,511
Single

441
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,279
Smart plug

442
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:38,559
They're beautiful

443
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:42,911
They plug into any outlet and turn it into

444
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,191
A smart outlet

445
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,727
You can plug

446
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:49,055
Any Appliance into it if you plug the lamp into it it turns into a dimmer

447
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,847
It also measures

448
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,383
Energy usage

449
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,919
It can do scheduling

450
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:54,943
It can

451
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,223
Let's see what else

452
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:58,783
Measures my carbon footprint for that device

453
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:01,855
And almost sounds like the

454
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:04,159
WeMo Insight switch that you had sent me

455
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,951
Yes and that is also 6

456
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:07,999
So if you were looking at both of these

457
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:08,767
Is senior like

458
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,303
I really want a smart outlet

459
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,839
That does some cool things

460
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,631
You know I might

461
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:14,911
Recommend you do

462
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:16,959
The Soule because you're going to get the

463
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:19,775
On off capabilities you're going to get the

464
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:23,103
Energy consumption but you're also give me the ability to dim a light

465
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,895
I don't believe the inside

466
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:27,199
I think you are correct on that one

467
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,479
But

468
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:30,015
For the time being

469
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,551
This is only iOS

470
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:34,367
So iOS only for now Android is coming later

471
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:35,647
I don't know about

472
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:41,023
So the big deal about the three packets besides saving yourself a little money

473
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:43,583
If you have three or more of these they

474
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:49,215
Use Bluetooth to triangulate your presence your location in your home provide it and I said this

475
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:52,799
Between years ago provided you have your phone on you

476
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:58,175
Yes and I know when we talked about this way back you're like when I don't want to carry my phone everywhere

477
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:59,711
But I bet you're doing it now aren't you

478
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:00,735
A little boy

479
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:04,575
Here goes okay so here is

480
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:05,855
Here's was Julius

481
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,647
Zulia selling presents

482
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:11,999
And they're selling it tied to Bluetooth on your phone so yes you do have to take your phone with you

483
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:14,815
Which I kind of lose because I don't always have pockets

484
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:17,375
But if I take my phone with me

485
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:18,399
Here's what I

486
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,447
I can walk into a room

487
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:23,007
And theoretically the lights will turn on

488
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,311
In the lamp that I have plugged

489
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,079
Into the zoo

490
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,359
It will turn on when I in

491
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,151
And that is actually pretty

492
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:32,223
So I'm walking through my house and it's like

493
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,015
The lights turn on

494
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,575
The TV turns on

495
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,135
Vistaprint

496
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:44,767
Do the lights turn off when you leave the room so yes

497
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:47,583
I accepted into our bedside table lamp

498
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:51,167
And her master bedroom is actually my husband's bedside table lamp because

499
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,239
Mine is already plugged into a different smart lamp setup

500
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:58,847
But his was set so five minutes after I leave the room with my phone

501
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,639
That it will turn off

502
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:06,015
And DUI on this is really nice so when you're actually setting that up it warns you it says

503
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:10,367
By the way when you do this you could be leaving other people in the dark

504
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:11,903
Do you still want to do it

505
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,463
That's nice I really did think that was a nice

506
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,023
Yes I do in my

507
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:18,559
Thanks a lot

508
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,095
So

509
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,119
Yes I did

510
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,399
And

511
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:24,191
When I left with my phone

512
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,215
Boom

513
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:26,751
It turned off

514
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:28,031
Actually

515
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:28,799
Once again

516
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:29,823
Nice

517
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,103
I did find

518
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:32,895
If I left

519
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:33,663
The room

520
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,967
But I didn't go into a room

521
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:38,015
That had a Zulily

522
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:38,783
Outlet

523
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:41,087
Didn't always turn off

524
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:43,391
It was a little hit or miss

525
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:50,047
And that's because it's it's basically figuring out which one of the Zulus are closest to with your Bluetooth ready

526
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:52,351
When your phone so again triangulation and

527
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:54,399
It's not going to be super super precise

528
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:56,191
Because of that it is my desk

529
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,471
Right so if I

530
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:59,519
If I went out of the master bedroom

531
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:03,359
Into like the office where there is another Zully and then I went someplace else

532
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:06,943
Then the light would turn off but if I went for my master bedroom down into light

533
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,479
Like a living room where there was no end

534
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:10,527
I bypassed all the others ulis

535
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:11,807
Yep it was just like

536
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:17,440
Because you're still closest to that one or yeah just doesn't know where you are at that point

537
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,464
So

538
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:25,120
I was like oh I guess I need to buy more of these two really cover my house I was just going to say you pretty much want one in like every room

539
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:28,192
Room that's one thing so here's the other thing about living

540
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,496
It integrates with the net

541
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:34,080
I can't tell if this is a great thing or not a great thing

542
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:38,176
So I think I need more granular controls but for most people they're going to probably

543
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,480
So you know how

544
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:43,808
Most people have their nests someplace out of the way and sometimes you're like

545
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:47,648
In a room and suddenly realize your nest is decided that you're away from home

546
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:49,952
Oh my God

547
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:51,744
All the time all the time

548
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,792
So this integrates with the nest already

549
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,584
And this would stop that

550
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,632
Because if you stick the smart plug

551
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:58,912
In there

552
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:01,728
In that room that you're in most the time with your phone

553
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:03,776
It'll just be like your nest

554
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:04,544
She's here

555
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:05,824
Don't go away

556
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,456
So these can act as basically external sensors for an ass which is very nice

557
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:12,992
It is except

558
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:15,040
I have my Nest upstairs

559
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:16,576
And when I go downstairs

560
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:18,112
I actually like that my nest

561
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:18,880
Turn off

562
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:22,464
So I was kind of like oh

563
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,000
I kind of wish I could turn my

564
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:28,608
Downstairs sensors off since I got a downstairs and upstairs thermostat

565
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:30,912
I wish that I could turn my downstairs

566
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:31,680
Sensors

567
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:33,472
Zulys off for the nest

568
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,032
Which is

569
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,824
Maybe a little more complicated

570
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,152
But I'd kind of like to see that in an update because I think that would be

571
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,432
Nice to have later

572
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:46,528
Totally agree you and your tell me about these before the show

573
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:49,088
You mentioned something about the battery life on your phone

574
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:51,136
Yes and this is the final day

575
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:55,232
I noticed and I install these on my iPhone

576
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,000
Because

577
00:22:56,768 --> 00:23:00,352
I didn't have the Android app yet and I don't use my iPhone

578
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:02,144
It's my work phone

579
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,168
So

580
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,728
I noticed it until usually I

581
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,056
Don't charge my charge my work phone once every four days or so

582
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:10,848
But this guy

583
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:13,152
Running this app I would go through

584
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:14,688
The battery like once a day

585
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:17,248
And this app uses the battery

586
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,552
2/3 at the bat

587
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:23,392
Yeah we went into the battery settings on your phone

588
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:26,976
Right before the show and took a look to see which apps are using the battery the most

589
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:30,048
And it was nearly two-thirds of the usage

590
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:32,608
Was from the zulia

591
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:37,472
And that's kind of concerning to me I know it's using bluetooth smart and it should be low power and all but

592
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:42,080
The app is probably constantly looking for the smart plugs

593
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:45,408
Even when you're not at home as my guest but there may be some

594
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,736
Some geofencing involve are that alleviates that I don't know

595
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:50,528
There's a whole lot of pinion going

596
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:53,600
Yeah now I don't know if it

597
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:57,952
So this is the question does it use geofencing to notice when I'm away from home

598
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:58,720
How to turn off the

599
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:01,024
Cuz I'm a little weird as a tester

600
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:02,048
I work from home

601
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:06,656
Right so it's people who were home you know

602
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:09,472
Not working at home but we're out all day

603
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:12,032
Maybe it stops paying for them

604
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:17,664
The app would have to know that I only know to know that I would it would need to be in a GPS or Wi-Fi or some other

605
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:18,688
Some other way

606
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:21,504
I'm going to suspect not it's just a guess on my part

607
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,784
It dogs location

608
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:23,808
It does ask

609
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:28,416
Maybe maybe

610
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:30,464
It is asking for that permission

611
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:38,400
You're going to have to go work in a coffee shop for 8 hours and then see if it still use 2/3 of the battery usage at that point because that's

612
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:40,448
The only way I think to find out unless the company

613
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:41,216
You know

614
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:42,240
Tell you for sure

615
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:43,264
Potato

616
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,312
It is going to Ping a lot because it's

617
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:50,432
Constantly checking to see how far it is away nachos from one Zulily

618
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:51,968
But for multiples awais

619
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:55,552
In the final wish list I would have for the Zulu

620
00:24:56,064 --> 00:25:00,672
Right now I can't use the presents for anything other than the zoo lease

621
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:03,232
Really want to use the present

622
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:05,536
Send Taylor the CEO of Zulily

623
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:07,840
Said that they're working on

624
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:09,632
But I really want to use like

625
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:12,192
Azuli presents isn't if this then that

626
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:14,240
2

627
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:15,264
Trigger other thing

628
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,032
Thanks because

629
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,824
Yeah my lights

630
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,848
Are not lamps

631
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:20,128
So the fact that it's

632
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:20,896
Plugged in

633
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:21,664
Devices

634
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,688
This is very limiting to

635
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:23,968
Tell me where is I want to be like

636
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:26,272
Yo when I step into this

637
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:27,808
Broom I want my

638
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:28,832
Lutron lights to

639
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:30,624
Turn on my Philips Hue Lights to turn on

640
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:33,952
So that's the next stage of zulia

641
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:38,816
You know after they work on the battery issues and after they possibly give me granular

642
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:40,864
Controls may be before the grid

643
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:44,192
I wonder if they're even considering

644
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:45,472
A second product

645
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:49,568
That would be less limiting to you and that would be easily smart switches

646
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,104
CNY

647
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,944
As we've discussed which is all the switches are hard for people cuz no one wants to install switches

648
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:55,968
Everyone's afraid of life

649
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:59,552
They should be

650
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,344
But afraid of

651
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:06,464
Before we had all these connected bulbs which is arguably much simpler to install

652
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,280
You know all the insteon stuff I have we're all smart switches

653
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:11,328
Redid mosto switches in my house

654
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,608
I'm with you that I've

655
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:13,376
Redid motion

656
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:14,656
We are in the process of

657
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:15,424
Redoing most of

658
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:18,240
Lutron

659
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:20,544
Now I'm feeling like

660
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,360
Oh no that's why I'm Like Glue Sean give me a dog

661
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:26,176
Please maybe I can build my own

662
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:31,296
I still like a radio from inside a Lutron or Pico and see what I can hack together

663
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:32,320
Kickstarter

664
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:33,344
Hello

665
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:39,744
Well we have talked a lot about a lot of things some good some bad we've made some good recommendations for people

666
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,048
And now it is time for us to take a

667
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:44,608
Quick interlude quick musical interlude

668
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:47,936
And then stay tuned for a guest who is liat ben-zur

669
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:54,336
She's with Philips digital health and she is going to discuss Aging in place and how the internet of things can help with

670
00:26:54,592 --> 00:27:00,736
Fat and change Healthcare

671
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:05,856
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things show this is Stacey Higginbotham and today I have is my guest

672
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:07,392
Liat ben-zur

673
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:09,440
Who is the Senior Vice-President of

674
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,208
Connected

675
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:13,024
Digital propositions for Royal Philips

676
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,304
Hailey. How are you doing

677
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:20,192
Hey Stacy I'm doing great thanks for having me I'm so excited you are here to talk about something that is

678
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:22,496
Actually really important which is

679
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:26,848
How we can use the internet of things to improve Elderly Care

680
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:29,664
And kind of the concept of Aging in place so

681
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:31,456
I'm super excited to have you here

682
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,296
So first off let's set the standard width

683
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:36,576
Phillips

684
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:39,648
You are right now part of the same company that makes the

685
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:42,720
Philips hue light bulbs but that is not the case for much longer

686
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:43,488
Correct

687
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:44,512
That's correct

688
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:49,120
We're actually splitting off of the lighting business by the end of this year

689
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:50,656
Alright so

690
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:57,056
Let's get started with kind of this concept because everybody much everyone's aware of the demographic Trends happening

691
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:57,824
Which is

692
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,616
They're about to be a lot of

693
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:00,896
Older people and

694
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:02,432
We're kind of concerned about

695
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:04,992
How we're going to care for so many aging people

696
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:06,784
With the resources that we have

697
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:12,160
And there's a lot of opportunity for The Internet of Things even if it's something as simple as

698
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:14,464
It'll caring for your parents and

699
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,536
Having the ability to put sensors in their home in it

700
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:19,840
Non hopefully surveillance kind of way

701
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:21,376
Just make sure they're okay

702
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:22,400
So

703
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:25,728
You guys have created actually I think it was about two months ago

704
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:27,008
Have a think tank

705
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:27,776
4

706
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:30,336
How to innovate around Elder Care

707
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:31,104
Correct

708
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,944
Yeah that's right actually we definitely do see

709
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,272
That there's a pretty big problem to be solved out there

710
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:40,320
So I think today there's

711
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:45,952
Seniors are actually using more of the healthcare resources per capita than any other group

712
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:50,560
And patients are 65 years and older are representing 40%

713
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:52,096
The Vault hospitalized adult

714
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,680
We think that there's a lot that we can do there there's

715
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:58,496
Technology Innovation sprouting around

716
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:03,104
Everywhere and you're you and and and his podcast talks about a lot of them

717
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,128
But it's

718
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:08,992
A bit rare to hear people talking about how those technology Innovations are are

719
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:10,016
Helping the elderly

720
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:14,368
And in research that was done between Phillips and Georgetown

721
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:18,976
University we we actually learned that it's not because the elderly don't want to adopt a pet

722
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:21,280
In fact many of them do

723
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:23,072
I think that one a little bit of help

724
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:24,608
On learning how to use it

725
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:28,448
But oftentimes their caregivers are just so overwhelmed with that day-to-day care

726
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:30,752
But they don't have time or the patience

727
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:33,312
So the Aging well hub

728
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:35,360
Which is that what you're referring to

729
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,896
Is is like a think tank

730
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:38,176
That we started

731
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:40,480
With a lot of other lot of other partners

732
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:44,064
Georgetown MIT age lab Humana will S Health and more

733
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:44,832
2

734
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:47,648
Focus on driving Innovation specifically

735
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,952
Around attacking issues of Aging well

736
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:55,328
And so far have you guys discovered anything interesting or what is kind of

737
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,096
Do you have a

738
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:58,144
Focus for your research yet

739
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:03,264
I think it's still very early days so a lot of these things are just getting started but

740
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:05,312
We're going to be stay tuned

741
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:08,384
To hear about what comes out of that about aging well hub

742
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,968
I I certainly will maybe we'll have you back in a year to see see what you've learned

743
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:15,040
So Phillips has actually been doing

744
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:16,064
A lot with

745
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:16,832
The elderly

746
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:18,112
Ocean sound like

747
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,720
But you guys have been in the space for decades with the lifeline

748
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:24,256
Product

749
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,024
Which

750
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:30,144
You know I think we've all were familiar with I fallen and I can't get up was at the tagline

751
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:31,936
Lifeline's tagline

752
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:35,264
Master concept of the concept I think

753
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:40,640
I think you're right Lifeline is has been the leader in the United States for many years in

754
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:44,736
Helping elderly to be more independent in their homes

755
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:46,784
With these types of solutions at

756
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,064
Detect Falls

757
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,880
And a lousy nurse immediately be

758
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:52,928
Connected to back and response

759
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:54,720
So

760
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:57,536
How do you take a product like that which is

761
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:59,328
You know connected to a cellular network

762
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,144
And kind of upgrade it for

763
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:03,424
The current

764
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:05,216
Generation and era

765
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:06,240
Because

766
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:09,568
You know I look at something like that and I'm like a that's

767
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,360
That feels very

768
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:12,896
Old school in

769
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:14,688
How do you tie something like that in with

770
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:18,784
Ghetto Sensors how do you make it may be a little bit cheaper I don't know I mean

771
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:24,160
I'm sure expensive because there's all this back and monitoring it's not just like

772
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:27,488
Are there people on the other end is so if you fall

773
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:31,072
You know it's calling actual people who will send help to you so that's

774
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:32,864
I assume part of the cost but

775
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:35,680
How do you get a chance when you're very very expensive

776
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,800
This is actually a very complex solution of a Lifeline system

777
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:47,200
Takes over 9 million call the year that's almost won a minute and their average response time is 22 seconds

778
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:49,504
So it's a it's a pretty serious

779
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:52,832
I'm solution to make sure that there's always someone there

780
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:54,368
For your loved ones when they need it

781
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:56,416
What's your question

782
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:58,464
Your question in terms of

783
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,000
How do you take these

784
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:02,048
Core Technologies and drive them

785
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:03,840
Into the Brave New World

786
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,632
Coyotes Rectify that

787
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:08,448
Coyotes what's hard about the same stuff that's driving

788
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:09,984
All of the wearable companies

789
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,520
That we like to talk about

790
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:12,544
To do

791
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:16,128
Cool stuff the same technology that they're putting into two to their devices

792
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:17,664
Are going into

793
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,712
The Next Generation

794
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:21,504
Philips go safe Solutions

795
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:24,320
Which is really a wearable pendant

796
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:26,112
Include includes

797
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:27,392
3G modem

798
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:30,464
Give to Les Bois home communicators GPS

799
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,280
Wife I told your bread crumbs audio begin

800
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:35,328
All the stuff that we talked about

801
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:36,096
In

802
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:37,888
I would say going to the more

803
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:39,680
Consumer Centric

804
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:41,728
Sexy stuff that early adopters

805
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:43,776
Talk like what like to discuss

806
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:45,824
But it's designed for the elderly

807
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,920
It's it's not the stuff that you see when you

808
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:52,736
First walking to Best Buy in the home automation Zone

809
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:55,552
Autoalert detection there is

810
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:58,368
Really designed to make sure that if someone Falls

811
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:01,440
Not only is at detecting the fall but

812
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:04,512
If a person falls in Camp themselves make a call

813
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:07,328
It automatically starts the call for you

814
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:09,120
There's someone that talks back

815
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:13,216
I'm from the response Center and make sure everything is okay if you need assistance

816
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:17,056
And then you can start to think about how this can go beyond

817
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:18,080
Just

818
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:19,872
Those types of

819
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:23,200
Of extreme cases to also providing

820
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:24,992
Support for elderly care

821
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:26,528
I'm going to need my assistance

822
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,832
So is that someone's been

823
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:30,624
Locked outside of their home

824
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,392
Or

825
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:33,184
I need to pick up some medication

826
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,256
Or they need help do you know to go to a doctor's appointment

827
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:40,096
They have that on them at all times with someone there 24/7

828
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,376
You can try to contact

829
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:43,168
A various people in there

830
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:44,192
Care plan

831
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:45,216
To get help with him

832
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:47,264
That's really useful because

833
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:49,824
I I know that Lifeline feels kind of like

834
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:51,616
Oh my gosh you know

835
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:55,456
I have literally fallen and I am unconscious or

836
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:58,016
You know you're going to send an ambulance versus

837
00:33:58,528 --> 00:33:59,808
Fall in and I'm kind of stuck

838
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:02,112
But I don't really need an ambulance I just

839
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,392
Can you call my

840
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:07,488
I just want to call a like a family member whose nearby and have them come over and

841
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,024
Help me out for

842
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,864
Maven esterly help me out but just kind of come over and comfort me or

843
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:14,400
You don't make me some soup

844
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:16,704
So that it's actually it is

845
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:21,312
It's an incredible thing Stacy I I've seen a lot of Technologies

846
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:22,592
I actually went

847
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:24,384
To visit the lifeline

848
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,152
Team

849
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:27,712
On the East Coast after taking a lot of these calls

850
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,296
And when you listen to someone who's

851
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:34,624
You know 9503

852
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,392
Person

853
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:39,232
Calling in in Encino just asking for help Small Things testing

854
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:40,000
System

855
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:44,352
And the happiness it brings up some on the other side right there immediately to help them

856
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:48,704
It's much more powerful than just the obvious thing that we think about in terms of

857
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,472
I'm salt

858
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:50,752
Call support

859
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:54,592
Deliver for Meals on Wheels before

860
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:55,360
And just

861
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:58,688
Just being there for someone is it's like

862
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:01,760
80% of like

863
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:04,832
What people need happiness it's Comfort like human comfort

864
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:05,600
So

865
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,416
Absolutely

866
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:10,208
So in terms of

867
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:10,976
Providing

868
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:12,256
Again

869
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:13,536
Healthcare let's

870
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:14,560
That's kind of talk

871
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:17,888
Beyond that solution let's talk about

872
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:20,192
How we bridge the gap

873
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:26,080
Between kind of consumer-grade medical stuff like a Fitbit activity tracker into kind of

874
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:27,616
Hospital in medical

875
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:28,896
Call care because

876
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:30,688
As you get older

877
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:32,992
You're probably going to

878
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:35,040
To need more wearables and more

879
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:36,832
Hospital-grade kerin

880
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:38,368
I'm very curious like

881
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,160
What that should look like

882
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:45,536
In kind of this more consumer I guess we'll call it the consumerization of

883
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:46,304
Medtech

884
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:48,608
Because we had the consumerization of it

885
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:55,008
But what should that start looking like to make it a little bit friendlier as we kind of try to bring the stuff into the home

886
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:55,776
Because

887
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:57,312
Where could I have to write

888
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:59,616
We can't just rely on hospitals for that

889
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:02,944
We don't seem to meet to as much anymore

890
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:06,272
With kind of better Wireless better sensor technology right

891
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:08,320
I think we have no choice

892
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:09,600
Actually I think

893
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:11,904
With the Aging population growing

894
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:16,000
The number of chronic diseases growing the overload on the medical system growing

895
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:18,048
Healthcare costs

896
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:18,816
Growing

897
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:20,352
It's just not sustainable

898
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:25,728
Absolutely there's no question about it the Healthcare System needs to change

899
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:30,336
And the way that we see that happening kind of depends on where you are

900
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:31,360
In the continuum

901
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:33,408
Continuum of Care what we call the

902
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,432
Care

903
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:36,480
So depending on if you

904
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:37,760
If you're someone who's

905
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:38,784
Healthy

906
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:39,808
Or perhaps

907
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:45,184
Recently went to a doctor and we're told that you have the potential of getting a chronic disease

908
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,976
If you don't change your lifestyle

909
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:49,280
These need to be Beyond

910
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:50,304
General

911
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,072
Fitness tracker

912
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,144
It's really about wearable Solutions

913
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:59,264
I'm not going to focus on some real Healthcare issues designed by doctors and psychologists

914
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:01,568
Like really leverage clinical knowledge

915
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,616
In order to drive programs

916
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:05,152
That can drive change

917
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:06,432
Behavioral change

918
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:07,968
That's kind of one

919
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:08,992
Part of the continuum

920
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:11,296
If you're someone who's already sick

921
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:13,344
If your son is already sick

922
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,392
And you're in the in the healthcare C

923
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:18,208
Systems there's also opportunities for 4

924
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:22,560
The Internet of Things in the consumerization of of healthcare and

925
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:23,584
Wearables

926
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:25,376
To play a huge role

927
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:27,936
I'll give you an example we've been working on

928
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:31,008
Intensive Ambulatory Care programs with Banner Health

929
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:34,336
Where we focus really on

930
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:38,688
The most complex and high-cost patients like the top 5% of patients

931
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,224
Austin elderly

932
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:42,784
Multiple chronic conditions

933
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,832
Accounting for 50% of all Healthcare

934
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:46,880
And those patients

935
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:48,672
Get a bunch of connected Hardware

936
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:50,464
To get Android tablets

937
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:55,328
To get customized software they get all kinds of biometric sensors blood pressure oxygen saturation

938
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:56,352
Scales whatever

939
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,424
All of those Solutions are tied back

940
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:00,704
2

941
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:03,520
How sweet digital platforms

942
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:05,312
Doctors have access

943
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:06,592
Nurses have access

944
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:12,992
To see the information that's being out of the country artists that information patients are matched to healthcare coaches nurses social workers

945
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:14,528
And

946
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,576
In just two years since we

947
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:17,344
Ben

948
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,880
Do we not program with Banner

949
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:21,184
Is a significant impact

950
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,512
Actual Healthcare cost Racine 27% reduction

951
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:26,304
And cost of care

952
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,352
Which goes up to 32%

953
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:31,680
I'm injection for acute and long-term care costs

954
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:34,752
And 45% reduction in hospitalizations

955
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:35,776
Overalls

956
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:37,312
What are the common

957
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:38,080
Things

958
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:40,640
That you needed a hardware side

959
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:41,920
That you need on these

960
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:45,760
Software side that you need on the cloud back inside to

961
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:48,320
That makes this different from

962
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:50,112
You know Alex hitting me with like

963
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:52,928
A Fitbit and maybe some home

964
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:54,208
Cameras and

965
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:56,000
Electronic medical records

966
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:56,768
System

967
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:01,888
Some other kid

968
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:03,424
Yeah so there's

969
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:05,728
There's a few key variables

970
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:08,544
That really matter when we talk about

971
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,568
Changing

972
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,104
Landscape

973
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:12,896
Number one is accuracy of data

974
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,432
So

975
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:19,552
Lots of solutions out there but accuracy of data really matters that's you know why

976
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:21,088
Much much harder.

977
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:23,904
2 things to be considered medical devices

978
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:26,208
Number two is

979
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:32,608
Wait a second so accuracy addata if it's FDA approved that means should I assume that that means the data coming off

980
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:33,376
What is accurate

981
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:34,912
Sweating.

982
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:35,936
What indicator

983
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:37,984
What's 1 indicator but of course

984
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:41,312
These Arduino accuracy of data can

985
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,104
Go beyond just

986
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:45,920
Care medical devices right because when it comes to

987
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:47,456
Being able to

988
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:48,992
Addictive

989
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:51,296
The more context you have the better

990
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:54,624
You can imagine all kinds of things around you providing contacts

991
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:56,672
And I think accuracy of data

992
00:39:56,928 --> 00:40:01,536
Is one of the things that the medical community Ashley struggles with there's so many things out there what do they dress

993
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:03,584
And noise in the system

994
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,888
Good really / results

995
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,448
And there's no tolerance for that in a minute

996
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:10,752
That's one that's one variable

997
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:14,592
Another key variable and probably one of the most important variables

998
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:15,360
Is

999
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:16,896
The ability

1000
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:19,200
For data to be used

1001
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:20,480
Color of a cross

1002
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:22,528
Longitude of

1003
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:23,808
Things you do in your life

1004
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,112
What I mean by that is today

1005
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:28,672
When you buy wearable devices

1006
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:30,464
Or smart devices

1007
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,744
At the store

1008
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,536
All the data that's collected

1009
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:35,072
From those devices

1010
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:36,864
Chesapeake elected in

1011
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:39,680
The spirit clouds by each manufacturer

1012
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:40,704
Liver

1013
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,728
. device

1014
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,288
So if I have 10 different connected things

1015
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,592
Around me on me in my house

1016
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:49,920
Usually the data is going to 10 different places

1017
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:55,040
One of the things that we're really trying to do and we think it's absolutely critical for the success

1018
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:56,064
Love

1019
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,880
Healthtech and Generals is to create an open platform

1020
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:00,416
The public cloud

1021
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:01,184
If you will

1022
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:02,208
Where

1023
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,000
You can start to connect the dots

1024
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:05,024
Home Health Care

1025
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,328
Systems all the way through to

1026
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:09,888
Devices that are more consumer-centric

1027
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:10,912
Secure

1028
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,192
HIPAA

1029
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:13,728
Compliant cloud

1030
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:14,752
Where

1031
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:16,032
If the consumer

1032
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:18,080
Consents to sharing data

1033
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:20,384
You can actually start to connect the dots

1034
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:25,504
And this is very very important because if you want to do some of the things that we think

1035
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:27,808
Are necessary for Predictive Analytics

1036
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:30,624
You need to be able to take that wearable data

1037
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,392
And

1038
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:32,928
Connected up to the healthcare

1039
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:35,744
I'll give you an example of

1040
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,024
How powerful that could be

1041
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,816
Summit lifeline

1042
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:40,864
Wearable pendant we talked about earlier

1043
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:45,216
The one that elderly people might be using more for you know call detection and

1044
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:47,264
Having someone there when they when they need help

1045
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:50,080
We've been looking at the data

1046
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:53,407
From the past several years from Seniors who have been using that

1047
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:56,991
And working with a lot of clinical scientist

1048
00:41:57,503 --> 00:41:58,271
Data scientist

1049
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:00,063
Even able to

1050
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:00,831
Do some

1051
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:03,391
Really interesting data analytics

1052
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:04,927
Where we can detect

1053
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:06,207
Proactively

1054
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:09,023
When patients are most likely to have health issues

1055
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:13,119
That's really allowing doctors and caregivers to intervene before problems occur

1056
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:15,167
You know of course ultimately helping

1057
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:16,447
Patience

1058
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:19,263
Stay healthy reduce reduce hospitalization

1059
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:20,287
But

1060
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:24,127
That's all using historical data that was gathered from Lifeline users

1061
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:30,271
Over the years and combining that with real information that's coming in real time from the from the seniors wearable device

1062
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:34,623
The care stage program which is the name of that analytics platform is he won't start

1063
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:37,951
Change things from being a reactive care device

1064
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:39,743
To proactive care device

1065
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:41,023
Extremely powerful

1066
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:46,399
You can't do that if all the different things were using to collect data on lives in 20 different clouds

1067
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:48,447
And you can't do that it's the things

1068
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:51,007
I'm requesting or data are living on cloud

1069
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:53,567
That are not secure not HIPAA compliant

1070
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:55,615
And are not going to lie to do

1071
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:56,895
Connect those dots.

1072
00:42:57,407 --> 00:43:01,247
Okay so it's like the predictive maintenance for Machinery but applied to humans

1073
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:04,063
You're like that's terrible Stacy

1074
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:06,879
Don't don't say that ever again

1075
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:08,671
Okay

1076
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:09,695
In that make sense

1077
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:11,487
You guys have done

1078
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:14,303
What will probably wrap this up quickly but

1079
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:17,887
I I do want to focus on some of the diseases that you guys have been

1080
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:20,191
Because you have this very

1081
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:22,751
Are the lifeline programs for generic

1082
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:25,311
General help you guys

1083
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:26,335
Also have

1084
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:28,383
The Ambulatory Care Program

1085
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:33,503
Which is also can generic but you also have some very specific disease programs

1086
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:37,855
I'm with diabetes you have diabetes specific Care Community you have a

1087
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:39,135
COPD

1088
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:40,415
Care community

1089
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:41,951
I'm very curious like

1090
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:48,351
I guess why those exist what you're learning about doing specific care communities versus General Health

1091
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:50,143
I'm guessing it's just a

1092
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:52,959
When you focus on these care communities you're getting both

1093
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:54,239
Is there a

1094
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:55,263
Specific like

1095
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:59,359
Being able to get better data associated with those care like

1096
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:00,639
Having a specific

1097
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:02,175
I guess Patient Group

1098
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:03,967
But is there also is like a

1099
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:07,295
Inability to bring those actual patients together if you want

1100
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:10,367
Beer kind of social media or help

1101
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:12,671
Yes absolutely

1102
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:14,207
First of all

1103
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:15,487
Phillips is

1104
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:16,767
Involved with

1105
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:18,047
All of the above

1106
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:21,119
So we're offering programs that are very specific

1107
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:23,935
Two unique cohorts of populations

1108
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:28,287
Such as a diabetes platform that was announced this week at dreamforce actually

1109
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:29,823
Well I'm with Salesforce

1110
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:30,847
And that's

1111
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:37,503
Really about a digital Health Solution to help improve the care for like the nearly 400 million people that are living with diabetes

1112
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:39,807
Huge population

1113
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:42,879
And it's all about diabetes self-management

1114
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:44,415
With an application

1115
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:45,695
Integrated

1116
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:49,279
To a backend that has an online community for collaborative

1117
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:50,047
Care

1118
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:56,447
So it's the first time that there's an online community that can connect people with diabetes to clinicians

1119
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:58,239
I'm two other

1120
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:00,031
People that also have the disease

1121
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:01,823
So that everyone can share

1122
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:07,455
Personal data clinical Health Data whatever they want to share in a secure

1123
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:08,735
Southeast Network

1124
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:11,039
You know

1125
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:11,807
Just a

1126
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:15,903
Just a simple example of of the types of things we're doing but we're involved in this

1127
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:19,487
Various points of a Continuum including

1128
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:22,559
General Health Solutions for people that maybe want to

1129
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:25,119
Just start to monitor their blood pressure

1130
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:28,447
There their heart rate their sleep patterns

1131
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:30,751
You're the most fundamental

1132
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:33,055
Things in your life are your sleep

1133
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:34,335
Your nutrition

1134
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:35,871
Your activity levels

1135
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:36,895
And

1136
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:40,735
Between those three things if he can if you can be coached

1137
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:46,111
To change your lifestyle you can actually prevent having all kinds of chronic diseases later on in your life

1138
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:48,927
And we're looking at those opportunities to

1139
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:50,463
I think one of the

1140
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:54,047
The most important differentiators coming going back to your other question

1141
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:57,119
What separates all of these programs

1142
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:59,935
A lot of the other solutions that are out there today

1143
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:00,959
Is the

1144
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:02,495
Clinical expertise

1145
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:04,543
And Healthcare expertise

1146
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:06,591
That were using

1147
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:10,175
To deliver the coaching to deliver the recommendations to deliver the

1148
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:11,711
Change behaviors

1149
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:13,759
That are necessary to

1150
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:14,527
Imbruvica

1151
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:17,343
Stop. The real key differentiator

1152
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:20,415
It's not just about tracking data and presenting

1153
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:22,463
Pretty graph visualization

1154
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:24,511
What can you do with it

1155
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:26,047
And how can we use

1156
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:27,583
Are benches

1157
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:28,607
Seal Behavioral

1158
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:31,935
Change scientists psychologists and

1159
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:34,751
NICU nurses in cardiologist

1160
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:36,543
Everything in between

1161
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:37,823
To help deliver

1162
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:39,103
Programs

1163
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:40,383
These are

1164
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:42,431
Solutions that we often build

1165
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:43,711
With the patience

1166
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:45,759
And with Hospital

1167
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:47,039
Burberry clothes

1168
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:48,575
The last mile of healthcare

1169
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:50,111
In order to try to make an impact

1170
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:53,183
Okay so it's the involvement of the doctors

1171
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:54,463
And

1172
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:57,279
Creating a community and getting an early start hopefully

1173
00:46:58,047 --> 00:46:59,327
Absolutely

1174
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:01,119
Alright well we have moved from

1175
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:02,655
Your elderly

1176
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:04,959
I'm always forgetting it's it's the elderly

1177
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:07,263
Hub no elderly Innovation Hub

1178
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:08,543
Aging well hub

1179
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:09,567
Aging well hub

1180
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:14,687
My brain my brain reacts against it cuz I'm like oh no it's an actual hub

1181
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:16,991
Anthony M physical device.

1182
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:22,623
So the agent will have all the way to I guess it's also aging well as but it's earlier in life

1183
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:26,207
With specific preventing specific chronic diseases hopefully

1184
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:30,815
You guys have a lot going on I'm excited to hear about it and I feel better about my own

1185
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:32,095
My own efforts of beijing

1186
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:35,935
Which which really involved is waking up every single day

1187
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:36,959
