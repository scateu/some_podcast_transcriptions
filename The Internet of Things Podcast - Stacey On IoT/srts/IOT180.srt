00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:30,208
Recently about Madam and Amazon adding motion sensors to

8
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:31,232
That platform

9
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:33,024
We got a hug

Connected products

15
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:41,216
Kind of like the Amazon Dash

16
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:41,984
They killed it

17
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:45,056
We've also got some lonely hacker

18
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:48,640
Hindus including an iot botnet and Google employees hacking things

19
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:53,504
Nest new temperature sensor a 300 million dollar acquisition in the industrial iot

20
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,040
And a parapet

21
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:56,064
Too big and dust

22
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:59,136
What's we have our guest

23

Yesterday

28
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:05,792
Focusing on

29
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:07,328
Indoor location

30
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:08,352
And

31
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:10,656
We're going to talk about why indoor location matters

32
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:14,240
What the challenges are there and what you can really do with that

33
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:15,264
So

34
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,568
We're also going to have a message from one of our sponsors

35
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:18,336

Big analytics company I know you guys will hurry up and

37
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:24,736
Now we should go to a message from one of our other spots

38
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:27,808
This week's show is sponsored by chocolate

39
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,136
Your customers are not a distributed error tracking

40
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:35,744
What's 64% of iot users in countering performance issues

41
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,024
You need chocolate

42
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,304
The Edge first

43
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,840
Problem finding software

44
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:43,680
What uses Advanced function analysis and deep learning techniques

45
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:46,752
Identify errors and performance bottlenecks across yours

46
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:47,520
Tired

47
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,568
Chocolate brings you the traces

00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:50,592
Systemmetrics

49
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:53,408
An environmental conditions you need to fix issues

50
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:54,432
For your customer

51
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:57,248

52
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:59,552
That I owe that's a u

53
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:02,112
Koe T. IO

54
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:03,648
Man

55
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:05,440
I would really enjoy it if

56
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:06,720
Companies actually work

57
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:07,744
Harder to find errors

58
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,024
What about you

59
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:13,376
Aqi tester

60
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:15,936
It's always cheaper to find errors earlier

61
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:21,056
Okay so let's get started with

62
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:22,592
Lenovo news

63
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:28,992
And now we have the details

64
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:35,648
Right we knew about this because of the FCC filing that we found I don't know maybe six weeks ago but it wasn't until last

65
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:38,464
Last week at the equator show that

66
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,864
Lenovo actually outages some new Smart Home Products and they are because they

67
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,632
Which runs

68
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,680
Google home Google Assistant settings

69
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:52,800
So this is not totally new expansion of smart home

70
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,848
And now have a dedicated smartphone

71
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,040
Spark plug

72
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:04,320
Eleanor smart

73
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,088
Camera

74
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:07,136
Last week with very little information

75
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,672
This week we have more

76
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:09,952
Sitting availability price

77
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:13,024
You should know these are all Wi-Fi

78
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,304
Capable devices

79
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,704
They are all 2.4 gigahertz with some smart home devices running solely on

80
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,752
Frequency but it is what it is

81
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:24,288
They're not available

82
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,312
But they will

83
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:27,616
Available

84
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,408
November exactly

85
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,480
Plug will be 2999

86
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:36,832
Camera v99

87
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:37,600
99

88
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:39,904
Availability

89
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:44,256
Willie was wondering what they were trying to do but now I sort of get it

90
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,792
Because if you think about it

91
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:48,608
There a competitor to Samsung

92
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,400
Between laptops

93
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:52,704
What laptops in particular I would say

94
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,472
And

95
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:55,776
They want to Augustine

96
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:02,432
Devices that lower selling prices

97
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:04,224
Send the stuff was happening

98
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,296
Everybody's going to multiple

99
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:19,327
This will work with the Google Assistant will work with Madam as well there are two versions of their app

100
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:23,423
Called Lenovo and Lync link app will be available soon

101
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,959
For IOS and Android

102
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:27,263
Who is this I would say

103
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,543
You can sing

104
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,079
People think is important

105
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,383
Smart light bulbs

106
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:34,175
They check everybody wants it

107
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,711
Even

108
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:36,479
Renters

109
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,015
But also a smart plug

110
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,295
Camera

111
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,831
This ties into

112
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,623
Very first devices

113
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,183
Buy I don't

114
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,463
Web cameras

115
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:50,815
So I don't recommend people by that but definitely a light bulb or a smart outlet to like

116
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,095
Remotely controlled

117
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:54,143
What is a great first step so

118
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:57,471
What's the bare minimum you need to

119
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:03,615
Yeah speaking of bare minimums I also noticed just now on the Smart Home

120
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,151
Website that they have

121
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:06,175
They have a smart

122
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:09,247
Speaker stand on speaker that works with Madam

123
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:15,647
This may have been out before but I think it's going under our radar unless you seen this before it it looks like an echo essentially

124
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:18,719
Can Intel Atom Processor inside it's got all the

125
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,511
Yeah right

126
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:24,607
I want trouble 10 watt woofer

127
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,143
99 bucks

128
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:36,895
Everyone who sends us the questions asking to the heck is what we call Amazon

129
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:39,711
Digital assistant so we don't set everyone's

130
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:43,807
Just so you know

131
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:44,575
Okay

132
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,159
We did last week

133
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:53,535
I don't know how I missed this but Amazon has added motion sensors

134
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,559
As a category

135
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:55,583
4

136
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:58,911
And that means that device

137
00:05:59,167 --> 00:05:59,679
Owners

138
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,471
Start integrating

139
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,751
Their sensors

140
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:04,543
Which makes

141
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,335
Automation Way

142
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,103
So

143
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,639
You're going to be able to stay if

144
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,175
UC motion

145
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,455
Camera

146
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,223
Turn on my porch

147
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,527
Yay

148
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:16,063
Something that the

149
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,599
Device manufacturers

150
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,671
First so smart things as one of the early adopter

151
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:25,023
They're doing it around their multi-purpose sensor and their motion sensor

152
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:25,791
Today

153
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:27,071
Any how to use

154
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,863
14 function

155
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,959
Write this is a new API essential

156
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:40,127
Biggie at something that the as you said that app makers and developers and

157
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,407
So I have to integrate

158
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:46,015
Oh my gosh this please you that I want to start playing with this the other device that uses this

159
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,807
Surprisingly is the Echo Plus

160
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,623
That is a few things so that if you have

161
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,159
Centralite sensors

162
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,951
Or Sylvania and

163
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,743
Birthing Centers Portland

164
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,815
If you have centralized Sylvania sensor

165
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,351
And an Echo Plus

166
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:01,375
You actually

167
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,399
Start using this

168
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,727
And others again

169
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:06,751
Center companies

170
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,543
Oh this is all

171
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:11,359
So others ABS sensor base

172
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:12,895
You'll have to certify

173
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,967
And why do you think that is

174
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:16,735
Answer this

175
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,039
Because what

176
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:21,855
Radio is missing from the Amazon hub

177
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:22,623
Oh okay

178
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:28,511
Do you have a scandalous story about a

179
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,583
Tell me more

180
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:32,607
Yes

181
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:35,167
Yes the Echo Plus which is their hub

182
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:37,471
And we should explain for people who don't know what these

183
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:40,543
Zigbee and Z-Wave R2 networking

184
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:42,591
Analogies have been used in the home

185
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,871
Really long

186
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,919
And they're low power

187
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,199
Networking

188
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,991
Wireless protocols

189
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:52,575
It's great for your battery powered sensors and things like that

190
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,111
Even door locks

191
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:57,183
But with things like Home Care

192
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:59,743
A lot of the new functionality

193
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:04,351
It's unclear exactly and Z-Wave are going to still be like

194
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,399
The masters of Hawaiian nation that they used

195
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,471
That's why we're devoting so much time

196
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:10,495
To that aspect

197
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,543
Okay so

198
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,591
I would say hey everybody

199
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:15,615
Please

200
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:16,639
Do this

201
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,407
It will be awesome

202
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,711
Because I really love

203
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:22,015
Having things automated based on

204
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:24,319
Although it can be kind of a pain to fingers

205
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,879
I was drinking and spent like

206
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:30,463
Six months trying to figure out how to create like a automated go to bed

207
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,487
Routine for my house

208
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:32,255
I never said

209
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:33,535
It was terrible

210
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,911
Not slept in 6 months no I just I didn't want to say like goodnight

211
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,191
I just wanted like

212
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:40,959
Oh

213
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:42,495
Haven't walked in the following

214
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:44,287
Hallway and these lights are out

215
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,311
And this person

216
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,591
Basically

217
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:48,127
It just would all go to hell

218
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:48,895
Whenever

219
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:53,247
There's so many variables that's the tricky part

220
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,015
Exactly

221
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,063
Moving right along

222
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:56,831
Also

223
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,367
We got news that the

224
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,135
Amazon

225
00:08:59,391 --> 00:08:59,903
Digital

226
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:03,999
Assistant that works with over 20000 devices

227
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:09,375
This is why you often say that first

228
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:12,191
Platform that smart home devices

229
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,727
Amazon

230
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:16,543
It's true they start with Amazon first

231
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:20,895
They've now started with Amazon first to move to Google and then they follow with it

232
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:21,663
Usually

233
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:22,687
And

234
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:28,831
I'll be curious with homekit with apple lightning up some of their requirements will see a bigger chunk.

235
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:32,159
Just to put this number in contacts

236
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,439
The beginning of the year

237
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:35,487
4000 devices

238
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,303
20005

239
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,839
The number of brands

240
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:43,935
Went from 1200 at the beginning of this year to 3500

241
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:44,959
So

242
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:46,751
They are making big strides

243
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:50,079
There's also 50000 Madam a skills

244
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,383
Inside actually start with

245
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:55,967
If you are trying to predict what's happening and how the Smart Home

246
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:57,503
I was going to get easier over time

247
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:58,783
Look at

248
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,063
The API integration

249
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,599
Alexa motion sensor

250
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,135
About or

251
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,159
Last week

252
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,183
GE announced

253
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,743
You no longer have to talk to G-Eazy

254
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,023
Assistant

255
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,047
Control the oven

256
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,351
And other Home Appliances

257
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,631
And that's because

258
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:14,655
They now have

259
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:19,519
Native support for ovens and microwaves and things like that inside

260
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:23,615
So this is a big deal because what is going in able to

261
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:26,175
Interoperability

262
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:26,943
So

263
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,223
Geez ovens work

264
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,271
Pretty much the same way that

265
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,039
Oh

266
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:33,855
Ashes of an acre

267
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,951
On off

268
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:40,767
So once you have that you can just say

269
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,583
Your particular device

270
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:46,143
To say hey

271
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,447
Turn the oven to 350

272
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,983
The echo figures all that

273
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:57,151
One other thought in case we have some enterprising individuals that listen to the show

274
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,943
I thought it was interesting

275
00:10:59,199 --> 00:10:59,711
That

276
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,735
Amazon

277
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:04,063
Mentioned a 22 year old college student

278
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:06,623
Is making $10,000 a month

279
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,391
With his

280
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:09,183
Word of the day skill

281
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,207
That

282
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,559
Opportunity

283
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:16,351
Yes people up there

284
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:17,887
You probably should come

285
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,727
Okay

286
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:30,687
Speaking of apis this is rather interesting as well

287
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,991
Samsung

288
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:36,063
Third-party developers to build apps for Bixby

289
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:40,415
And I don't think we're going to call Bixby Mister because I don't really know anybody using Bixby

290
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:42,207
50 States but that is

291
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,743
Good news for

292
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:44,767
Developers

293
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,047
I want you

294
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:49,119
Target another platform

295
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:53,471
I don't know I am a little too late a minutes expected to happen

296
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,495
Samsung to do list

297
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,519
But

298
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,335
I just I don't see a baby

299
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,871
Push for Bixby these days

300
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,919
Maybe in other parts of the world

301
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,711
Is Bixby begin

302
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:06,527
The thing about Bixby

303
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,831
Is just not a good implementation

304
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:13,951
Perfect example Galaxy Note 9 just came out Us phone out right now

305
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,999
Every single review I read

306
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:22,399
Bixby is half-baked Bixby doesn't respond Expedia spins for 30 seconds and then says I don't know

307
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:26,495
I know they put on a good show with Bixby at there

308
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:30,335
Home speaker for example

309
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:33,919
Developer on Samsung

310
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:40,575
Not it's not nearly as bad

311
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:42,111
Having use both but yes

312
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:43,903
And

313
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:46,719
We should mention this week kind of bypass these standards

314
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,487
Part of this

315
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,303
Last week

316
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,095
Also on Thursday

317
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:01,311
Earliest version 2 of the io tivity Sanders

318
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,335
And

319
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:07,455
For all of you guys have been following us for years we've talked about this because this was supposed to be like

320
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:09,759
A unifying standard for the internet

321
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,551
Especially in the smart

322
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:16,415
It might be but no one else's

323
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:19,231
So LG Samsung

324
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:19,999
And

325
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,303
Higher are all going to

326
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:25,375
Tivity certified devices

327
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:27,167
Coming to Market

328
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,447
2019

329
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,239
That is next year

330
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:31,775
I'm really

331
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,311
I mean I wrote about this

332
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,871
When I go to be the first version launch there were

333
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:36,895
It only ran on

334
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,943
Giant machines like hugs and

335
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,735
Things running Atom Processor

336
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:43,551
It just was not great for the internet

337
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:46,111
Right way too much memory all that

338
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,135
And

339
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,671
They took a really long time

340
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,463
Security spy

341
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:53,023
I've been worried about the OCS

342
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:53,791
Quite some time

343
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,327
I feel like this is

344
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,351
Too little too late

345
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:58,911
I've been watching this particular effort

346
00:13:59,423 --> 00:13:59,935
Oh

347
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:00,703
3 years

348
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,263
Maybe for years now and then

349
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,799
Prior to that I was watching

350
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:05,567
Qualcomm

351
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:06,847
All join

352
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:10,175
Choose another effort to like have these Universal data C

353
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,991
So what it looks like we're getting a

354
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:14,015
We're going to have

355
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:16,063
Amazon Echo take over

356
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:18,879
This I guess and maybe Google home

357
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,415
That's what I was going to say

358
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:26,559
If you take too long to come out with a standard and somebody else develops to censor their own standards

359
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:30,911
That generally come for the universal or standard coming in late

360
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,959
Biscuit is not adding a standard at all

361
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:35,263
So

362
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,031
This is

363
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:40,895
This morning but there are I still actually need lots of people who want to use the open

364
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,431
Connectivity Foundation standards

365
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:44,223
You know maybe I'll be surprised

366
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,063
Will keep it up there

367
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:48,831
See what happens

368
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,135
All right

369
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:53,183
Lot of little products in things

370
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:55,999
Talk about so let's talk about or via voice

371
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,047
You been waiting for this

372
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,839
Not this particular

373
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:07,007
Well maybe not particular this device but yes I am looking for expect the next

374
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:14,687
Has to be a consolidation and by that I mean we don't need a box of bridge at HUB etcetera for everything we do

375
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:21,343
Why not put them all in integration where you can and that's what Netgear is doing with her or be voice

376
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,623
So what it is

377
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,391
It is

378
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:25,183
Part of their orbi

379
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,719
Mesh wi-fi system

380
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,535
Also is a smart speaker

381
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:34,143
So you get decent sound assistant and you extend your network

382
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:34,911
So

383
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:35,679
That's

384
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,239
This type of process exactly what I've been working

385
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,775
I mean I get this product

386
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:42,079
Yes I forsee many

387
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:44,127
Similar products from various vendors now

388
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:47,199
Yay

389
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,223
All right

390
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:49,759
Tattoos

391
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:50,527
Target

392
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,599
They are products

393
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,903
Vinyl Products

394
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:58,463
Couple times

395
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,487
But

396
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:00,767
And he was in the newsletter

397
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:06,911
Amazon Dash except they built

398
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:07,935
Connection

399
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:08,959
Bluetooth

400
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:12,031
And when it was almost empty it would reordered

401
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,055
Yourself

402
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,079
Kind of cool

403
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:17,663
People did not support it if they launched as a crowdfunding

404
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,711
Nobody decided to

405
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:22,015
And I think it's probably a couple things

406
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,575
Actually talked about

407
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:29,439
That's not the best way to do it

408
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:30,975
The den 2

409
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,631
Many many many

410
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:40,191
We talked about

411
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:40,959
Dogs

412
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,263
Dog food scoop

413
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:48,383
Order more dog food as you scoop it out basically

414
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,687
Anyway

415
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:54,271
It was really hard because when you were trying to assess value is at

416
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:55,807
You're like

417
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:57,599
Changes the equation

418
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:59,391
You like his convenience worth

419
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,671
The little prince premium

420
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:01,695
I don't know

421
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:03,231
And most people probably said

422
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:06,047
And I think it's because they hadn't experienced that

423
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,887
Didn't make sense I mean

424
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:12,447
We're getting bombarded with a shift

425
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:14,495
Two subscription-based things

426
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,775
Celebree ordering

427
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:18,335
When you're low on something smartly

428
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:24,735
Makes sense but it's also like to I want another kind of things I think you were struggling

429
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:28,063
All right if he doesn't talk about this kind of thing

430
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,343
You want to use it

431
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,135
I don't know

432
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,159
All right

433
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,439
What's up

434
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:34,975
We got a

435
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:37,791
OK Google employee hacking the Google door

436
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:39,839
I was like

437
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,399
Yeah I know it's actually very good

438
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,423
Google

439
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,495
Sunnyvale offices were hacked by one of his own employees

440
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:47,519
You're somebody else

441
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:51,359
Because I couldn't really bad but one of these employees on Sunnyvale

442
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:54,175
Found out to get into the

443
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,735
Uses I think was NFC

444
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:57,503
RFID

445
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,295
Is RFID there we go

446
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,343
Software House

447
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:07,743
Software House exactly will suffer house needs to take a look at it software because encrypted messages

448
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:10,559
Sending across the network

449
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:11,839
And this

450
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:17,727
Employee discovered a hard-coded encryption key Software House devices

451
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:24,127
So he replicated the key commands and was able to lock

452
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:25,919
Fellow employees out of the building

453
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,711
So the good news is

454
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,991
He reported at 10

455
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,015
Is being address

456
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,063
Google's probably very happy that

457
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:37,695
This raises an interesting challenge that I worry about

458
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:42,047
In our future for as a consumer for example because the locks

459
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,631
Didn't have enough memory to be upgraded with the fix

460
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:47,679
So literally you had to

461
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:50,495
Not you will have to physically have those locks

462
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:54,847
And that's like gr device makers considering

463
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:55,615
You know

464
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:57,151
Memory constraints and such

465
00:18:57,407 --> 00:19:03,551
For something like that she got to have some overhead in case something drastic goes wrong so that way they're not sending new devices

466
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:04,319
Not everybody

467
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:07,391
So that's actually

468
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:09,695
Even around

469
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:11,231
Basic functionality

470
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:15,327
So having enough overhead in your

471
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:17,631
Teal

472
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:18,399
People

473
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:20,703
You're going to bump up against especially because

474
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:23,007
My gosh we just keep making software bigger

475
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:26,591
Historically a lot of like

476
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:27,359
Locks

477
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:28,895
Appliance makers

478
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,175
What do you like that

479
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:33,247
You don't remember it was like an extra building materials

480
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:36,063
Straight hair like no just play it to the Bone you need to

481
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,855
Nothing until they're actually haven't

482
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:38,623
To do

483
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:41,183
And how they think about

484
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:41,951
Building there

485
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:42,719
Products

486
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:44,511
The Internet of Things

487
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:45,535
And

488
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,583
But it is

489
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:49,375
It is definitely

490
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:51,167
Something that I don't think

491
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,191
4 years ago

492
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:56,287
They were thinking about and now they are and they're having to start designing this kind of

493
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,823
Extra overhead in

494
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:00,127
And you know it will run out so

495
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:01,919
Fisher Hawaii

496
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:04,735
Modular

497
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:06,783
Yeah the good thing is we

498
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:13,183
Come along way with remotely managing updating industrial and elsewhere

499
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:15,999
And if the device itself doesn't have enough

500
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:21,375
Memory to handle that that's an issue it's so it has to be part of the design process that think ahead

501
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,007
Let's talk about

502
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,543
Caillou

503
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:35,711
Yes a new iot botnet

504
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:42,111
As you mentioned

505
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:44,415
D-Link Huawei and Realtek

506
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:45,951
Routers so

507
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:51,327
Is the Japanese word for according to

508
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:57,727
Yeah this is just your typical I'm going to get on your router and I have donut services and I'm going to pin

509
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:01,055
Report I can see what's on your network

510
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:02,591
The password or what has

511
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:03,871
Hard coded

512
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:05,663
You know from the device maker pastor

513
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,967
Have you didn't change it so you could access

514
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:10,271
Wi-Fi cameras on your network

515
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:11,551
Consumer Reports

516
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:12,831
Yeah that's not good

517
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:15,135
I believe

518
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:17,952
There's no

519
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,488
Fix for this yet I have not

520
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:20,768
Scene record of one

521
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:25,120
Okay we're optimistic news relare

522
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:26,400
Which is a

523
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:27,680
Enterprise

524
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:28,960
An industrial iot

525
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,288
Acquired by insurance

526
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:33,824
Munich re

527
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,616
This is a deal that valuable are

528
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:36,896
300

529
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:38,176
Million-dollar

530
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:40,480
This is about this is

531
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:44,832
Blair's been doing this for a while. They help companies tie a lot of their

532
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:45,856
Next products

533
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:47,904
Together using

534
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:50,720
Customers

535
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,256
They also offer Analytics

536
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:54,048
And this makes a lot of sense because

537
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:55,584
I believe there is a

538
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,144
Promising understanding

539
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,192
And things

540
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,752
Maintenance schedules all of this

541
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:06,592
Actuarial world of Ensure

542
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:07,616
So

543
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:09,664
Getting that kind of data

544
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:10,688
Pulling it

545
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:11,712
Being able to

546
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:12,992
Actually see it

547
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,272
Is going to be important

548
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,320
Going forward

549
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:18,112
I don't know if the

550
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:21,184
Companies working with relay or going to be excited about sharing

551
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,720
Christina with insurance

552
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:24,512
Companies so we'll see how that

553
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:25,536
Doylestown

554
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:26,560
But

555
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:28,352
I do think this is a highly strategic

556
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,424
And one

557
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:35,264
Interesting one of the investors in

558
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,800
One of the later rounds of funding

559
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:38,336
For this company

560
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:40,384
Got to get in early on

561
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:42,432
Indy industrial internet

562
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:45,760
Corporate and strategic investors are wonderful Sunday

563
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:46,784
Industrial

564
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:47,808
I will say

565
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:48,576
Also

566
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:50,624
In this kind of industrial world

567
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,416
Google the company that makes

568
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:54,464
All kinds of things this contract

569
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,048
Manufacture they are working with Cisco which I associate with

570
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:58,816
Analytics software

571
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:00,096
To make a

572
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:03,424
So if you don't want to design your own board

573
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,960
With it up Memories by the way

574
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:06,496
In handle all the

575
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:10,080
Analytics aspects and getting all that data to the cloud

576
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,616
Offering out there that

577
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:14,432
So while we're building your

578
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:17,248
Washing machine we can also have this word in

579
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:20,320
You can start pulling data off of it very easily

580
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,344
So

581
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:24,160
For companies that don't want to have to

582
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,000
Some tiny little product

583
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:30,560
We don't talk too much about these but lucky

584
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:32,352
Is a crowd-sourced thing

585
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:33,376
On Kickstarter

586
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:35,424
Crowdsourcing is like a Bluetooth

587
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,032
Teething

588
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,568
You know where it is

589
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:44,384
Weider Home

590
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:48,992
Without your key and it also has a sensor in at the tracks when the key was

591
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:51,552
Turn so you actually know if you lock your door

592
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:53,088
You can't change anything

593
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,696
You can't remotely fix it

594
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:04,608
He makes Yorkie sort of smart but not so much Sherlock

595
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:05,888
Exactly

596
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:06,656
Yes also

597
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:08,448
At least it's temperature sensors

598
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:10,240
Rainbow colors

599
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:12,032
I think this is fine but

600
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,568
Are some negative reviews out there

601
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:15,360
Yeah there's a review just

602
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,384
Earlier this week

603
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,456
By the Virgin the basically the biggest upgrade

604
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:20,480
Disappointment

605
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,272
Goodness hasn't changed that much

606
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,808
This is an upgrade

607
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:26,624
And they say does the bare minimum which is

608
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,208
Is the temperature sensor doesn't have presents for example so you can't

609
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:36,864
He's in a room is very limited as programmability because you only have certain blocks of time where you can

610
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,144
Set the temperature

611
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:38,912
Sensor 2

612
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:40,448
A certain temperature

613
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:41,216
Perhaps

614
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:47,616
Even early riser you want to have somebody new I have a cooler room or warm room at 5 a.m. while you really can't do that with this

615
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:51,456
What is a temperature sensor

616
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:55,296
Doesn't you know she's not going to do much more I don't think

617
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:57,600
Yeah you sure that I feel like

618
00:24:57,856 --> 00:25:04,000
It should be way smarter so yeah

619
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,024
Is it temperature

620
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:06,304
We might think that

621
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,584
It would be better to have a temper

622
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,120
Your presence and air quality

623
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:15,008
Deciding

624
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:22,688
Right that's the key so if you wanted to have all these extra things what would you expect the price to pay if you expect

625
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:25,248
Pack 499 sensors

626
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:27,296
No. Like right now at this time

627
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:30,368
Alright skip ahead

628
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,904

Really good

655
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:24,128
Super sturdy

656
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:26,176
Tell that this is a medium

657
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:26,944
End

658
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:30,016
It works really well so we're excited to offer this

659
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:31,040
You guys cuz it is

In September

663
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:44,608
This is not a huge Drive

664
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:49,728
I'll tell you when we get about 20 voicemails a month and what we do is we stick them in a spreadsheet

665
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:54,592
And we use a random number generator to draw these so your chances are

666
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:59,200
And I don't just say that cuz they do

667
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:01,760
It is a really nice

668
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:07,136

669
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:09,440

Okay

674
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:20,192
Let's hear from

675
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,752
Hi my name is Megan I'm from

676
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:24,032
Southeastern washing

677
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,104
We're in the process of building home in Colorado

678
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:29,408
The Builder uses a group

679
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:31,712
Saw their home automation products

680
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:32,480
Soyuz

681
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:35,296
Ultrasound thanks from interlogix

682
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:36,320
Further hub

683
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:39,136
We now have a home that has a Wink 2 hub

684
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:40,928
And a lot of

685
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:41,952
Miss A

686
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:43,232
Compatible products

687
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:45,280
I'm not comfortable using

688
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:48,352
A group as an ultra sink from

689
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:49,376
Interlogix

690
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:51,168
God never heard of since

691
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:55,264
She is in the midst their own by gng is in the midst of it Sebastian

692
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,032
Future

693
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,312
Should we just

694
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:59,104
Have them installed the Catholics

695
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,176
Cable and audio and go your own way

696
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,712
Do you have another pinion

697
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:09,344
Oh okay this is a good question because I bet a lot of people deal with it

698
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:13,184
Yeah this is the system we put in take it or leave it

699
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,976
In this case I'm going to tell you that

700
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:16,512
Britney actually no longer

701
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:19,840
Intralogic

702
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:20,864
Bye

703
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:24,448
So you don't have to worry about these troubles there

704
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:25,216
And

705
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:26,496
I think for us

706
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:29,312
The big question in this is going to be for you

707
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:31,360
Rather not

708
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:32,128
Is

709
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:34,688
Do you want to put this in your house

710
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,248
And just ignore it which is a possibility

711
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:41,600
Do you want to not have it in your house at all which I don't know what that's possibility

712
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:43,392
Or do you want to try to use it

713
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:44,928
If you try to use it

714
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,232
You're going to be there are some limitations

715
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:49,280
You will be stuck buying

716
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:50,816
Interlogix products

717
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:54,400
You can however integrate those with things like that

718
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:55,680
So

719
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:58,496
So as far as like crazy Smart Home

720
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:01,056
Integrating it

721
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:02,848
Necessarily with things like

722
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:04,128
Or

723
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,200
But you could use the voice control of matter made of

724
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:08,224
Turn things on and off

725
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:10,272
That's one

726
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:11,808
And then Kevin

727
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,856
Yeah my thought was

728
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:18,464
Ucenter already using like a DIY system you have wink Frozen after he said

729
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,536
As do I you not paying any monthly fees

730
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:22,304
Right now

731
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,072
Obviously

732
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:26,144
I would check in the building should be able to tell you if

733
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,960
The interlogix system has a monthly

734
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:33,568
I personally would not want that which is why I have went and I assume

735
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:35,872
You feel the same way but

736
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:37,664
You can change your mind

737
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,968
Maybe there isn't a fee maybe they discount it

738
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:42,016
I only say this because interlogix

739
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:45,088
Products are sold install through dealers

740
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:47,904
It's not an off-the-shelf anything or you just install it yourself

741
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,208
As a DIY person so I'm assuming

742
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:52,256
There may be a monthly fee involved

743
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:53,280
Yes if you want to

744
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:55,840
So

745
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:58,400
What we have to tell you

746
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:01,216
I'm not 100% sure what you're actually

747
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,520
Like so hopefully this helps

748
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:05,824
You don't at least have to worry about the bees.

749
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:06,592
And

750
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:07,360
If you

751
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:09,408
Want to it might be kind of nice

752
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,688
To just be like

753
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:12,480
Justine Smith anime app

754
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:14,016
It really depends on how you

755
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:15,808
In how much time

756
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:18,368
Bat

757
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:19,904

00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:30,656
I remember

762
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:31,424
Murder hole

763
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:32,960
Start with sleep

764
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:35,264
Let's get ready now or

765
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:36,288
Our Guest

766
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:40,384
This week who is going to be talking about indoor geolocation

767
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:42,688
Really hard problem for iot

768
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:44,736
So I guess is Vikram Parvati

769
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:46,784
CEO of Lowe's

770
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:49,600
Before we get to him we're going to have a message

771
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:52,928
We got a new sponsor this week in

772
00:30:55,744 --> 00:31:01,888
Hey everyone we are taking a break from The Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor this week sponsor is

773
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:05,984
Fast and I have json man who is VP of iot

774
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,264
Louis asked you to talk to her

775
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:09,824
Alright so let's just get started

776
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:10,848
Talking about

777
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:11,616
Sassy

778
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:12,640
And iot

779
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:14,432
Chaz has been in the analytics space for

780
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:15,200
A long time

781
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:18,016
Can you give us a few updates until us

782
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:19,552
What you guys are doing

783
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:20,320
With the internet

784
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,136
Most people are familiar with sass

785
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:24,160
As as leader

786
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:25,184
In Analytics

787
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,208
Within the space

788
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:27,744
More than 42 years

789
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,024
And the change.

790
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,048
Has been presented

791
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,096
Respect to the iot market is the

792
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:32,864
The fact that

793
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:35,424
A huge explosion of data being generated by the

794
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:36,960
And the data is

795
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:37,728
Is distributed

796
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:39,776
ATS device

797
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:40,800
2 hour

798
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:41,824
Response to that

799
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:43,104
An investment

800
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,128
And streaming technology

801
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,152
Being able to

802
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:45,920
Chicken Little

803
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:47,200
From the previous.

804
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:47,968
Processes

805
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:49,248
Be able to apply those

806
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,528
Penn State in motion

807
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:51,296
IRT is

808
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:52,832
Big data problem

809
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:54,112
The dolphin x x

810
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:56,672
Kyushin is required again small bits of data that are

811
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:57,696
Moving quite rapidly

812
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:58,464
Alarm

813
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:00,000
Incapability

814
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:01,280
Will Alice generator

815
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,072
Environment

816
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:05,632
Shasta's created a new iot division

817
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:06,912
Kendall Oliver

818
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:08,448
What is that mean forecast

819
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:12,288
So yes we did create a new division within SAS

820
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:13,312
The goal was be able to

821
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,336
Full resources

822
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,872
Together from R&D

823
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:16,640
An archipelago

824
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:17,408
Operation

825
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,432
Marketing

826
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,456
Product management

827
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,760
Ford sells all of these

828
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:22,528
Capabilities

829
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:23,552
Brought together to

830
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:24,320
Focus

831
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:25,856
Only iot opportunity

832
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:26,624
Globally

833
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,440
Customers is a couple things most of the use case

834
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:30,720
Houses that we see around Iowa

835
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:33,280
Peores on yield Improvement efficient

836
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:34,304
NC failure to text

837
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,072
Or

838
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:35,840
A better engage

839
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:37,376
Is there an customer

840
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:39,168
Safari

841
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:40,192
Class of problem

842
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:40,960
Improve my

843
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:44,800
You see the capability to reduce the latency and the decisioning

844
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:46,848
The origin of data

845
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:47,872
Closer to the origin

846
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:48,640
Of the problem

847
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:51,200
And on the customer engagement it really

848
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:54,528
Provides the ability for a unique message to a customer

849
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:55,552
In a unique position

850
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:57,344
Respect to geolocation

851
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:59,904
To an incap proximity to

852
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:00,672
Healthcare device

853
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,464
A couple of categories that

854
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:04,000
Do you skate

855
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:04,768
Leverage

856
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:08,608
So openness is a big deal in the internet

857
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:10,656
How is SAS handling

858
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:11,424
That

859
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:13,984
Yes so certainly UC wide mark

860
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:14,752
Adoption

861
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:18,080
Some of the open-source capabilities while using example as

862
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:19,104
Python modeling

863
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:20,896
But what we have found through

864
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:21,920
Evaluation

865
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:23,712
Concepts

866
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:24,736
Stockwell

867
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:25,760
You can generate inside

868
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,064
Which is quite difficult

869
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:29,088
To the point that in

870
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:29,856
Enterprise

871
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:30,624
Environment

872
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,904
For sustained value of

873
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,184
Overtime

874
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:34,208
An hour and 4

875
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:36,256
To support the full

876
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:37,792
Iot analytics life cycle

877
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:38,560
It allows you to

878
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:40,608
Consume those open-source model

879
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:41,632
Languages

880
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:43,680
An example but then provide

881
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:44,704
Capability

882
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:45,728
Play.

883
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:46,496
And maintain

884
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:48,032
Improve those models of

885
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:48,800
X

886
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:49,824
Continue to

887
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:50,592
Justine Valley

888
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:53,408
All right and Jason where can we go to

889
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:56,224
To find out more about SAS and its efforts and iot

890
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:58,272
Absolutely so you can go to

891
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:00,320
Tous ask.com.

892
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:01,344
And that provides

893
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,368
The basis for now.

894
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:16,704
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham

895
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,752
And today's guest is Vikram

896
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:21,568
Hibachi who is CEO of Lucic

897
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:23,104
Ink hive

898
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:23,872
How are you

899
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,664
ICC how are you

900
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,456
I am super well so

901
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:29,504
We are talking about

902
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,784
Location today

903
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,552
Neighborly

904
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:33,088
What you can do with

905
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:34,880
Highly granular location

906
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:37,184
In the iot and why it matters

907
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:37,952
So

908
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:40,512
You guys just launched your company

909
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:43,328
But this is something you guys have been working on for

910
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,864
5 years almost

911
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,144
Absolutely

912
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:51,520
The Genesis of the accompanying idea founding the company really started Nelly for 5 years ago

913
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:52,544
Okay so

914
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,312
Let's Orient

915
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:54,848
People kiss people may not be

916
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:55,872
Really like

917
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:58,944
Why do I need such awesomely granular location

918
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,480
People may not even realize we don't

919
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:01,504
Have greater

920
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,528
Location for Io

921
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:04,320
So let's talk about the problem

922
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:06,368
A little bit what is difficult about

923
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:07,136
Finding thing

924
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:10,464
Yes I think we already familiar with using

925
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,744
GPS driven

926
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,512
Babson

927
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:14,816
Location Technologies in the outdoor

928
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:15,584
Environment

929
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:20,960
I can imagine people navigating without Google Maps or Apple Maps today in the Outdoor World

930
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:24,800
But once we comes to an indoor environment which includes all the way from

931
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,848
You know what your commercial buildings off

932
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:29,408
Retail to factory

933
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:30,432
Warehouse and Logistics

934
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:32,480
Facilities and also your home

935
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:37,344
Wiki Lac today Stacy is a very precise way of localization

936
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,416
Indoors by precise indoor localization

937
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:42,976
So important is because in terms of

938
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:48,608
Warehouse logistics for example if you want to be able to accurately locate assets

939
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:51,424
Which includes a patient they cook Mayan people

940
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:53,728
And ability to locate and then

941
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:57,568
Track them as they moved to these Logistics centers allow or custom

942
00:35:57,824 --> 00:36:00,640
Smurfs to be more efficient increase productivity

943
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:02,688
And get a lot of visibility on what's Happening

944
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:03,712
Inside their operations

945
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:10,112
On The Other Extreme for example you can imagine having precise localization indoors in your home and buy

946
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:16,512
Understanding where all these devices are that are connecting to each other and you can create a contextually Aver

947
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:18,304
Environment where consumers can

948
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:24,704
Use these to automate a lot of their in our daily chores that otherwise take a lot of effort to initialize

949
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,008
And then in between you have

950
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:28,032
Different

951
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:28,800
Application

952
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:29,824
Schleich locating

953
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,360
A certain hospitals

954
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:32,896
Assets in factories

955
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:35,456
And cilantro for indoor localization

956
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:40,064
And the position of diet really enables people to be more efficient or productive

957
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,648
Can get more visibility on the how things are happening inside their environment

958
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:49,280
And this is also a challenge just when you think about it once I've put a bunch of sensor someplace

959
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:51,072
Sometimes they move sometimes

960
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,096
Happen

961
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,888
And you want to be able to

962
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:55,424
Know where they are for maintenance

963
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:57,216
Battery changing

964
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,544
Absolutely and you'll be amazed as to how

965
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:05,408
You know you take the context of just operation and maintenance rate in a commercial building

966
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:06,688
Pick up large

967
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:12,064
Skyscraper in you have seen on thousands of HP AC units are going to have light bulbs or

968
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:17,952
Lamps all of these overtime in the course of a building life of a building can be 25-30 years

969
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:19,232
You have no idea where these

970
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:21,280
What was it stored where and what happened

971
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:23,840
And so you know even something as simple as

972
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:25,120
Smoke detectors

973
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:29,472
And understanding for example knowing the location of these detectors you can

974
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:32,800
Visualize where exactly the fire started wedding has

975
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:34,336
Initiate advice propagating

976
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:35,616
On The Other Extreme

977
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:38,944
My lamp is not operating in Bronson semaphore

978
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,224
And I can send that right

979
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:40,992
Technician

980
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:44,064
The 6-8 even before the customer complains about it

981
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,904
Idea of location is really really important to an operation in Renton

982
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:54,560
And it goes all the way from commercial buildings you know including a home for example today when you install your smart home devices you have

983
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:59,680
Physically going in log into location for example I have all these Alexa devices

984
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:00,448
Tooth in my home

985
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:01,728
That's exactly going

986
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:04,288
And locate right and so I've no contextually

987
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:07,104
No spatial awareness of a desert

988
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:08,128
Putting in

989
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:12,480
User representation for that so I descale in Osprey large buildings

990
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:14,272
That issue gets magnified even more

991
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:16,576
I can't even imagine I hate having to deal with

992
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,112
So

993
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:19,136
Let's talk about

994
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:20,928
We've needed this for a while

995
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:22,208
But we don't have it yet

996
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,744
About the challenges of

997
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:26,304
Joking this inside different in fire

998
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:32,704
The three major challenges that have plagued indoor localization one of them is that the environment that we are trying to

999
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,752
Track and locate things is a dynamic

1000
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:35,776
Imagine a

1001
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:42,176
I Logistics facility today where things are moving constantly when we are living in the world of e-commerce where this summer

1002
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:44,480
Which Automation and velocity has increased

1003
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:47,040
So dramatically over the last spinner 510

1004
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:53,440
15 years so the dynamic nature makes it very difficult for us to use traditional Technologies every fingerprint

1005
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:57,024
And then try to assess if things are actually right they were supposed to be

1006
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:01,632
The second one is that it or buildings indoor environments have a lot of obstruction

1007
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:08,032
You don't have traditional line of sight Technologies like Optical or what even are asking actually

1008
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:10,848
See you at the king or the person that you're trying to locate

1009
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:17,248
So this non-line-of-sight is it a significant Challenge and even beyond that once you get past these do you have

1010
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:18,272
Have what you call it

1011
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:21,088
Multipass like a selection severe physically you can have

1012
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:26,976
You know 16 deflections of a given signal and then which one was the real one and which one weather reflection

1013
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:33,376
So this idea of eliminating multipath has really played the industry for God's for the longest time so

1014
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:36,960
Three main challenges and of course it has to be affordable and

1015
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:38,496
Scalable and cost-effective

1016
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:44,896
And you don't want to be deploying something which is not based on a standard those are the main challenges that doesn't look like this

1017
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:46,432
It has faced over the last 4 years

1018
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:48,224
Man you went for like 3 to 6

1019
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:49,760
R7

1020
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:51,808
Lots of companies

1021
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:56,416
I have tried to do this and I'm just going to run people through a brief history of indoor location

1022
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:57,184
Nothing

1023
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:02,560
GPS GPS and GPS didn't work well with GPS + Wi-Fi so we had

1024
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:04,352
Departure companies like Skyhook

1025
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:06,400
Companies trying to do this

1026
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:10,496
And now we're trying to add other radio so there's efforts

1027
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:13,568
Laura Bluetooth location efforts

1028
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:15,104
So let's talk about

1029
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,384
Why you guys went

1030
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:17,408
Wi-Fi

1031
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:18,688
Also subject

1032
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:22,272
Yes it is 5 V bucks was driven by a

1033
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:23,552
Tina recognition.

1034
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:28,160
Two things were happening when is that you know his wife I now become as important as water

1035
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:34,048
I mean every building in the world now has Wi-Fi and consumers customers all depend

1036
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:38,400
Don by 5 for data communication talk to you in for voice so Wi-Fi

1037
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:40,192
Really are the most ubiquitous

1038
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:42,496
Infrastructure that is already present

1039
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:44,544
And will continue to be present

1040
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,104
That was one very important reason for going with Wi-Fi

1041
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,896
That reduces the cost and

1042
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:51,968
The scale issues that you have it other newer technology

1043
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:54,528
Do you like you and Bluetooth are ultra-wideband

1044
00:40:54,784 --> 00:41:00,928
The second part that we recognize many years ago was that there's an effort to increase the bandwidth in Wi-Fi

1045
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:04,768
By that allows Wi-Fi to be even more interesting from a localization

1046
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:10,144
Ocean Point of View and that's what really started a few years ago and we were able to understand that

1047
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,192
And leverage that a lot in our solution

1048
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:15,520
Today so we use our global standard call 11ac

1049
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:17,312
Are witches high bandwidth

1050
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:23,712
And which allows us to take advantage of the advances in Wi-Fi kind of combines the two is that

1051
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:25,248
What Vidal ice was that

1052
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:27,040
It's a lot of it has to do with the algorithm

1053
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:33,696
And the ability to to do machine learning once you have captured the data that's the reason why by Begin video

1054
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:34,464
Attractive

1055
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:37,280
Beyond. Just so you know Global standardization

1056
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:41,632
Baby looney that Wi-Fi device working in Japan would work in the US or in

1057
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:43,168
Germany or China

1058
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:49,568
Produces a lot of concerns with our customers and the ability to use mobile phones is very important as well.

1059
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:52,384
Something that newer Technologies would find difficult to do

1060
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,919
And then the sub gigahertz

1061
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:55,967
Component be used mainly for communication

1062
00:41:56,223 --> 00:42:02,367
Cam site is 2 reduced by 5-day power intensive protocol to the ability to use sub

1063
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:03,903
Gigahertz allows us to den

1064
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:10,047
Communicate and maintain the network without leveraging the high-power and Smith and receive functions of Wi-Fi

1065
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:12,351
So you guys use radio

1066
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:15,679
ORF to understand location but you also have something called a visual sensor

1067
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:16,959
About why you're doing

1068
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:19,775
When we started looking at this challenge of

1069
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:22,079
Uniqa capture and really visualizing

1070
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:26,175
The physical space Wikipedia lies was that a lot of the algorithms.

1071
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:30,015
People have developed especially on Dai side leverage ratio data

1072
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:32,575
And we are very good at image and video Analytics

1073
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:38,207
But the challenge then is that most of the devices that people use in commercial buildings or invade houses

1074
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:40,511
6 personalities

1075
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:43,071
Security you tend to use a lot of buy a camera

1076
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:45,375
And these are expensive very difficult to win

1077
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:50,495
Install into fuel have a million-square-foot facility in a warehouse distribution center

1078
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:54,079
You can't deploy these Violet sensors if I have cameras all over these

1079
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:54,847
Large building

1080
00:42:55,359 --> 00:43:01,503
Most of the cost is not in the hardware but in the insulation the maintenance the reconfiguration and if you take the lifetime cost

1081
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:05,855
Cost-effective becomes really high invented is a visual sensor what you do is

1082
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:07,135
How to use standard

1083
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:08,159
Image sensing

1084
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:09,951
Components we have not did nothing

1085
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:16,351
You know anything exciting about those but then we have modified the protocol of use out on wireless sensor Network in total

1086
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:19,167
Call that allows us to transmit image data

1087
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:20,959
And video clips that they look Park

1088
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:24,031
Consumption by doing that now if you can do is you can deploy these

1089
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:24,799
These cameras

1090
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:31,199
Battery operated cameras all over your facility and if you take an image and video streaming devices

1091
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:37,599
For that device cameras do really well with a lots of times you want to take images once a minute once an hour and some cases

1092
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:39,391
Customers even take images

1093
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:45,791
Once a day so that kind of operation original sensor product is really good so now you can take images from Hyundai

1094
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:47,839
Different locations within your facility

1095
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:50,399
And use Ai and advanced Analytics

1096
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:52,191
To get actionable insights and take the

1097
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:55,775
Decisions make decisions that you know otherwise would not have been possible

1098
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:57,311
Example UK

1099
00:43:57,567 --> 00:44:01,919
If you have an implementation in a bat house baby use up wireless cameras for tracking

1100
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:04,479
What you call a smart truck doc application

1101
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:10,879
She just literally walking to her house to tease wireless cameras and start monitoring the docks in the warehouse and

1102
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:14,463
You got visual data every few minutes or every 5 minutes

1103
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:20,863
Vision. You can analyze truck birth utilisation you can take the license plate of the truck you can make it

1104
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:24,703
Intelligent Decisions on who the truck driver was with a truck owner was

1105
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:26,239
What was the grill time

1106
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:29,823
You can essentially come up with a really intelligent kpi now

1107
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:33,919
And monitor the operational efficiency of how your dogs are cooperating

1108
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:36,479
Inside the red house just an example or you can

1109
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:37,759
Beautiful security

1110
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:40,319
Can you get four understanding space utilisation

1111
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:42,879
In complex areas within your facility

1112
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:45,951
I know you could always use it for security and for surveillance as well

1113
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:47,487
So why would I use that

1114
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:51,327
The differences.

1115
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:53,631
Bayit camera or the video camera

1116
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:54,399
Essentially

1117
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:55,679
Everett have to major in

1118
00:44:55,935 --> 00:45:01,567
This one is that it has to be fired because you're in or trying to take data and streaming across a high bandwidth

1119
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:03,871
Vire

1120
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:05,663
Insulation cost goes up

1121
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:08,479
The maintenance Costco's are because you and also operating cost

1122
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:12,575
Because now you're taking large band with files and trying to store them or pasta

1123
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:13,343
System in the cloud

1124
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:15,135
So what happens then they refused.

1125
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:19,231
If you're taking data from just one location or maybe five or six locations

1126
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:21,791
That's fine because you can easily afford to do that

1127
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:24,607
What if I want to take data from thousands of location

1128
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:26,399
Within a million-square-foot

1129
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:31,007
Facility or a $54 building you know the cost of both of data capture

1130
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:31,775
Analytics

1131
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:32,799
And storage becomes

1132
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:33,567
Really high

1133
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:34,335
Best Buy

1134
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:40,735
Our situation allows you to cost-effectively capture the data across very large spaces and then you can visualize and digit

1135
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:44,831
What's the outdoor right sofa example you can literally walk up

1136
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:47,135
Low.sex visual sensor devices

1137
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:49,439
Hook them up on two different things outdoors

1138
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:50,207
And start collecting

1139
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:50,975
Data from them

1140
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:57,375
And you don't need any fires you don't need an electrician that could easily move them across from one part of the outdoor location

1141
00:45:57,631 --> 00:46:01,983
That's what makes this so different from anything else that's out there in the market

1142
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:03,519
Let's talk about

1143
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:05,567
Developing the

1144
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:07,871
While how are people using

1145
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:13,759
This two areas have you seen the most significant interest one is from the warehouse and Logistics Market

1146
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:16,575
And the second one is from commercial building operation and maintenance

1147
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:20,927
Steve Matson Logistics the interest level is very high on understanding

1148
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:22,719
Space and acid realization

1149
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:26,047
And then enabling his capture to operate

1150
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:29,887
Increase efficiency increase productivity gain more visibility and their operation

1151
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:31,679
Inside these Logistics centers

1152
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:35,263
A lot of it states has been given by e-commerce there's a strong

1153
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:40,383
Organization of their houses real estate costs are going up for these facilities as

1154
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:41,919
Consumers are demanding product

1155
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:43,455
Closer to their homes

1156
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:49,855
Which happens to be no burn areas so in the past you have had a distribution center in Tracy but now it's coming right into your into South

1157
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:52,671
San Francisco going all the way into downtown Sanford

1158
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:57,791
Just go and see if you take more complex cities like Tokyo and New York the cost of organized spaces

1159
00:46:58,047 --> 00:46:58,559
Is really high

1160
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:02,143
So understanding space utilization is one of the most interesting

1161
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:08,543
Use cases that you have seen to the ability to use both the visual sensor and our location local positioning system

1162
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:12,895
Our customers can understand how space is being utilized and there's a part of that then

1163
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:15,711
Becomes an expert know how much

1164
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:21,343
Forklift people resources at the right resources available at the right time at the right space

1165
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:27,999
What did I place those are actionable insights that customers really are interested in pain. Commercial side there's a lot of interest on

1166
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:32,607
Commercial buildings lot of interest also by the way in specialization as you know Laura

1167
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:33,375
Usra

1168
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:35,423
Inside Global buildings are underutilized

1169
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:41,823
And so using our visual sensor and location devices people will become more efficient in how they

1170
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:47,711
Do you space within commercial offices in using our products for operation maintenance

1171
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:50,271
People are using a cameras for examples for

1172
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:51,807
American rooftops in

1173
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:53,855
In other parts of the building

1174
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:56,671
Security and surveillance reading a much larger

1175
00:47:56,927 --> 00:48:03,071
Scope of security within larger complexes which are traditional camera Solutions cannot cover some of the interesting

1176
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:04,863
Can you say seductive come across so far

1177
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:08,447
You like many companies are building a platform

1178
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:09,727
That could really

1179
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:11,519
Go in any number of Industry

1180
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:15,103
But it's also so far been very easy to see that

1181
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:16,895
Many of the most successful

1182
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:21,503
Iot in the Enterprise in industrial space focus on just a few areas

1183
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:23,039
Sino Logistics is

1184
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:23,807
Big deal for you

1185
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:25,855
Are there other areas where you

1186
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:26,623
You guys are going to

1187
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:27,391
Try to be high

1188
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:32,511
You think Logistics is definitely the the primary focus of the company

1189
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:34,047
But then once you go beyond

1190
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:36,095
Logistics commercial buildings

1191
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:41,983
Because again as you know a lot of iot solutions have not been very successful with commercial buildings

1192
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:43,775
Security and surveillance dance

1193
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:46,335
To be the one that people look at but if you

1194
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:47,615
Take a step back in

1195
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:49,919
Once you have better indoor location

1196
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:54,527
What can I do with that if I can improve office occupancy space utilization

1197
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:59,903
Then can I be more efficient with not only space but also work operations

1198
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:00,671
Tobacco

1199
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:01,951
You know kind of look at

1200
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:06,303
Our Technologies as applicable to smart home it's just like that's a slightly different Market

1201
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:10,655
Not our main focus directly right now but in a partnering with some of the

1202
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:12,191
Larger companies were

1203
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:18,591
Sinnoh focused on Smart Home Technology to build in location into the home which is has you no sodium

1204
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:19,359
Missing at this point

1205
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:21,151
Yes or if not missing

1206
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:22,431
Manually inputted

1207
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:23,199
Anything that

1208
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:29,599
PSD to set up a smart home today

1209
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:33,951
This is also kind of nice because it can auto update

1210
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:35,999
Correct if I move something around

1211
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:37,535
It's like

1212
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:38,815
Now it's different

1213
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:40,863
Inertial sensors in all devices

1214
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:47,263
Tuesday similar to your phone so if you move to example interview are using them already in our warehouse application example

1215
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:50,335
I know that now it's on the move and so now we can start tracking

1216
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:54,431
That makes the device lot more efficient in terms of power consumption and

1217
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:55,199
The New York

1218
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:56,223
Cinnamon tanning everyday

1219
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:57,503
A meaningful strike

1220
00:49:57,759 --> 00:49:59,039
An optimization of housing

1221
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:02,111
Things are specially placed within your environment of Interest

1222
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:03,135
All right

00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:03,903
Thank you so much for

1224
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:06,975
Thanks thanks for the opportunity
