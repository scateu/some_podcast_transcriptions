00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,944
I said amazing show for you today

5
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:23,040
We are going to talk about Amazon's new drop-in feature adding more context

6
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:24,064
Typical home

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,112
Applebee's tracking firm

8
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:29,440
And we're going to do some thought experiments on ransomware

9
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:32,768
Plus we got a new phone for the iot and I got to review

10
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,328
Woohoo I've been you Eero

11
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:36,352
Routers

00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:40,448
Arabic songs for this week is TE Connectivity

13
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:43,520
Guest Daniel elazar

14
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:46,080
He's going to explain how to build and manage

15
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:47,360
Products

16
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:48,384
So

17
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:49,408
State

18
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:52,480
And now a message from another sponsor

19
00:00:54,528 --> 00:01:00,672
If you're hunting for a subscription Revenue model for your iot business you need to hear about Affiliated monitoring

20
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:07,072
In response to a trigger from any connected device affiliate is professionally trained live agents can follow up

21
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:09,120
Protocol and reach out to your customers

22
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:15,520
Their loved ones and local emergency services Affiliated works with hundreds of smart home security help

23
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:21,920
And other iot businesses visit Affiliated.com iot to read a case study

24
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:28,320
And how they help to connect guitar startup turn an idea into a thriving business with a hundred-million-dollar exit

25
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:30,624
Affiliated. Com

26
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,928
Splash iot

27
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:34,208
All right

28
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,256
Let's get into our shows

29
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:40,608
Speaking of show next week we're going to have the Amazon Echo Show

30
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:43,680
But in the meantime we should actually talk because some of the reviews are out

31
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:44,704
And

32
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:46,496
I know I felt like they were like

33
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:51,104
It's got the screen is desiigner

34
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:55,968
It was a mixed bag in the reviews and it's funny because the hardware itself

35
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,064
People did complain about the design felt it was chunky block Etc

36
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,928
And it actually brings me back to the very first Kindle device which was also

37
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:10,816
Very angular and odd you know Jenna was remember that the page Kindle

38
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:13,632
About Amazon website

39
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:15,680
Yellow

40
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:16,960
It's blocking a junkie

41
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:22,080
Amazon

42
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:27,456
They are not here to design things to sell you things in the most efficient and cost-effective

43
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,480
Way possible

44
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:31,040
That they are that they are

45
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:34,112
Again I did not order when you did and you should have one like

46
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:36,160
Probably right after the show it's going to be delivered

47
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:39,488
UPS come to my house at 1:45

48
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,792
Oh I'm sorry

49
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:42,816
What what you're getting

50
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:43,584
I'm not

51
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,680
You know I get to see you again from going back-to-back the original Fire TV

52
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:48,960
But has the

53
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:50,496
Cards for

54
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:51,520
Madam a

55
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:56,128
On the screen that there's a benefit to that especially for the bedside device and so on

56
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,480
And for people who maybe you're not tech-savvy want to keep in touch with family

57
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:02,528
Tweety's Echo shows would be

58
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,064
Would be handy but

59
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:06,368
I don't know I will say this

60
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:11,488
Amazon continues to evolve the whole Smart Home

61
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,768
Product line

62
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:15,072
Far faster both hardware and software

63
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:18,656
Then anybody else on the market today and I'll give him credit for that

64
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,448
I agree with you and

65
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,240
Working

66
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,520
Hard to

67
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,312
Say hey is this working

68
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:28,128
So there are really actually moving

69
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,200
And I love it

70
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:35,552
Some features that might make the show work for some people with Smart Homes

71
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:38,112
So they brought in several camera

72
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,648
Suzhou Logitech

73
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:41,184
Cameras and

74
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,000
My August doorbell camera actually can feed into the show

75
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:44,768
When I get it

76
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,840
Those are the kind of things that you know

77
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:48,864
Might

78
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,632
Mater to

79
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,472
No doubt no doubt right rather than have you know

80
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:59,616
Paleta smartphone and look at the feed whatever it mean it's just easily accessible you know if you have that show in your room

81
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:03,968
What I imagined Google will do in response is

82
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:06,528
You know the Google home doesn't need a screen because you can

83
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,392
Chromecast use the Chromecast on your TV if you have that always on

84
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,952
Sunday now you can just be like

85
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:17,791
You don't need a device with a dedicated screen to send it to your television

86
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,119
I will show up.

87
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:27,519
So that's kind of where I see probably Google heading in that direction there's pros and cons to this

88
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:31,359
I mean obviously if your TV is on watching something you don't want to be interrupted with

89
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,919
Bright

90
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:38,783
Order pizza

91
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:43,903
But then again I mean it wouldn't be a stretch to see a little picture in picture pop up

92
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,207
Did a programmatically appear as soon as

93
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:50,815
If somebody's at the door so it doesn't take away from the viewing experience of

94
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:55,167
Whatever you were doing beforehand so AT&T I never very clearly

95
00:04:55,423 --> 00:05:01,567
Like 15 years ago show this for Smart Home

96
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:03,359
Digital Life was part of U-verse

97
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:04,639
So I'll go

98
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:06,687
Yeah

99
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:10,015
So if you're right picture and I always forget about picture in picture

100
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,039
So

101
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:11,807
That could

102
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:12,575
Definitely

103
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:14,879
We should mention

104
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,159
That we

105
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,951
Talk about the Google home stuff

106
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:22,047
Because Android police did a teardown of the latest

107
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:27,423
App update for the Google home and they noticed a couple things they notice bluetooth support which

108
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:31,263
Pair more devices to the stadium or speakers

109
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:32,543
Yeah

110
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,591
And then you can also set

111
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,127
Default help

112
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,151
Put devices so you

113
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,431
You can actually say

114
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,199
Hey

115
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:41,759
This guy the Google home in my living room

116
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,295
I want you to talk to my living room

117
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:44,831
Which

118
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:45,855
As the default

119
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:48,415
Yes as a default which means it's automatically going to

120
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,439
Go there so in that

121
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,719
Future that we just talk

122
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:54,815
You might have to set your defaults but then poop that's where they're just going to send it

123
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,351
Yeah nope

124
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,375
Android Police

125
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:03,775
Does a lot of Android app teardowns and some of those things pan out some of them don't have the code is in there

126
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,591
Where to enable those two features that you just mentioned

127
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,615
But it's not

128
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:08,383
Active

129
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:09,407
Right

130
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:12,223
And Google did talk about this though at

131
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:12,991
Their last

132
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:16,831
That I oh I oh I was so excited

133
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,623
Everyone else was like no product

134
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:22,463
Cohasset vision for context

135
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:26,815
Andrew

136
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:28,607
Kevin was writing about context

137
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:35,519
Yeah I was Google Now on my wrist I said I want to see it and lo and behold we got it

138
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:42,175
Alright Amazon also announced a fun new feature

139
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,991
I personally wanted like women

140
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,527
It launched so I'm excited about

141
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:47,807
It's Erica

142
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:51,903
And isn't this will work on your show this work on your dots this work on your

143
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,439
I don't know if it would work

144
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:59,583
Taps who has a tap you know what it actually I tested I have a tattoo I have one of each type of echo

145
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:02,911
It does not show up as an option on my tab

146
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,447
I might at brother

147
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,727
Okay so

148
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,775
Kevin has answered both questions

149
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,567
Kevin has the tap and it does not work

150
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:16,735
So there's a couple ways you can use this I actually used it from The Madam a app on my phone

151
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:19,039
By going to conversations

152
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:21,087
And that's where you can see the

153
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:24,159
Voice calling that you might have done you see a history there in your contacts

154
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:27,487
But the very top of that screen there's a blue bar that says drop in

155
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:32,351
When you tap that it shows you which Echo devices you can drop in on

156
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:35,167
I have three right here if I tap any one of those

157
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:39,007
That device will actually make a sound like an incoming call but little

158
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:39,775
Ring light

159
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:40,799
Turn green

160
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:42,591
And it now becomes an intercom

161
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:46,175
So it's an intercom between my phone through the app and that Echo

162
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,711
But I think you can do it

163
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,247
Without the app as well

164
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:52,319
Okay one thing to know before you start

165
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:54,367
Dropping in on people in trying to make this work

166
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,671
This is based on the name of

167
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,439
Your Echo

168
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:59,743
When you install that you had to give it a name

169
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,791
If you gave it a cute fun name like

170
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,327
She who shall not be named

171
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,375
You're not going to want to keep that you're going to

172
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:09,215
Probably for the intercom feature what I keep it as the name of the room that it's in

173
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:12,543
Who is your go-to one of your echos

174
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,567
And you'll say

175
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,103
Madam

176
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,639
Drop in on

177
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,663
Bedroom

178
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:18,687
And then

179
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:21,503
It will the light will turn green up there and

180
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,039
Chime will sound and

181
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:24,831
You are working

182
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,879
If you can drop in and you can talk to whomever

183
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:29,951
You can actually also do it like a formal phone call

184
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:31,999
If you think that someone might be busy

185
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,791
And so then you would say

186
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,327
Madam a

187
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,095
Call

188
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,935
And then what's going to happen is the person actually has two

189
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:40,703
Answer you

190
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:43,263
Two ways to do a drop-in is like

191
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:44,543
I'm here

192
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,567
And the other one is like

193
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:46,847
Oh

194
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:47,615
I'm trying to get

195
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:48,639
Attention

196
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:58,623
I like both approaches and part of the reason is when this was announced a lot of folks who wrote it up as

197
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,159
You able to spy on

198
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:02,719
And listening on people in your house and so on

199
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:06,047
And you made it sound like they wouldn't know that you're doing this but

200
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:09,119
It's so far in my usage it's very clear

201
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,679
Between a chime and the ring light

202
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:15,007
But you are either, glistening talking Etc

203
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:15,775
So I don't

204
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:19,103
I don't have that concern of a from a privacy standpoint

205
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:22,943
And I actually so my husband and I tested this and he was able to walk

206
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,479
All the way across the bedroom

207
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:26,783
And I could still hear it just fine

208
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,063
Can you

209
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:31,903
Well I have my stepdaughter is a low top

210
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:35,999
Then she wasn't facing the echo

211
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:42,399
It might have to understand my family does not like to test things with me this stuff they don't put their all into it so

212
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:44,447
It could have just been that she's a low talker

213
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:46,495
I don't know

214
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:50,591
I suspected it work for you and your husband I'm sure it's going to work fine for everybody else

215
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:53,407
You know I feel like kids voices

216
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,735
Understanding my daughter sometime

217
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,111
Redis clear

218
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,159
Okay

219
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:08,511
Let's see what else do we have that was so much like a personal assistants exciting

220
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,327
We got apple

221
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:13,631
Confirm

222
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,167
That's it

223
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:17,983
That's the report I mean you never really know

224
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:22,079
What two apple has purchased until usually long after the fact

225
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:24,895
But I didn't use shell companies and so on so

226
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:26,943
The report is that

227
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:29,759
They purchased sensomotoric

228
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,039
If I'm saying that correctly

229
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,319
Which is a

230
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:35,647
German company that has 1991

231
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:38,719
They have developed a range of eye tracking

232
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:41,791
Hardware and software through 4 lotto verticals

233
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:44,351
And it sort of makes sense if this is

234
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:46,143
That this might be true

235
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,215
Because there's been a lot of discussion about Apple getting in on

236
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,007
AR VR

237
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,103
Wearables possibly although so far that's all just

238
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,383
Speculation

239
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:59,967
Because at WWDC they were showing a rnvr through

240
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:00,991
AR kit

241
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:07,135
Bearcat which is been very impressive from what I seen so far

242
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:10,463
Many of the people who work in PR that I talk to

243
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:14,303
They're like this is really powerful and it's really easy and

244
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,119
It's already on everybody

245
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:21,471
When I was 11 right

246
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:24,799
Isn't this company makes glasses

247
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:27,615
Peoples Natural Gas

248
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:28,383
In real time

249
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:32,991
And it is up to a hundred and twenty hurts which is super fast

250
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:34,527
A lot

251
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:35,551
That's a lot

252
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:37,599
And

253
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:39,391
The benefit here is

254
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:42,207
If you know where someone's looking it's a more granular

255
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,231
Data field

256
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,255
For you to actually

257
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,327
Zhu Zhu it's it's less jerky

258
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:48,863
Fluid

259
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,935
Yeah I mean that you're getting analytics that

260
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:54,239
You might not think you could get a sense

261
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:57,055
But they would be very valuable for a developer to have

262
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:02,687
These type of analytics are pretty useful and in fact it was earlier this month at YouTube

263
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:06,527
Was actually showing off video analytics through VR

264
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,807
And of course

265
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,623
Are being owned by Google alphabet.

266
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,415
Probably more for

267
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:15,231
Add sewing thing for ad targeting

268
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:18,815
To see what people are looking at as opposed to a developer

269
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:25,471
But either way I'm into to be able to get this type of granular data on what people actually looking at is it school

270
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,751
Going to open up new markets

271
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:27,775
And

272
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:28,543
Possibly

273
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,591
Confirm that people are ignoring ads

274
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,383
That's true

275
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:33,919
Let's see

276
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:37,503
What else do we have we have a hundred million dollar fund from Trent

277
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:40,575
This is Jennifer.

278
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:44,159
We don't know a lot about this but they said this week

279
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:47,999
And this is the typical corporate investment strategy what it looks like is

280
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:50,303
Dollars to invest

281
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:53,631
And they're trying to get an understanding of how

282
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:56,191
To think about Security in the eye

283
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,751
So this looks very strategic for

284
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,823
We've had we shared some thoughts on

285
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,871
Security iot in the past

286
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:08,991
Oh gosh I don't think I have a day doesn't go by that I don't think about security and iot

287
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:16,159
So yeah this is interesting I too am looking for a threat model like a way to think about securing the internet of things which is

288
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,695
It's just completely massive

289
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:19,743
And it's really probably

290
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:22,815
It's more a model of thinking about how to secure

291
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:25,119
So many highly distributed

292
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,143
Devices that

293
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:28,191
Are really relatively dumb

294
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:30,751
What are going to have very complicated permissioning

295
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:31,519
Between them

296
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:35,615
That's kind of how I'm thinking about it I however do not have a hundred

297
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:38,175
Million dollars to invest so you should probably talk to

298
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,455
At first but then you can call me

299
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:41,247
I could start a $10

300
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,271
Oh yeah

301
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:44,063
I'm sure I could make it even to hunt

302
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,855
I mean let's be generous

303
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,159
410x already

304
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:50,719
Speaking of security

305
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:53,791
There is a wannacry variant running around

306
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:57,631
Hitting everything

307
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,447
This is a ransomware attack

308
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:03,263
Which is basically where companies are like

309
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,055
They wake up one morning

310
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:08,895
They got a message and it's like hey you can't access your data because

311
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:13,247
We've got it and we've encrypted it and if you want the key to unencrypt it

312
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,295
You got to pay us X number of Bitcoin

313
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:19,647
So people freak out this is Ben

314
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,183
Ongoing for a while

315
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,743
What are predicted late last year

316
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,791
Included in my annual predictions

317
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:28,607
Is this is going to be a big deal for iot

318
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,655
Not necessarily for

319
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,191
Attacking

320
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,727
Individual consumers

321
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,543
Protagonist company

322
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,079
Hey

323
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:40,127
If you want your thermostat to work

324
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:47,039
Pay this meeting points maybe it would attract consumers I just feels weird.

325
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:47,807
Especially

326
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:50,879
Cloud-based iot service providers that are at risk

327
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:54,207
And it wouldn't be hey do you want your thermostat to work it would be

328
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,487
Do you want your

329
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:57,023
10 million

330
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,327
Customers thermostats to work

331
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:00,607
Right

332
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:04,191
So yeah

333
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,471
Way better

334
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,847
Please don't use it

335
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:15,455
As soon as I read the news about how this new variant I think it's called Pacha

336
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:16,735
It's hit

337
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:19,039
N64 countries

338
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,575
And some of the various

339
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:25,183
Companies that it is hit I mean the major shipping company

340
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,207
Maersk is it

341
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,743
The proper pronunciation

342
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,279
They they were only able to

343
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:31,071
Send out like one of their shipping boats

344
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,095
Only one

345
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:35,679
Then they like one of the largest shipping providers around the world

346
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,727
As a result of being hit by this

347
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,263
You know

348
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,055
It got me thinking about

349
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:44,383
Boy the IRT service providers better

350
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:46,175
Better not get lock out

351
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,503
Just think of it again the scalability of how many

352
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,295
People be impacted if

353
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,575
A Samsung

354
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,599
SmartThings

355
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:54,367
Platform

356
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,903
Was locked out of the top

357
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:58,719
A wink and Nest mean there's just so many

358
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:01,791
Especially if it has a ransomware

359
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,071
Kind of

360
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:05,375
Attached to it it's one thing if your device doesn't

361
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:08,447
So if you get a message

362
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,215
My device doesn't

363
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:10,239
You're like

364
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,263
Son of a gun

365
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,799
And you get kind of frustrated

366
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:19,455
Hey this platform has been compromised until Samsung pay

367
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:21,759
You know all your data belongs to us

368
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,551
And then I would say

369
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:26,367
That's a different level of freaked out cuz you're like

370
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:28,671
Yep I got who has access to Lake

371
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:29,695
When I'm home

372
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:31,743
When I'm not home my security alarm

373
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,023
That is a berry

374
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,559
But if they're attacking

375
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:36,607
Provider and not the consumer directly

376
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,167
That's going to freak people to hack out

377
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,703
Is it true that

378
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:46,591
Is it is it should I I think I mean this type of attacks or less about getting the data although I

379
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:47,871
Share your concern

380
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:51,711
I'm sitting here going I walk up to my house and I can't unlock my front door now

381
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:56,575
And neither can any of the other three million people or router many that have the same lock as me

382
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:04,767
Yep that's true

383
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:08,607
I don't carry it

384
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:11,679
I have my watch or my phone that has the app

385
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:12,959
It's a Kwikset

386
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,519
It is just use a screwdriver

387
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:19,103
I can't believe you went there

388
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,639
It's true

389
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,687
I have a Kwikset lock

390
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:28,831
Vanitas Z-Wave screwdriver

391
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:32,415
Thanks I'm changing my lock now

392
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:34,719
You're like great did you send this to me you did

393
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,559
Not mocking it locks anymore

394
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:42,143
This attack is really scary it's spreading very quickly

395
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:45,215
It's part of a new type of attacks just like wannacry was

396
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:47,519
They call them network-based attacks

397
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:49,311
And we could go into that

398
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:51,103
Stop that

399
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:54,175
To tell you that this is actually a big deal because it's hitting

400
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,455
Infrastructure

401
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:57,247
Not just computers

402
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,271
So

403
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:01,343
This attack picture or variants of it

404
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,879
Which confusingly is called

405
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:04,415
Not not yet you

406
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,487
Is

407
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:12,351
It's running a muck and the way to stop it do we have a way to stop at yet I don't

408
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:16,191
You know what that there was a report

409
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:20,543
I want a security researcher that if you created a read-only file with a certain name

410
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,847
That it would stop it

411
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:23,871
And I know that

412
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,919
One email provider

413
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,199
Tank in Germany

414
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,735
Has disabled

415
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,527
The email address

416
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,367
Of we're supposed to send the Bitcoin but that's a problem because

417
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:39,487
Now even if you want to pay it you can't so that it doesn't seem like the smartest solution to me

418
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:42,559
Yeah that I saw that and I was kind of like

419
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:47,935
You have a good excuse but if the hacker still doesn't give

420
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:48,959
What you doing

421
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:49,727
Still kind of screwed

422
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,519
So that's a very legal

423
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:52,287
Kind of

424
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:54,335
Weight attack

425
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,127
It's a big

426
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,151
And

427
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:59,199
Once again is highlights

428
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:03,039
How unready we are to actually move

429
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,575
Everything online

430
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:07,391
And how the old security models

431
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,695
Are now being exploited

432
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:11,231
Because we haven't adapted

433
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:12,511
To this agreement

434
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:13,791
So things like

435
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,327
How do you patch test

436
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,119
How do you deal with

437
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,399
Problems when they occur

438
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:24,287
How do you get people to upgrade to the latest version of os has on their computers because a lot of these

439
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,335
Types of attacks are on

440
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,103
Older

441
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:33,247
Versions of OSS

442
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:37,343
Industrial or even Medical Society

443
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,623
Yep

444
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,671
People who manufactured this

445
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:41,951
They don't support

446
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:43,487
Upgrades to a nice early

447
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:47,327
Which means if you're if you bought like a million ATMs you don't want to update

448
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,351
Beto's in potentially

449
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,119
Break all the stuff

450
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:51,679
You really want your vendors

451
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:52,447
Help there

452
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:59,871
I just I just had this conversation with my son who works at Wawa which is a convenience store chain on the East Coast

453
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:01,407
And we were

454
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:04,223
Discussing two nights ago on the deck I said what

455
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:06,527
Systems do your point of sale

456
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:09,599
Systems take baby touchscreens for ordering at the deli and all that

457
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:11,391
Windows 95

458
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:16,511
I said I said you know I mean

459
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:22,399
If I knew what I was doing I can come in there and you know a taxi sings of the virus he's like well you just have the point of sale

460
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:26,495
System that that may not be connected to our corporate system

461
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:30,335
But what if I held them Ransom across all 665 stores

462
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:33,663
And you couldn't take orders at your Deli how much would that cost your store

463
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,455
And then all the sudden he got silent

464
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:39,295
Yeah not to mention stealing people's credit card

465
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:43,647
Why will these you don't pay at those terminals okay

466
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:45,695
What are point

467
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:47,743
But they think they're safe and they're not

468
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:48,767
Exactly

469
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:50,047
And that is kind of

470
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:53,375
That is where we are today in that we

471
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,911
This is going to be a giant

472
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,703
Honking bass until

473
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:59,007
We get all of these old systems

474
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:01,055
Updated or out

475
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:07,199
I talk to people in the medical industry and they're like God we are like 15 to 20 years out from that because

476
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:09,247
Those purchasing Cycles

477
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:11,551
Even today people are still

478
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:14,111
At the board level or the purchasing level

479
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:18,464
Turn on Tech stuff so things that they perceive as being non-tech

480
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,000
Point-of-sale system

481
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:21,280
They're like

482
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:24,608
How do I really want to pay the extra money for security

483
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,912
And the answer is often no

484
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:33,568
I don't think they look at it I don't think that's the question they ask themselves or like do we need to upgrade a point-of-sale system know it's worth

485
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:36,896
Working fine how much would it cost how much would it cost to upgrade

486
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:37,920
Tiffany

487
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:39,712
Really not whatever MyPay

488
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:46,624
Guess what you could pick a cost you more lost Revenue by not doing it with another new from the Securities and they're not

489
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,392
Not looking at it that way

490
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,928
Not the equations

491
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:49,696
The people are

492
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:50,720
Making in their hair

493
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,280
That's all be terrified

494
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,304
And talk about the

495
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:55,584
Like

496
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,912
I have the new Eero routers that we talked about

497
00:21:59,168 --> 00:21:59,680
Couple weeks ago

498
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:05,824
I have been testing them but I will admit to not testing them too long because I came while I was in Costa Rica

499
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:08,128
One does not test routers

500
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:09,152
Vacation

501
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:09,920
This one.

502
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:10,944
Other people

503
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:13,504
So these are the

504
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,040
And Eero Pro

505
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:15,808
Routers

506
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:16,832
And they

507
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:19,392
Are more powerful the beacon is smaller

508
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:21,184
And plugs in

509
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,208
So it's kind of like a

510
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:22,976
Flume say it

511
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:24,768
Oh I need a little bit more WiFi coverage

512
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,560
Send

513
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,096
There's two things I can't

514
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:31,168
One is I could go all around my house

515
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:36,544
I did go all around by house testing like Netflix streams and that sort of thing which seem to be

516
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:37,824
The biggest test

517
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,592
I could come up with

518
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:40,640
I did not run a software like JP

519
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:42,176
Detest

520
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,456
The actual

521
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:45,504
Signal strength

522
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,528
6 megabits per second

523
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,832
In the

524
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,112
Clear reason

525
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:53,184
Like I did think about doing it and I was like you know what

526
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,464
Wi-Fi today

527
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:58,048
In many homes when you have sufficient

528
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,840
Connection and I've got a 305

529
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:01,376
Bit per second connection

530
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:02,912
So at that point

531
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:04,704
I don't actually

532
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,472
Care about getting

533
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,824
Even bad Wi-Fi is good Wifi in your house

534
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:13,408
Right so that the real issue is coverage it's so

535
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:15,712
Where can I go in my house

536
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:17,248
Inexperienced

537
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:20,576
And I think honestly that's how we should start testing

538
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,112
Because

539
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:26,976
Especially when you're a lot of the reasons people upgrade their Wi-Fi networks is because you know you're

540
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,000
Sticking up

541
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:31,840
Connect sprinkler in a garage somewhere in the garage has crappy WiFi

542
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:36,192
And you know that sprinklers only going to need like a 1.5 megabit per second connection

543
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:39,520
Right it doesn't need to Speed it needs the ability to communicate

544
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,544
Reliably in

545
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,312
Consistently

546
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:42,336
Exactly

547
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:43,872
That was my thinking

548
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:44,896
In this you guys can

549
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:45,920
Call and tell me

550
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:46,688
That that stupid

551
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,480
Ectasia Rock

552
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:50,528
So

553
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:52,064
IWatch all around my house

554
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:55,648
Everything worked I had a challenging area

555
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:57,696
It's actually worth

556
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:02,560
Contesting doorbells so I have this challenging area right outside my backdoor

557
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:05,376
So I went out there and I spent some time

558
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,912
With some connected doorbells

559
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:08,704
Those

560
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:10,496
Had better

561
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:13,312
Wi-Fi signals as measured from the doorbell app

562
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:14,592
Based on the DBS

563
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,384
So

564
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,944
It seems like these actually offer better

565
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,712
Pepperidge

566
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,296
Then my existing which were the old school year

567
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,368
Is this going to work for everyone

568
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:28,416
That's becoming the question with

569
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:29,952
By any answer is

570
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:30,720
I don't know

571
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:32,000
You really have to install

572
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:34,048
That's it that's kind of crappy answer

573
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:36,096
But it's it's a fair

574
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,656
Answer because everybody's

575
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:43,264
Infrastructure is different your house or townhouse your apartment your office building

576
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:47,360
It all depends on the layout depends on the materials

577
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,896
That are used to construct it

578
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:51,456
So you can't say it's going to work for everybody

579
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:52,224
Nobody can

580
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:53,248
But

581
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,320
You can eventually I don't know if they do it yet

582
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:58,368
You can add the extra Beacon

583
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:01,696
So if you have really crappy coverage

584
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:04,512
You're going to be able to buy a beacon in just be like

585
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:06,560
And plug it in

586
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:07,840
So

587
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:10,144
The Eero beacons $149

588
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:11,936
Enable ship in July

589
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:13,472
It also doubles as a night light

590
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,056
Mine is currently up mine is actually in the roof

591
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,080
On the roof

592
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:19,872
On a roof

593
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:20,640
In a cabin

594
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:21,408
It's so

595
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,944
The night light does not

596
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,712
Really

597
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,832
Help their the idea of the night light is actually one so you don't stick it in the cabinet like I did

598
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:32,928
Depreciate

599
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:34,464
Appreciate is not the word

600
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,232
Where do you usually

601
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:40,352
Negative negatively impacts the signal

602
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:41,120
Thank you Kevin

603
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:42,400
But

604
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:44,192
You can put this in your hallway

605
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:49,312
I actually thought about putting in my hallway because I always right about those doors weren't testing those doorbells and I thought

606
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:51,872
Good way to add connectivity there

607
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:58,784
There was also announced that they were going to launch to Services when is a security service in one is a parental control service

608
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,344
Those are not available on my test app

609
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:07,488
So do not test those but I'm really eager to test those cuz for $10 a month it's something I might actually buy

610
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:08,768
Yeah

611
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,560
Well that's it on the Eero

612
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:11,584
It's time for

613
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,608
Kevin

614
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:15,168
How to say sayonara in for us to

615
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:16,960
Take a message for my sponsor and then

616
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:17,984
Come back

617
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:23,872
For some really cool tips on how to build and manage connected products this is a product manager who's built

618
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:25,920
Any iot products were going to talk about

619
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:27,712
Sustainable business models

620
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:29,504
How to talk to your engineers

621
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,272
And more

622
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:32,576
Stay tuned for all of that

623
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:38,976
And we'll see you next week everyone we are breaking into the Internet of Things podcast

624
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:44,608
Message from our sponsor sponsor is TE Connectivity and I have Nick Langston

625
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:48,960
Head of Business Development at TE Connectivity to talk about the smart

626
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:54,592
So let's kick this off with a quick reminder what is TE Connectivity do

627
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:56,384
TV connectivity mix

628
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,408
Sensors

629
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:58,432
Antennas

630
00:26:58,944 --> 00:26:59,712
Huge variety

631
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:00,480
Connectors

632
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:02,784
That appear in all manner of device

633
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:06,880
Message from consumer electronics to Home Appliances that Aerospace

634
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:07,904
Medical devices

635
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:09,696
We're here today to talk about

636
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:11,488
How I can get a smart kitchen

637
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:12,768
What we see happening in the

638
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:14,048
Today is

639
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:17,632
Device manufacturers are adding sensors that take advantage of

640
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:18,912
Increase precision

641
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:19,936
To enable

642
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:21,472
Usersub make meals

643
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:22,240
With

644
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,520
More consistency

645
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:25,056
With less effort

646
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:30,688
They're also really focused on using this increased Precision in sensing to improve efficiency

647
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:32,480
We're in the business of manufacturing

648
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:35,552
Watches that can get those jobs done for everyone

649
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:40,160
And when you think about it there's a lot of different places in the kitchen that are really rather harsh be

650
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:44,000
Because exposed to extremely low temperatures extremely high temperatures

651
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:46,048
Exposed to a lot of moisture

652
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:49,376
A lot of motion it takes a particular skill set

653
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:50,400
To design

654
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:51,168
Sensors

655
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:53,984
Connectors and things that can withstand assorted

656
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:54,752
Environment

657
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:59,104
Precision sounds really awesome but it also makes it sound professional

658
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,640
How can the smart kitchen

659
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:02,176
Actually help everyone

660
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:03,968
We think about the

661
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:04,992
Smart kitchen

662
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:06,016
As being

663
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:08,576
The area in the Smart Home

664
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:09,344
That

665
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,904
Really begins to deliver a lot of value

666
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,184
To the public

667
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:13,952
Early on

668
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:16,768
People on connected home things

669
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:21,632
Because the kitchen is the place where we really begin our lives at home

670
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:27,264
It's all about what's cooking what's going on how we talk to each other how we gather as a family that'll happen

671
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:30,848
In the kitchen and if we can leverage sensing

672
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:31,616
And connect

673
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:32,384
Activity

674
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,688
With all of the data now available

675
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:36,480
What about us as individuals

676
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:42,368
And What Makes You mistake online then we can leverage that to live healthier and happier life

677
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,952
For example if we think about a week when

678
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:46,720
Weave

679
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:50,560
Just nailed it and everything's gone right for us we can look back on that week

680
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:55,168
It's okay I had two healthy meals I didn't know reason had a lot of junk food that I had good activity

681
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:56,704
Think about a bad week

682
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,472
Maybe you say I am

683
00:28:57,728 --> 00:29:00,288
Too much junk food I was traveling a lot of fast food

684
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:02,336
With the smart kitchen

685
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:03,616
Your appliances

686
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:05,152
May actually be able to

687
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:09,248
Know about your current health they may communicate with your

688
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:15,136
Wearable device to know what kind of activity you had during the day and they can leverage artificial intelligence

689
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:16,672
To understand what

690
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:17,696
Sort of Neil

691
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:18,976
You should be eating

692
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:22,048
Hear a t e connectivity we want to provide the

693
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:22,816
Sensors

694
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:25,120
Activity and even the system

695
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:27,168
That helped make that possible

696
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,192
In appliances

697
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:31,008
The Senate May look like something like a wireless

698
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:32,288
Power and data trend

699
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:33,056
Ignition system

700
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:38,176
Some new cooking appliance whether it says sous vide circulator or

701
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:40,224
Smart coffee machine

702
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:44,576
Where can people go to find out more about TE Connectivity

703
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:46,880
We invite the audience to check us out

704
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:54,048
Ged.com connected home

705
00:29:54,304 --> 00:30:00,448
Hey everyone about them to the Internet of Things podcast this is your house

706
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:01,472
Stacey Higginbotham

707
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:06,336
And today I have an awesome guest for you guys his name is Daniel Elizalde

708
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:09,408
He is the founder of tech product manager

709
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,200
And today we're going to talk about

710
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:17,344
How to introduce your own iot products to the market or how you should think about that if your company is trying to do this

711
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:20,672
Thanks for coming on the show this week

712
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:23,488
Thank you so much for having me and really excited to be

713
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:26,560
I am too I'm excited you're here because

714
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:31,424
My gosh I see a lot of companies saying Hey to the mix

715
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,216
We're going to watch a connected product

716
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:35,520
And then they do something and it's terrible

717
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:39,104
So I'm hoping that maybe this conversation will

718
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,640
Stop a little bit of that from happy

719
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:43,456
Boston I come up to you and I'm like that

720
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:44,736
We need some IRT

721
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:45,760
Is that really the right approach

722
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,832
Yeah that's a really good point because

723
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:50,112
That's what I see a lot of

724
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:50,880
Company

725
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:52,672
Today pay here that iot

726
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:54,208
He has all this potential

727
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:54,976
Opportunities

728
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:58,048
And then

729
00:30:58,304 --> 00:30:59,072
We need an iot

730
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:01,376
Aetna really not understanding

731
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:08,288
Iot is just a tool that can help

732
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:13,408
Solve the customer's problem in a better cheaper faster way

733
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,480
So by understanding what problem did really trying to solve

734
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:21,088
Then you can analyze if iot with all these components and all the benefits

735
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,880
Actually the right Solutions

736
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:26,464
And once you have that understanding you can go through

737
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:29,792
Process to understand all the different pieces

738
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:31,072
How they fit together

739
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:32,608
If there's a business case

740
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:43,360
Jump that step I launched into

741
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:44,384
We're building

742
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:46,688
So let's have identified

743
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:53,088
Problem is it safe to say that there's probably a few more steps once I've identified that problem before I should launch into

744
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:56,416
Yes there's actually a lot of different

745
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:58,208
Places that you can go through to

746
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:00,256
Valley Faith with her. Problem is

747
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:02,048
First of all that's a traditional

748
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:04,352
Weather. Problem is worth

749
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,120
I'll be

750
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:07,424
But then once you figure out that your company

751
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:09,472
That's found a problem when solving

752
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:12,032
And they are well suited to solve it

753
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:13,056
It's not the same thing

754
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:15,104
And you can go into

755
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,152
The process of understanding

756
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:19,200
What it would take to do it from an iot

757
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:20,992
That's where

758
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:22,528
I think there's a lot of

759
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:28,416
Confusion between companies because iot sonido and it has so many different components

760
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,488
Even if they're able to identify the problem

761
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,536
The transition from

762
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:34,560
Strategy to

763
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,656
A lot of things get lost bear

764
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:39,936
Alright so

765
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:41,472
How should I

766
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:42,496
Think about this

767
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:43,264
Cuz like

768
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:44,544
For a while

769
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:50,432
A lot of connected products were coming on the market and they basically were like you can control XYZ from your phone

770
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,456
And most people are like

771
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:52,480
That sounds great

772
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:56,320
Actually I don't to pay three times as much for something

773
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:58,624
Like to turn on crock pot for my phone

774
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:01,440
How do I get people to think about

775
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:04,256
Connectivity and really applying it to

776
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,632
I guess useful make sense for their business

777
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:12,448
The way I think about it is that

778
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:13,984
Dislike song

779
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:16,032
What are the problems that companies

780
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:18,080
Particularly are trying to solve

781
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:19,872
They already have those problem

782
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:21,920
So companies are coming up with

783
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:22,944
New problems

784
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,224
Barefoot products

785
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:24,992
So bad

786
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:26,016
Are the ones that

787
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:27,552
Falling to this

788
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:29,344
Not enabled

789
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:33,696
But let's say that you are a manufacturer that sells

790
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:34,720
A particular

791
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:35,488
Type of

792
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:36,512
Epic Motors

793
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:38,304
And then your customers

794
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:39,328
They are

795
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,352
1 C to

796
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:46,752
Get more value out of those Motors because they say that they are discussing the money because there's

797
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:50,336
So the customer already has. Problem

798
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:53,152
And you have been having that problem

799
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:54,688
Forever we discussed

800
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:57,760
Society doesn't really opening

801
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:02,624
How can you apply this new technology to solve that problem in a better way so that

802
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,392
You can provide

803
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:04,928
More value to your crush

804
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:08,256
Ultimately they don't care about iot

805
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,072
People don't buy a

806
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:15,168
Customer doesn't really care about how

807
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:16,704
Take care about

808
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:18,240
How you going to help them

809
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:19,776
Bottom line

810
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:22,080
About my opinion

811
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:22,848
I don't like

812
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:25,408
Problems with companies

813
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:27,456
And how can you enhance that

814
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:30,272
Caballo tea to bring more value to your customers

815
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,088
Okay so

816
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:34,624
Maybe I should think of this is

817
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:40,512
Classes of problems that the internet of things are adding connectivity consol what would those be

818
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:46,912
Challenges that we have with the term biote is that it's all-encompassing

819
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:49,472
Anything that connects to the internet

820
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:54,080
And 1/2 component on the difference

821
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:59,200
But there's a big difference in the car

822
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:00,992
Solutions for healthcare

823
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:04,064
Consumer products like wearables

824
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,344
Smart buildings

825
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,904
Smart TVs to military to energy

826
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,184
So I think that

827
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:09,952
The class

828
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:10,976
Problems

829
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:14,048
Are going to be dependent on the industry that you're serving

830
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:17,888
You're going towards the industrial manufacturing setting

831
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:22,496
The challenges that they have always had have to do with up time

832
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:24,800
Reboot of their production line

833
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,080
Purchasing cost

834
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:31,456
If you're looking at it

835
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:34,016
Call Darius

836
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:35,040
Convenience

837
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:37,856
Give me five different systems of data

838
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:41,440
So that's the kind of problems you can solve

839
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:45,024
Kindred Healthcare well that's a highly regulated area so

840
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,584
Problems that have to do with

841
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:54,240
Ensuring Precision of instrumentation to be single time

842
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:59,360
There's no one killer application for iot

843
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:03,712
One solution

844
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:05,248
Classes of problems

845
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,784
Which detergent

846
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:08,064
Solving approach

847
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:10,624
With the corresponding Eye Institute.

848
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:11,904
One of the things that I see

849
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:14,976
It's a different process

850
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:16,256
Understanding

851
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:17,792
Who are the customers

852
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:19,840
Anubis digging into what

853
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:20,864
Text problems

854
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:22,656
So sometimes

855
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:25,472
Even if you were focusing on a specific vertical let's say

856
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:26,240
Black building

857
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:27,264
And

858
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,056
You are creating a product

859
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:30,080
Connected

860
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:33,664
A device that controls the air conditioning to say

861
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,432
Energy

862
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:39,552
Buildings need to save energy there for dissolution is going to work out

863
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:42,624
But it turns out that when you actually do

864
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,464
Some user research

865
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,256
Care about serving energy

866
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:52,864
That much they really cared about the other colors not be running in there cooking

867
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:56,192
Or their security in the building so

868
00:36:56,704 --> 00:37:02,848
All the sudden you have this companies that come in with IBS

869
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:05,152
Back from the customer

870
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:10,016
Could be okay if I cared about that problem

871
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:13,600
Let's get into this idea business models because

872
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:18,720
I think a lot of companies throughout connected products and services without thinking about

873
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:21,024
Supporting them over the life there Prada

874
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:24,608
So their business model doesn't necessarily match with

875
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:26,400
Product that they put out there

876
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:28,704
I think people are realizing that

877
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,984
They made some mistakes

878
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,080
Child services on a product

879
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:36,640
But

880
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:38,944
How do you advise companies to

881
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:43,040
Identify their problem and then before they even start building

882
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:44,064
Product to think about

883
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:44,832
How they're going to

884
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:46,624
Pay for it or how they're going to charge cup

885
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,816
Converse all these different areas

886
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:55,584
In order of

887
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,400
Understanding

888
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:00,704
On the way aye

889
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:03,264
Set this up is in a way that is Progressive

890
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,592
So once you understand your users and understand your data

891
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:08,128
And having a date

892
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,944
Ticketfly see a lot of companies doing is that

893
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:12,736
They say we're going to going to

894
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:15,296
Add sensors to whatever we are selling

895
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:16,832
And that's it

896
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:19,904
When you probe deeper text what are you going to do with that data

897
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,440
I will figure it out later

898
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:23,744
And it turns out that later Never Comes

899
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:27,328
A lot of fees in the clouds

900
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:28,096
Space

901
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:29,888
Storage Etc

902
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:33,216
By going through a process that can

903
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:34,496
Help you understand

904
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:40,128
All the different components of a solution

905
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:44,736
How long do you intend your system to be on the field and therefore

906
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:46,528
How long do you have to

907
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:49,856
Be able to get revenue from that customer can make it

908
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:51,392
Bible all those things

909
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:52,928
Is what I see is important

910
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:53,696
What to do

911
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:58,304
Even before you start for the types of before you raise Capital before you launch

912
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:00,608
I understand your data strategy

913
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:01,632
What is

914
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:03,168
Is model support that strategy

915
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:11,104
And that all of those things are interrelated because the technology has to be at a price point

916
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,128
45

917
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:13,920
And that's what all this change

918
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:14,688
Play together

919
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:17,760
If you add more data then

920
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:18,784
Cost you

921
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,856
Marcos Torres so therefore you going to have to charge more

922
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:24,416
And by being able to understand all these different

923
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:25,696
Complexity

924
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:28,256
Then

925
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:29,536
I'm more realistic

926
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:31,072
Memorial Estates

927
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:31,840
Road map

928
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:33,120
That actually

929
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:35,168
Pictures of passports profitability

930
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:36,192
As opposed to just

931
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:36,960
Cool

932
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:38,752
Technological solution

933
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:44,640
I'm sitting here looking at your iot decision framework and for folks who care I will put it in the show notes

934
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:46,176
But you got

935
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:47,200
You excited

936
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:49,504
So and that's actually less about like

937
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:51,808
Ux it sounds like

938
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:55,392
Well it is still your ex but it's more about identifying the need of your customer

939
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:01,024
You got the business model that you're going to work from the technology

940
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,352
Then you move to security so a thank you for having

941
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:05,632
Security in there

942
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:11,776
Is a lot of people feel like security something that should be designed in from the beginning

943
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:18,432
This is obviously a I think still before you put anything together but can you talk about like how you think about security and house

944
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:22,272
Please back with everything that you've talked about that comes before

945
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,832
Yes that's a very good point send

946
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:27,136
The reason I put security here

947
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:28,416
After technology

948
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:29,696
The way

949
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:31,232
I use this framework is

950
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,768
It's a matrix

951
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:35,072
So you look at each of those items

952
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:37,120
At each layer of the Earth

953
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:40,448
Iot technology stack support example when you looking at business

954
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:42,240
A look at the business implications

955
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:44,032
But then also

956
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:45,568
Empathize Hardware perspective

957
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:50,176
Application

958
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:55,040
You're going down then you have

959
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:56,064
Technology so

960
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:58,624
What cigar did you going to use to solve V

961
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:00,160
And then

962
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:01,952
Security cam player because

963
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:05,024
Unless you understand what the technology

964
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:07,584
What you going to say

965
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,888
Security risk management

966
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:12,704
It's a located that you should be able to

967
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:15,520
Beginning to end

968
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:16,544
Before you

969
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:18,080
Start developing anything

970
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:19,360
So in that sense

971
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:21,664
It is baked into your design

972
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,456
And then you have to understand

973
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:24,992
What security

974
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:29,344
You need a device Hardware other device off when they are a Communications

975
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:35,488
What's the worst that can happen

976
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:38,816
That's true and understanding your customer base is in

977
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:40,096
Port near to because

978
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:42,656
A medical device is very different

979
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:45,728
From a security standpoint than a consumer thermostat

980
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:47,008
Or a Bluetooth

981
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,824
And that's why in the framework but I have a case

982
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,384
Starting with ux witches understand your user

983
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:54,431
It's so if you understand

984
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:56,735
Persona 4

985
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:59,295
Different user involved throughout the life cycle

986
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:00,575
Then you can say you know what

987
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:01,599
Security

988
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:04,671
Even though we might be in a highly regulated energy

989
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:05,695
Well

990
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:09,279
Security is going to be most important for us at the device Hardware because

991
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:10,559
Physical tampering

992
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:12,607
I supposed to the car application

993
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,399
Assessment

994
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:15,423
And you say

995
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:18,751
Might different users care about Security in this difference

996
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:19,519
Layers

997
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:21,823
And I am comfortable with this levels of risk

998
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:24,639
Now here's the fun part of all

999
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:25,407
All this

1000
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:26,175
This

1001
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:27,199
Is a real

1002
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:31,807
And I think it's it actually is a very nice

1003
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:33,343
Way of thinking about

1004
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:39,487
It's also this is a very fast-moving area

1005
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:40,767
And so

1006
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:43,071
How much time should a company

1007
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:44,607
Take on this

1008
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:53,823
Put everything

1009
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:54,847
Together so

1010
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:57,919
All teams should be looking at you like salty should be looking at 8

1011
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:01,759
Ed

1012
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:04,319
But I do work substitute teacher

1013
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:09,439
A week or so working with your team you can actually learn the framework

1014
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:17,631
You should be able to fill this out really quickly or so if you spending too much time on this

1015
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:25,567
So that you understand all the different things and you make the fish

1016
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:27,359
And my

1017
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:30,431
To go with a minimum viable product

1018
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:31,967
You always going to be learning

1019
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:36,575
But at least

1020
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:37,855
And then turn right on

1021
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:39,647
And the other thing is that

1022
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:43,999
Isolation because the industry moves so far my recommendation is

1023
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:47,327
Look for Market fit before everything else

1024
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:49,631
A lot of companies that are coming from

1025
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:53,471
Having hyperthyroidism having a lot of experience there

1026
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:54,751
They thrive

1027
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:55,775
Forecast

1028
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:59,359
They want to have the cheapest product

1029
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:00,895
Smallest products in Market

1030
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:02,687
And I

1031
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:03,967
Paint that is actually

1032
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:05,759
Putting the cart before the horse

1033
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:08,575
Do something even if it's broken

1034
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:12,927
With other types of components from third-party vendors

1035
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:14,207
So that you

1036
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:15,231
Verify that the

1037
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:16,767
Traction in the market

1038
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:20,607
Watch contraction in the market then you can actually start by finding your offering

1039
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,399
To make it faster

1040
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:23,935
Cheaper smaller etcetera

1041
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:25,727
And

1042
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:26,751
Here's a tough question

1043
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:29,055
Cuz I think a lot of the benefits that

1044
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:31,359
Connectivity will bring to businesses

1045
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:35,711
Is an Ashley in a physical product in some cases it might be a service

1046
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:39,295
And I'm thinking of things like you know being able to order a Domino's Pizza

1047
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:40,831
Amazon

1048
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:43,135
In this this feels very

1049
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:47,487
Physical product oriented but I'm curious if this can be adapted to

1050
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:53,119
Just probably thinking about how connectivity everywhere is going to disrupt

1051
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:54,655
All kinds of businesses in

1052
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:55,935
Thinking about using this

1053
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:57,727
Even to deliver services

1054
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:58,495
Azure software

1055
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:01,567
Yes I can see that's a great observation in

1056
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:02,591
I think this

1057
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:04,383
Generic

1058
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:07,455
It has all the different components that you can eat

1059
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:12,063
And then ask your realtor Progressive than you can focus on a specific area

1060
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:14,623
Example of the echo

1061
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:16,671
The echo have all these components

1062
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:20,255
But as you continue to evolve it into stay now the echo

1063
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:21,535
Orders pizza

1064
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:22,815
Well that is just

1065
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:24,351
Focusing on the device

1066
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:25,375
Software area

1067
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:29,215
In the voice recognition and artificial intelligence

1068
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:32,287
So you can actually have

1069
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,103
And then it just touches

1070
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:36,639
Sum of the parts

1071
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:39,455
You don't have to do everything every single time

1072
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:40,991
What are

1073
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:42,783
Sir product mistakes

1074
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:44,831
They have gone before so

1075
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:47,391
What are some some ways that people have not

1076
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:49,183
Follow this

1077
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:50,207
How to fight them

1078
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:58,143
The first one is not understanding who your users are

1079
00:45:58,399 --> 00:46:00,703
And what problems are you really looking

1080
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:01,727
Salt for them

1081
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:04,799
So that it's a combination of

1082
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:07,359
Not having user

1083
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:09,151
And also the technology

1084
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:10,175
Leading the way

1085
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:11,455
I think a lot of companies

1086
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:13,503
Think that iot is going to

1087
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:15,807
Open your doors from a technology perspective

1088
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:18,879
The temperature to Dollar Tree without really understanding that you

1089
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:20,927
Another

1090
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:26,303
So the idea is that you can

1091
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:27,327
Add sensors

1092
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:28,095
2

1093
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:30,655
So that you can collect information

1094
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:32,191
2Pac somebody

1095
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:34,495
If you don't have a clue what the value is going to be

1096
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:36,543
Going to be really hard to

1097
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:37,823
Justify

1098
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:39,103
Cost

1099
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:41,919
Later or change it to your organization

1100
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:43,199
Or anything else

1101
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:45,503
Business

1102
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:47,295
You have to think that

1103
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:49,855
Other couple of my area that I think are

1104
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:52,415
Often not understood correctly security

1105
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:56,767
Speculation

1106
00:46:58,047 --> 00:47:02,655
Companies don't really take the time to understand what regulations are going to eat

1107
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:05,983
Especially if they're going to go to work

1108
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:08,031
Like energy or Healthcare

1109
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:10,847
You know what they're getting into otherwise

1110
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:11,615
It's never going to

1111
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:13,919
Adoption or purchase etcetera

1112
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:16,735
Other types of

1113
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:18,783
Examples of smart buildings

1114
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:19,807
Now

1115
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:21,855
You have to deal with building code

1116
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:26,719
Exchanges in different districts and municipalities and you have to have all the different

1117
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:29,535
I completely outside of the technologically well

1118
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:30,815
A lot of companies just

1119
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:32,095
Don't think about that

1120
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:33,631
So my recommendation is

1121
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:36,191
Think about it

1122
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:38,751
I get the rice counseling to make sure you understand

1123
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:40,031
What the regulations

1124
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:43,871
And in the

1125
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:44,639
Area

1126
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:46,175
Regulation changes your back

1127
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:52,831
How do you ask your users what they want especially when we're kind of in this place where we it's like your users don't even know

1128
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:54,623
What they want

1129
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:57,183
Give them what they need not necessarily what they want

1130
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:05,887
And that's why I'm a big proponent uaccess

1131
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:09,727
Techniques that you can do to observe your users

1132
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:10,495
Their uses

1133
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:12,287
Won't be able to tell you

1134
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:14,335
What solution they want

1135
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:16,127
But they can tell you what the problem is

1136
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:18,431
And it's your responsibility

1137
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:21,503
To come up with something.

1138
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:24,575
Salt. Net for them in a way that make

1139
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:25,343
Makes sense

1140
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:28,927
There are a few of my favorite things

1141
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:33,535
To observe your users in the wild identify who uses our first of all

1142
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:38,911
And then go out there and spend the day with them and interview them even how they interact with their environment

1143
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:40,447
Problems first time

1144
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:41,727
Then

1145
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:42,751
Costume

1146
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:44,287
Identify the problem

1147
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:45,567
Keep that

1148
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:49,151
Discovery and research mentality swap

1149
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:54,783
And other

1150
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:56,063
Types of Technology

1151
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:58,623
But they need to make it deeper into

1152
00:48:58,879 --> 00:49:00,927
Iot is what

1153
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:02,463
To be a part of everything

1154
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:06,047
Needs to be part of the toolbox if any product manager

1155
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:07,583
So that we can understand

1156
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:09,887
And then

1157
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:13,215
Only then proposed what solution to fit them

1158
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:15,519
All right

1159
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:17,823
Thank you

1160
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:19,871
Thank you so much for having me

1161
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:21,151
Really exciting

1162
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:24,735
To be able to have this conversation with you

1163
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:26,783
You just had it with

1164
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:33,183
