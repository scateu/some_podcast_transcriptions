This week sponsor is chocolate 64% of iot customers report problem

Web server aquatrax architecture Regional patterns system

Get started today and chocolate. IO that's chocolate auk

49
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:56,992
Let

50
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:57,760
.

51
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:58,528
IO

52
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:02,112

00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:03,136

00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:05,184
Which I did have a few problems with

55
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,024
So heaven

56
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,304
Let's get started

57
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,072
Which

58
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:11,840
Voice

59
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,888
We got some new stats from Adobe

60
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,192
None of these really surprised me

61
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:17,984
But I will admit to having

62
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,544
I think I hard voice

63
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,824
Smart speaker user

64
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,848
In Seattle came out

65
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:28,224
The big thing is 70% of people report using a voice assistant

66
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:30,272
Music 64%

67
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,808
Museum for weather

68
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:34,368
53% use it to ask fun question

69
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,648
All of that is true

70
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,184
Children laptop

71
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:42,816
The I don't ask fun questions me maybe before the show is we're just kind of goofing off or something

72
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,352
Not so much in everyday life

73
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,448
Not so much I know that on my Echo Show sometimes it'll show me

74
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,472
Questions to ask

75
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,264
Ask Madame a

76
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:54,336
What we call Amazon Echo

77
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,104
Ecosystem

78
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:55,872
Assistant

79
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:57,920
So we don't set off yours so it's like

80
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:00,736
Ask Madame what the big news is today

81
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:02,272
My daughter in heaven

82
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,808
Oh

83
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:05,344
What is the big news

84
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:06,624
And that's usually

85
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:12,256
Yeah and you're right about this report from Adobe they asked 1000 us

86
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,024
Smart

87
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,584
Speaker owners what they do with their devices

88
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,192
It wasn't anything any new activities or like old I should try that but what was interesting is

89
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:22,752
Be kind of rank the usage patterns

90
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:24,544
And those stats you just

91
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,128
Phone number for primary activities the ones that I use

92
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,920
Are the emerging use cases

93
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:33,504
Which is weird because I've been using these for so long and I guess

94
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,040
I don't know I just weird but

95
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:38,624
I'm looking at things like only 31% use them for smart on the commands

96
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,648
4

97
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:40,928
Yeah or

98
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:43,744
36% from making calls

99
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,048
That is more of an emerging use case because that's

100
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:46,816
More

101
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:49,632
Relatively new features I get that one

102
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,680
The people actually asked about their calendar.

103
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:56,032
Schedule for sports scores just as much as I do smart home commands

104
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:59,360
I'm like wow maybe just cuz we've been doing the smart on things so much

105
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,640
Longer than most people

106
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:01,408
Yeah I think this

107
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,176
Said we're definitely

108
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,760
But we are definitely

109
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,040
Yeah

110
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,832
And I was actually curious so

111
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,368
Food delivery

112
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,648
Domino's has had

113
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,720
A skill for a while

114
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:16,512
Hotel and flight research

115
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,280
Are you doing that

116
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,815
No not there

117
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,351
Okay that was my thought

118
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,167
Set a temperature to be like

119
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:30,079
Maybe just maybe it is a really good feature that we're not using because I mean we book travel and when you do it

120
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:33,407
Later I do it I typically go through an app or through the web

121
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:35,199
Yeah I'm almost all web

122
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,039
Because I want to see all the options in right now

123
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,319
My apps are all like

124
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:42,879
That's just crazy

125
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:49,279
Yeah so other things to know is 32% of consumers reported owning a smart speaker in August 28th

126
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,071
Looks like a third of

127
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:51,839
Consumers

128
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:54,911
Here in the US this is compared to 28% in January

129
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:57,727
Of this year so it's a 14% increase in 8 months

130
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:58,495
And

131
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:03,103
I don't know I didn't think that makes total sense to me people are constantly sending in questions

132
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:03,871
Stop the show they're like

133
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,151
Hey which one should I get

134
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:06,431
For I just bought one

135
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,711
What should I do now

136
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:09,759
Basically people are more

137
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:12,063
Comfortable really curious

138
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,599
Cuz it talks about

139
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:16,159
How people who have these start becoming

140
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:17,951
You mentioned

141
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,487
That your family doesn't

142
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,511
Like talking to

143
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,559
Smart speaker is that changing at all

144
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:23,583
You know

145
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:28,703
If you were to just ask me and I can think of that I take that is not changing and all they barely use it

146
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:29,983
I have to admit

147
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,519
As I think back

148
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,055
Oversaw the past

149
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,591
Seizure year-and-a-half

150
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:37,663
They probably do and I think of cases like

151
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:41,247
Are downstairs lights come on before dusk every night

152
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,271
Automatic just have

153
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:45,599
But if it's cloudy out it's a little darker before that

154
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,135
So my wife

155
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:51,743
Is sitting in the living room and it's dark and she will say Madam a turn on the downstairs

156
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:55,583
Not maybe that's because there's really not much of an alternative for her because

157
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:58,911
You know she knows if she messes or touches switches in the house

158
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:00,191
That's going to mess things up

159
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,471
So maybe it's by

160
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:06,079
Sheer lack of choices but yeah she's doing it she doesn't seem as self-conscious about it

161
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:09,407
Voyager wife

162
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,687
Pretty much

163
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,527
It's forced adoption

164
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,063
Okay

165
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:16,831
So

166
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:21,439
Not really speaking voice actually but this is the other side of switches

167
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:23,231
Something else idevice talking to you

168
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:25,279
Maybe instead of you talking to a device

169
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:27,327
If this then that or if

170
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,143
We talked about it all the time

171
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:35,263
We use it till I connect web services to devices or web services to other web services

172
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,799
Using simple if this happen

173
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,335
Do that to me

174
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:40,895
They have an integration now with Sonos

175
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:43,199
Yay

176
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:43,967
So

177
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:46,015
Michael was to create

178
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,551
I have a right now I'm testing

179
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,319
Nest

180
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:54,975
It is sometimes the doorbell chime

181
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:56,255
I think this is the nest issue

182
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,559
I think it's tired

183
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,583
Is that a legitimate

184
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,351
Excuse I don't know

185
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:02,911
But I was like when people press the doorbell

186
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,191
Let's have the Sonos make

187
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:08,799
Unfortunately the nest is not supported and if that particular

188
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,591
Aspect of it

189
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,383
Cameras seem to have support

190
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,151
Vanessa

191
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:13,919
Ecosystem

192
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:23,391
And I just been playing with my weird motion sensors are things happening

193
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,415
X

194
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,695
You do need to be careful

195
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:28,255
It becomes really irritating really quickly

196
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:31,071
Like for example when your phone gets into your Wi-Fi

197
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,095
Zone

198
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:32,863
Having

199
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,143
George theme song play

200
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,679
It sounds like a lot of fun

201
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:36,447
But

202
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:39,519
It kind of sucks when you come into your wife

203
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:42,591
It's like 2 in the morning and everybody Sonos comes on

204
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:53,087
Yeah I could see that being annoying so coming home from say travel or something yet were even like if you hooked it up with

205
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,879
They supported webcam that one

206
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:55,903
Camera saw you

207
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:56,927
Walk in the house

208
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,719
It would play your songs or whatever

209
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:02,047
If somebody taking a nap or something like that that's probably not cool

210
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,351
You can set time limits oh

211
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,375
Unless it is

212
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,143
Between

213
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,423
10:00 at night

214
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:10,751
Sexy morning I have to be careful because my daughter has a Sonos in her

215
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,799
And she goes to bed earlier than everyone

216
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:17,407
Just little things to think about but you can't have a lot of fun with this

217
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:20,479
I think an interesting use case would actually be a button

218
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:22,271
So if you have their lots of

219
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:24,575
Logitech pop buttons I've tested

220
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:27,135
Pebblebee buttons a lot of those are supported

221
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,159
On if

222
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:30,207
And you can actually create a button that plays your

223
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:32,767
Your favorite song

224
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:35,327
Your favorite playlist

225
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,679
I feel like coming on

226
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:40,447
Quick

227
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:43,519
Aside from choosing like a predefined

228
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:44,799
Centos favorite

229
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:47,359
Song album artist cetera playlist

230
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,127
You

231
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:52,991
Get quite a bit of functionality here generation aside from basic playback controls

232
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:56,831
Pause resume next previous you can even control the volume so

233
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:59,903
You have a doorbell and supported in the doorbell rings Maybe

234
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,183
They couldn't mute

235
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:04,511
This I know so you can go answer the door and peace and quiet

236
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:08,351
That is actually one of my favorite things that the yonomi software did

237
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:10,399
I just started this I'm glad you mentioned that

238
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:12,191
Whenever my phone would ring

239
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,519
It would actually mute my Sonos has that were playing

240
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,823
Which is kind of sucky if

241
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:18,591
Like my daughter

242
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,663
My phone re

243
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,247
Insert news cases this is actually really nice

244
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,015
And

245
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:29,087
You know you could actually set that up on your iOS or Android

246
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:29,855
Easily

247
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:34,463
I wonder I haven't looked at the new if denigration but I wonder if you can

248
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,487
Set this to

249
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:38,303
Specific Sonos devices so that if you have multiple ones

250
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:40,095
Maybe your daughter is doesn't mute button

251
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,631
The one in your living room

252
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,727
So I kiss you

253
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:46,751
A lot of options

254
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,543
Moving right along

255
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,103
Okay next we have a ginormous

256
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,895
Semiconductor deal

257
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:55,711
You guys know how much I love my semiconductor

258
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:57,247
So this is Renee sis

259
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,015
It is

260
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,295
Agreed

261
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,367
To buy integrated device technology Inc

262
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:05,183
46.79

263
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,463
This helps

264
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,999
Renee says get into

265
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,023
Semiconductors

266
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:11,327
Sand

267
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,351
You guys may not be

268
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,399
Here where this but today's cars have

269
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,959
So much silicone on them it is a

270
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:17,983
Huge deal with

271
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:20,031
Qualcomm CSR

272
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,055
And

273
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:21,823
Then later when

274
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,151
Tried to buy nxp automobiles were actually the driving

275
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:33,343
Shell Manassas is second only to nxp in auto-related chips and it's got about 30% of the market

276
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,879
Kit for microcontroller

277
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,159
So

278
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:38,975
It does need the analog chipset integrated device

279
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,535
And just so you guys

280
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,071
Analog chips are those that can

281
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,095
Convert analog stick

282
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,631
Signals like sound waves

283
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,679
Analog day

284
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,215
Any sort of physical

285
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,007
Happening in to digital

286
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:54,079
And that's really important cars for like pressure sensors

287
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:58,687
So this isn't like a super secret

288
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:01,759
Kind of deal is part of a larger Trend in

289
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:04,575
Consolidation among semiconductor manufacturers

290
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,599
Part of this is

291
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,367
Because

292
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,903
As you get into iot

293
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,951
Average selling prices of the

294
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:10,719
The chips

295
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,743
Are much lower

296
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,791
You are selling a whole lot more

297
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:14,559
But they're cheaper

298
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:16,095
So you really need a lot more

299
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,631
Is a scale associated

300
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:21,727
He had two quick notes to the store a man it's good news

301
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,263
For Sure Fit industry

302
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:25,823
This is the second big acquisition

303
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:31,199
Vanessa says made this year and those two Acquisitions including the 6.7 now total 10 billion dollars

304
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:33,503
That's a big chunk of change they bought

305
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,295
Intersil witch again

306
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,575
Yes analog ships

307
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:38,623
Free sample but the other thing to know

308
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,671
And I know this IDT which

309
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:43,743
Okay yes they have chips that they can supply for the automaker's

310
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:47,071
They only generate 11% of their revenue from Automotive

311
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:49,375
Industrial businesses so I just wonder if

312
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,679
It's a big price to pay for

313
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,215
For what they're getting we'll have to see

314
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,495
I don't know

315
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:59,359
Global did put Renee cesana negative credit watch

316
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,895
A lot of crazy stuff

317
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:01,919
S&P

318
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:02,687
Did not monitor my

319
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,551
Let's see

320
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:10,367
Qualcomm introduced a new one for wearable

321
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,391
Devices

322
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,159
And

323
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,183
Kevin saunderson

324
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:20,095
So it's good that they are introducing this but I am a little mitt on it I'll tell you why

325
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:23,167
So for those who don't know just about every single

326
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:23,935
Google

327
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:26,751
Android wearable now it's called where OS I apologize

328
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,287
Wear OS watch

329
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,823
Runs on a Qualcomm

330
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:32,639
Snapchat in chat with the old 2100

331
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:35,199
It came out 2 years ago and even then it was

332
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,991
Kinda getting a little long in the tooth

333
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,015
Now

334
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:40,319
It's good that Qualcomm Snapdragon wear

335
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,855
3100 is now

336
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:49,023
And there are no devices out with that yet although Montblanc has announced that they will have one very soon and I'm sure

337
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,071
CES but

338
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:53,887
Two thoughts here one is that it's really not that

339
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:54,655
Chip

340
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,447
Hardware that's been holding

341
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,727
Google smartwatch

342
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:58,751
Back

343
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:05,151
I'm sales is really been a kind of mediocre user experience with the interface which is changed majorly 2 or 3

344
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,431
Now so that's

345
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,455
Part 1 of this

346
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,479
Part two is

347
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:10,015
The 3100 chip

348
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:10,783
It

349
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:15,647
Is good in that it offloads most of the low-power stuff to a low-power

350
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:22,047
Processor that's also on this chick it's like a big little architecture there's two chips one that's heavy-duty processing and

351
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,327
One that's like processing

352
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:28,703
But it's not a major change in that chip technology from the 2100 it's really meant to boost battery life

353
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:31,263
Be smart watches so don't expect like

354
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,103
Major Performance gains although there probably be hard to measure in General on a smartwatch

355
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:41,503
The apps are so small but it just seemed like a very incremental thing for them to do when they could have done it a while ago to be honest

356
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:42,783
So that's why

357
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,319
Me mail

358
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:46,111
I am

359
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,183
And the reason why

360
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:50,463
Why is because

361
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,231
They

362
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,767
Qualcomm with this chip

363
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:57,119
They've introduced a low-power coprocessor that uses

364
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,935
What's called near threshold design okay

365
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,215
Are you guys ready

366
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:01,983
To get nerdy

367
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:04,287
This is a big deal so

368
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,823
Near threshold design

369
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,359
Has been buried

370
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:10,431
Early-stage Cutting Edge

371
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,455
Is

372
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:14,783
That you are basically giving the chip enough voltage

373
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,063
You're getting it

374
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,855
Plenty of voltage so you know it work

375
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,391
It's going to flip the switch

376
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,415
Which RAID is going to happen

377
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:21,695
Plenty of house

378
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:23,487
Your threshold says

379
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:25,279
We're just going to give you

380
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,071
Just enough

381
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,863
It's really hard

382
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,679
To do tight transistor design

383
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,727
Things like leakage become really important

384
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:35,263
So

385
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,543
There's no margin

386
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,079
And

387
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,103
It's pretty cool

388
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:42,175
And the fact that welcomes doing it because they do a lot of there

389
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,711
Manufacturing process

390
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:46,783
That means this is going to be accessible

391
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,319
To a lot of company

392
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:50,623
Significantly

393
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,159
The power

394
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:55,999
I'm going to tell you there's another chip company

395
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,303
And they actually do

396
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,839
Sub-threshold design

397
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:00,863
Just like this

398
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:01,887
Even more so

399
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,167
And those guys

400
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,191
Are in

401
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,495
Huawei wearables

402
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:07,775
Aspire

403
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:10,591
Wearable that you basically tape into your underwear

404
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,871
Tracks your activity

405
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:14,175
And other stuff that lasts for like a year and a half

406
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:16,223
So this is a really

407
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,503
Big deal

408
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,551
What Kevin sizes of matcha

409
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:21,087
In that is going to bring

410
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,367
Lower power

411
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,391
Coyote

412
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:24,671
Devices

413
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:29,279
I'm a little less may now

414
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,047
Okay

415
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:36,447
My Buddy Lee Ratliff who's an analyst he explains it really well he says power consumption is

416
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:38,239
Proportional to the square of the

417
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:41,055
So even a small decrease in voltage

418
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,079
Have a really big impact

419
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,431
If you slept through all of that

420
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,199
Wake up

421
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:49,759
Because nxp has announced a security chip for

422
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:50,783
Google iot Cloud

423
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:52,319
With an exciting name

424
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,343
Bissell wave people

425
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,159
Can I say

426
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:58,975
Let me see if I pronounce this correctly this is tricky

427
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:01,279
A71 ch

428
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,071
Nailed it

429
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:03,839
Thank you

430
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:05,375
So we don't have practice

431
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:11,007
We don't necessarily care about the name of the chip so much as we care about what this is this is linking

432
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,287
Security keys

433
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,567
To Google's cloud

434
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:16,127
This is very similar to the design

435
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,151
Microsoft azure

436
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:19,711
Project Sopris in the

437
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:20,735
You're linking

438
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,527
Particular cloud

439
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:23,807
Cloud OS

440
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:24,831
2

441
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,111
Security hard

442
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,647
Onnit ship

443
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:31,487
That's actually a lot of people look at that as the future of how we're going to develop

444
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,279
More secure iot devices

445
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,327
The fact now that

446
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,607
An excuse doing this for Google

447
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:37,631
Hey that's worth something

448
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:38,911
So that's why we

449
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:46,079
Now this this is a big deal named kidding aside is this a big deal nxp says that device credentials are pre injected in

450
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,103
Into the chip

451
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:49,919
And public keys are sent to the end-user through

452
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,967
Whatever interface is required etcetera

453
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:55,295
Security

454
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:57,343
The First iot Security bill

455
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:59,647
Has been approved in California

456
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:02,207
And is waiting at the governor's desk to be signed into

457
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:04,767
This is SB 327

458
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:10,655
Yeah so basically the big provision in this bill is that a manufacturer of a connected device

459
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:11,679
Shell

460
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:14,495
Equip the device with a reasonable security feature

461
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,263
Four features

462
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:16,799
That's a little

463
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:23,455
So that's concerning to me because what is reasonable security it just talked about authentication procedures such as

464
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:29,855
If it connected devices equipped for the means for authentication outside a local network there are two criteria that they Authentication

465
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:32,927
Systems must meet so unique passwords for example

466
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:36,255
Or it must proper user to set their own password

467
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,023
So this is

468
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,303
A good step forward

469
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,631
That's true in things like reusing Keys looks like it may not be

470
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,167
Acceptable

471
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,191
Under the sea

472
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:54,175
Password is 1 1 1 1

473
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:55,455
However

474
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:57,247
This is not an end all be all week

475
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,271
Because it does not deal with

476
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,039
Show me

477
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,343
TC security

478
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:03,135
But it is a start

479
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,671
We'll see how it is and

480
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:06,463
By the way we should update you on

481
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:09,279
Internet of Things cybersecurity

482
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,559
Improvement Act

483
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:11,839
Was in the US Senate

484
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:14,399
I didn't think this bill was all that other piece of cake basic

485
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:17,727
We talked about what devices the government should buy in the security standards

486
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:20,799
Pretty minimal but that isn't going anywhere right now

487
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:24,127
This is what we have in California's laws do actually 10 minutes

488
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:24,895
Enchiladas

489
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:26,431
Developments around the country B

490
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:28,991
Central State

491
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,527
So keep an eye on that

492
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:31,807
Okay

493
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:33,599
Moving on where security

494
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:35,647
Morbidness actually

495
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:37,439
Well one of them is the same button

496
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,463
And the other one

497
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:43,839
I think it's gasket and obviously everyone is Mariah and I

498
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:46,911
I tell you I'm wonderful ever stop talking about Mirai

499
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:47,935
Maybe in like

500
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:50,239
We just like

501
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:53,567
But tell us about

502
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:54,591
What's happening now

503
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:59,455
So the Palo Alto networks unit 42 has a new report out

504
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,735
MRI and

505
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:01,759
Gadget

506
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,831
Are basically moving beyond

507
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:09,439
The typical Target switch in the past we talked about such as connected cameras

508
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,207
And

509
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:15,071
Security systems and routers now it's moving into the Enterprise

510
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:16,095
It's because

511
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:18,143
The open

512
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:18,911
Source

513
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:19,679
Framework

514
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:20,703
Apache struts

515
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:27,103
Which is used for Java platform Enterprise Edition there's your Enterprise hook and was also what way

516
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:32,479
Was attacked in the Equifax breach last year they still unpatch Samurai is now targeting those systems

517
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:36,319
So now it's getting into potentially Enterprise job apps

518
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:40,415
That is not good so that's an expansion of targets there and then

519
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,439
Gasket

520
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:47,583
Which is also known as bad as light which is probably easier to say is attacking unsupported versions of

521
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,887
SonicWALL Global Management

522
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:50,911
System so

523
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:53,215
This is bad because it's going

524
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:54,239
Again Beyond

525
00:19:55,519 --> 00:20:00,639
Yeah that's firewall product for networks in Enterprises and such so that is

526
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:01,663
Also bad

527
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,199
Extra bad

528
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:04,479
Okay well

529
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,807
Alright so any

530
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:09,343
Good news on that for

531
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:12,159
Not till these things get patched

532
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:15,487
UNF it just speaks to a bigger issue here

533
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:18,047
Add button that's another iot device

534
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,327
Hacks and attacks

535
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:25,471
They're not limited to a specific type of device or a specific client or a consumer or Enterprise

536
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,775
There were widespread and then we'll just keep

537
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:29,823
Looking for things to in fact

538
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:36,223
And it's really scary when you think about how many connected devices are out there we talked about this all the time billions and billions and you know it just

539
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:38,527
How do you patch everything is the question

540
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:43,135
Bummer

541
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,927
But let's talk about some quick updates

542
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:45,695
Newspaper

543
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:46,719
All right

544
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:49,279
Kevin I'm going to give this to you cuz you're the guy who found it

545
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:53,631
You know nobody seems to remember that but you're right and that we talked about in the podcast

546
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:56,447
Yes probably early August maybe Late July

547
00:20:56,959 --> 00:21:01,311
Yeah I noticed an FCC filing for Samsung SmartThings tracker

548
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:05,663
And it was going to work with both Verizon and AT&T s

549
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:06,943
LTE

550
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,479
M1 Networks

551
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:11,039
And sure enough it just got an ounce this week

552
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:13,087
So think of this like a

553
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:14,367
Bluetooth tracker

554
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:17,184
Only doesn't use Bluetooth but if you have a tile or

555
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:22,816
Some other similar tracking device this is just like that except it has a GPS and it connects to

556
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,352
The in first case

557
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,888
AT&T network

558
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:27,680
It will cost you $99

559
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:34,080
It's real-time tracking again because of GPS you can set geofencing with it works with SmartThings and there's even a panic but

560
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:37,152
Just nice so you can use it as a personal tracker if you don't want to

561
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:38,432
Attach it to your luggage

562
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:41,504
$99 includes AT&T service

563
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,576
The first year after the first year you're going to be paying

564
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:45,600
$5 a month

565
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:47,136
Or $50 a year

566
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:49,184
Available later this

567
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,744
Tweek actually at select AT&T stores and

568
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,512
Samsung.

569
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:58,656
Compsych resume my Verizon model follow very soon because the FCC tested also for Verizon's

570
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,704
Those prices

571
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,496
Cesare kind of insane for tracking my luggage

572
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:04,288
Put

573
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:06,336
I mean in your kids backpack

574
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,360
If I were kidnapped

575
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:09,920
Which I am not doing if I were

576
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:11,456
The first thing I would do is throw away the

577
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:14,016
It might work

578
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:18,880
I would actually my dog used to be able to escape my fence and run all over the place I would put it on my dog

579
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:21,440
I love these case for it I mean

580
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:25,280
Again because it's Tyler and so expensive you really have to have

581
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:27,072
A high-cost or high value

582
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:27,840
Item

583
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:28,608
To attach this to

584
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,656
Exactly I probably have to put this on my

585
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:31,936
Keys to my car

586
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:37,568
Even though that is a high-value thing because I have a spare key and so on so forth but I'm one of a kind item that it is

587
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:39,360
How to replace or has

588
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:43,712
Things that you need for an essay trip in your luggage yeah I would do that

589
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:45,760
It's just that $5 a month through

590
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:47,040
It's me

591
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:48,320
The first years included

592
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:56,000
I paid $10 for that what I get for that for me personally is

593
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:58,560
My family knows where I am all the time because

594
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:04,960
It is tracking the GPS and so on in there and they in is uploading information to them if they need it I also get

595
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:06,496
Get all my calls and my texts

596
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:12,896
My notifications I don't care about that when I'm out and about running or something but it's nice to have the ability to even make it

597
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:14,944
A call from my wrist without my phone

598
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,224
If I get hurt while I'm running

599
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,272
So you're buying

600
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:22,112
I'm not buying peace of mind because darn it I'm worth it

601
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,392
You are worth

602
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:25,952
Maybe 15 a month I wouldn't I wouldn't do it

603
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:26,720
59 net worth

604
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:35,168
Alright here's an update I complained last week

605
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,728
Two weeks ago I think about my June oven

606
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:38,496
And

607
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:39,264
How

608
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,080
I felt like it a chain recognize my toast anymore

609
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:44,128
It turns out

610
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:46,688
That June check the logs because they can do that on a

611
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,736
Device and they're like Stacy

612
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:49,760
You have a giant

613
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:50,784
Greece

614
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:54,368
Which is exactly what Kevin told me

615
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,672
How to say that Kevin

616
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:00,000
I checked your logs to just so you know

617
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,048
John Kerry

618
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:04,096
You know exactly how many waffles

619
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:07,936
Is a little disturbing to know that if June wants to they could be like

620
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:08,960
Ayo Stacy

621
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:10,240
You cook a lot of

622
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:11,776
Eggo waffles

623
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:14,592
But you know what they always whenever you

624
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:16,384
Request support help they asked

625
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,152
Commission

626
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:18,432
To view your logs

627
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:21,504
Are they doing the behind-the-scenes I doubt it could that yeah

628
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,088
But I mean any company could look at the date of their getting from the device

629
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:28,160
You know I'm making a baked potato or

630
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:31,744
I'm not cooking anything

631
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:38,656
So you also and complaints we talked about the nest by Yale lock

632
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:45,568
Yeah that was our complaint show a week or two ago that's right the Google home integration with the nest by Yale lock

633
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:47,104
I know we talked about it cuz it was

634
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,896
Announce right before the podcast

635
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:49,664
A week or two ago

636
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,224
I couldn't get it to work no matter what I did and

637
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,248
Stacy it sent me a

638
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:59,136
Great set of troubleshooting steps from when she had works with nest for troubleshooting something similar in the past

639
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:00,928
I was just about to do that

640
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:01,952
When

641
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:04,256
All of a sudden I went to my Nest app

642
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,280
And it

643
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:08,864
Said there's a new application permission that we'd like

644
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,144
Access to

645
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,728
Really what is that and sure enough it was for

646
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:16,288
The ability to see the state and information

647
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:22,176
In from the nest by yella so the integration just hadn't ruled out to me yet so I did not have to do anything

648
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:27,552
So my complaining was kind for nothing cuz I was impatient but it does work now and I can speak to my

649
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:30,880
Home devices right now I'm not going to cuz I want to set PeopleSoft

650
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:31,648
And ask it

651
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:36,256
If the front door is locked I can tell it to lock the door and

652
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:40,608
I think that's it you might be able to assign specific codes cuz it is a touchpad lock

653
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:43,424
And two different people and then I could tell you who's home

654
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:45,984
Think that's a possibility but I want to check on me

655
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:51,616
Can you couldn't create a routine with it now though too

656
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:52,384
Oh yeah that's

657
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,432
Set up

658
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:55,200
Movie times

659
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:55,968
Lower the thermostat

660
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:58,016
Turn on my Sonos

661
00:25:58,272 --> 00:25:58,784
Businesses

662
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,832
No it doesn't work with

663
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:03,136
All right

664
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,464
Okay quick update for everybody who follows

665
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,744
He connected blinds

666
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:13,120
Story it turns out that Ikea has submitted documentation to the FCC

667
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:14,400
Did blinds

668
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:17,728
Okay you guys have everything

669
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:20,544
The most common show question but we do actually get this question about

670
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,080
Hey I want smart blinds

671
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:25,664
And so this being Ikea I expected to work with the truck

672
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:30,528
I also expect it to be cheaper than the current options which are

673
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:33,600
Are kind of expensive there is my smart blinds which is one of the cheaper one

674
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:35,648
Works with wooden slat blinds

675
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:36,672
The big one

676
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,976
And that is $99

677
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,024
Window

678
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,048
And there's a limit

679
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:43,584
How big that blind

680
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,608
Dang it will move

681
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,960
There is a Lutron Serena Shades Hunter Douglas has somebody has some

682
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:50,496
Soompi

683
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:52,032
Has Raquel expensive

684
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:53,568
Which is why I don't have them

685
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:56,128
Will post the motorized shades are expensive

686
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:58,432
Adding connectivity to motorized Shades is not

687
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,480
A big cost Sterrett

688
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:02,016
Motorized

689
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:04,576
The shade coz motors have to

690
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:06,624
In some cases a lot of cloth

691
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,392
And they have to be

692
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,672
And

693
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:11,488
In some of the fancier iteration so I have motorized shades

694
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:12,256
To my house

695
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:13,536
Ginormous

696
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:15,328
Windows and those were $10,000

697
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:16,352
Which is

698
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:17,888
Bonkers so

699
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:19,168
But they cover

700
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,448
A 10 x 40

701
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:21,728
So

702
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:24,544
There's a lot of fabric to move they actually plug into

703
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,592
Dedicated low voltage

704
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:28,384
It was a quiet

705
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:30,176
But most people are good

706
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:36,832
Agreed well I'm not so that's why I don't have them and Ikea products do tend to be less expensive I mean

707
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,368
Look at the Tron freeline it's

708
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:41,696
Cheaper than most other smart home device lines

709
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:42,464
So I'm hoping

710
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:48,352
And I don't think we'll have to wait too long because IQ usually announces their new products in

711
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:50,912
Stay

712
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:52,960
Real quick

713
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:55,008
Question about the trophy

714
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,032
Hub

715
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:58,080
The radios that supports

716
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:04,736
I'm assuming it's zigbee FaceTime looking at the FCC report and based on that frequency that they tested High assume this is

717
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,112
You can

718
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,696
The custom music me I can't remember if Sha

719
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:16,000
Something else yes

720
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:17,280
You have to have

721
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,816
Particular hub

722
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,608
You can't link it I could not link my

723
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:22,400
Tri-C lights to other

724
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:26,496
Even if you have a zigbee hub if it's not

725
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:27,776
I tried freehub you won't be

726
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:28,800
Able to use these person

727
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,592
Boo

728
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:33,664
So yeah

729
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:36,736
Okay

730
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:38,272
Let's talk quickly about

731
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:40,320
The new brilliant

732
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,600
Light switch and

733
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:43,136
Smart home control devices

734
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:44,928
I've actually been testing it

735
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:45,696
It came out

736
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:49,280
Not a good time for us cuz it was after his last week's podcast

737
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:50,048
Live

738
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:50,816
We can talk about it

739
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:52,608
But I have been testing it

740
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:53,888
It is a

741
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:54,656
Light switch

742
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:59,776
Which one switch panel so that replaces when switch is $300

743
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:02,080
And it goes all the way to 4 switch panels

744
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:03,872
449

745
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,480
So what these are they replace your existing light switch you do have to be

746
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:10,528
Comfortable turning off your power and

747
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:12,576
But it's not hard

748
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:14,624
I'm not going to recommend these just yet

749
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,672
We're going to have the CEO on the show

750
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:17,952
And we'll talk more about WhatsApp

751
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:18,976
I think

752
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:21,792
In a few months this is going to be a very different product

753
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:23,328
I would recommend

754
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:26,144
But for right now it has a lot going

755
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,448
And DUI is in

756
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:29,984
It's not great yet

757
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:32,544
So I think it be confusing for most Norm

758
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:35,104
People if you are dedicated smart home user

759
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,896
It'll go ahead you're used to

760
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:38,176
Playing around with stuff

761
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:39,968
Things improving over time

762
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,248
This is fine

763
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:42,784
What it does is

764
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,832
Access a light switch

765
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:46,368
Also acts as an intercom

766
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:47,648
Taxes

767
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:52,000
A Madam a device and it ties into a variety smart

768
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:53,536
Products like the ring doorbell

769
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,840
The Sonos WeMo

770
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:57,120
Hue Lights

771
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:58,144
Nest

772
00:29:58,656 --> 00:29:59,424
Coming soon

773
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:00,704
And also smart thing

774
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:01,728
So

775
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,288
That's a lot of things that you can do with it

776
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:06,592
You can set scenes in idea is

777
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:09,152
You walk in and you can use this

778
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:12,480
To control your home via voice or via a touchpad

779
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,016
Touchpad

780
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:14,784
Screen

781
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:16,832
What I found

782
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:20,160
The touch pads too small to control all the devices

783
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:20,928
Really easily

784
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:22,976
What I think is really interesting though

785
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:24,256
Is you could install this in

786
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:26,816
A couple places in your home and actually control all the lights

787
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:28,096
Which

788
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:30,144
When they figure out the user interface in

789
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,216
Easy I think this could be real

790
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:40,384
It could be anyone shown me we did a video hangout you show me a little bit of the usage in

791
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:46,784
It reminds me of the old wink relay in some regards which had a touch screen and was able to

792
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:50,112
To literally show that your wink shortcuts in your devices on there

793
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:54,976
But I still think there might be a little bit of work left on the southwest side for the brilliant

794
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:58,560
Okay so now let's talk about the integration

795
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:01,632
I started out just played with a plane

796
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:02,400
And

797
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:04,704
I will say one of the nicer features because

798
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:07,776
Casitas way it was being able to upload my own photos

799
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:10,848
Taranis panel so it's like this neat little digital photo frame

800
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,664
You can only do 25 and it's kind of time-consuming youku

801
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,944
Individually upload each photo

802
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,480
But it is really nice to like

803
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:17,504
Walk by the slice

804
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,272
Pictures of my

805
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:21,344
Some things that were

806
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,904
Hard is once I brought in my Hue Lights

807
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,952
There's a little glitch Inus in bringing in

808
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:28,000
One of them didn't show up

809
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:30,816
And then to control all of them is

810
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:31,584
1 unit

811
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,376
Was a bit time consuming

812
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:34,912
Like to actually create

813
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:37,984
Make a schedule for my living room because there's no way to group

814
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,544
Light bulbs yet

815
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,080
There's no way to group light bulbs into

816
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:43,872
And that's

817
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:46,944
Kind of frustrating cuz I don't no one really wants to control

818
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:51,296
Not in the same room

819
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:52,576
So

820
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:55,648
That's one thing they do say that that's coming in two to three weeks

821
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,952
So is a non hacked

822
00:31:58,976 --> 00:31:59,744
Nest integration

823
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,512
And they're just waiting for

824
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:04,864
And you can create scenes and those are interesting in the Sonos integration

825
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:08,448
Is actually doing really well for them it only likes to

826
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:10,240
Favorites R radio station

827
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:17,152
And if you need to control for like deep dives into specific songs

828
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,200
So

829
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:20,480
Do I love it

830
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:21,760
It's all right

831
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,064
Do I think it's going to get better

832
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,136
Yes oh and SmartThings the SmartThings integration is

833
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,952
You can't control all of the devices

834
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:31,488
You can put into your smart

835
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:34,560
And then with the Amazon Echo

836
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:35,584
Croatian

837
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,120
It actually sometimes

838
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:38,400
It won't play music

839
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:43,008
But it does do things like when you ask it for the weather it'll show you the weather

840
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:46,848
It doesn't do all the things

841
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:51,200
Very much reminds me that wink relay cuz you could do a lot of things

842
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:52,480
Similar things in

843
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:53,248
Displace

844
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,064
Interesting Lee the photos is nice

845
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:59,136
Having to manually upload them somewhere is kind of

846
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:05,280
I don't know mm Forest to me but I understand why you need some kind of integration I only mention this because just

847
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,560
Earlier this week

848
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:12,960
Google opened up its Google photos API and that means apps can men have Integrations to

849
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:13,984
People's Google photos

850
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,520
The other reason I mention it is

851
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:21,920
Because for the next podcast you're going to have something that will automatically pull in your Google photos for you you want

852
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:23,456
Upload them it'll just be there

853
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:25,248
You know I'm talking about

854
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:28,576
Set me a Lenovo display

855
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:37,024
So that's what we'll talk about for now and how much is it that today

856
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:38,560
9 for the

857
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:39,584
1 gang

858
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,120
So the one switch

859
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:43,936
Which comparison like The $99 price for the wing

860
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:47,776
Yeah I was 99 and even came down in price after

861
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:51,360
Not install they still have

862
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,432
2 switch panel which is probably the most common

863
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:55,456
Is 340

864
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:56,736
And they will bundle stuff

865
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:59,040
Oh and also works with

866
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:01,600
It looks

867
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:03,648
I mean I've only seen it on the Hangouts

868
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:05,696
But it looks like it's

869
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:08,256
Work that money just really pretty

870
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:12,608
It's a very nice device in the microphone on it is crazy

871
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,632
Search for

872
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:14,656
Kingdom anime

873
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:15,424
So

874
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:17,216
Actually turn that potion

875
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:18,240
Because

876
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:19,776
It was fighting with my other

877
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:22,592
Batman that a debate does more things so it's like

878
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:24,384
I want you

879
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,200
That's just me

880
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:30,272

63

887
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:47,680
74

888
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:48,448

Canada

891
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,824
And the US

892
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:54,592
Unfortunately

893
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:55,360
So

894
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:57,152
Remember smarter homes

895
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:57,920
Start

896
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:58,688
Which lay

897
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,272
And this week we have a question from an unknown individual

898
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:04,064
But it's still a really good question

899
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,088
So let's hear it

900
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,624
Stacey and Kevin

901
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:13,280
Long time listener and you guys had an episode while ago where Kevin talked about using his

902
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:15,072
Hue bulbs the color ones

903
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:16,352
2

904
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:17,888
Show different shade of

905
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:18,656
Colorlink

906
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:20,704
Red or blue I think Bass

907
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,984
On whether or not

908
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,288
Kevin stocks were trading well

909
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:28,128
I want to employ similar use but with temperature

910
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,968
So when I wake up I'd like for one of my color bulb to display

911
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:34,784
A blue or red in Greater intensity

912
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:35,808
Gymnast

913
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:36,576
Based on

914
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:37,600
Current temperature

915
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:39,392
I would love to know if this is possible

916
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:43,744
Philips Hue bulbs I use Google home and

917
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:46,048
And willing to do pretty much anything

918
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,840
Alright thanks so much

919
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,120
Okay

920
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:49,888
This is a great

921
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:51,936
Question and Kevin and I have actually both

922
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,984
Dumbest or variations of this in our

923
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:56,032
I've actually done literally what

924
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:57,568
So

925
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:59,104
I'm going to give you the easy answer

926
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:00,384
Kevin is going to give you a hug

927
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:03,200
Bez more fun

928
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:05,760
Yours is more fun and it has the potential to be

929
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:08,576
So my answer is

930
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:11,136
I set up my Hue bulbs

931
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:12,416
If

932
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:13,952
And then I just set up a

933
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:15,488
Basic rule that if

934
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,536
If the weather is

935
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:18,304
Above

936
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,888
You said do it in the winter so I do if the weather is above 40

937
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,168
Turn red

938
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:24,960
And if the weather is below

939
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:26,240
32

940
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,544
I did this in a light

941
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,616
Closet for a while cuz then I was like oh now I know how to dress in the morning

942
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:36,480
Is it perfect no cuz you have to set your temperature parameters

943
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:43,136
You're lying out of Weather Service that may not be directly outside your house you could if you have like a netatmo device you can link directly

944
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:44,928
The weather station

945
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:46,464
Right outside your door

946
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,512
Sometimes you have temperature sensors

947
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:50,048
Doorbells

948
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:50,816
Access them

949
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,864
So that's ways to get

950
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:54,400
Granular

951
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:55,680
At your house weather

952
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:57,472
But you also then after that you have

953
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,008
Reset the light

954
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:00,800
Or create another recipe.

955
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:02,592
Beckett

956
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:03,360
Go back to Norm

957
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:07,200
But that is an easy way to do it it doesn't cost you a thing

958
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:08,992
It works with your existing stuff

959
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:10,784
Play around with it till you get something

960
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:12,320
Luther's Cafe

961
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:17,184
The hardest way to do something simple that's my motto

962
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:18,208
So

963
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:21,792
What I did just to refresh everybody I literally created a

964
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:23,072
Python program

965
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:23,840
That

966
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:26,656
Reads information from an API

967
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:29,728
Other side Bitcoin cryptocurrency Trading

968
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:30,496
Services

969
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:33,312
So it's constantly every minute getting up-to-date

970
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:34,848
Numbers on the actual

971
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:35,872
Currency prices

972
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:38,688
And then I use another API based on information

973
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:39,968
And said hey

974
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:42,528
Turn on my lifx bulb to Green if

975
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:47,136
The price is up and even increase the brightness if it's up over certain percentage

976
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:49,952
So I have a super fine granular amount of

977
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:50,720
Control

978
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:51,488
Where

979
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:52,256
Yiking

980
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:53,024
Literally get

981
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,328
More precise India notification

982
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:56,352
Obviously

983
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:57,376
This is

984
00:37:57,632 --> 00:38:02,496
A program exercise and you need to have something to run that program on I use a Raspberry Pi for example

985
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:07,360
So you know you have to add something to your smart home you would have to do some programming

986
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:09,920
I've shared most of the code on our sites

987
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:11,968
It's a good stub to get started

988
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,576
But you also need to make sure that apis for your products are available

989
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:18,624
And in case of Philips Hue

990
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,648
Yacht there are

991
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:20,672
Apis

992
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:21,696
How to control lights

993
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:25,024
So it literally you could get temperature information using

994
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,608
The program and set parameters out of those will be your trigger events

995
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:29,632
If you

996
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:32,704
Compared to F and then what you want to happen

997
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:37,056
Would be an API that sends data to your Philips Hue Lights

998
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:39,872
It's going to require some effort on your part but it's

999
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:41,664
Stacy said it's something like a

1000
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:48,064
Do a lot more and could be reused in many other cases dirty easily just changing a few lines

1001
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,368
Zip code could information from another

1002
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:51,136
Source

1003
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:53,184
Maybe it's stockmarkets maybe it's

1004
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:55,488
If your mailbox

1005
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:57,792
Have been open in your sensor on it for example

1006
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,608
You can get a light to Blink when the mail is here

1007
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:04,960
Okay okay but I'm just coming up with

1008
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:06,240
Random examples

1009
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:10,848
But you're right yeah you know there's lots of ways to do this if it would be what I would recommend from us

1010
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:11,616
People yes

1011
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:16,224
So I would start their shirt into programmer you want to learn about apis

1012
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,760
You know it's a fun experience

1013
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:22,368
Two ways to go

1014
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,648
Just in case

1015
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:24,928
You're that kind of purse

1016
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:26,464
Yes

1017
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:30,304
I hate to be that guy but I don't want to be the only bad guy so please

1018
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:34,144
All right

1019
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:35,424
Now

1020
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,448
It's time for

1021
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:40,544
A word from our sponsor but stay tuned because our guest this week is an Bashi

1022
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:43,104
She's going to talk about why

1023
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:49,248
Iot providers need to focus on just a few use-cases what vendors need to do to mm

1024
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:50,016
Prove

1025
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:53,088
Their services or companies buying iot Solutions

1026
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,112
And

1027
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:56,928
Who's going to get wet chunks of the 502

1028
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,464
Million-dollar pie

1029
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,232
For the internet

1030
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:02,816
You're going to like it

1031
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:09,216
Hey everyone we are taking a break from The Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor this week sponsor

1032
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:10,496
Is that

1033
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:12,288
And I have json Van

1034
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,592
Who is VP of iot

1035
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:15,360
With sass

1036
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:19,200
Last week we talked about SAS creating a new division for iot

1037
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:20,736
This week we're going to talk about

1038
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:22,016
The edge

1039
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:23,296
So let's kick it off

1040
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:24,576
What is the value

1041
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:25,600
Us the edge

1042
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:26,624
In The Internet of Things

1043
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:28,928
I think the value can change

1044
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:31,488
Based on use case that the first element is

1045
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:32,768
Just a reduction

1046
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:33,536
Encaustic

1047
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:36,096
Transport and storage of data everyone sees

1048
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:36,864
Projections

1049
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:37,632
The number of

1050
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:39,936
Sensors that are going to be deployed in the edges

1051
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:40,704
The amount of data

1052
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,008
It's being generated in the fact is even

1053
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:45,312
Commodity transport commodity storage

1054
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,104
If you move everything to the network

1055
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:48,128
Into storage

1056
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:51,712
It's going to be quite expensive in the fact is most of the data is not valid

1057
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,296
The first capability is reduce that footprint of data you movie

1058
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:56,832
Through your network and then it really gets

1059
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:57,856
Listen to the youth cases

1060
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:58,880
Surround reduce lighting

1061
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:01,184
Ucn decisioning failure identification

1062
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,208
And yield Improvement

1063
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:03,744
And then within our cuss

1064
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,536
Centric Industries I like

1065
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:07,840
Betel or Healthcare it really provides the

1066
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:10,656
The basis for a unique engagement model with

1067
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:13,984
Unique messaging based on what you know about your customer

1068
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:14,752
Where they meet

1069
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,032
There you go

1070
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:17,824
It really does dairy buyer

1071
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:21,408
So everybody's talking about the edge these days

1072
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:23,200
What are the SAS differentiate

1073
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:26,272
So I talked a little bit about this

1074
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:29,088
In our last topic but it really has been about the invest

1075
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,368
And being able tax

1076
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,696
A lot of people talk at 10000 feet around the ability

1077
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:34,464
Push

1078
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,256
Assisting to the edge but it's quite

1079
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:37,024
Duplex

1080
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,304
Davis-standard

1081
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:39,840
Device configuration

1082
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:41,632
Invested

1083
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:42,656
Chablis in that

1084
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:44,704
With this verification validation effort

1085
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,984
To make sure that when we say

1086
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:48,800
Push a robust set of Analytics

1087
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:50,848
Capabilities to the edge that we can ask

1088
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:51,616
We do that

1089
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:55,967
And we talked briefly about them but what other industry verticals are working

1090
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:59,551
We're starting to see adoption across multiple

1091
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:03,647
There are those industries that have a long history with sensor data so we

1092
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:04,927
Racine early adoption

1093
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:08,511
Spaces things like energy both generation and distribution

1094
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:09,535
Transportation

1095
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:11,583
Is an area for wide adoption bothan

1096
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:12,863
Fleet Management and

1097
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:13,887
Autonomous cars

1098
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:15,935
So it's really not one industry that I

1099
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:16,703
.2

1100
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:18,495
To say they are leader in the space

1101
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:19,519
But there's white adopt

1102
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:24,127
Great if you want to learn more about what's ass is doing at the edge

1103
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:25,151
Where can we go

1104
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:27,199
We had a great landing page setup

1105
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:29,503
Or additional information whether it's Industries

1106
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:35,903
Specific or more horizontal capabilities that can be found at stats.com

1107
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:49,471
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your house Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest is an

1108
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:50,239
Vashi

1109
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:53,823
Who is a partner and leader in the iot practice

1110
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,359
With pain in calf

1111
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:57,151
Hi and how are you today

1112
00:42:57,663 --> 00:43:00,223
Angry Stacey thanks so much for having me on

1113
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:03,807
Super excited you guys have done some great report

1114
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:04,831
I just love

1115
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:05,855
Wow

1116
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:09,695
Lots of money and iot you talked about all kinds of really challenging issues

1117
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:11,487
So let's just get this started

1118
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:13,791
A level set where are we

1119
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:15,071
Industrial

1120
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:16,095
Enterprise

1121
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:19,167
We have done Recent research

1122
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:25,567
Over the course of the last two years in Time series to understand what the big changes are that we've seen in iot

1123
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:28,895
And the first one is

1124
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:30,431
It still is

1125
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:31,711
Really attractive

1126
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:34,015
Which I think most of your

1127
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:37,087
Listeners would agree with the market Revenue

1128
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:38,623
Circulation providers

1129
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:40,415
Thor Solutions

1130
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:43,999
2 / 500 billion dollar

1131
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:45,279
Aa2021

1132
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:46,815
Which is more than Java

1133
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:50,399
Today but that is a tremendous thought

1134
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:52,447
Also what we found

1135
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:54,239
Customers are really planning

1136
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:55,263
A lot more

1137
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:56,543
Contact

1138
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:57,823
Kidding

1139
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:58,591
Contacts

1140
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:01,407
Fantastic it's really accelerate

1141
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:03,967
The other thing that we found out is that many

1142
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:04,991
Temperature

1143
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:08,575
Haitian so it's really interesting that they could do anymore

1144
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:09,855
But really

1145
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:10,623
Location of

1146
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:13,439
Piece of rolling out and the pace of

1147
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:16,511
Inexpensive implementation

1148
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:18,047
Has actually Fallen

1149
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:19,839
It's a lot of energy but I see

1150
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:20,863
September

1151
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:23,423
And so some of this is really adjusting

1152
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:26,751
That there was probably in mm

1153
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:27,519
16

1154
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:30,335
Birthday today

1155
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:33,663
Continued barriers to adoption but people are finding

1156
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:34,943
As they're starting

1157
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:36,223
And engaging on Twitter

1158
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:38,783
We can talk a little bit more about those

1159
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:39,807
Okay and we will

1160
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:44,159
But first I want to dig into this 500 I think is 520 billion

1161
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:45,183
Was the number that

1162
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:45,951
You guys

1163
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:47,487
So who gets that

1164
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:50,559
Because there are a lot of different players happening right now

1165
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:51,327
In

1166
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:53,631
The industrial iot in Enterprise iot

1167
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:54,911
Teethers the big kind of

1168
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:56,703
Traditional it guys

1169
00:44:56,959 --> 00:45:01,311
There's a bunch of steps and then there's the traditional old school

1170
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:03,103
Honeywell emerson-johnson

1171
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:05,407
Zeidman's all of these guys so

1172
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:06,431
How does that money kind of

1173
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:08,223
Divvy up yeah I guess

1174
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:09,503
I would say there's a lot of

1175
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:12,063
For many different pocket

1176
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:14,111
The first one is

1177
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:20,511
There is actually very interesting opportunities for the traditional technology players especially when it comes to

1178
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:24,095
Kill a couple of things conductivity obviously for the

1179
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:27,935
Cisco's in Ericsson but the world as well as the

1180
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:33,311
Spiders obviously this opportunity

1181
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:34,335
84

1182
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:35,615
The cloud provider

1183
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:39,199
Microsoft

1184
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:40,991
As well as the private

1185
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:44,063
Providers that companies like idea

1186
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:46,623
For example and then

1187
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:47,647
I think the other is

1188
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:49,951
Providers

1189
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:53,279
Now I think you've mentioned it so there's a lot of

1190
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:57,119
Point you kids application

1191
00:45:58,143 --> 00:46:02,495
And then there's also application development

1192
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:06,847
Integrators

1193
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:09,151
And then of course you can't

1194
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:12,479
Leave the felt that you were talking about like a Honeywell or

1195
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:18,111
Schneider or GE that are providing Industrial Equipment because they also have

1196
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:22,463
Unity to music operational Technologies

1197
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:25,279
Stand not to use iot data

1198
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:26,815
Really there's a lot of money

1199
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:30,655
Starview at Bain is that there is not

1200
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:35,519
Billy broad-market Steve

1201
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:36,799
I would say there is many

1202
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:41,663
Vertical here and there's opportunity for many winners across is vertical

1203
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:44,479
Awesome yes I would be terrified if you said one

1204
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:46,271
Get it all or even to really

1205
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:53,439
Funny baby I feel like we get that question a lot who's going to be the winner and IRT

1206
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:54,975
Everyone does love a winner

1207
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:57,023
Just a singular winner so

1208
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:59,583
Okay what's the point of this concept of

1209
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:01,375
Pilot purgatory

1210
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:05,471
Because it's fun to say and you talked about maybe reality setting

1211
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:06,495
A little bit more

1212
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:07,775
In this field soap

1213
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:09,055
What exactly is

1214
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:10,847
Going on as these projects

1215
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:13,663
Get halted at the pilot stage we're going to stay there indefinitely

1216
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:15,455
Yeah sure

1217
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:16,735
So I think that

1218
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:17,759
There's a lot of

1219
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:20,831
Obviously

1220
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:22,111
Search with customer

1221
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:24,671
And our findings at the

1222
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:26,975
Billy around mm

1223
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:33,887
About 40% of the executives that we interviewed

1224
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:34,911
More likely

1225
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:39,263
Getting proof of concept

1226
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:45,663
20%

1227
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:47,711
In the number of tfv4 happening

1228
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:49,247
Let me talk with the band

1229
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:53,855
They talk about how expensive

1230
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:57,695
Backpack

1231
00:47:57,951 --> 00:48:01,023
When you say how extensive the asks are

1232
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:02,047
Do you mean like

1233
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:05,631
The number of companies a ski or do you mean like they want a whole heck of

1234
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:06,399
Save-A-Lot

1235
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:10,239
Exactly

1236
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:12,031
Okay so these are happening

1237
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:16,639
And what's happening inside these companies as they're doing them and they're like oh

1238
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:17,407
What is a learning

1239
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:22,015
While they're learning a few things so the first one is that there's still a lot of beer

1240
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:24,831
Adoption that haven't really been broken down

1241
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:26,367
We found at the top

1242
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:28,927
3 issues that customers are facing

1243
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:30,207
Into the barrier

1244
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:34,559
Feeling pretty

1245
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:36,351
They were 2 years ago

1246
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:38,911
And so the first one is around Sakura

1247
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:40,959
It's the most acute

1248
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:42,751
Challenge that customers are facing

1249
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:46,847
They might be okay

1250
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:48,895
Contact that is a ringtone

1251
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:50,431
But then thinking about

1252
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:51,455
Scaling out

1253
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:52,991
Without me

1254
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:55,807
Security capabilities on the device or the app

1255
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:56,831
What concern

1256
00:48:57,087 --> 00:49:01,951
Protecting the data is something that keeping them from

1257
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:02,975
Probably at least

1258
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:05,791
Extensively I think that people are implementing

1259
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:07,071
But there's

1260
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:08,095
Probably.

1261
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:11,167
Practice security

1262
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:12,191
Challenge

1263
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:13,471
Concern

1264
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:16,799
To increase the number of devices

1265
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:20,127
And actually even probably

1266
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:23,199
And for those of you guys

1267
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:26,015
Who don't speak chart in ASP is average selling price

1268
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:30,623
The second one is around

1269
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:31,647
Return on it

1270
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:34,719
And so I think the safety you might have heard that

1271
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:37,279
Folks that are implementing

1272
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:41,631
New kinds of ukases that you dial TJ.

1273
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:42,911
Problems on both sides

1274
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:44,191
The Returned

1275
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:48,287
Inside

1276
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:50,079
Lack of clarity

1277
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:51,103
I got on

1278
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:51,871
What

1279
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:55,711
In terms of upside and I think benders-hadi

1280
00:49:56,735 --> 00:49:58,015
To really characterized

1281
00:49:58,271 --> 00:49:59,295
What the value is

1282
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:02,111
Buying

1283
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:04,415
Customers are buying

1284
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:06,207
Decision

1285
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:07,487
The ability to

1286
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:13,375
A producer's be there for increasing the velocity of their supply chain

1287
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:17,983
Enfield vendors need to translate the data

1288
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:18,751
Allowed

1289
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:22,079
Customers make better decisions and showed up in the prison

1290
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:24,127
Cut that flips on The Returned

1291
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:25,663
Lack of clarity of

1292
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:26,431
What kind of

1293
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:27,967
Turn that should expect

1294
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:29,247
MMA

1295
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:31,807
Cute is that the investment

1296
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:34,623
Zhuhai and that's for a couple

1297
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:35,903
The first one

1298
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:36,671
Really around

1299
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:37,695
How much cups

1300
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:42,303
Station is happening today each of these implementation Austin

1301
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:43,071
Is very

1302
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:47,935
Develop to deliver

1303
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:52,031
Have less repeatability been in a more mature

1304
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:54,079
EXO vendors really need

1305
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:56,639
Hate to drive more repeatability across

1306
00:50:57,151 --> 00:51:00,735
Keep it so they can understand some more

1307
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:03,807
Common component and you really get them better

1308
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:07,135
Out of the box but I think that would help on the

1309
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:08,415
Investment side

1310
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:09,695
Is that ladder bit

1311
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:15,071
Possible because I feel like a lot of the customers are the ones that demanding this customization

1312
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:21,471
In part because maybe their workforces and is familiar with it so they're building these highly complex Dash

1313
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:25,567
Words for people or it could even be you know just their equipment is so

1314
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:27,103
Particular to them and that

1315
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:27,871
Particular

1316
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:30,687
Figuration

1317
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:37,343
Between

1318
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:39,135
There's no way that you

1319
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:43,231
Sinnoh customizer are always different

1320
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:44,511
There's actually value

1321
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:46,047
Standardization

1322
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:47,071
And so

1323
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:49,119
How to trade off right

1324
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:51,935
Can have a lower investment and more standardization

1325
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:53,983
And so I think they're just actually

1326
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:55,007
The challenges

1327
00:51:55,263 --> 00:52:01,407
There's not really an offer yet today

1328
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:08,575
I think there is some truth in what you say

1329
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:10,879
To all I got

1330
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:13,695
There's going to be

1331
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:17,279
Elevation here

1332
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:23,679
Rebate application

1333
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:28,799
Vibe and then stomach pain walkers on sale software

1334
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:29,823
Relationship manager

1335
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:31,615
Tool

1336
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:38,015
Paradise more than there has been today I just think the vendors haven't had a

1337
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:42,879
Cato's in a particular vertical

1338
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:44,927
With a particular type of equipment

1339
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:47,999
You know they need to actually identify those little cheese

1340
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:49,279
Parts that actually could be

1341
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:51,071
Okay

1342
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:53,119
I feel like the vendors

1343
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:56,959
You have some strong feelings about what they are and are not doing

1344
00:52:57,471 --> 00:52:59,007
What would you be telling them right now

1345
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:01,311
Kind of funny

1346
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:02,079
Because

1347
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:06,431
Same thing just like you said you know pilot Purgatory on the cusp

1348
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:09,759
When we talk with vendors

1349
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:10,527
All different

1350
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:16,159
Pollution

1351
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:19,487
The concept that are going on and they're trying to figure out why

1352
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:21,023
Which one is actually

1353
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:23,327
John Deere trying to figure out

1354
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:26,911
Can be repeatable because from their economic

1355
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:28,447
Doesn't work either

1356
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:29,983
To have something that's custom

1357
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:36,383
Time and so they would like to also reduce the amount of customization but they're having

1358
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:38,431
What's challenging about this

1359
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:39,967
So bright

1360
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:43,039
Play it's like an opportunity

1361
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:44,831
And so

1362
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:46,623
Aiden Mesa technology

1363
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:50,719
He market like the horizontal technology

1364
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:57,119
Vendors that are capturing that 520 billion potentially in the future right there so many of them

1365
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:58,143
I actually need

1366
00:53:58,399 --> 00:53:58,911
2

1367
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:02,239
We spoke at

1368
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:03,519
That I

1369
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:08,639
That's just too many you can't actually figure out how to

1370
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:12,991
A particular UK If you're focused on 80th

1371
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:14,015
Wait

1372
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:20,415
And so what we suggested that vendors really reduce the amount of verticals that their focus

1373
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:21,695
Initially

1374
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:26,047
Look at what their customer base actually looks like we're to have to go

1375
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:30,399
Where could they have some repeatability and that they're delivering

1376
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:35,519
How many verticals should a particular company try to focus on and is it dictated by like

1377
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:36,799
If I'm a startup maybe I should pick

1378
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:39,359
Three if I'm someone like Microsoft maybe I should

1379
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:40,383
5 +

1380
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:43,199
Work with dedicated Partners how does that actually look in

1381
00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:47,039
We would actually say that even for a large company

1382
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:53,439
Microsoft

1383
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:54,207
Good night

1384
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:57,023
Probably two or three UK.

1385
00:54:57,279 --> 00:54:58,559
Target

1386
00:54:58,815 --> 00:55:00,607
And then for a startup Austin

1387
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:13,663
Repeatability

1388
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:15,711
So we suggest I guess

1389
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:18,527
If they take a particular

1390
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:27,231
Just on the horizontal component that they might so you know servers Ark

1391
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:27,999
They also looks

1392
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:29,279
Or how do I act

1393
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:42,847
What are the challenges that we haven't talked about yet is this idea of

1394
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:45,919
If I am a big industrial manufacturer I may do a

1395
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:47,967
A proof-of-concept in one area

1396
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:50,015
And be like this is amazing and

1397
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:56,671
Roll it out fully but then when I start doing things in other areas I realized that oh maybe my two

1398
00:55:56,927 --> 00:55:58,975
Solutions will never talk to each other or

1399
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:02,047
Maybe they're not designed to be as flexible as possible

1400
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:03,839
So how do companies kind of

1401
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:07,935
Handle that or how should they be thinking about is future-proofing there

1402
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:09,215
Iot efforts

1403
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:14,847
Customers are actually doing many proof-of-concept the same time

1404
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:17,663
Any given company is

1405
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:23,807
Two or three different type of concept for different UK

1406
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:25,087
Exactly what you're saying

1407
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:28,927
She working with Microsoft and then application

1408
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:31,999
Provider to actually look for something like an HVAC

1409
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:33,279
End

1410
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:34,559
You're standing pal.

1411
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:38,399
But I might have another Bender that I

1412
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:41,727
To think about the transport within the belt

1413
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:46,847
Contact

1414
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:49,407
Realized

1415
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:51,199
We think about

1416
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:53,759
Some industrial providers

1417
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:57,855
Like a Honeywell or GE

1418
00:56:58,111 --> 00:57:00,671
Interoperability across

1419
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:02,463
Types of equipment

1420
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:05,023
And so you know I think one of them think that customer

1421
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:08,863
What you do is really think about the choice of vendors that they have

1422
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:13,471
Whether that be a provider like a Microsoft or an Amazon

1423
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:16,031
Industrial Equipment provider

1424
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:19,615
And how could they ensure that the data that they have

1425
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:22,431
Different kinds of devices

1426
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:26,271
UK that might be usable or shareable I think about it

1427
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:28,319
Initial proof of concept

1428
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:29,343
And probably

1429
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:33,951
I need to think about potentially due to the concept

1430
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:34,975
Othello

1431
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:35,999
Okay

1432
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:38,303
I'm going to call you good news Anne

1433
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:41,631
From now on all right and thanks so much for coming on the show.

1434
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:48,543
A cart that's it for this week thanks so much for listening and remember if you'd like more iot news

1435
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:53,663
Sign up for my newsletter at Stacey on iot. Cam will see you next week
