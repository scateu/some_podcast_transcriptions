00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,704
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast I'm your host

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,264
Stacey Higginbotham and this is your co-host

3
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:12,544
Kevin tofel

4
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:14,336
And this week we have got

5
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:18,688
Gobs and gobs of news for you including the fact that Kevin is psychic

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,480
A preview of CES

7
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:21,248
And

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,552
A review of a

9
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:25,600
$3,000 coffee maker

10
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:27,136
And let's see

11
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:28,672
SIM lighting Products

12
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:30,464
But I am really excited about

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,256
So let's get with the show

14
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:36,864
Kevin you want to start out with your psychic prediction that has since come true

15
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:40,192
I do not want to say I told you so but

16
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:45,056
You know I won't it's funny because my kids always say I'm from the future I was

17
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:46,848
Predict things and then

18
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:50,176
How many personal things you can get most of them right at some point.

19
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:53,760
I might remember when it was but I could have sworn I said

20
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:57,600
I don't want any more of these smart home hubs hanging off my routers

21
00:00:57,856 --> 00:01:00,672
We got only screens in the house all these TVs why not just

22
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:02,464
Put the Smart Home

23
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,512
Hugs in the TVs

24
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:05,536
Guess what

25
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:08,352
Samsung is going to do that in 2016

26
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:11,424
They are integrating smart hubs right into their

27
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,264
4K TVs that are 1080p

28
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:21,408
If there s UHD TV so it sounds to me like it's all 4K TVs not 1080p is but

29
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:27,808
Doesn't matter I want one I'm super excited by this and we need to talk about what it means we found some tidbits

30
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:29,600
After the announcement earlier today

31
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,440
Tidbits and we should say this is a very specific hub

32
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:34,208
It is

33
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:34,976
Samsung

34
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:36,512
Hug which we all know and love

35
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:37,536
Incall

36
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:39,840
The SmartThings Hub

37
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:42,400
Alright so

38
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:45,216
Let's go with tidbit that was tidbit number one

39
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:47,776
This is the SmartThings Hub you can

40
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:48,800
So

41
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:53,664
It's actually the SmartThings software and to get this inside your television

42
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,200
What must you do

43
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:59,040
Will you have to buy a 2016 television personal

44
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:02,368
Second of all this is kind of interesting

45
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:04,928
Samsung is going to offer a

46
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,720
Free USB adapter

47
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:09,536
It's called the SmartThings extend and

48
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:15,936
Before the show station I were not sure what that was going to be or how much was going to cost we've just said it's free so now we know it's free

49
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:22,080
Interesting way it's going to add the ability to Monitor and control zigbee and Z-Wave devices from your TV

50
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:26,432
So what's inside the TV radio wise does not include zigbee and Z-Wave

51
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,456
But

52
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:32,320
You had this little USB dongle and 212 to the compatible TV that is

53
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,856
And you'll be able to

54
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,648
Work with zigbee and Z-Wave devices

55
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,928
Yay

56
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:40,000
That's if you if you care about that so

57
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:44,352
In a lot of ways zigbee and Z-Wave are going to be kind of the Legacy Smart Home

58
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:45,632
Radios

59
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:46,912
Even even though

60
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:48,192
Smart things guys will say

61
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:52,544
But

62
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:55,104
So the TV will have the Wi-Fi

63
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:57,920
And I bet it has Bluetooth to

64
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:00,992
Oh I thought I would would not doubt at 1 for one second

65
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:04,064
So yeah cuz the V2 of the SmartThings Hub has

66
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,344
Z-Wave zigbee

67
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,624
Wi-Fi Bluetooth

68
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,928
And I believe it has a spot

69
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,464
Or has a dongle break

70
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,232
Unplugging

71
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,024
Cellular

72
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,048
So

73
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:15,584
With all of that

74
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:20,192
Applaud the sin and you got the SmartThings soft

75
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:25,824
And what were unclear on right now is if it's running tizen which is the operating system

76
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,104
Samsung uses on it

77
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:27,872
TVs

78
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:30,176
And we're trying to figure out if

79
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,968
The current generation of

80
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:32,736
SmartThings

81
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:34,272
Hubs runs ties

82
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:36,832
Because way back when it was

83
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:37,600
Announce

84
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:38,624
Lafayette

85
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,672
It wasn't an ounce

86
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,464
Is it like the SmartThings Hub was

87
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,232
Running tights

88
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,536
They wanted to move to

89
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:53,984
That's that's my educated guess is that the current SmartThings Hub does not run on tizen

90
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,800
You can call it Legacy software from

91
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:59,872
When before SmartThings was bought by Samsung

92
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:01,920
You and I are at the big gay

93
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:08,064
Iot keynote sing last year at CVS where Samsung was on stage and Tyson was going to save the world

94
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:11,648
Can let all our devices talk to each other my guess is that

95
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,696
Samsung spent 2015

96
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:15,232
Getting that ready

97
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,512
And

98
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:18,303
I know the TVs are on tizen

99
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:20,095
I also know that

100
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:25,215
I'm expecting that tizen version 3.0 the next version of tizen will be out

101
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,239
Next month

102
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:31,103
After CS is what I'm hearing but that wouldn't preclude a CES announcement obviously so

103
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,127
I'm thinking

104
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,663
The new

105
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:39,295
Call the new SmartThings platform for better word is going to be tizen-based

106
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:41,855
Right so tizen hopefully 300

107
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,135
Will soon come out

108
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,927
And we'll see that

109
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,207
Running

110
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:48,255
Auntie Dee's and

111
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:50,559
So

112
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:51,583
Exciting

113
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,351
Will get

114
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,911
For people like Kevin who hate hugs

115
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,959
You will soon have to buy only this

116
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:57,983
Samsung

117
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:00,543
S UHD what is the used

118
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:04,895
Ultra that that's why I'm picking it up

119
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:08,223
Yeah that's why I'm thinking it's

120
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:15,903
That's why I'm thinking it's going to be the 4K TVs actually Can Shed a little more light on that just now as I'm re-reading what they put out today

121
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:18,463
Let me say this out loud for Dragon celebrities

122
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:20,255
Because actually have two things here

123
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:23,071
We're excited to announce that all 26

124
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:28,191
2016 Samsung Smart TVs will be compatible with SmartThings

125
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:32,287
So that's one thing that smart TVs can be 1080p 720p whatever

126
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,871
And all s UHD TVs which is the 4K set

127
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:41,503
Will have iot Hub technology so the TV can become the heart of your smartphone

128
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,527
A slightly different

129
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:48,415
Oh okay so it sounds like for one of them they will be the Hub and the other one was sounds like it will be

130
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:50,207
Become integrator because

131
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:50,975
Comparto

132
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,023
Got it

133
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:55,071
That is so true

134
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:57,631
2 related answers with their TVs and iot

135
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,679
Okay and it sounds like

136
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,471
You probably will then be able to

137
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,263
Control or organizers

138
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,543
Smart home on your TV

139
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,847
The Samsung

140
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:15,039
S UHD application will allow you to trigger different SmartThings

141
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:15,807
Teens

142
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:19,391
You can also get notifications on that sucker when important thing

143
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,415
Things happen

144
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:24,255
2nd Annual connected cameras right on your TV

145
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,535
Control your canoe

146
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:26,559
Devices for me

147
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:28,863
Fancy

148
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:33,471
So the forecast Wednesday when they get

149
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,519
If your SmartThings

150
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,311
If you're not a smart thing

151
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,591
Okay

152
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,359
Okay

153
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:42,431
Let's take a moment here and just Lament The fact

154
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:45,247
Did the sounds really great

155
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,015
But

156
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:47,551
It also sucks

157
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,087
Here is why

158
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,111
Tell me why

159
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:50,879
Because

160
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:55,743
We and I have seen this I have seen this dream come to fruition

161
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,023
In labs

162
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,303
With all join

163
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,863
And other Open Standards

164
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:03,423
223 years ago

165
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,983
Where all of this was happening

166
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:10,591
And things were whizzing around my house through invisible radio waves and software

167
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,639
Open Standards

168
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,455
Years ago

169
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,735
It it's not coming

170
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:17,503
Troop

171
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:20,831
But there's a difference there's a difference here

172
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:26,719
I agree with you that the Open Standards and and SmartThings it's all very similar to All Join

173
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:31,839
What all joints didn't have and what Samsung does have is it also owns the hardware side of things

174
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:35,679
Right we'll see in this gets into this can get into

175
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:36,959
If we want to talk about

176
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:37,983
Is

177
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:38,751
Why

178
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,311
Why this is fundamentally broken

179
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:42,335
So

180
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,383
Thing 1

181
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:47,199
Yes I got some data heading into CES

182
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:47,967
From

183
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:49,247
Let's see this is

184
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,087
Parks Associates is saying that 43% of people next year

185
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,111
43%

186
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,207
People in the US will buy a smart device

187
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,743
In the next year

188
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,535
I want to tell all those people

189
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,303
No Doubt

190
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:08,447
Different kind of counter to our show

191
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:11,007
I usually don't do that

192
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,543
So because

193
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:18,175
You are about to set yourself up what was happening right now is everybody is creating these.

194
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:23,807
Please lock and standards that we've talked about we talked about for three years we talked about it last episode with friends a few

195
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:25,599
And

196
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:28,927
We're about to talk about it now because this is very much on my mind

197
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:35,327
Going into CS where we're about to see a lot of other walled Gardens

198
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:36,607
Being built

199
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:40,447
So

200
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,799
With Samsung what they're doing is I know that last year at CES

201
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,335
They got to her

202
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,615
Their CEO got up and

203
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:50,943
Did this wonderful everything must be open presentation and

204
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:53,247
I'm sure he still feels that way

205
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:59,135
But that is not what's being built right here this is very much a hay

206
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:02,463
I got a Samsung TV that's going to work with tizen

207
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:07,071
And a hug that also will it possibly eventually run tizen

208
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,351
And everything

209
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,399
What happened on this TV

210
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,447
And

211
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:16,287
It is very frustrating for me

212
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,823
Soap

213
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:21,151
6 best rating for everybody it's it's one of the biggest challenges that

214
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:26,527
Smart Homes in iot devices really have them in your right way I'm not going to rehash it cuz we talked about this

215
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:30,111
I don't say every episode but darn it comes up on off alot how

216
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,647
There are just too many

217
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:38,047
Competing call them standards if you will that competing efforts by different companies in groups

218
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,071
Companies in

219
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:41,375
And Kickstarter projects and so on that

220
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,143
Want to

221
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,935
Give you the solution but

222
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:47,263
If they're not going to play nice with others if there is a lock-in

223
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,847
2 to a large degree still on next it's frustrating as all get-out

224
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:54,943
So there's an interesting perspective out there and I want to draw your attention to it audience

225
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:57,247
I'll put it in the show notes but Bruce scheiner

226
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,551
Read about it over the Atlantic

227
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,343
And he'd kind of drawers

228
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:06,207
He talks about this he talks about in relation to Hugh he talks about in relation to John Deere's

229
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:09,023
Tractors where they're trying to send

230
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:15,167
On the software associated with this and Keurigs coe's on their their pots and dram

231
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:20,287
And he blames the Digital Millennium Copyright Act which I thought was really crazy

232
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,335
So

233
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:24,895
Whose theory is

234
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,735
Is that

235
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:32,319
And I'll just I'll just read part of his his theory here

236
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:37,695
Stop competitors just reverse engineering the proprietary standard and making compatible peripherals

237
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:42,303
For example another Coffee manufacturer put in Keurig codes on their own pods

238
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:46,655
These companies rely on a 1998 law called the Digital Millennium Copyright Act

239
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,935
The dcma

240
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,727
Originally passed

241
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,031
Prevent people from pirating music and movies

242
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:54,591
Well it hasn't done a lot of good in that regard

243
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,615
Is anyone who

244
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:57,407
Uses BitTorrent can attest

245
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:59,199
It has done a lot in Hibbets

246
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,991
Security and compatibility research

247
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:06,111
Specifically the dmca inclusion anti-circumvention provision

248
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,671
Which prohibits companies from circumventing

249
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:10,975
Quote technological protection measures

250
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:13,791
Effectively control access to copyrighted works

251
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:18,911
That means it's illegal for someone to create a hue compatible light bulb without Philips permission

252
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:21,983
A K-Cup compatible coffee Pod without Keurig

253
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,775
Orange HP compatible

254
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:24,799
Printer cartridge

255
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:25,567
Without

256
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,335
Hp's

257
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:31,455
And this explains why I still prefer using my Amazon Echo in the wink hub

258
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:38,367
Because neither one of those folks are trying to create their own walled-garden nearly as much as anybody else

259
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:44,255
So yeah so his his thought as he writes of the Atlantic is that all of these things are inhibiting

260
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:45,535
This is kind of

261
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,839
Cert this inability to circumvent

262
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:48,863
Proprietary

263
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,167
Code is

264
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:55,263
Why we don't see why we can't have nice things on the Internet of Things

265
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,567
This is why we can't have

266
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:58,847
Interoperability

267
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:02,943
Is a problem

268
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:08,063
And it seems like it's getting worst some degree

269
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,343
Because we're

270
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,135
Because we have

271
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,159
More products

272
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,695
Entering the market

273
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:17,279
And then we also see that we want them to connect

274
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:23,423
There are enough products out there that are starting to be on the market

275
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,703
Connect to other products

276
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,471
That we have

277
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:27,775
Oh

278
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,311
Will see this connected

279
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,335
Like here's a great example

280
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:35,199
Sample thermos makes it connected water bottle that connects to a Fitbit

281
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:37,247
And you're like

282
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:40,831
Hey cool there's a connected water bottle that measures my hydration

283
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:41,599
Connect my Fitbit

284
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:45,439
But I don't have a Fitbit I have a jaw bone why does my jaw bone

285
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,231
And you're like

286
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:53,119
And if you me you you email VPR at

287
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:56,191
Why doesn't this connect to my job on there like all we haven't talked to them

288
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:56,959
You're like

289
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:58,239
Guys

290
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,263
Get on it

291
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:02,591
When it be just so much easier is

292
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:04,895
If they didn't have to actually do this

293
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,431
Text negotiation yes

294
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:08,223
I'm as everybody here

295
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:11,295
Who listens to the show is probably like yesterday that you said this already

296
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,319
Okay

297
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:16,415
So I just wanted to drive you to it or dry your attention to it because I thought

298
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:19,487
You know this was an interesting perspective we don't hear

299
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:25,631
A lot about Digital Millennium Copyright Act

300
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,911
So it's like that

301
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:27,679
That made me think

302
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,447
I don't know what the

303
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:29,983
Entirely Act

304
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:34,335
I'm sure I'm going to bring it up with people as I go to CVS and talk to them

305
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,103
So

306
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,127
Will find out

307
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:39,711
And if you're thinking about buying a

308
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:40,479
Connected

309
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:43,295
Device a smart home device in the next year

310
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:45,343
Please

311
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,367
Choose Wisely

312
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,647
Choose

313
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:52,767
Wisely that's probably the best thing to choose a product that is friendly and plays well with others

314
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:56,095
Although I would have said you because he plays Wells

315
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:59,167
With others and then they did the friends of hue program although they did

316
00:13:59,423 --> 00:13:59,935
Walk it back

317
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:05,311
So they quickly they quickly backtracked on on that I know we talked about it last week but for those who missed it

318
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,383
Third-party bulbs

319
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,943
Or no longer going to be working with

320
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,991
The Hue bridge and about a day

321
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:14,527
After hearing people complain about it

322
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:17,855
To said that we are going to change that back to the way it was sort of

323
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:18,879
Yeah

324
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,207
Speaking of Phillips

325
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:25,535
They only say a coffee maker brand

326
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:29,887
Which I may or may not be pronouncing correctly because

327
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:33,215
Because I live on the internet and I only read things

328
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:38,079
Sako is there coffee maker brand and

329
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:40,639
They have launched in the US

330
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:43,711
A

331
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,247
Connected coffee maker

332
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:48,831
And this is a connected coffee maker that is a super automatic coffee maker

333
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:51,135
Which is the time that grinds the beans

334
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:51,903
It has like a

335
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,695
Brew unit that

336
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:56,255
Does everything from grinding the beans still like

337
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:57,791
Pretty the pressure in the

338
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,071
Pumping out of fool

339
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,887
Fancy cup of espresso or

340
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,935
Got the milk frother

341
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,983
Macchiato

342
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,031
Chino whatever you want

343
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,615
Does everything all you have to do is like

344
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:12,895
Clean it once

345
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,431
It's amazing

346
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,967
I own one

347
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:17,247
I really love it

348
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:19,551
Mine is not as fancy as this one this is a

349
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:21,855
The MSRP is 4000

350
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:22,623
The dollars

351
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,415
Yeah I know

352
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,463
Williams-Sonoma has it

353
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:30,815
What is on sale for $2,500 Before Christmas normally is $3,000

354
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:34,399
So this is fancy it is the

355
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,423
Grand

356
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,727
Arista Avanti

357
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:40,543
It's sold in Germany now coming to the US

358
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:43,103
Phillip send it to me to try

359
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:43,871
And it was

360
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:44,895
A lot of fun

361
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,431
And it's

362
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,455
Connect it

363
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:55,135
Say that she's talking about the coffee just going on in my nose and

364
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:59,231
Happy Meal

365
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,815
I know that doesn't taste as good

366
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:03,839
The Bluetooth does not

367
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,911
Okay it has Bluetooth

368
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,191
It has an app

369
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,471
It has

370
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,519
It has some form of

371
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,287
Intelligence

372
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:16,127
I'm going to say the Bluetooth felt more like a gimmick

373
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,407
Than anything

374
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,199
One because it didn't connect

375
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:19,967
Anything else

376
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:24,319
If Phillips wants to make it connect to other things it could be maybe better

377
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:30,207
Like maybe if it wants to connect to my jaw bone to be like most aces up

378
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,743
Turn on the coffee machine

379
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:34,559
Although this thing heats up in a matter of like

380
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,583
Less than a minute

381
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:36,607
So

382
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:39,167
I don't really need it to like

383
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,215
I mean it's not like a huge weight for coffee

384
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:47,615
Still be nice to like connected to if this then that and set up a trigger on the echo.and

385
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:50,943
Same can you make me a cup of coffee and by the time you get downstairs

386
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,015
Ready that's true I would also like to be my echo Jeeves

387
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:56,063
Because that would be amazing

388
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,855
Cousin Augustine Cheves

389
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:59,647
Make me a cup of coffee

390
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,951
All right while I'm dreaming

391
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:03,999
So yes if all that happens

392
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:04,767
That would be

393
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:12,703
But that doesn't happen the best thing about it the Bluetooth is that it gives you access to the app

394
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,519
And the app does make it easier

395
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:17,055
Then that it has a

396
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,103
It hasn't LED touch screen

397
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,151
And

398
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,711
There's a lot of buttons you can press there's like

399
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:25,759
I think 16 total drinks you can make

400
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,039
So

401
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:30,879
There is a kind of a lot to do on the touch-screen although you can do it

402
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:31,903
All from the

403
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:32,927
Touch screen

404
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:33,951
That's fine

405
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:36,767
Doing it from the app is a little bit easier

406
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,047
But

407
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,839
If you can't find your phone

408
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:40,863
You're kind of like

409
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,935
If you're like myself and don't always have your phone on you

410
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:46,495
You may kind of be like

411
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:48,543
You gotta do not want to run back upstairs and

412
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:56,735
I like the app cuz it's got pretty little pictures of all the drinks so if you're not sure what it's called you can just do it by sight if that's the one

413
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:59,295
Yes Andrew is Daffy drinks

414
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:01,087
From the app you can be like

415
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:07,487
Oh this needs to be much stronger or I need more milk or I need less milk or I need less coffee any more coffee

416
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:08,255
Yeah I did this

417
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:09,791
It's very much fun

418
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:10,559
So

419
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:12,863
So but it also feels kind of like

420
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,911
Do I need the Bluetooth

421
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,191
Yeah

422
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,799
Maybe not but let me did you know if they sell egg

423
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:23,359
Similar non-bluetooth Edition like you have you

424
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:25,919
They do and I'm curious what the price differences

425
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,199
I don't know

426
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,991
Do you think I would know

427
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,271
But I don't know

428
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,575
You can like

429
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:35,391
The thing is that they come out with new models all the time

430
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:38,975
Yeah no like you could probably buy last year's model

431
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:40,767
Very similar features for like

432
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,047
Much less

433
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:44,095
So

434
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:46,655
Where you could buy like a giraffe or a

435
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:47,935
DeLonghi

436
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:52,799
We're getting into it we're getting into clock

437
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:53,567
But

438
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:54,847
If you're if you really want

439
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:58,175
Today's high-end really amazing connected coffee maker

440
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,223
The coffee on this

441
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:01,247
Is consistent

442
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,319
It makes it has a nice

443
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:05,599
Crema Crema

444
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:09,951
The little the little foamy stuff on top of your espresso is nice

445
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:12,511
I will say that the flat white was not good

446
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:13,791
So

447
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:15,583
The flat white not gray

448
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,607
Cappuccino

449
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,399
Good the latte

450
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,751
People ask me if they wanted me to test it with almond milk

451
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:23,519
Soy milk

452
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:24,287
Skim milk

453
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,591
So I did those

454
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:28,383
It's Frost all of them

455
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:33,247
It didn't do as good as the job as it did with whole milk

456
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:38,111
I don't drink those milks normally so they all tasted pretty bad to me

457
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:41,439
Because I just don't drink them

458
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:48,095
Whole milk or nothing for me

459
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:50,911
Kind of nice but it still tastes too kind of watery like an almond milk

460
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:51,935
Short

461
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,495
So what if you like almond milk it tasted

462
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:56,031
Like toasted almond

463
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:57,567
Belk in the drink so

464
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:03,967
I'm going to stick with my Nespresso

465
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:07,807
So the coffee was consistent I felt like if you had good beans

466
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:09,087
You probably could do it

467
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:12,927
I have a friend who has the Jura A9

468
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:17,791
Like I will make coffee amazingly well kind of fancy coffee maker

469
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:20,351
If you came over any tested it and

470
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:22,143
We found some that we like

471
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,935
We found that

472
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:27,519
Some that we're kind of watery

473
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:31,103
But you can actually dial

474
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:37,247
Up your bean Grimes and all that kind of stuff you can customize like just about everything on this thing so I feel like it

475
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:39,039
You spent a lot of time on it

476
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:41,599
You probably could have cheese like

477
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:42,623
Greatness

478
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:44,415
Except

479
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:45,695
That is that

480
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:53,119
No I wish I wish you would had like some kind of Wi-Fi access so I could like make you a cup of coffee on the show

481
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:57,727
Mm

482
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:00,799
I felt like Wi-Fi would really do Oaks

483
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:03,871
Okay my to ask for this Woody Wi-Fi access

484
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:06,175
And then a little weight sensor

485
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,199
At the bottom

486
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:09,247
Iowa caucus

487
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:11,551
Yes you can see if there was a cup there because

488
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:14,367
We even with Bluetooth access

489
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:21,024
Like I couldn't always tell if I wanted to make a cup of coffee and I couldn't see the coffee maker if there is if I couldn't remember if I put

490
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:26,656
Put a cup there or not

491
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:28,192
Except for if there's a cut there

492
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:29,472
And I was like

493
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,080
I had to get up before I made another

494
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:36,128
Oh the shame

495
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,408
Theogony

496
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:40,736
Moving a couch in the bed

497
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:47,136
But you be you be then burning calories doing so and that's what apparently a lot of people are doing this holidays

498
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:48,160
Because they bought

499
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,952
Surprisingly fitbit's

500
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:53,536
Yeah it was like the top app in the in the App Store

501
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:57,632
So the conclusion was that everyone has fitbit's and everyone loves them

502
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,424
And they all got them for Christmas

503
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,472
And not shot way up

504
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:04,288
And ye everyone got tickets for the holidays

505
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:09,920
Everybody should be tracking their steps

506
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:12,480
Still have my job

507
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:15,296
Had a lot of server trouble leading into the holiday

508
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:16,576
Which

509
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:18,112
You know was a pig

510
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,416
No one's talking about this

511
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,208
Except on the jaw bone like

512
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,000
Jawbone support Twitter

513
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:28,096
Account but you know if you got a job own and it's been slow to upload

514
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:30,912
Know that they have been having some real issues

515
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:32,704
And they're really not copping to it

516
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,520
Except they're they're like

517
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:41,408
Some server trouble it should be fixed now but mine is still actually uploading kind of slowly

518
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,968
So and apparently other people are still having

519
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:44,992
Trouble so

520
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:50,880
Now you know but this brings me to CES that was a really long convoluted segue

521
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:54,720
CES

522
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:55,744
Where

523
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:56,768
Fitness

524
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:57,536
Trackers

525
00:22:58,048 --> 00:23:00,352
Are going to be a thing but not the thing

526
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,960
We're going to keep it pretty General because I'm actually going to be at the show

527
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:05,984
Next week

528
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:10,336
So all I'll be bringing you all kinds of crazy things that I have seen

529
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,616
I'm including

530
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:13,920
News and things from the show but

531
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:14,944
Big trends

532
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,712
AR

533
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:17,504
Cars

534
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:21,600
Probably cars

535
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:24,160
I'm sticking with cars lot of traffic

536
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:30,560
Yeah I think I think intelligent self autonomous type cars you can talk a lot about the technology there and over

537
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:31,328
Volkswagen is

538
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:36,192
I wanted a keynote one of the big Keynotes there

539
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:42,336
Robots that they've always had a little robot section and it's growing every year there

540
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:43,616
Intel makes sense

541
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:45,152
Intel CEO Brian

542
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,272
Brian Kang

543
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:54,624
Kevin and Stacy who talked about people whose names they cannot pronounce

544
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,928
And products whose names they cannot print

545
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,464
That should be the name of our show

546
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:04,096
Alright so Brian K from Intel's going to be there I expect a lot on Intel's wearable strategy

547
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:06,400
I'm in iot strategy

548
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:10,496
As well as

549
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:16,896
I need you're going to see more of the smart home stuff you know the whole enter the homework tomorrow kind of

550
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:19,712
We saw a lot of that last year

551
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:24,064
And the year before in the year before but last year was really the year of iot

552
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:30,464
This year yes I got tons of products I'm going to see lots of stuff I got so my inbox

553
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,536
Just bursting at the seams with crazy products

554
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:35,072
But

555
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:36,096
I'm telling you

556
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:37,376
Cars

557
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:39,424
Cars cars cars

558
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:42,496
Also a lot of

559
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:44,800
What is it a lot of

560
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:50,176
I think I'm just see a lot of Smart Home Products from larger vendors

561
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:53,504
The last year I saw a lot of Smart Home Products from light

562
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,040
Newer kind of companies

563
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:59,904
I'm getting a lot of invites from Big established companies with

564
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:02,208
Products

565
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,304
Yeah and I can't say too much because I don't want to like now

566
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,584
Outland Marcos

567
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:13,216
What's better with the tricky part of December going into city as we have some information ahead of time and we can

568
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:15,264
You know we can't really give that away but

569
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,336
I think you're you're spot-on I don't think

570
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:24,736
I don't think those smaller smart-home players are going to be gone or missing I think they're just going to get lost in all the noise

571
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:27,040
Canasa because you're right the bigger companies an hour

572
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:29,600
Moving into the space as it continues to grow

573
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:32,160
Unless you remember last year homekit

574
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:32,928
What is the big thing

575
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,208
This year

576
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:35,744
Man

577
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:40,608
Homekit is nowhere on the horizon and we're still waiting for a

578
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:44,192
Just so people are where we're still waiting for a lot of homekit profiles

579
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:49,056
We haven't seen a video like profile yet on homekit all we've got right now

580
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:50,080
AR

581
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:51,360
Kind of some sensors

582
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:52,640
We've got the

583
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:55,200
We have door locks we don't even have door lock

584
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:59,040
I can't think of any

585
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:00,320
I know that

586
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:05,696
A few of the hubs now work with homekit in stands newest Hub does

587
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:08,000
Outlets

588
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:09,280
And we've got lights

589
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:12,864
Space it's a very limited selection though at this point

590
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,168
And that's because we still don't have

591
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,216
Homekit works with profile

592
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:19,776
Rights we have a profile for each product

593
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:20,800
Comes out on the mark

594
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:23,360
And we're still waiting for a video

595
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,920
I think we're still waiting for

596
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,712
Door lock

597
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:29,760
Do we have the homekit door lock

598
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:30,784
If we don't

599
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:35,648
Then we're still waiting, I don't think so

600
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,184
I lie to you

601
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,208
The Schlage

602
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,000
Touch sense door lock

603
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,608
August has a homekit door lock to that's out on the Moor

604
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:47,680
Yes they do

605
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:51,008
So we have it or not profile it's still just seems like

606
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,360
It's still talk about him or talk about homekit then actual

607
00:26:55,616 --> 00:27:00,736
Products and platforms and here's your whole solution make life easy that's kind of what was promised and

608
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:02,528
It's just not here yet

609
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:04,832
It's a Walled Garden that's still being built

610
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:06,624
Pretty pretty lame water garden

611
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:08,160
Who loves Gardens

612
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:12,256
It's just a while there's nothing interesting in there you don't want to live there yet

613
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:13,792
All right

614
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:17,120
And in terms of new device categories

615
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:19,168
I'm not seeing a lot

616
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:19,936
But

617
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:21,472
There is one

618
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:24,544
Product category I am really excited about it's not a product

619
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,568
Categories of product

620
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:32,224
I was going to tell you about it because it's so freaking exciting and then we should probably in the show cuz we have talked a lot

621
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:33,248
All right

622
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,784
Just company

623
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:36,832
Cut stack lighting

624
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:38,624
I interviewed them

625
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,464
A couple like before before this version of the iot podcast

626
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:44,768
And I've got a review unit coming

627
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:45,536
End

628
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:48,352
When it's here we're going to talk about it in Greater depth

629
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:49,120
But

630
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:51,936
It is a light

631
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:52,704
That is

632
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,288
Responsive in this is actually really interesting Trend we're going to keep following

633
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:58,848
It's

634
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:01,664
Instead of calling them smart because they feel like the

635
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,224
Turn smart has been to so bastardize

636
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,504
Over there,

637
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:11,136
Responsive and idea is these lights have a motion sensor an ambient light sensor

638
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,928
And a

639
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:16,256
Occupancy sensor

640
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,048
I'm not sure

641
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:21,376
And what happens is when you walk in

642
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:22,656
They

643
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:23,680
Turn on

644
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:30,848
And if it needed if there is not enough light in the room and they also turn on in regard in Black release

645
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:32,640
Listen to the circadian rhythms of the day

646
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:33,920
So

647
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:35,456
Their white lights

648
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:36,736
Politico

649
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:38,272
Brighter in the morning and

650
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:41,088
Turn yellow room dimmer towards the evening

651
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:43,392
And so the idea is they

652
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:44,160
Turn on

653
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,184
When they're needed

654
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:46,720
And when someone's in the room

655
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:47,744
When you leave

656
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,024
Turn off

657
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:50,048
So

658
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:51,584
And you do nothing

659
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:56,192
And then they also will

660
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:58,496
Work with other systems

661
00:28:58,752 --> 00:28:59,520
Is the plan

662
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:00,800
So they will act as

663
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:02,848
An occupancy sensor for your neck

664
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:05,408
Or other

665
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:06,944
Thermostat

666
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:07,968
Overtime

667
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:11,040
And they will work through if this then that

668
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:13,600
So why am I really pumped

669
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:15,136
About these and I'm going to get

670
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:20,512
Towards sometime after CES I'm going to get the first so they come and be our 30s right now

671
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,072
And there are a hundred and fifty-four

672
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:26,400
Hub and to BR30

673
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:29,472
And it's 60 bucks for each additional bulb

674
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:32,800
I know they're very expensive there Q expensive

675
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:39,456
That's okay then just starting out with a new product I mean you know until you can scale up and bring your prices down today

676
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,736
Crosstown I did that

677
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:41,504
I'm not

678
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,064
I'm not going to write them off because of that

679
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,856
And see how they work

680
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:48,672
Yeah. I'm at the exactly cuz I'm kind of excited

681
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:51,744
Occupancy

682
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,768
Without

683
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:54,304
Relying on a phone

684
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:56,608
Kind of exciting

685
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:57,376
Right

686
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:59,424
Is it said it's semi presents

687
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:03,776
Semi presents but they report back like if there's a person in there

688
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:06,080
Without needing the phone

689
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:12,736
So so in a sense I can provide presents information to other devices such as your nasty as you said

690
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:13,504
In particular

691
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:16,064
Great

692
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:18,368
I'm but I'm I'm still kind of stone

693
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:19,648
Because you know man

694
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:21,440
And left

695
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:25,536
That is that is the product I'm really excited about

696
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:28,608
And that is kind of some thoughts about CEs

697
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,912
And we will

698
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:33,984

So thanks for coming on the podcast today

732
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:54,112
We are

733
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:55,136
Excited to have you

734
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:56,416
I am

735
00:31:56,928 --> 00:32:00,000
Talking to you because I picked up a survey for the industrial internet

736
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:01,280
Consortium all about

737
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:05,632
This concept of a new wave of investment in iot startups

738
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,168
And basically

739
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,448
It was about

740
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:09,984
Venture industrialist

741
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:12,800
It's about a new type of venture capitalist

742
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,336
Coming in

743
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,360
Kind of investing in

744
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:17,664
Startups I'm going to talk about that but first

745
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:20,480
I want you to talk to me about what you do

746
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:21,504
Pitney Bowes

747
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:29,952
My role as Chief Innovation officer

748
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:36,864
And also lead our Innovation initiative has been our technology alliances

749
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:39,424
Okay and when I take a pic nebo's I think

750
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:41,728
You're going to hate me for this I think Direct Mail

751
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,080
But I know you guys do so much more than that so

752
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:47,616
You want to give us like that.

753
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:48,896
50000

754
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:51,200
Maybe even ten thousand foot view of

755
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:52,736
What else you guys do

756
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:58,368
Absolutely

757
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,952
Nelly operations and

758
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:04,512
Technology products

759
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:07,584
2/3 + SMD and Enterprises

760
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:12,448
3 billion dollars

761
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:18,336
Billion dollars of business in software and e-commerce services that grew 20% last year

762
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:21,408
Over the last decade the company

763
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:23,456
How about you

764
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:26,272
B company with very strong book physical

765
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:27,808
And digital assets

766
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:28,832
Tyler Converse

767
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:29,856
So

768
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:31,904
What kind of challenges do you guys

769
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,976
Like so getting to this kind of venture industrialist

770
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:36,256
Concept

771
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:37,536
Which I don't know if we're

772
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:39,328
We're on board with yet but

773
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,352
Canada

774
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:41,632
Stadia was

775
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,168
You're going to need

776
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:46,752
A special form of strategic investor

777
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:49,312
To invest in the industrial internet

778
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:51,104
And I'd be curious from your take

779
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:53,664
Not not just about this but

780
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,736
What are you guys looking for when you're looking for

781
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:58,528
Startups or

782
00:33:58,784 --> 00:33:59,808
Companies to work with

783
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:01,088
In the internet

784
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:09,536
Sure we have a certain set as an objective that we're trying to accomplish and

785
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,096
We look for partners

786
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:14,400
In the industry that will

787
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:20,800
Filter in gas we believe we have applied technology that's needed to cry to sleep

788
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:21,568
Customers

789
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:27,712
Video of expertise about the Technologies but then also

790
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:29,504
I got the use of Internet

791
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,784
Obscene

792
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:35,648
Technologies to transform business operation to transform service

793
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:38,720
Driven are partnering approach

794
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:45,376
Journey that we have done so far has occluded to serve our large

795
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:46,912
Enterprise business

796
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:49,216
And that was the partnership with

797
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:53,568
GE where we were looking to a big company in that case

798
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:59,712
That's provide a form and a set of application services that would help us

799
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:01,504
That we're also

800
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:04,320
I'm working with a VC back

801
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:06,624
West Coast water company

802
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,416
To provide

803
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:09,440
Network

804
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:12,256
Connectivity and security

805
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:16,096
4in internet-of-things initiative we have for our

806
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:18,912
Business

807
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:23,264
If it's a smaller if you keep a company that has the capability to work

808
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:27,872
Certainly not for you to work with them especially if their identity

809
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:31,456
And can help us

810
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,016
Okay and so

811
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:37,088
That that's kind of awesome because you got both ends of the spectrum

812
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,368
And

813
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:40,160
What I took from this kind of

814
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:41,696
Report

815
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:44,256
A couple things one is this idea that

816
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:45,792
Working with clients

817
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:46,560
Like your side

818
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:47,328
Clients like

819
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:48,096
Yourself

820
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:50,144
Midea is the venture capitalist

821
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:53,216
May not be super successful investing here

822
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:55,264
Is because they don't have the domain expert

823
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,032
Expertise

824
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:58,080
Industrial clients

825
00:35:58,336 --> 00:35:59,360
Like yourself require

826
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:04,224
And at the exits here may not be huge so maybe they should leave it tonight corporate development officer

827
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:08,064
And I don't know do you

828
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,600
Do you have an opinion on

829
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:16,512
I think it matters by the component of Internet of Things

830
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:18,816
Technologies are activities in

831
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:21,632
I think we would think of it as a value chain

832
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:25,216
Subsistence

833
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:26,496
Technology

834
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:30,848
That's required from a security networking employee to extract

835
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,896
Data from machine

836
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:34,432
I can't believe that

837
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:40,832
Could be a relatively horizontal technology that could be applied to a broad brush

838
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:42,880
Total addressable Market

839
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:44,160
There is

840
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:46,976
Networking in cloud-based

841
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:48,768
Big Data

842
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:52,864
Collection ingestion and analytics capabilities

843
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:55,936
And I'd argue that that later as well

844
00:36:56,448 --> 00:37:00,032
Could be applied to a broad total addressable Market

845
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:04,128
In the top layer which is

846
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:07,712
The set of applications that are created to help

847
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:11,040
Crazy business outcomes that the Industrial company

848
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:18,464
And that maybe something that has a more limited total addressable Market

849
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:25,120
And it's probably more nuanced to the needs of unlike ourselves or particular subset.

850
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,216
What about this idea

851
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:29,984
The big

852
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:33,824
Fortune 500 companies out there

853
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:35,616
They just don't want to

854
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:36,896
Work with starter

855
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:39,712
I feel like in reading this report

856
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,016
There was a lot of openness

857
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:42,784
What's in there

858
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:44,576
2 startups because

859
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:47,392
There's so much Innovation coming from

860
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:49,440
The start of

861
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:50,976
System that a lot of these companies

862
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:52,000
Is feel like they can't

863
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:53,280
Afford to miss out on

864
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:55,840
And I thought that was kind of an optimistic way of

865
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:58,144
Exciting

866
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:04,288
Equally optimistic in there

867
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:11,200
We do work with quite a few venture-capital back companies that we we may not

868
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:13,760
Work with startups that we perceive

869
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:15,808
Have a significant amount

870
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:18,368
Business risk associated with

871
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:20,160
I rely on them to

872
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:22,976
I'll be around if we using

873
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:24,000
But

874
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:29,376
The reason we liked working with Venture capital-backed companies that maybe Yer

875
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:31,680
B round C round type

876
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:37,824
Venture Capital companies is just as he say it can typically be

877
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:44,224
A cutting-edge technology and I'll help us transform where we're going off of Transformer product roadmap

878
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:48,064
Accelerated a year to sister that feeling

879
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:54,464
It's been a great marriage

880
00:38:57,024 --> 00:39:00,096
A customer that we have that they don't

881
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:04,704
And she'll channels and indirect channels that we have and they don't

882
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:10,592
So it's a very symbiotic relationship that sits work very well and in many

883
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:14,176
Avicii. Companies as partners

884
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:17,760
Also consumer Technologies in in we

885
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:22,112
Actually really love to have them as customers of ours cuz they drive

886
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:23,648
Requirements

887
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:30,304
I think intelligently and accelerates the capabilities of our own products

888
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,584
Oh I like that I bet

889
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,376
Are they demanding customers they're like

890
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:35,680
Hey why can't I venmo you buy page

891
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:36,960
My payments

892
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:41,824
They're incredibly demanding or not

893
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,384
Quite a few humbling meeting

894
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,408
With the

895
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:53,088
It's so expensive and tastic and and what we try to do is work with

896
00:39:53,856 --> 00:40:00,000
I've clients at BC back companies as clients usually perceived as having

897
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:02,560
Requirements that you need be

898
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:08,448
A year or two ahead of the rest of the clients we serve and sodas demanding and

899
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:12,288
Don't they look it up you say why aren't you doing a PhD in

900
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:18,688
We actually like it because the active AT&T

901
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:25,088
Looking at it for the rest of the clients that you can sleep there

902
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:29,440
So I have to ask because this site I feel like it's probably part of your job

903
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:30,720
How do you think

904
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:32,256
The Internet of Things is going

905
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:34,560
How to change Pitney Bowes in the next year

906
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:35,584
And then in the next

907
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,352
3 years

908
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:42,496
This is one of our most important initiatives that the company

909
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:43,776
We have

910
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:50,432
A set of 552 foundational Technologies as we describe them that we believe

911
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:51,200
Poppy

912
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:55,040
Tri Core competencies to transforming Who We Are

913
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:58,880
Are corporate strategy and vision is to

914
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:03,488
Leopard 2 combination of physical assets and digital assets

915
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:04,768
The power Converse

916
