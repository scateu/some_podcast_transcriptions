To talk about today

28
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:33,440
Waterbury

29
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:38,304
Cornucopia cornucopia

30
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:41,376
Show me all the stuff

31
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:42,400
What should we

32
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:44,960
We

33
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:51,360
You haven't talked about the Amazon Echo in a bit and I think we should because there's rumors of a new music service

34
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:53,152
And this is odd to me

35
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:56,224
Specific to the echo devices

36
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:58,016
Yeah I thought this was

37
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:58,784
Crazy whack

38
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:02,880
Especially because just a few weeks ago the echo was like you know what

39
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:06,976
Do you want to switch from the default being the Amazon

40
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:08,000
Prime music

41
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,280
How do you say it

42
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:11,584
Yeah you can switch to I think it was to

43
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,632
Noah's Pandora or Spotify

44
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:17,984
Azure default switch I probably did because we use Spotify

45
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:19,776
And that has changed our life

46
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:20,544
Better

47
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:21,824
Well that's important

48
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:23,872
Not.

49
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:26,432
Huge significant ways

50
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:29,248
My life is changed forever

51
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:30,784
Better

52
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,832
Decide by.

53
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,904
Yeah I kind of like

54
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,744
Is Amazon thinking here is it that

55
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:44,352
Necessary could you just make prom better I'm spending $100 a month on

56
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:51,520
Yeah it's it is kind of strange man Amazon is known for trying different things and different models or

57
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:54,592
Different takes on existing models of services so

58
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:59,456
So the newspaper folks who might not have heard the word from my country code

59
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:05,600
Sex yeah they they got information says Amazon facility cheaper music subscription service

60
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:10,976
Which is fine never disclosed a cheaper music that's great but it's only going to work on the

61
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,024
Echo devices and

62
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,424
That's kind of weird because you've already got as you said Amazon Prime music which is what I do use with my echo pretty much all day

63
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,448
Long when I'm at home

64
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,776
And I have the the echo Dot and the dash

65
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:26,080
Different places for different use cases

66
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:30,688
And I'm happy with that I'm a Prime member obviously so pay my 99 bucks and

67
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,224
Taking full advantage of it

68
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,832
But the deal here is it Amazon made do they second service that is going to

69
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:40,160
Cost either for $5 per month

70
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:42,464
And again it would be limited to

71
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:43,488
B

72
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,536
Amazon Echo devices

73
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:48,608
And I'm not sure I get that why would you

74
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,144
I want you close

75
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,544
Service not wear at a headache low service is probably better way to say it is opposed to you know using the more open service

76
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,312
Because

77
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:03,712
Prime music you can use on pretty much anything he's on my iOS devices my Android devices and obviously my echo devices so

78
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,504
I don't know everything

79
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,344
It just seems odd to me and I don't know that I'm going to pay an extra five bucks

80
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:12,928
If I'm already a Prime member music and am happy Prime music

81
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:15,232
Which I pretty much am for my purposes

82
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,512
Taipei

83
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,280
$10 a month

84
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:18,815
Spotify

85
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:22,143
Because they change the default now

86
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:25,215
It's so easy like it was kind of a pain to be like

87
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,495
Play Kanye West

88
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,031
Amazing on

89
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:30,335
Spotify

90
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:31,615
But

91
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,663
The other thing that's weird is

92
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,711
Spotify for me

93
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:38,527
And some of these other services that people can subscribe to

94
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,063
They go after

95
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,855
Sprite and

96
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:43,647
Delimitation

97
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:50,303
And it's also like the only thing I can think of is you Spotify doesn't have a huge heart

98
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:51,839
So

99
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:57,983
If your Amazon and you want to work a deal with music companies to get more music cuz right now not

100
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,263
It's not a huge

101
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:05,663
Selection of like you are songs or esoteric songs on correct correct

102
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,431
These are like

103
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:12,831
You want to do this you want to make a reasonable here's how we're constructionists and they're going to have to acquiesce to

104
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:18,975
Give people more variety in these are people who may not be technically Savvy or interested in survival

105
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:25,887
And that makes sense except for one thing Prime music I already have the Amazon Prime music

106
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:26,655
Service

107
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:31,263
Is that the only Subscription Service have for music now I'm drawing a blank

108
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:36,383
I think so so

109
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:42,783
Instead of coming out with a Prime music that has more than the million or two million tracks that are currently Veil

110
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,087
Mobile for free included with Amazon Prime

111
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,879
This is their play to

112
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,671
Have a broad

113
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,695
Basic music

114
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:51,231
Available for subscription

115
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:51,999
What time

116
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,023
And it's fine

117
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:55,071
But why Limited

118
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,399
So

119
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:03,007
If their focus is on getting people to buy the echo

120
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:08,639
And use it for an into love it right because when you start streaming music

121
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,687
I feel like all this just has a timer

122
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:14,271
But if you're like hey for five bucks a month you also get all the music

123
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:19,903
Yeah

124
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:24,511
No no that make sense

125
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,535
That makes sense

126
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:29,887
And as you were saying that I was double-checking myself there is a pair of there is no

127
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:32,703
Add on Prime music subscription that's just

128
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,263
You have Prime music with Amazon Prime

129
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,287
Or you don't

130
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:42,175
So this is they're taking maybe you're right maybe it is to sell more Echo devices and

131
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:44,991
As they get more of those devices in hand people will

132
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:48,575
Buy more things and use more Amazon services and really that's

133
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:50,111
Kind of their play so

134
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,135
Just

135
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,671
People who don't have Amazon Prime

136
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:54,207
I mean I'm trying to think of

137
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:57,791
They're obviously our people who don't pay $100 for Amazon Prime

138
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,327
And for those people

139
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,863
If you've got an echo

140
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,679
That's the question of how and we don't know

141
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:07,775
How many people have don't have Prime but do have an echo

142
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:08,543
Tumi

143
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:11,615
It's got to be a small amount of the overall

144
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:14,431
But this could be them trying to push out into the broader

145
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,247
I mean the echo is turned into

146
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:23,135
Even people who are not tech nerd so my friends who just don't even think about like smart light bulbs

147
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:32,095
I don't talk to those people and we talked to the text you want to be my friend you got to have a Smart Lipo

148
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,143
Belleville East

149
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:35,679
So

150
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,471
I don't know maybe I'll go hang out

151
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:40,287
Echo in Best Buy

152
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:44,895
I would be curious what they think because I'm struggling to see this as a

153
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:45,663
Big big

154
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:50,015
Play you're just seems really really limited and I'm not sure I understand it yet

155
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,135
Everybody

156
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,159
Building a

157
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:56,927
Schedule for the

158
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:04,095
Between 3 and 4 million is kind of thought process and then imagine the overlap between

159
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,887
Has like certain connected devices

160
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,191
You know it's probably

161
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:15,103
They won't want to leave money on the table if they can pick up a

162
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:17,919
Relatively small percentage it's still a lot of people

163
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,991
So it would add up so

164
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,271
I was going to say so

165
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,831
I'm super intrigued by

166
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:28,415
The smart staging kit for selling your house

167
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:31,231
I want to know because you just sold your house

168
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:36,095
How you feel about this so what this is is Coldwell Banker the real estate firm

169
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:38,143
Has teamed up with Lucia

170
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:38,911
Yes

171
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,191
In August locks

172
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:43,519
To create basically a package to Stage your house

173
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:45,567
That includes an August lock

174
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,615
Which I'm sure the realtor would love to

175
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:49,151
Easier to go in and out

176
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:52,735
Two Lutron connected like light switches

177
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,527
+ + the affiliated

178
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:57,343
Pecos and whatnot plus a Lutron Bridge

179
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,367
And

180
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:03,231
Nest Thermostat one smoke detector in one drop kit

181
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,023
So

182
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,607
That's that's what's in here and it's basically the espresso the

183
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:10,911
Hold if you wanted to get everything if

184
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,703
1135.

185
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:16,287
Which is what I would probably cost you if you did it on your own

186
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:20,895
There's no like super discount here it's just there and then they also offer

187
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:23,711
Professional install of all of this for 500

188
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:24,479
50

189
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:27,807
Course they do

190
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:34,463
So I asked someone who just sold their home and I left my Nest behind but I took all of my

191
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:37,535
Hubs Bridges bulbs cameras Etc

192
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:41,887
I understand why Coldwell Banker is doing this

193
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:44,703
But I think you know they see an opportunity here

194
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:50,335
And I assume they're getting the the hardware at a discount so they're making some money there

195
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,103
But

196
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:53,919
When I hear home staging I think of

197
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:55,199
Renting stuff

198
00:09:56,223 --> 00:10:00,063
But if your stage your home with furniture and pictures and all that

199
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:02,623
You don't buy it and it stays in the house

200
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,903
U-Rent It

201
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:06,463
And it's in there for the showings and then it goes away

202
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,535
This stays in the house if I understand correctly

203
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,375
You don't return it

204
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,143
I'm buying it

205
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,423
Right

206
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:16,447
SO2

207
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,519
If they're calling it staging which I think they're

208
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,567
Playing with the wording here cuz to me

209
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,103
Yeah this is just

210
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:26,175
Let's make your homework charger by turning into a smart home

211
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:28,991
With these products that you could do this all yourself

212
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,015
Santana

213
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:32,063
Kind of Mitt Romney idea

214
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,087
So

215
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,391
Baidu

216
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,439
Baidu

217
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:42,047
We have down the street from a somebody built of 1 Point

218
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:46,143
Dream is a home is being sold for 1.3 million dollars

219
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,167
And

220
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:49,983
I'm looking at the listing for this home

221
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:50,751
I was

222
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:57,151
Struck by the fact that they are advertising all these smartphone feature so they've got like a MyQ garage door opener

223
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:01,759
That's like a hundred and $2,930 garage door thing right

224
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,367
High-end homes anyway

225
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:10,463
Those are the big selling point so it used to be

226
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:17,119
Advertising the granite countertops there like pushing is 1.3 million dollar home with idea that it's smart and has like a

227
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,911
Connect to garage door and I was kind of like

228
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:24,031
And that's because they're selling the feature to people who don't understand

229
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:27,359
This Market the iot market because

230
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,407
People who do know like you

231
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:31,455
Let's honor $30 garage door opener

232
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:34,783
Install that in French

233
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:40,927
My house did not list for a million and change but it had you know the nest and I could have

234
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:43,231
Don't let some other things in there and

235
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:47,583
Anybody can do this you can have a $100,000 house and have these things so

236
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,143
It's people who don't yet understand

237
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:56,543
The cost of these products they just see over the garage door can tell me when its open and then the camera

238
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,103
Tell me what time is the front door this is amazing

239
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,919
Well it is but it's also not

240
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,455
Matt expensive

241
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:06,271
So Coldwell Banker put out a survey

242
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,831
In response to this in the interview at 12

243
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:11,135
Again

244
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:16,255
Coldwell Banker sells real estate so it's important for you guys all to know their biases here

245
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,327
They asked some people about

246
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,375
How they Define move-in ready

247
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,399
And

248
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:28,031
44% said that the mood and ready home has Smart Home Technology already installed

249
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:33,151
45% said a move-in-ready homes new construction my husband the totally

250
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,455
These people must be in the south

251
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:37,759
But they also said

252
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,807
If two homes are exactly alike

253
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:42,111
Most Americans would choose the Smart Home

254
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:46,207
But they don't want to install the gear themselves

255
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:53,119
36% of us respondents believe that having smart technology is a major selling point when buying a home

256
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:56,959
But 32% said they would be scared to install by themselves

257
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:03,871
And I think the the demand numbers for that is only going to go up as you know younger people would be

258
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:04,895
Brought up in

259
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,431
Smartphone age

260
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:10,271
You know I'm leaving this house doesn't have a Nestor

261
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:12,063
And August lock or whatever you know

262
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:15,391
I think it's going to continue but I also hope

263
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,159
That

264
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:20,511
The public starts to better understand what the actual cost of these things are and the fact that

265
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,815
Many of them are not that difficult to install

266
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:27,935
Because they took pay a premium for house or example because it has these things

267
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:29,727
Doesn't make sense to me

268
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,519
Can I get myself on the cheap

269
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:33,567
You are

270
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:38,687
That's the kind way of Truth

271
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,479
Weather that we won't say

272
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,295
I understand understand

273
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:46,367
There's a second listen there's a sign of the population that

274
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:50,975
Doesn't want install doesn't want to know how these things work they just wanted their and they went to work

275
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,023
And they're willing to pay for it I get that I really do

276
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:56,607
Me too but I would hear seriously Stacy Higginbotham plug

277
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:04,287
You can install a Smart Lock even the August in like 15 minutes my daughter who was nine at the time helped me

278
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,055
Install it

279
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:09,151
You can swap out your switches that's a little scary because there is electricity

280
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:12,479
Especially in a home like a neutral wire so relatively new home

281
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:14,783
You can install the stuff

282
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:17,087
So easily and I encourage you

283
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:19,391
2 tribus super empowering

284
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,695
Now if you got two screaming kids you

285
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:23,999
Working all the time and you're like exhausted then

286
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,303
That may not be for you but

287
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:29,119
Try it it's awesome to be like these

288
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:35,519
I do again what Coldwell Banker is going for I still question the whole word staging but

289
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,567
You know what that's a marketing thing that up

290
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,591
Technical singing

291
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,639
That's their business so

292
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:42,431
I'm sure some people take advantage of it

293
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:46,015
The New York Times a couple weeks ago had a whole article on

294
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,807
Is staging really worth

295
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:49,599
So

296
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:52,671
We did not say to her mother

297
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:55,999
Okay and position is so it's like you know

298
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,791
Hey if you plan on moving

299
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:01,887
Maybe the better way to think of it as if you plan on moving

300
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:04,703
You know it's on your house or right

301
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:06,495
So

302
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:12,639
I will give them some Kudos though on the smart home staging. Com site which is where all this information is

303
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:14,687
They do say for sellers

304
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,967
What you sold your home

305
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:20,831
Here's how you should return Smart Home Products their factory default settings which is something I remember to do

306
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:26,463
When I left my house but it's easy to forget that if you're selling your house cuz you got a lot going on

307
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:28,511
I think that's really useful

308
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:29,791
I agree

309
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:34,143
There we go in at some point in time I'm going to have a realtor come on the show

310
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,423
And talk about

311
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:36,447
The investment

312
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:42,079
Solar panels do I can tell you that from experience

313
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:49,503
Southeast Pennsylvania

314
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,319
Okay let's talk about

315
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,343
Oh I don't know Kevin

316
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:56,927
I want to talk about this NFC ring because you like smart jewelry

317
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:59,231
Yasso

318
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:03,839
Back in June or July forget which I'll double-check right now to make sure I did it right

319
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:08,447
Visa it was June Visa announce an nfc-enabled payment ring

320
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,799
14 Visa sponsored athletes to use at the Rio Olympic Games and

321
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,591
Olympic games are over now

322
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:17,663
I'm so what happens all those Rings will they keep working obviously

323
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,455
Their little ceramic

324
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:21,759
Rings that look like a normal ring

325
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,039
And have an NFC chip

326
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:27,391
Inside at no power needed it's just using the electromagnetic fields of a

327
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:29,695
Point-of-sale terminal you put the ring

328
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:33,791
Are your hand over a 20syl terminal you can pay for stuff using your Visa card

329
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:36,863
Tell tokenize insecure in songs Airport

330
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:39,167
Apple pay Android pay Samsung pay Etc

331
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:46,079
The thing is there weren't just for the Olympic athletes we find out because you can go to

332
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:48,383
Nfcring.com

333
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,407
And

334
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:55,039
Purchase your powered by Visa smart ring so it's open to anybody now

335
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,063
And

336
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,599
I really like

337
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:59,391
Hey the look at these things

338
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:02,975
I'll be the price on a 50 bucks which isn't too too bad

339
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:09,375
And see the fact that you know it works with a very standardized system you know NFC and Beezus payment system so

340
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:15,775
I thought I was kind of neat don't know if you saw these at all that one looks just like my wedding ring for Crown but I can swap at my wedding ring cuz

341
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:20,127
I think I buy tungsten carbide ring now but I could replace you with a similar ceramic ring

342
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,407
I have NFC

343
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,431
I love the ideas

344
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:23,455
Sweetie

345
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:26,015
Replace our wedding band with

346
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,855
Best trust me that's no problem my wife just lost her second band

347
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:34,463
Power couple weeks ago and go to Amazon and get a wedding ring whenever she doesn't care

348
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,231
We're not like that

349
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:35,999
I want to

350
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,047
These are very mask

351
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:42,399
I will maybe that's why I like them more

352
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:43,935
So

353
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:47,007
Yeah they're 50 bucks there's one that's 60

354
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:48,287
They look nice

355
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,591
If you want to pay for things I feel like

356
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,639
They don't do much other than payment

357
00:17:54,687 --> 00:18:00,831
They symbolize your love for Nobel paint

358
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:08,255
With have you tried to pay for something using NFC like an NFC product or a wallet

359
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:10,815
I got your phone without being asked to show ID

360
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:12,095
Yeah man

361
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,631
Okay I'm asking

362
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,703
Then you just say this

363
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:23,103
We don't even need your phone I don't think with this

364
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:26,943
Straight up NFL

365
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:32,575
Yeah I don't think you I don't think you need your

366
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:36,415
Your phone at all and it and to be honest it's also not just for payment so you can

367
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:39,487
Use that chip to unlock doors

368
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,279
Ketorolac supports that

369
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:44,095
You can share information through NFC

370
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:47,423
You can program it with that so there's there's more to it than just payments even

371
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:51,263
Yes and they actually have their cheapest one Kevin

372
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,823
You should only 525 and it has it

373
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:56,895
I like that it's like basically there

374
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:57,663
Prototype

375
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,199
Theaters

376
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:00,991
Just like

377
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:02,271
So

378
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:04,319
That's the Vintage model that makes sense

379
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:07,903
And you went did we ever think we would call NFC Rings vintage

380
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:14,815
So

381
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:18,399
I like the eclipse it's got that textured

382
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:19,679
Flip2it

383
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:30,687
Okay

384
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:31,455
So

385
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,223
Lychee

386
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:34,271
Next we should talk about

387
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,039
Ecobee

388
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:38,111
I got a notice on Twitter from

389
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:39,647
Dunk it

390
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:42,463
Who he is

391
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,999
He's a reporter at

392
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,023
Asteroid

393
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,815
So don't really know

394
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:48,095
What that is but

395
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:49,119
Public hello

396
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,143
Sent me

397
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:53,727
News that the FCC founded FCC filing

398
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:55,519
That says there's a new

399
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:00,127
And he's right because we check the FCC database

400
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:01,919
And it is the ecobee Lite

401
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,711
L i t e

402
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:06,527
Bike light bulb

403
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:07,295
Like

404
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,367
Light bulb

405
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,135
Sorry

406
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:12,671
No apology

407
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:14,975
Okay

408
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:15,743
So

409
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:17,279
This feeling

410
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:20,607
There's not much in the FCC database we know it works son but

411
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:22,399
2.4 gigahertz

412
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:26,495
And in the 900 megahertz range switch now that's it

413
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:33,663
Exactly so we were talking about this before the show were like what is he could be doing

414
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:34,431
IPhone get version

415
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:37,247
Maybe it's a sensor free version but then

416
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:39,039
It's got 900 megahertz support

417
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,831
Providence Support Center

418
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:44,159
What is it

419
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:45,183
So what is

420
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,719
What does ecobee light mean

421
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:47,999
We can't tell you

422
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,023
Rihanna

423
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:49,791
Because we don't know

424
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:50,815
I can't tell you

425
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,911
Stat ecobee recently took 35 million dollars from

426
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,447
The Amazon

427
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:57,727
PT's punch

428
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:00,543
Try not to say

429
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,823
She who shall not be named

430
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,615
So they're fun for the echo

431
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:07,711
And it's possible this could incorporate something like

432
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:10,015
Echo voice services

433
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:16,928
Right which means you wouldn't need to have an echo like I have an echo and I tell my echo to change the thermostat by voice and

434
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:17,696
And it does so

435
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,744
Maybe this is native

436
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,024
Voice services

437
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,072
And that makes me wonder Maybe

438
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:28,192
The touch screen is not a touch screen that it's only voice control and that would be the light part

439
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:30,240
Yeah and if that's true.

440
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:31,264
A cheaper car

441
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:40,480
I got to refurb unit off Amazon ecobee3 so I don't remember what the cost nowadays

442
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:41,248
How is your son

443
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:44,832
Okay

444
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:52,256
So I did find interesting the Globe and Mail wrote up

445
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:54,048
About ecobees funding

446
00:21:54,560 --> 00:22:00,704
Time and day in their story mentioned some great shots that I thought were useful about a third of the

447
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:02,752
Users

448
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:04,288
Actually

449
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,616
Blink their devices to either homekit

450
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:10,176
Or the echo or SmartThings

451
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:12,992
So actually going to be a little bit higher

452
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:13,760
But that's okay

453
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:18,368
And ecobee has a 24% market share

454
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,648
According to NPD

455
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:21,184
So it's right behind nest

456
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,464
And that's in the Smart Home

457
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,488
So

458
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:26,048
And personally I like the ecobee

459
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,072
Three more than

460
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:34,752
Same here I left my Nest behind at the old home and then I put the eagle be in here and have a sensor here in my office so

461
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:38,592
And I'm getting too warm in the summertime on the second floor

462
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:39,872
Yay

463
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,200
So the point here is we don't know what is happening

464
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:45,248
But will keep you apprised

465
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:48,064
I'm going for no touch screen

466
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:50,112
Voice control online

467
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:52,416
And that would be great cuz that would be

468
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:54,976
That would have to have a cheaper product

469
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:56,256
Touch screens

470
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,072
Okay

471
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:01,120
Let's see what else do we want to

472
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,400
Kevin YouTube

473
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:06,496
We got two little car tickets we can talk about

474
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:09,568
Going to talk about

475
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,128
Delphi

476
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:19,040
Identify yes yes yes so they Delphi forces with mobileye to develop AC

477
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:20,320
Self-driving system

478
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:26,720
And mobileye if you are not familiar they are the folks that I believe Tesla works with for their

479
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:27,488
Automatic

480
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:29,280
Driving abilities yes

481
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:39,520
That's right yeah yeah yeah so so I guess what Delphi mobile I are planning to do is kind of created

482
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:41,312
An autonomous driving system

483
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:43,104
That any car maker could just

484
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:49,504
I want to say plug-and-play cuz there's more to it than that but essentially create that solution that will work with any car and car makers

485
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,344
Easily just purchased the driving system and install it

486
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,368
Enter there

487
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:55,136
Vehicles

488
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,928
Yes in his cars become

489
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:57,696
Computers

490
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:58,464
I think

491
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,744
The idea of

492
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,328
Creating these kabaddi parts for these modular parks

493
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,352
Computers went down and

494
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:05,376
Tremendously

495
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:06,400
Once we were like

496
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,168
Hey

497
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:12,800
A standardized on you know this kind of instruction sets osx86 let's standardized on

498
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:15,872
A graphics card slot in different buses

499
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:17,408
So if you think about

500
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:20,736
That's basically this model and I think it makes a lot of sense

501
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:22,272
So we'll see if

502
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,552
The carmaker's think so

503
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:26,112
Can I get a smart move

504
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:28,416
Anything else I got you

505
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,768
Notes for the next carpet

506
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:34,048
Connect Adobe

507
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:37,888
The plug-in module

508
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:41,216
These are devices

509
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:45,568
Every car made after 1996 has this slot below the steering wheel

510
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:46,336
Down there

511
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:51,200
You can plug in something to it and it's like on board diagnostics you can see date about the engine

512
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:54,016
Gas mileage all kinds of fun stuff

513
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:57,856
Automatic all of them

514
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:01,696
Have these products that can reduce data and give the data to your smartphone

515
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:07,072
So what automatic is done they have launched their second generation products which has

516
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:08,352
Cellular Bill Jen

517
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,424
And it's I believe 3-g cellular

518
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:13,728
And what it does is

519
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:18,592
Since that day. Not just to you over like when you get home

520
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:22,176
World connection

521
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:24,992
They also send now can send it wherever you are at

522
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,576
This is important for

523
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:32,416
People who like want to see the actual car locations of your parent

524
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,256
Or if your insurance firm

525
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:38,304
Discount space.

526
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:42,912
Which I do I have fun module plug into a two-door cars

527
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:43,680
Sweet

528
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:47,776
It really the most interesting thing for my perspective on this is that it

529
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:49,568
Doesn't have a data subscription

530
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:55,712
So there to whisper sink

531
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:58,528
And it only cost $30 more than the original

532
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:00,320
People who are like

533
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,344
What what

534
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:03,904
It's $100 for the

535
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:08,000
Anon 334b 3G

536
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:10,560
And

537
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:15,680
I'm wondering who's did a network they're using a money gesetz AT&T

538
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:23,616
But you're right AT&T is good for cars Verizon's been doing some really cool stuff though with

539
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:24,384
Connected

540
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,200
So

541
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:30,272
I don't know who funds them and that isn't

542
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:32,320
Really darn good question so

543
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:34,368
If we find out who let you guys know

544
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:37,184
We will find out it something time and

545
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,464
While we're on the subject

546
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,024
OBD ports and what not real quick

547
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:45,888
They're great for getting information but did you know that they're all so awesome for

548
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,448
Sending pushing information

549
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:56,384
So much as I have flashed the software of many Android devices in my time

550
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,968
I have flash the software of my car using the OBD

551
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:06,368
Yeah it's it's actually it's pretty common noun for 3rd party

552
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:11,744
Companies to create new engine mapping software that will boost your

553
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,560
Attorney Brewster turbo pressure boost the

554
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:17,120
The horsepower the torque and so on

555
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:20,448
All done through software and they push it through the OBD port

556
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:21,728
Huh

557
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:26,080
ECU engine control unit of the car which is also for bass

558
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:28,384
It's flash just like you flash a phone or tablet

559
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:30,176
Okay

560
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,832
Sorry I mean sorry the curveball

561
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:41,440
Listen to if this than that which is fine because then you can like

562
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,464
Kinds of other fun stuff

563
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:46,304
And if you ever want

564
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,328
Time time-wasting

565
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:54,752
That they do actually offer like their blogs sometimes has fun posts like where the most aggressive drivers

566
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:58,080
Yeah I program my list

567
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:59,104
Upstart

568
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:03,200
That's what why do you think I made my car faster

569
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:05,504
Kevin your number one

570
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:07,552
So

571
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:17,024
And be most aggressive people

572
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,328
On highways are actually in Phoenix

573
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:20,096
In case you were wondering

574
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:23,936
Also on City roads also in Phoenix

575
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:24,704
So

576
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,264
Yeah I believe it in there many times. Believe it

577
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:28,800
The chillest drive

578
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:33,920
I also believe that Seattle

579
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:38,784
I believe in Seattle to the Lord every time I drive in Seattle I'm like

580
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:42,624
Oh my gosh you people you're so polite and nice what it was

581
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,160
But in the rare aggressive driver

582

They make a I don't know how to describe this thing they provide artificial intelligence

593
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:09,248
Two companies so

594

597
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:20,256

Hey everyone it's Stacey Higginbotham and we are back with the Internet of Things podcast

616
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,264
I am here with Mary

617
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,312
Who is the CEO of nura

618
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:40,384
And we're going to talk about something everybody is super excited about

619
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,176
Artificial intelligence

620
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:43,968
Hello good

621
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:46,528
Hello Stacy thank you for having me

622
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:48,320
I am so glad

623
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:51,136
Taboo because I am super pumped about

624
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:54,976
How we make sense of all this data that's going to be coming in

625
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:58,048
So let's start off with

626
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:04,704
What you guys do so people can understand where you're coming from do you want to give me a quick 22nd view of Mara

627
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:08,800
What it is we do we understand

628
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:10,080
Human contact

629
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:16,992
In what we call the alternate to anything that's not working tonight we try to break down the avial and life into us

630
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:18,272
60 components

631
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,808
Then we allowed

632
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,344
Users to Shelby

633
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,880
Components for the environment

634
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:24,928
The environment can be response

635
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:29,280
A door lock can be sure it's locked after it realizes you fall asleep

636
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:30,816
Vulcan

637
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:33,888
An annotated realizes you're on your way home etcetera etcetera

638
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:35,168
Got it

639
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:38,752
All right now you guys first right now have an app

640
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:40,800
And I actually downloaded it and it was fun

641
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:43,360
It focuses mostly though on

642
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:45,920
Health right now today yes

643
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,992
To our product is an SDK

644
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:51,808
We do have an app that dap is used for

645
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:53,088
Maybe either testing

646
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:55,392
Assistant manager

647
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:56,672
I just want to make sure

648
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:58,720
How cold it is an ingredient

649
00:31:58,976 --> 00:31:59,744
Sits inside

650
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,024
Good healthy products

651
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:03,584
And did these products and then ask

652
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,632
SDK questions

653
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:09,728
Good answer for example you want to know any other fell asleep you want to know any users on

654
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:10,496
Sweet home

655
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:12,544
When user is starting to run

656
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:15,616
And as a result of the answers we provide

657
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:18,176
Theater solution can change its Behavior

658
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:25,344
Sounds kind of worrisome as a user I'm like God I don't know if I want something that knows all of this information

659
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,112
Json about me

660
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:28,928
Telling other devices unless I let it

661
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,768
Festival you really need to understand

662
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:33,536
Lights out

663
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:39,936
If you believe that door lock that make sure it's is it is locked after you fall asleep is beneficial

664
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,264
And you would like to have this functionality

665
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,056
And the question is how

666
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:45,824
To make it

667
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,104
The most secure and safe

668
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:47,872
Convection

669
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:49,664
That you can possibly make

670
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:52,992
But I do agree this thing

671
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,528
We must convey

672
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,344
To the users is what is the upside they're getting

673
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:00,160
So can the music player

674
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:03,232
Bring me that special music when I'm running or

675
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:07,328
When I'm running this phone can stop at pushing noise notifications

676
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:08,608
Do not disturb me

677
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:11,424
And the car will realize they just finished a run

678
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,960
And cool down the car

679
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:14,752
Can all of this

680
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:18,848
Be beneficial to me and if so let me share these pieces of my life

681
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:22,176
With these Solutions so that they can personalize themselves

682
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:23,712
Alright,

683
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:27,296
How are people going to use this what is this going to look like

684
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:30,368
If your vision of the world comes to fruition

685
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,904
Believe again

686
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:33,952
Similar to the internet

687
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:35,744
And devices

688
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,768
Mobile experience

689
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:39,072
Lily personalized insult to our needs

690
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:39,840
So

691
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:42,144
I can't think of a chronic disease

692
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:46,240
Be connected with my diabetes results

693
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:47,520
Hypertension

694
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:49,568
And the answer is definitely yes

695
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:51,360
A glucometer today

696
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:52,640
Is this a sensory

697
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:54,944
Takes your blood glucose cut, cable

698
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:55,968
Overtime

699
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:58,528
What is the glucometer look in real life

700
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,064
The time I just

701
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,624
Woke up and I'm on my way out of the home

702
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:05,440
Now would be a good time to interject

703
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:06,208
MessYourself

704
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:10,304
I understand that I am about addictively to start a run

705
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:12,352
And I haven't measured myself

706
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:14,144
For the last 3 hours

707
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:15,680
Enso mattress

708
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:17,984
Advise me to eat an apple

709
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:18,752
Measurements

710
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:21,056
Now this glucometer

711
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:25,152
Changing the behavior to me versus to University or third person

712
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,944
And takes care of

713
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:29,504
And this can happen tomorrow

714
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,528
Technology

715
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:31,296
Make this

716
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:32,320
Happened to Momo

717
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:35,136
You can think of any type of medical

718
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:36,160
Solutionwhere

719
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:40,000
Example they want to provide you with Insight so today what's happening is

720
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:44,352
You have 6000 inside and they just throw some Matthew hoping that they would work

721
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:49,728
What is this solution realizes that I'm about sleeping so the inside tube

722
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:51,008
Potato to mining

723
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,568
Verses on my worst exercises

724
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,384
And so these inside need to be tailored to my niece

725
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,408
So now

726
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,200
Again you and me

727
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:00,992
Mike gets very very different

728
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:02,016
Experience

729
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:03,040
From this device

730
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:04,320
Solution

731
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:07,392
And so on and so forth I really believe

732
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:13,792
That the power of context of AI is relevant tomorrow and not necessarily

733
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:15,584
Innotech is from today

734
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:16,608
Awesome

735
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,424
This feels almost like magic so

736
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,704
Talk to me about

737
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,008
How this happens in

738
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:25,824
What do my devices need to know when how is the setup

739
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:30,432
It's important to realize that this

740
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,480
Interweb inter

741
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:34,016
It's nice if you and me

742
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:35,808
Clever wording to Google

743
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:42,464
Google try to understand what is it I mean when I say gift in you mean when you say gift in personalized results when you and me

744
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,488
Going to Amazon

745
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,048
Home page and why is that

746
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:46,816
Because

747
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:50,656
Amazon price to increase our conversion to make it more relevant to us

748
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:51,680
In what

749
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:53,728
I called the ultimate

750
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,520
Mobile experiences

751
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:59,104
In the experiences we're not there yet

752
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:01,920
Whole Space is much more today

753
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:07,296
I will stick to you like that will focus on Health and Wellness

754
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:12,672
And presently we work with a glucometer so think of a glucometer the tree lights

755
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:14,208
Feel about starting run

756
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:15,744
We are about to enter restaurant

757
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,768
And as a result

758
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,352
Advise you to admit to yourself or give you some insight on

759
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:21,632
Children shouldn't run

760
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,424
Aeromexico

761
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,216
Set a remind me to take that

762
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:27,008
Medication at 8 a.m.

763
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:32,640
Medisafe with another customer can remind you to take that medication before you leave home predictively or

764
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:36,224
Just after you wake up which for you might be 6 a.m. for me might be

765
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:36,992
10 a.m.

766
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:38,272
And so

767
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:39,040
Again

768
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:40,320
Little Things

769
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:41,088
That

770
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:43,392
Will take this opportunity

771
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:48,000
Into a a sweet same Evolution as the internet went through

772
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:49,536
Similarly

773
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:50,560
Will experience

774
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:53,888
Better engagement ring conversion better personalization

775
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:54,912
Okay

776
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:59,520
So many of these examples that you could have mentioned I see

777
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:04,896
One company that has the data in makes this change in their individual product

778
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:07,968
What's different about the Internet of Things is there

779
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,528
Lots of products and

780
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:15,136
We're trying to get them to work together so I'm curious if that changes how you build something

781
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:22,560
Solution to becoming a small solution you got all kinds of ways to do it

782
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:24,608
Some ways legal equal subject matter

783
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:28,192
Door locks in the oven

784
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:29,984
Whatever

785
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:30,752
Delightful

786
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:31,776
But some of them

787
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:35,104
Diesel 82

788
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,640
What is the human

789
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:37,664
Contacts

790
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:42,016
We talked about tomorrow call example typically what you say is

791
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:44,320
Talk about Entertainment System

792
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:48,160
Talk about telematics you talk about autonomous driving all of these

793
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:49,696
Ozone the car

794
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:52,000
Sleep deprived

795
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:55,072
Lights when you enter the car we just finished a run

796
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:57,632
You sweaty when you enter the car can impact

797
00:37:57,888 --> 00:37:58,912
The car Behavior

798
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:00,960
Luck has nothing to do with the car

799
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:02,752
About understanding the person

800
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:03,776
Rental cars

801
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:06,848
Car playlist deep focus on what they do best

802
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:08,384
Which is their own device

803
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:10,176
In with we do

804
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:12,736
Philosophy we advocate for

805
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:16,064
Let's understand the human in a good holistic manner

806
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:17,344
And then

807
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:21,440
These understanding can benefit multiple facets

808
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:24,256
Standardization protocol play then

809
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:26,304
An action subject Methodist

810
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:30,400
Got it so then I would think that a company like Google

811
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:35,264
Or possibly even Amazon or Facebook that has a lot of information

812
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:36,800
About me is a

813
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:38,336
Person already

814
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:41,920
Might be a venom more powerful position to do this

815
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:46,784
You can bet the Google is not interested

816
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:48,576
To cool down my room

817
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:51,136
I did not why they buy Sims card company

818
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:52,416
They're interested in.

819
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:55,744
Odell doing building very proactive

820
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:59,328
To get this sort of what again what I called the outernet

821
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:01,120
Things are not Webbie

822
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:02,912
It's definitely

823
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:05,984
Specifically we feel

824
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:07,776
Technology

825
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:12,640
But the model by which we work which gives the user full transparency

826
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:16,736
Just think about

827
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:18,528
This amount of data

828
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:22,112
Is now being collected and aggregated around you

829
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:22,880
Anyone

830
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:26,464
Midlands action recipes Constantin very limited

831
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,488
Serve your needs

832
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,792
Which is not the Google Motorola

833
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,352
Old Amazon

834
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:34,400
Let's give you something free

835
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:36,960
And sell your life to a Nike phone ad

836
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:40,544
Okay so how does this how does this model work

837
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,128
How are you guys collecting all this data about me

838
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:47,712
Against the way we advocate for this new

839
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:48,992
Economy

840
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:50,784
Is to provide compelling

841
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:51,552
To the user

842
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:53,600
You want the door locked

843
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:55,136
HELOC after you.

844
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:59,488
Make it make sense for you to let the door lock know that you falling asleep

845
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,024
And in exchange

846
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,048
Get that value

847
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:03,328
The door being locked

848
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,864
You need to understand that

849
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:08,448
What doesn't need to get is the fact that you

850
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:11,008
Waking up or the fact that you are

851
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:16,896
Sleep Quality vs. Sleep Quality or how much time you sleeping are you sleeping next to

852
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:18,688
Interesting for the user

853
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:23,040
Let the door lock know if the door lock connect to just a Sleep Center

854
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:24,576
Then they get all of that

855
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:28,672
Type in to get the burden of only listening to a sensor or not

856
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:30,720
Utilizing algorithm

857
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:35,072
This is definitely the mother that we advocate

858
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:36,864
The way we do it then

859
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:42,496
Alcoa skillset is essentially algorithm we collect data from multiple channels app 200 channels

860
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:45,824
And we take all of that to put it into an agreement

861
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:50,176
Try to figure out what does this picture mean does it mean that use a fell asleep

862
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:52,736
In the falling asleep example

863
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:55,296
It can be anywhere from sensory activity like

864
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:58,112
Sleep sensing motion sensing

865
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,416
Mobile elements like

866
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:01,440
Is there lights

867
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:03,488
Are you charging

868
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,048
UPS to Patton Elementary this your home

869
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:07,840
This we typically sleep at

870
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:12,192
Have you home this is the time you color you typically fall asleep at the Tara Tara

871
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:15,264
Whatever we get would fit into very agile

872
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:17,056
Algorithm

873
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:18,592
Sin City 1 or 0

874
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:19,872
Okay

875
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:24,992
And then you sell your SDK and a company would say hey I want the results of this sleep data

876
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:27,040
Coolest I want to be today

877
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:31,904
Example when the user for the sleep wake up sore about to wake up predictive later.

878
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:34,464
As a result I'm going to change my

879
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:35,488
Solution

880
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:36,256
I'm going to

881
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:37,792
Turn off the lights

882
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:40,352
Lock the door reminder take a pill whatever

883
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:43,168
But again if you use all solution user

884
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,704
Must be involved

885
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:48,288
So the door lock will not come to dinner until he knew I want to know when

886
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:49,568
Stacey fell asleep

887
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,128
It would go to Stacy and say hey Stacy

888
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:53,919
I want to make sure the door is locked

889
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:58,271
After you fall asleep in exchange I ask that you would let me know

890
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:00,575
Understanding the value

891
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:02,367
Will approve the transaction

892
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:04,159
Got it

893
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:04,927
So

894
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:07,743
Where are we today with the deployment of

895
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:09,279
Will call at AI in the outer

896
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:13,631
I think it's the really initially think what you see is that

897
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:16,447
Fulton Health and Wellness

898
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:19,775
Received the spaces siloed some elements

899
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:21,823
Space amoeba world summer list

900
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:24,127
Examples most home today

901
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:26,943
People are still going to focus on the basics lollipop

902
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:28,991
When I tell you to lock u-lock

903
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:30,527
Michaela Conlin

904
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:31,295
That's it

905
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:33,087
If you can do that I'm good for now

906
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:35,135
In the space is not even there yet

907
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:40,511
In medical for example you have dozens of glaucoma till dozens of mobile apps

908
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:41,279
Today

909
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:43,071
And now they're seeking for that

910
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:45,119
Differentiate

911
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:48,703
Okay bye I can give you some basic lollipop position

912
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:49,983
And now let me

913
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:51,519
Personalize it like me

914
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:53,823
Hey make it more intuitive to you

915
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:56,127
It's very similar to the internet

916
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:56,895
Used to have

917
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:58,175
Dumb portal

918
00:42:58,431 --> 00:42:59,711
One website fits all

919
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:02,527
Evolve evolve now

920
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:03,807
Your website

921
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:05,087
My website would not

922
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:07,391
The same lips that do not behave

923
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:09,183
2 Yuan to mean the same as

924
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:12,255
Are you concerned that when people think about AI

925
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:14,815
They still think of Skynet in the end of humanity

926
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:16,607
And I would love to get

927
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:18,399
Your response to that

928
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:19,167
Because

929
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:24,799
Do you feel like we're anywhere close should we be worried about this or are we still so far off

930
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:27,359
Technologically

931
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:29,407
Technologically I think

932
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:31,455
Even if you scrape the boundaries of

933
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:33,503
Psychology today understanding

934
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:35,039
Human behavior

935
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:37,087
Predicting human behavior

936
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:38,367
Extremely difficult

937
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:40,415
I do think that the way

938
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:41,695
That has been handled

939
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:42,463
Is

940
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:44,767
Something of concern and I think you see it

941
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:47,327
You see how the market this concert like

942
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:50,399
Coyotes not about what websites do I serve

943
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:53,215
Select my home systems my car system

944
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:54,751
Health Systems

945
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:57,823
I think we have an offer

946
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:58,591
Tunity

947
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:01,151
Two again change the rules of the game

948
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:03,199
But

949
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:06,015
Honestly think he is being utilized

950
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:07,039
As a buzzword

951
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:08,319
Trading

952
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:09,855
Expectations article

953
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:11,391
Not really easy

954
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:15,231
And I think we're potentially getting going to get hit by that

955
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:20,607
Because two three years from now experienced are going to get better but you not going to see any Terminators roaming the streets

956
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:23,679
That's good yes the Terminator probably shoot me

957
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:24,703
Before I got here

958
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:26,495
So you mentioned

959
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:30,847
That we have a chance to change the way we handle this data to me it feels like a lot of

960
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:34,431
But that horse is already out of the barn so I'm kind of curious

961
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:35,967
Why you say that

962
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:36,991
And how we can

963
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:38,783
Put the horse back in the barn

964
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:41,855
Craigslist in the internet

965
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:45,439
No one reads terms of agreement before they press I agree

966
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:47,231
That's again descent of the things

967
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:49,023
Also this one set of.

968
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:51,071
Goodwill not used to sharing

969
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:56,959
Even Samsung you see the de-emphasized privacy

970
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:58,239
Very much

971
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:01,823
And so the Google way of doing things is being challenged

972
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:04,383
Even Google itself is taking measures to

973
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:05,919
Increase transparency

974
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:10,783
The way I look at it is this is as follows I think you have enough companies

975
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:12,319
The don't deal with data

976
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:16,671
But I'll players in the Internet of Things by Samsung hblg Lenovo

977
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:18,719
Good movies to give you valium

978
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:19,487
You buy some

979
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:23,071
And they have an embedded incentive

980
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:24,863
Increase that value

981
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:26,399
Enhance add value

982
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:28,191
You asked

983
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:28,959
So

984
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:30,751
You have multiple players

985
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:32,543
Will at least appreciate

986
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:35,615
An alternative to the Google way of doing

987
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:40,223
If we can present them with this alternative that is technologically good

988
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:42,527
They will use that

989
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:44,831
So I think now is essentially a race

990
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:47,903
Network effect Weber can get

991
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:49,183
What's a good AIC

992
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:50,975
Technology to enough hands

993
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:53,023
I will set the tone

994
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:56,607
Oh my gosh that's a huge burden for consumers because they don't

995
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:59,423
They may not understand the terms and

996
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:01,215
What is even going on here

997
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:06,847
I mean people are just as freaked out about Samsung televisions that are unicorn quote always listening

998
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:08,639
As they are about you know

999
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:09,407
Google

1000
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:12,479
CM Nest thermostat in their house so

1001
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:14,783
How to communicate that to the end user

1002
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:16,575
I agree with you completely

1003
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:18,623
Anythink

1004
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:20,415
Against a lot of

1005
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:22,207
Incentive to

1006
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:24,511
Not make the screen still in to the user

1007
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:26,559
This is why you have 50 days

1008
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:28,607
Signs of a gay man that no one reads

1009
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:32,191
And you expected to sign to get whatever a Gmail

1010
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:33,727
And I do think you know

1011
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:34,751
Christmas

1012
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:36,031
Experience

1013
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:40,895
Did the Fiasco that happened so far for example the Samsung TV

1014
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:42,175
Something that it has

1015
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:43,455
Card Samsung

1016
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:44,479
Significant

1017
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:46,527
They are actively seeking

1018
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:49,855
I mean that's a perfect example of

1019
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:51,903
A company realizing

1020
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:53,439
Get this done wrong

1021
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:54,463
Klein

1022
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:56,767
Very profusely to change that

1023
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:00,095
I honestly think

1024
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:02,911
Consumer loan will not be able

1025
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:03,935
2

1026
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:05,471
She was at movement

1027
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:10,335
You need both the demand side and the supply-side realizing that there is a business model

1028
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:12,383
You're not being a spy

1029
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:13,919
Letting being

1030
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:15,199
A villi

1031
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:19,295
Diligent with how you handled that there is money to be made in Gotti to be

1032
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:21,599
All right I love it

1033
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:25,183
And I can't wait to see if this works out so

1034
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:28,767
