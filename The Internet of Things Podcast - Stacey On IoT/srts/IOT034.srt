00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:13,056
Hey everyone welcome back this is the Internet of Things show and I am your host

2
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:14,336
Stacey Higginbotham

3
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:16,128
And we have

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,408
Kevin tofel

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,432
End

6
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:24,832
Today we have actually a lot of news we have a brand new smart home from Lowe's we have an update to the Bluetooth

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,672
And we have some fun kind of new devices on sale in

8
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:32,256
In various places including a new night light so

9
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:34,560
Let's get started we'll start with d

10
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:37,632
The launch of the second generation Lowe's

11
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:38,656
Iris

12
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:40,448
Which

13
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:44,032
To be honest I have yet to try out because I'm actually heading

14
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:46,592
I guess I should say I'm heading out of town because by the time

15
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:48,640
Y'all hear this I will be almost back

16
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:51,968
And I hadn't had a chance to try it out yet so I was like

17
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:53,248
Like hold a review for a minute

18
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:56,576
Did want to talk about it because Lowe's

19
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:57,856
Has actually been

20
00:00:58,368 --> 00:01:00,160
Really prescient in the space

21
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:06,560
DIY retailer you guys are probably familiar with it they launched the iris platform back in 20

22
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:07,328
12

23
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:10,144
Which is way before you know smart things and

24
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,216
Revolve if you guys remember the revolve home automation hub

25
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:15,008
And other things rather

26
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,544
It was ahead of its time

27
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,080
For what it offered at the time

28
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:21,920
It did and when I reviewed the original Iris I dinged it because

29
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:24,480
Cuz it had well a couple reasons it had it

30
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:26,784
First off it came with a

31
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,808
Premium

32
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:29,600
And another it came with it

33
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:30,624
Three-tiered

34
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:33,184
Subscription plans I had a free version

35
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:33,952
A

36
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:35,488
Medium version and then

37
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:36,768
Premium version

38
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,816
The new version has

39
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:39,840
A two-tier plan which

40
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:40,608
What is Friant

41
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:44,192
I didn't like the idea of having a DIY system that also had a

42
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:44,960
Subscription fee

43
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:45,984
But you know what

44
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:48,544
That's the bottle everyone is actually turning to

45
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:55,456
The other thing it had its hub actually had both a backup battery at the time and the option to

46
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:56,992
Papa cellular modem in

47
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:00,320
Which is something that SmartThings is actually doing now

48
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:02,624
But I expect to see that for a lot of other

49
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,208
Hubs to make the best of it more resilient the SmartThings option is

50
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:09,792
It's an integrated option I assume you don't put in a plug in a modem or anything

51
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,328
I believe you actually

52
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:12,608
2/2

53
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:17,216
The original SmartThings didn't have the backup battery out

54
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:20,800
Which is important

55
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:22,848
I don't recall it what the original price

56
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:26,432
Of the iris Hub was but now I think it's $59

57
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,224
The original price was $99

58
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,832
Current price for the new version is 5999

59
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:33,856
Which puts it

60
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:36,928
Very close just $10 more than the wink hub

61
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,976
Which is what those rifle

62
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,024
So

63
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,048
The other thing

64
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,072
The big difference

65
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,608
For the lowest version

66
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:45,632
Github

67
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,936
I guess so kind of will lay it out for you

68
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,984
The Lowe's how is controlled

69
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,264
Bi-Lo's so

70
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:53,824
Lowe's hosts all of it in the

71
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,640
In Microsoft Azure so it's hosted by Lowe's

72
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:59,456
They control everything they offer support for it

73
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:02,272
So this is not like wink was actually

74
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:03,552
Africa company in

75
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:04,832
Now it's

76
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:06,112
Since work is bankrupt

77
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:07,648
Minkus on the market

78
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,744
Flextronics is offered to buy it will stay at the bankruptcy court allows it to

79
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:14,048
It's a little different setup than most of the other

80
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:15,584
Jobs out there

81
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,888
So lows also

82
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,680
Has its own branded Gadget

83
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:21,472
Cats that are Iris branded gacha

84
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:23,008
Step work with the eye

85
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,336
Lowe's does not bring in

86
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:27,616
Hue light bulb

87
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:35,040
That's what I was going to ask because I've already looked at the new Iris by Lowe's website which does have the new Hub and

88
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,320
Looks like there's a

89
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:39,904
A starter pack for $249 with a bunch of Gadgets in there

90
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,464
But all I see are Iris Brandon

91
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,792
Devices for that so is it not as open as some others

92
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,840
It is not now I

93
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:50,144
Lowe's does work with

94
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,936
Established vendors to make

95
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:52,704
Lowe's

96
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,472
Stranded

97
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:54,752
Versions

98
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:55,520
Of their products

99
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,824
You're not going to see a Lowe's Brandon Ness

100
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,176
But you know they work with centralite they work with

101
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:04,992
Aaon Tech they work with a lot of these other

102
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,784
Kind of companies that make

103
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,600
You notice the motion sensors that things like that

104
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:10,624
They have connect

105
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,904
Do pet doors connect

106
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,184
Garage door openers

107
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,488
Cameras

108
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,024
A lot of the things you're going to

109
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,303
Want they just

110
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,351
Brandon Iris and then they sell them

111
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:22,399
For your kind of customer is a few

112
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:25,727
Play so this isn't for someone who's shopping on Indiegogo or

113
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:26,495
Kickstarter and

114
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:29,055
I can't wait to buy the latest gadget

115
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:31,103
This is for someone who's like

116
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:34,687
Perusing the aisles of lausanne is like I really want to automate my house

117
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:35,711
Hey

118
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:36,479
Connected Outlets

119
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,783
Great I'll buy them

120
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,831
Will too limiting for me I think

121
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:43,903
Is this is probably not for you and I but

122
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:46,719
If you're like an insteon fan this

123
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:49,535
Insteon limits you write in

124
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:52,863
Yeah baby

125
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:56,447
I got into insteon back in 2010 because there weren't many other options

126
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:58,751
Since then I got to wait for him because it's not as

127
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:03,615
Open and passed away in current or some other hubs and such so

128
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,919
So so yeah so this is for those

129
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:10,783
So once I have a chance to get it get it in my hands and review it I will say that

130
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:13,599
One of the other complaints I have when I did the original

131
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,135
Lowe's Iris

132
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,415
Was that it was

133
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:17,695
Web-based

134
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,999
So they had a web portal

135
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:25,119
But I couldn't do things on my mobile which was really weird to me at the time

136
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:28,191
Now it seems like they have switched based on

137
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,495
Well they better than iOS

138
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,263
Send Android app

139
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:34,335
I knew that going in but based on a review that you found cat

140
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,639
It sounds like they may

141
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,711
Gone completely away from their web version

142
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:46,111
That's what it looks like and it's just according to One customer review so you know I can't validate it by any means I don't know

143
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:46,879
I don't have the

144
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:48,671
The devices and such here

145
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,951
He had

146
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:54,047
A number of complaints but I'm not going to think it's fair to go through the living that

147
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,839
Is a sub even available yet

148
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:56,607
Or I guess

149
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:57,887
They have this available now

150
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,191
As of month

151
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:03,775
I almost don't feel right talking about 1 review but okay

152
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:07,103
It just you never know it could be one person's experience

153
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:09,663
I will say that it concerned me that he said

154
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,991
It couldn't as a pair of any Z-Wave devices but as we just said

155
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,015
You know

156
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:16,831
It's the iris ecosystem so

157
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:20,159
Maybe it's even trying to take non Iris devices

158
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,183
I don't know

159
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:25,791
His version one key fob isn't working with the new version to HUB as well so

160
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:29,375
You know that there's going to be transitional paying for people that probably the first

161
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,935
Version of this everybody else maybe not

162
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:37,567
You know what I will say I do like this cuz I mean I know I sound like I'm the hating on it a little bit here with

163
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:39,871
I do like if you go to the website

164
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:44,991
And they show you all the different things you can do you know when the activities in the devices

165
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,295
Codify them by saying

166
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:52,159
Is this one simple to install this is a moderate project to install this one's involved

167
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:54,207
This one is free this one is premium

168
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:58,047
It's really nice how they actually show all that's very consumer-friendly in terms of presentation

169
00:06:59,071 --> 00:06:59,583
There you go

170
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:04,191
And iiii will remain like when I tested the original Iris it was very

171
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,495
Consumer-friendly like

172
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,519
When you

173
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:09,823
Pair to device The Hub actually beat

174
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,615
You didn't have to wait for like

175
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:18,271
The device to register on the screen or something to possibly flash a different color you just had a instant comp

176
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,039
Information

177
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:22,111
And this was back at a time when you repairing things and

178
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:22,879
Sometimes

179
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:23,647
You know

180
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:25,695
Your app would like timeout

181
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:28,255
Or fail and then you would be like I don't know did it work

182
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:32,095
And then you have to restart everything in poop there would be like magic and you like

183
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,399
And then you know

184
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,423
But you have no idea

185
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,191
So

186
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:38,239
You know they're there little things that make

187
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:40,031
A really big difference and that was like

188
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:44,127
I thought you know I didn't like the fees I didn't like some of the other things about it

189
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,407
DUI was only so

190
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,175
So so

191
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,015
You know it felt very consumer-friendly but it also felt blessed

192
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:53,343
But some of the more advanced things that I was testing

193
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,647
They totally didn't nail the basic

194
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,927
Looks like Iris

195
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,975
The timers at Rita

196
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,767
So I can't wait to see what they've been

197
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,071
So let's stay tuned for that

198
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,863
In the meantime

199
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,655
Let's think about

200
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:10,751
Let's see what are we thinking about let's talk about the new Bluetooth which by the way

201
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:13,823
Is one of the new radios that the Lowe's Iris Hub ads

202
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,103
Yay

203
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,383
That's cool

204
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,711
Oh yeah so so after our show last week

205
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:22,271
The Bluetooth special interest group the folks at

206
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:25,599
Promote the Bluetooth standards and help great Diamond songs

207
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:26,623
They

208
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,743
You're talkin about bluetooth smart devices next year that will be sending information farther and faster

209
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,023
So that's a win-win

210
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:36,863
They said they shared some details of their 2016 road map

211
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,655
Telling us what to expect so

212
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,679
Weather sion

213
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,215
Assuming everything is accurate

214
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:46,335
On the road maps are saying the overall range of Bluetooth smart devices will expand four times over

215
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:50,431
And data transfer speeds will be doubled over today's Bluetooth devices

216
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,455
So

217
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:53,247
What seems to be driving this

218
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:55,039
Is IRT

219
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,319
As soon as I can I guess

220
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,599
I guess you can guess

221
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,647
But I know you would have said I was

222
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:00,671
Cuz everything

223
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,975
Hanson Brothers

224
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:09,887
So you know this is good even better though which I love I love I love this in this is actually a nice bit for iron

225
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:12,959
Bluetooth will support as of next year

226
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:13,727
Mesh

227
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:14,495
Networking

228
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,263
Okay

229
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,591
So here's where things get a little crazy though Kevin

230
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,359
Okay

231
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,383
I have talked

232
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,407
To SIM network

233
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,175
Engineers

234
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,223
And we have had

235
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:24,991
Actually

236
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:29,599
I don't know if these are network Engineers are just radio nerds like in the chip industry so

237
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,623
Weaknesses

238
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,903
These are the people I drink

239
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:34,463
We got to visit discussions about mesh Network

240
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:36,511
Am I understanding is

241
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,815
The way Bluetooth does its Mesh networking

242
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:39,839
Is

243
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,631
Inherently inefficient

244
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,935
Did they argue that Bluetooth

245
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,215
Mesh networking

246
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,751
Is less efficient

247
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:49,311
And kind of can flood your network

248
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:54,175
Because the way it does it is it basically shouts out to all of the devices

249
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,223
Hey

250
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:58,015
Tell so-and-so dis

251
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:02,111
Hey tell so-and-so this so the more divide it tells every single device

252
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:08,511
As you increase the number of devices on your network it tends to flood the network

253
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,047
In Kabul

254
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,351
Now the way like

255
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,887
And these are thread propone

256
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:16,959
So take all of this with a grain of salt because

257
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:20,799
I can't evaluate that these arguments I can only like

258
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:22,847
But this sounds

259
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:25,407
This is accurate like when I look at the

260
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:28,223
So this is not inaccurate

261
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,247
I just don't know

262
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,807
On the thread side

263
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:33,855
They're going to a proxy

264
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,415
So they go to one thing and they say hey

265
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,439
Tell this

266
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,999
You got your in charge of this message

267
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,279
Tell the following

268
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:42,815
When someone checks

269
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:44,095
For this information

270
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,119
Tell them this

271
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:46,911
Witches

272
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:47,679
More

273
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:48,959
Bandwidth efficient

274
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:52,287
Well you know I

275
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:55,103
The Bluetooth say didn't share all the technical details.

276
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:55,871
Supreme

277
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:57,407
Outline with a roadmap

278
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,687
Plans are

279
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,735
So the implementation on how it's going to work

280
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,271
I don't know and I don't

281
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:05,087
Unfortunately I don't go out and drink with radio nerds but

282
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,111
That is a

283
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:10,463
It is I know I believe I'm missing out trust me I haven't answered your question probably

284
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,743
So I just want to say

285
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,767
What I'm saying

286
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:16,607
Radio nerds if you were listening to the show like the Bluetooth

287
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,143
Tell me

288
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,191
Give me the answer to this like

289
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,727
Maybe the threat guys

290
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:26,591
Like you like yes that's true but the downside to the other way of doing Mesh networking is

291
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:27,615
I don't know

292
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:28,639
It's Radioactive

293
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:35,807
Let's hope not puppies are named in getting those proxy so

294
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:37,087
We'll stay tuned to hear that

295
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:43,743
Okay so that is that is the update on Bluetooth we we kind of knew that was coming because we did know that

296
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:46,815
You know the Bluetooth say was looking at mesh Network

297
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:47,583
Because

298
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,607
We do need

299
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:51,423
Better mesh networks this does in my mind

300
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:52,959
Weed to once again

301
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:58,079
Are we going to have Bluetooth or we going to have thread because they're it they're still setting themselves up for kind of a

302
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,383
The Showdown

303
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,943
There was a Clash of the Titans cuz both of these standards

304
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,223
Why can't I type

305
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:05,247
In terms of data

306
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:06,783
But

307
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:09,087
We'll see did you find out what the data rates

308
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:09,855
AR

309
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:10,879
With the 2x date

310
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,183
That was one of the questions I had

311
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,207
And I didn't get any answer

312
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,999
No I do not know

313
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:18,303
Second question for the Bluetooth Sig people

314
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,839
Explain to us

315
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:23,935
Radio networking the new data rates

316
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,215
Because

317
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:26,239
That's important

318
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,799
And will will definitely update on that

319
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,591
So now

320
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,639
Before we sound like real idiots explaining

321
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:34,687
Something we don't know much about let's move on

322
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:39,551
We've got lissy a new retail channel for some more iot stuff in

323
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:44,927
I am super excited about this because I love being able to go and put my hands on more devices

324
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:48,511
Send the device is the Leo night light is now in Lowe's

325
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,047
Stores in Best Buy

326
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:54,143
Best Buys in Toledo NightLight is a

327
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,239
$99 smoke detector we actually might have talked about it last week

328
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:00,287
When we talked about the roost

329
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,591
We might have benches

330
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:04,383
It sounds familiar my TV on

331
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,175
Banana show way way way back

332
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,199
At one point in time

333
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,223
It's a

334
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:11,807
Plug-in night light that's connected and listens for smoke alarms

335
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:14,879
So what it does is it listens for your smoke detector

336
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:17,695
And then it tells you basically

337
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:19,999
It tries to figure out where

338
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:23,327
The smoke detector is coming from and is like hey and then it

339
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,095
A Pikachu

340
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:28,447
So I can send alerts

341
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:34,335
Retrofitting your smoke detectors without buying the $100 desk in as many rooms as yes

342
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:40,223
So it's kind of a nice option that night light isn't LED that changes colors my my daughter loved it when we tried it

343
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:40,991
It's very

344
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,271
You know it's fun

345
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:47,135
So you could use one of these to monitor several smoke detectors which is worth the cost savings

346
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:48,671
Exactly

347
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,439
Yeah okay

348
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,719
Annie's early

349
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:53,279
Gotcha is there a monthly fee or anything

350
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:58,655
Back in the day it was $99 I believe it is still 99

351
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,191
So

352
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:00,959
200

353
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,239
Sketchy your whole house

354
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:07,103
It will not tell you though when your smoke alarm is out of battery

355
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,895
So you stuck in the 3 a.m.

356
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,943
Unless you buy what we talked about

357
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,223
The roost

358
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:12,991
Yeah

359
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,015
So

360
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:14,783
There you have it

361
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:17,087
What's interesting about Leo is

362
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:20,927
Back in June they actually did a layoff or they laid off a couple

363
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:21,695
People

364
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:25,279
And lo and behold there still like it we were all kind of worried we're like

365
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,815
There is a lot of money

366
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,607
They are doing layoffs

367
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,655
Going to be a sad sad story

368
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:33,215
Do you know if this is their only product right now

369
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:36,799
I believe it is their only shipping product they are

370
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:39,103
Planning to make a wide array of Prada

371
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:41,663
Text Leo is interesting because they have a global

372
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,943
They want to be global

373
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:46,783
They're very focused on making products for

374
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,831
Specific Geographic areas

375
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:50,879
So yeah

376
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:53,695
Oh you know what we haven't talked about by the way

377
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:54,463
No

378
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:56,767
With all of our Smartwatch moves

379
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,303
Fossil

380
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,351
Buy misfit

381
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,887
Route 206

382
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:02,911
60 million dollars

383
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:09,567
Yes yes yes yes Misfit the folks with the make the shine the shine the really pretty tiny live

384
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,663
Tracker tracker

385
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:14,687
They make

386
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,991
Connect to light bulbs take to make the bolt

387
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:19,551
Connected light bulbs something that I always forget

388
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:23,391
I have not tried the bolt I have not tried them either because I'm like

389
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,671
Random products

390
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,719
Fat people

391
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:29,791
But I wanted to get your take on that news because

392
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,839
I was kind of it first like

393
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,119
Why is this house

394
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:39,519
Fossil people do not think of fossil when it comes to smart watches and I'm not going to say that people

395
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:40,287
Are thinking

396
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:43,871
A lot about smart watches right now but when they do they're not paying me fossil

397
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:46,943
They should because fossil has been involved in the store

398
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:47,711
Smartwatch

399
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:49,759
Business for well over a decade

400
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,039
Penny helps make

401
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:53,599
The first Microsoft spot watch 2004

402
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:55,391
The Abacus I still have one

403
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,671
So they

404
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:58,207
Try this before

405
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:01,279
And didn't work ahead of its time

406
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,839
They're now making their own smart watches

407
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:08,191
And now by adding Misfit what they can do is make traditional type watches

408
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:09,983
At low cost with fossils not a

409
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,543
You know there is some $1,000 brand easily

410
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:15,103
You know they're not they're not Rolex then

411
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,639
Tag are in a week

412
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,407
Talk about them

413
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,431
So it's

414
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:24,831
I don't say that inexpensive way but it's a a way to get in better integrated into the activity scene with watches

415
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:29,951
The people who may not want a true Smartwatch for notifications and Bluetooth and

416
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:31,743
Music and call so

417
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:36,863
I don't think it's a bad purchase I mean I'm not a financial analyst I don't know if it was if it made sense financially

418
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,911
But I do like the idea of him

419
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:41,727
This is a unexpected move but

420
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:43,775
Once it happened like I'll be up that make sense to me

421
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,335
Okay and you know I will say that

422
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,359
I'm looking at

423
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:49,919
Fossil had done a deal with Intel or they

424
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:52,479
Akon on stage at IDF with Intel

425
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:54,783
Doing an Android Wear SmartWatch 2

426
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:58,111
And fossil CEO I'm not going to butcher his name

427
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,903
Costa car

428
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,183
Sodus

429
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,463
Cardinal Terrace

430
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:06,047
He had said back in August during earnings call

431
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,327
That

432
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:10,655
He thought the most significant long-term devices would be

433
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:12,447
Quote-unquote smarter watches

434
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,519
It's just adding chips and extra functionality

435
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:18,591
Not a full-fledged

436
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:22,687
Watch when operating system and so on like an Apple Watch run Android Wear watch

437
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,295
It's it's more of a transitionary kind of thing to the Inn in between product for people

438
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,575
You don't want to

439
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:30,111
Another Kiki watch on there

440
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:30,879
Brest but

441
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:33,951
A nice watch like that like the Y things activity

442
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:36,767
You know that's a nice analog watch

443
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:43,167
We can still track your steps and I'm leaving a Bluetooth now or they can shoot me information to an app and all that that Timmy is a smarter

444
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,447
That's a good example

445
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:46,239
Yeah and I thought then

446
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:51,359
The purchase of Misfit makes sense because they've always had a very minimalistic design

447
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:54,175
And they've never been kind of about life

448
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:58,015
The watch there's no real like OS it's it's been very much about

449
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,319
Conveying information

450
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:03,135
What does little battery power is possible

451
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:06,719
Flashy

452
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:09,791
So so it does make sense I kind of always thought

453
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,607
If your watchmaker and you were going to buy a watch

454
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:13,887
Company should buy pebble

455
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,167
Because you know

456
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,215
What's cross-platform it's got like

457
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,263
This open OS but

458
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:23,359
I guess if you're watchmaker you're probably in your thinking along those lines you like

459
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:27,455
Did you buy a computer I want to buy a watch

460
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,479
Smarter

461
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:29,759
So this follows along the

462
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:37,183
And to be honest with a company like a fossil or another traditional watchmaker that wants to do this could do what tigers

463
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,719
Just go with Android Wear

464
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:41,535
When it's available open they have to pay for it

465
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:45,375
So they could just do that the differences how do you stand out from the crowd of Android Wear watches

466
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:47,679
Fossil I don't think wants to do that

467
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,703
I think they wanted

468
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:49,983
Compete at the

469
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,263
As you said smarter watch

470
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,031
Area

471
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,335
Okay see you soon yeah

472
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:57,151
I can't believe we almost didn't talk about that I forgot about it

473
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,431
Terrible

474
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,991
We're building up this whole Smartwatch Galbraith

475
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,783
All right

476
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,343
We will skip ahead to our guests this week

477
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,367
Who is

478
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:08,927
I haven't talked to him yet guys so

479
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:11,999
I'm just going to punt on his last name until I talk to him

480
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:15,839
His name is Alex he's the CEO of Josh. AI

481
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:18,911
We're going to be talking about building intelligence for the Smart Home

482
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:21,471
And specifically Building open intelligence

483
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,239
Anti-police

484
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:23,263
So

485
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,287
It should be fine

486
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:30,431
Stick with me and just to be fair Stacy knows his last name is just the pronunciation is the trick

487
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:34,527
Yes I could spell it in a heartbeat this is what happens when you take a print journalist

488
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,063
And you give him a podcast

489
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,135
I'm not even going to risk

490
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,159
Until I talk to him

491
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:47,327
Yeah so alright well

492
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,375

00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:22,655
A product called

I'm going to get that.

508
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:33,919
So Josh is a

509
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:36,223
Product that is actually not in the market yet

510
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:38,271
It won't be in the market for another 3 months

511
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:40,831
And Alex real fast

512
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:42,879
It's just a wee bit about Josh.

513
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:51,583
Yeah use the company was really founded on an artificial intelligence backend

514
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:54,911
Where we cannot into all sorts of interesting to my products

515
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:57,215
And in this particular instance

516
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:58,495
Tronical releasing

517
00:20:58,751 --> 00:20:59,775
Is all about the home

518
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:02,079
Connect with

519
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:04,639
A lot of yourself product so you're nasty

520
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,199
Philips hue light bulb

521
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:12,319
Restaurant Depot

522
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:16,159
Conversation

523
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:21,280
You speak to the Sea

524
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:22,816
Excellent okay

525
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:26,912
So with this in mind I had you on the show because you guys have

526
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:28,960
Been producing some really fun stuff

527
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:30,240
Actually run medium

528
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:32,544
And you talked about kind of

529
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:33,824
What the smartphone

530
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,848
Return from bat

531
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,688
Send it

532
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:39,968
You talked about kind of

533
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,784
Idealized Vision so I thought for you to kind of

534
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,808
Talk about

535
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:45,600
Your vision of the Smart Home

536
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:47,648
Even three years from now

537
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:50,976
It's interesting

538
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:52,512
Overseeding right now

539
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:56,864
The hardware that comes out of the companies are making their own app

540
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:03,264
Which means you have a whole collection apps on your phone

541
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,312
Think about it

542
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,848
Nothing

543
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:09,664
Turn on the lights and having lights go on his wonderful

544
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:14,784
Combination is more about Craig and Orchestra

545
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:15,808
Do

546
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:18,368
Magically based on the time of day

547
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:24,512
It's over the next three years we think it's coming

548
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:28,096
It's really truly realizing

549
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:29,376
Home automation

550
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:33,728
I really mean that contractors

551
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:36,544
There's a brain in the home the home

552
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,872
Is intuitive able to recommend

553
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:41,664
I just wanted to quit

554
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:45,248
We have

555
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:47,296
Number of Nest products at home

556
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:52,928
I know I'm not alone in saying it's extremely frustrating when they learn

557
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:54,720
What stinks are habits

558
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:56,256
And it turns out to be

559
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:57,280
Completely wrong

560
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:59,840
Los Angeles

561
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,984
Air conditioning really cooling the house down

562
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,008
Thomas Whitaker

563
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:13,408
Last night I set my thermostat to 72

564
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:15,200
64

565
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:17,504
And this was not trying to be too smart

566
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:23,136
Having the ability to automate but also

567
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:25,696
The intelligence to not do it in a bad way

568
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:26,720
Why voice

569
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:27,744
As the primary

570
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:29,280
And then we'll say

571
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:30,816
Why is it so important

572
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:32,608
I have this or how do you build a

573
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,144
Voice interaction

574
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:39,520
The first of which is

575
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:41,568
I think it's really important.

576
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:42,592
Really just

577
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,384
Clearly Define

578
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,688
How were talking about artificial intelligence

579
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,992
And that really ties into a voice

580
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:54,880
As soon as Jerry came out and we have the ability to

581
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:57,184
Potter have a little bit of this

582
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:59,232
Almost Human like experience

583
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:01,280
Everyone started saying

584
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:03,840
Arise

585
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:08,960
Across the board in scrum

586
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:11,520
Quote unquote use artificial intelligence

587
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:13,056
It's really into

588
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:14,848
Important

589
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:16,896
Is that Siri really doesn't use

590
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:18,432
Any artificial intelligence

591
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:20,736
And a lot of what we see today

592
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,320
Is it true artificial

593
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,600
Intelligent systems

594
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:27,648
Is behaving human-like

595
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:31,488
Human-like is free thinking

596
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:34,816
It's working with a system like you're working with the purse

597
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,656
Kylo Ren

598
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:39,936
Open this door

599
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:41,216
Turn this light on

600
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:43,776
That's a very easy thing to call me to do

601
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,824
To tell computer to do that

602
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:50,176
Today

603
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:55,552
Very flexible but in all reality

604
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:59,648
If you wanted to say something like

605
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,208
Send Stacey a text that I say hello

606
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,744
The system doesn't

607
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,024
Understand

608
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:07,072
The nuances of what you're saying

609
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:09,120
You're basically matching your words

610
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:14,496
And if it matches you get a response

611
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:16,032
Dirty South something like

612
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:17,568
Let me search the internet

613
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:19,104
Or some other answer that

614
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:23,968
In all reality it just doesn't know what you're saying

615
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:24,992
And then

616
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:28,576
Is very true but we see what Google Now

617
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:31,648
And even with the first version of Josh that we're working on

618
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:32,416
It's

619
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:35,232
Fortunately or unfortunately

620
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,256
Artificial

621
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,584
And I think it's important to put that out there because

622
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,144
Restart reading about artificial intelligence

623
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:43,424
Skynet

624
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,960
Computer taking over

625
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:45,728
Consciousness

626
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:46,496
Free thinking

627
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:48,800
We're so far away from that

628
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:53,408
And so I want to make sure that people understand

629
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:55,968
Is really not a human-like smart

630
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:56,736
Computer

631
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:58,016
It's a

632
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:06,208
If you took something like the Amazon Echo

633
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:07,232
Or even

634
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:08,512
Apple Siri

635
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:11,328
If you want to say want this product to be all about

636
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:15,424
You realize you just have to figure out rooms around home

637
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:18,496
So how do you say the turn on and off the light

638
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:21,312
How do you say to lock and unlock the door

639
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,080
Music

640
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:24,128
You realize that this problem

641
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,664
Problems

642
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:27,968
I'm much more to sign then

643
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:29,504
General purpose AI

644
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,552
Google Now

645
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:35,904
Problems with AI

646
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,720
Mass market products

647
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:39,488
Is that

648
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:43,072
You don't know what to ask you systems because they

649
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,400
And that's something that we're very directly trying to

650
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:47,168
Opposed

651
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:48,192
Worst thing

652
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:51,776
Dumbass costume

653
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:52,544
Make you feel better

654
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:54,080
All those things are

655
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,360
Possible

656
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:57,152
We want people to understand

657
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:58,176
Josh

658
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:00,480
Should be able to do anything

659
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:01,504
Therefore

660
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,040
If you can think of

661
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:05,088
A way to explain his statement

662
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:09,952
We want to guarantee the job he's going to be able to do that

663
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,280
AI

664
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:15,072
In terms of natural language

665
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,352
Processing invoice

666
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:19,680
So excited about this for a couple

667
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:24,288
The first insight

668
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:25,312
Beautiful products

669
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:28,640
Experiences.

670
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:30,688
What's Soca

671
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:32,992
Confusing

672
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:35,040
Is that these products are often

673
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:36,064
Complicated

674
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,344
You're confusing

675
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:39,904
Just have to learn multiple systems that don't

676
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:44,256
Talk to one another they don't work together

677
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:46,560
Are building around a graphical user

678
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:48,352
Lola's voice everything

679
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,632
So

680
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:52,704
How are you going to work with these companies

681
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,312
Is I mean right now one of the big challenge in creating these cuz I actually can create

682
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,848
I have so many

683
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,128
Devices in my home

684
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:03,712
Play the song so I can create a lot of things right now

685
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:10,368
How do you plan to do it because the big problem for a lot of these companies is just Manpower in integrating

686
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,440
All of these connected devices together

687
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:16,256
So how do you plan to kind of address that it's

688
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:19,840
Not an easy problem to solve and it takes a lot of group

689
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,936
A number to Hardware companies

690
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:26,240
Very beginning did not want to talk to

691
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:36,736
And I will be in touch later and the only reason by the way

692
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:38,784
Is it they don't already have a public API

693
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:42,624
Does only have a public API

694
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:44,672
We're off to take me to get furniture

695
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:47,488
Rather than dealing with the echo

696
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:51,072
You're the federal rules that we work with

697
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:53,632
Hardware companies

698
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:56,704
Porcine

699
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:58,752
And we're going to do it with

700
00:28:59,008 --> 00:28:59,776
The products that are

701
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:00,544
Customer service

702
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:03,616
Disregard creative ways to make it work anyway because

703
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:05,152
Quite frankly Anderson

704
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:07,456
Airbus

705
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:10,784
There's almost no Securities most iron

706
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,808
Network

707
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,136
It's what that means is we can gain access to almost everything

708
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:16,928
If we're on the local network

709
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:19,488
That's the way Josh Gordon

710
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,048
So we're basically taking the hard

711
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:22,816
Approach

712
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:26,400
To building the stuff out ourselves the most

713
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:29,216
I'm in other cases you're working with companies

714
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:30,496
Better provider

715
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:31,776
Just hi

716
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:34,848
Dana 80 or

717
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:36,896
In the building Engineers working with us

718
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:39,712
Often times it will find you

719
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:43,040
We say our customers need this product

720
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:46,112
We're going to make it work one way or another and you just figure it out

721
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:49,184
Okay so that is very much the kind of SmartThings approach

722
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:50,720
Quite a while

723
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:52,000
So you mentioned

724
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:53,024
Security

725
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:54,560
Let's talk about

726
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,352
And privacy

727
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:57,120
Because

728
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:58,400
AI is built on

729
00:29:58,656 --> 00:29:59,680
Training sets a

730
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:00,960
Basically

731
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,776
And using that data to train neural network

732
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:04,544
Parks and

733
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,824
One of the things that

734
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,128
I'm fascinated by this is the fact that

735
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,664
You know you can't

736
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,456
Develop gradle

737
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:13,504
Credible kind of models for them

738
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:16,320
Without lots and lots of data

739
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:18,624
So how do you guys look at

740
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:20,160
Being able to hit like

741
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:21,184
Train

742
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:24,256
Your algorithms and train your models for this

743
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:26,048
How do you kind of reconcile that with

744
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:29,376
The Privacy policies that you're thinking about her saying

745
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:33,216
Got a couple things going on

746
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:36,800
Understand that you mentioned that a lot of a eyes book

747
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:39,104
That's perfectly true

748
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:43,200
I'm in the way that neural networks work

749
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:47,040
You essentially are training a large system of data on

750
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:51,904
Neural Nets are very well

751
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,928
Established

752
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:59,584
I can recognize cat photograph

753
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:02,912
I'm going to do is I'm going to load in a million photos

754
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:05,216
And therefore when I show a photo if there

755
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,360
With language however it's very very

756
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:12,128
System

757
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:13,664
And that's really the only case

758
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:15,968
You need now

759
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:17,504
In terms of what word

760
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:24,416
Voice

761
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:25,952
They're basically three components

762
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,256
First there's the speech-to-text

763
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:32,096
Someone is going to speak into the microphone

764
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:35,424
And this isn't going to convert that speech tax

765
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,520
Once you

766
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:42,080
Send you a text to text translation

767
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:43,872
And this is really where the brain

768
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:46,944
The text that says

769
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,736
Turn the lights on in the kitchen

770
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:51,808
And it interprets that means this action

771
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:54,624
That's going to connect to this device and then it's going to generate

772
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:59,488
The responsive generates

773
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,280
Steps converted back to speech

774
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:08,192
That might be what you hear is just

775
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:09,472
Okay

776
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:14,592
Turn the lights on that happened in

777
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:17,920
So what you doing

778
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:18,688
Perspective

779
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,040
You're actually have to explain all three of those and understand that they're different

780
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:25,344
When you're looking at the last adventure

781
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,368
Text to speech

782
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:32,256
Open source technology

783
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:35,584
Apple Google Microsoft products

784
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:38,656
Something that we've been able to use you

785
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:47,872
That's something that a lot of really really smart people

786
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:48,640
Stunning

787
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:50,688
Jackie Chan

788
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,504
Word the benefactors of a lot of that

789
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:54,784
However it's not

790
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,600
There's no product on the market in my opinion.

791
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:59,648
Good enough to just taken worth it

792
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:02,464
We still have to do a lot of creative engineering around that

793
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:03,744
That's what I mean

794
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,536
If you were to say something like

795
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:08,352
Play Netflix on the TV

796
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:12,448
If Netflix is not understood word in the vocabulary

797
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:15,520
It's not going to pregnant

798
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:18,848
Computer

799
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:20,896
It's never going to spell anything wrong

800
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:22,432
It is what it is

801
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:23,968
Try to not snore

802
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,040
Dictionary

803
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:31,136
How to make salmon Grill

804
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:38,304
But then she just jump into the middle layer which is really where

805
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:41,632
This is what we need

806
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:43,168
We

807
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:49,056
You think about how many ways can you say that

808
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:50,080
Turn the lights on

809
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:53,408
Turn on the lights turn on the lights

810
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,200
Please turn the lights on

811
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:56,992
All sound very similar ones

812
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:59,552
Computer

813
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:02,368
Instead of what we have on one level

814
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:03,904
Is there a flexible

815
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,208
Basically programming language

816
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,744
That can handle

817
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,304
Do you have to language processing element

818
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:12,864
What was Santa's house

819
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:16,192
If something says what we don't match Google directly

820
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,472
What we try to do

821
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:19,776
Figure out what you might be saying

822
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:22,848
The other thing that we do

823
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:26,176
When you say something that a system doesn't

824
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,712
Your natural response

825
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:28,992
You try to say it again

826
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:37,696
So what we have in our system has something comes in

827
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:41,792
Would like to check did not match rule did not generate

828
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:42,560
Response

829
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:44,352
Later than usual

830
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:46,144
Something else

831
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:49,728
That's it soccer system that those two things might be

832
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:52,544
They might be trying to stay the same thing in a different way

833
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,848
And so there's some areas that we actually

834
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:56,384
Extended dialogue

835
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,176
Basically

836
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:00,736
Recommendations to human engineer II review

837
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:03,552
Another cases with system tries to auto-update

838
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:05,344
I'm basically get smarter on its own

839
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:06,368
Anime

840
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:10,976
Give me the date of what users are saying but

841
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:13,280
Really the context around who sang it

842
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:21,216
If you are Stripes can you something and Josh doesn't do it it doesn't understand it

843
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:23,776
You're able to do that action another why

844
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:25,312
Next time you go to stay that

845
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:26,336
Same thing

846
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:27,872
We should make sure we do it right

847
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:28,896
Got it

848
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:30,944
All right well on that note

849
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,992
Alex I really appreciate

850
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:34,016
You coming on the show

851
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:36,576
And I look forward to 3 months or so

852
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:37,856
Not being able to

853
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:40,416
Test out trash. In my own home

854
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:41,696
Thank you for coming on the show

855
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:42,720
Thank you so much

856
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:49,120
And that concludes this week show thank you so much for listening and we'll see you next week
