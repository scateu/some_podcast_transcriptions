00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:04,768
CSM going to talk about

25
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:06,304

00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:28,992
Kevin

53
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:32,832
Stacy

54
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,112
This year

55
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:35,904
Was the star

56
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:42,816
Well obviously because I wasn't there I'm going by third-party reports since I read a ton of coverage

57
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:49,728
And it seems to be I'm not going to name her name but the woman Inside the Amazon Echo with star of the show and

58
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,520
She really wasn't even there

59
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:54,080
It's not like Amazon has a booth

60
00:02:56,896 --> 00:03:02,016
They didn't write but they did have a truck that dispensed Gadget

61
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:05,856
Oh I want one

62
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,416
Can I order one

63
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:12,000
Would love a truck filled with treasures and trinkets and gadgets

64
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:13,280
I am sure

65
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:16,096
Prime now

66
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:19,168
What's

67
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:25,568
Usually I have seen Amazon products in the past but it's usually from like the people who put the chips inside and so on

68
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,128
You know the fire tablets and things like that

69
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,920
But yeah so

70
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,200
It seems like

71
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:34,528
They were tons of gadgets that were incorporating

72
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,904
The Voice services are inside the Echo and I strategically didn't mention your name I thought I did a good job.

73
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:43,744
Now again I wasn't there so I was reading 3rd

74
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:44,768
Stories

75
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:48,352
Did you see some of these gadgets that

76
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:53,728
Came out like I know LG has one where was Algeria Lenovo has the

77
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,008
Eraser

78
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:56,800
Prettier version

79
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:04,480
Right right it's a Sydney two-cylinder just like the regular Echo apparently has a much better speaker in

80
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:10,368
Which I don't think the speaker in that activates all that bad to begin with but hey more sound more bass that's good

81
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:15,744
It's interesting to me that they just basically created a what I think is a clone of the echo

82
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,327
Which anybody could really do because of the voice services are

83
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,375
Available for developers so you can

84
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:25,727
You know if you got some Hardware smarts and some developers March you could create one of these things

85
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:28,799
But they weren't the only one it just seemed like there were so many products

86
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,847
It's my companies that said hey

87
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:34,943
This is already working so well for so many people let's not develop our own

88
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:35,967
Cloud-based

89
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:41,599
Voice recognition system let's just use one that's available and that's of course I win for Amazon as well

90
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:44,927
So basically what Amazon has created here is

91
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:46,207
Incredible platform

92
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,999
And they did it by being open

93
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:51,071
So when someone came to them and said

94
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:54,655
Into the Trilby guys I was like hey you guys are actually doing

95
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,191
It was a speaker for the kitchen

96
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:56,959
Using

97
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,263
We kind of have to say it the

98
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,055
Abs

99
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,079
Cicatrix

100
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,359
So using AVS

101
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,151
Which is a voice service

102
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,455
They built basically

103
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:10,527
It had a few modifications but it was essentially an echo

104
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:13,855
And I talked to them and they were like yeah it was I was cool with

105
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:16,415
They wanted this out there so yeah

106
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:22,559
That is the mark of an excellent platform and that What's Happening Here is Amazon wants to be the os4

107
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:24,095
For The Internet of Things

108
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:26,655
Or maybe it's the OS for the boys plaits

109
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:27,423
It's

110
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:29,983
I think those are two separate things that we shouldn't get them

111
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:34,591
I think you're right I would I would classify as they want to be the interface

112
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:35,615
For your smartphone

113
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,407
Just like apple brought.

114
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,711
Capacitive touch

115
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,479
Right

116
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:46,879
Baby had resistance before that resistance touch before the capacitive touch was a ground changing

117
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:49,951
And they define the features hinchan Zoom swiping

118
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:50,975
What's happening is it

119
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:53,279
Amazon with the echo is

120
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:57,119
Or with AVS more specifically is defining the interface for

121
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:58,911
End

122
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:00,447
Actually we could see this

123
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,983
Coming because

124
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,775
Companies like a rant

125
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:04,543
In ALA

126
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,847
Those two guys are helping

127
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:09,151
Product manufacturer

128
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,199
Basically create

129
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,735
Cloud services for

130
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,527
Connect two things so there the brains

131
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,087
Are the brains in the muscle that are actually make

132
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,367
You're like washing machine

133
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,647
Your smoke detectors

134
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,183
Connected

135
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,463
And those guys

136
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:27,071
Have integrated and made it super easy for the manufacturers to add

137
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,095
Avs2 there

138
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:28,863
Air Products

139
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:31,423
And in talking to those companies they're like yeah

140
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:37,055
Every single manufacturer is come to us in the last 6 months and said we have to be on the echo

141
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,103
That is number one feature

142
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:39,871
That we need for

143
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:40,895
For consumers

144
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:41,663
So

145
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,711
We saw this coming

146
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,503
It's actually out

147
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,271
Google

148
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:47,807
Where are you

149
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,343
I've got to say that like

150
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,647
I know that Google has the apis for

151
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:52,415
For their voice but

152
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,439
Antarctica

153
00:06:55,231 --> 00:07:01,375
So I think it was a really good point I'm also just real quick going to disclose that I am a full-time consultant for Google I do now

154
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:05,215
At work with the Google Home Products or anything like that I work with Android and chrome stuff

155
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:09,311
I agree with you though first-mover status here has been huge for Amazon

156
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:14,431
Like making the platform open by being developer-friendly

157
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:16,223
This is why I mean

158
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,039
I work for Google and I don't have a Google why not

159
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,319
I have 4 echos In the House

160
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:21,599
Why do I for icons

161
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:24,927
Because it open enough and came out sooner

162
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:27,999
So that the products that I want to use work with it

163
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:30,559
I can't say the same about Google home or other

164
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,351
Similar devices so

165
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,935
Yeah first-mover Status here has been huge in my opinion

166
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:41,311
So I did run into wink at the show and they said that we should see them on Google home

167
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,591
So those of you with the wink

168
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,615
He said in a matter of

169
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,383
Weeks

170
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:48,991
I've no doubt it will happen

171
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:51,551
I mean yeah wink is I think a

172
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:54,623
A solid player in this in the space for smart home hubs

173
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,415
And there's many others that we

174
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,695
We talked about

175
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,719
Them in the past

176
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:00,767
So I'm sure it will come to Google home

177
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:06,911
But you know again then will people like me say I've already invested in X number of Echoes

178
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:10,751
What's better with home or whatever other competing product and

179
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:11,519
I do think

180
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,055
For information

181
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:16,895
When you're requesting information I think maybe home has an advantage there

182
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:19,967
But I have my phone and other devices for that so I don't

183
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:21,247
Nebat personalized

184
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:24,575
I mean I switch quite honestly even one wink support comes

185
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:27,903
You know Google home is better at more than just information

186
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:30,975
Because when you talk to it as much more conversation

187
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:31,743
Also

188
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:34,303
When I tell the echo to set an alarm

189
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,071
For 6

190
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:38,399
Is it always ass a.m. or p.m.

191
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:41,215
So I have to remember am now if I tell Google home

192
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,751
To set an alert for 6

193
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:43,775
The clock it's like

194
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,567
Done Saturday

195
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,103
I set an alarm for 6 a.m.

196
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,895
Yeah I think it's

197
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:54,527
Yeah I think that gets into the context that Google Now is brought

198
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:56,063
Go to Google home

199
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,343
Which is very good

200
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:58,879
I also wonder if

201
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:02,207
What would happen if you set that alarm at 4 in the afternoon

202
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:06,559
Because I'm wondering if it just sets the alarm for the next instance of 6

203
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:07,327
It might

204
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,095
And that makes a lot

205
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:15,263
I'm just taking a guess I don't know cuz I can't I can't text on my phone I suppose with Google Assistant but I do think

206
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,287
Text or standpoint

207
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,847
Google services do have an advantage

208
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:22,431
We'll get into this at another show cuz I'm actually writing an essay on

209
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:23,967
Context

210
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,527
It was the

211
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,831
Context was the undercurrent of CES

212
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:31,135
That's too many to get into now

213
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,927
And I want to write it before I talk about it

214
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:35,487
It's at all a morphis in my mind

215
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:36,511
But it's

216
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:41,375
I hope your reference my 2012 or 2013 article that I wrote for you on

217
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,655
Is the title was

218
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,447
Why won't Google Now my wrist

219
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,727
Context is King

220
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:46,751
Call Kev

221
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,359
Alright so let's move on

222
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,127
Yuan to

223
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,151
Fitbit

224
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,943
App Store

225
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:58,015
We will take their plans to

226
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:01,599
I want an app store this year so they don't have an app store yet

227
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,879
But they're going to do one

228
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:09,535
Okay cool what time am I just do it cuz everybody else has an app store Napster the big thing the big try

229
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:13,887
I'm not sure I want to see if Fitbit app store in the reason why

230
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,423
One of the things

231
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:20,287
I think my Fitbit so successful is it's really good at a few core features

232
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,591
And it's simple

233
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:27,967
Bring an app store and you start adding complexity and such that I don't know that

234
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,759
Would help this product I mean

235
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,039
I love Fitbit of had

236
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:34,879
2-3 maybe even for fitbit's and they worked great for me

237
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:41,791
I don't know if there's even talk into the Verge had talked to the founder of the co-founder and CEO James

238
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:51,007
And so the purchasing well there's it's undoubtedly meaning that fitbit's going to also a launch create a smartwatch

239
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,287
Unlike

240
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:54,079
Why not just have the Fitbit app

241
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:58,431
That works well on an Apple Watch and Android Wear why do you need to do that

242
00:10:58,943 --> 00:10:59,967
Come scratch my head on this

243
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:00,991
What you think

244
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:03,039
So this is everyone has to have a plateau

245
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,599
And you know Fitbit is in a hard spot

246
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,623
With the financial markets

247
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,159
Member is public

248
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:12,767
They've got to do more than sell devices because devices are come out

249
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:19,167
Quality business in this is the truth of everyone who is going to get into the consumer Internet of Things

250
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:21,983
This'll be a good segue into a later segment

251
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,031
What we got here

252
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,055
Where is all of

253
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:25,823
These company

254
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,359
Are like

255
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,919
I need another source of Revenue

256
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:30,687
I need to

257
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:38,367
And so it's not enough to have Fitbit you know extend its API to all of these other devices out though

258
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,135
Thayer witch

259
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:41,951
Honestly it's the best interface for iot

260
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,487
They got to have an app store

261
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:47,839
And it got to have a revenue model that gets them a chunk of change so

262
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:50,911
I don't like it I don't think it's the best way to go but

263
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:52,703
I see why they're do

264
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:58,079
I asked you why I think you you laid out a very good case for it I just wonder I mean

265
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:02,431
They don't just need a nap store they need a successful App Store and

266
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:09,343
By investing resources development in SM mean it's got a payoff otherwise they could be in worse shape

267
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:13,439
Goodnight I just worried that the being worshipped but I don't want to see what happened obviously

268
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:17,535
Will you know they acquired Pebble now I don't know how it didn't acquire

269
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,559
All of the

270
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,631
In Pebble had an app store and they did

271
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:23,679
Well wish

272
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,447
With it

273
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,543
I don't know where there any apps on the pebble App Store that were actually purchasable

274
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:31,615
I believe you could purchase apps

275
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:38,271
I haven't had a pebble in quite a while and that's another example of a device that actually works really well it didn't do that much at

276
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:40,319
First what it did it did really well

277
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:43,903
That was no smartphone notifications and such

278
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:46,719
And then they started adding complexity

279
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:53,119
Out of the same thing it was already existing popular SmartWatches and it didn't work out

280
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,911
So that's my fear

281
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,983
Alright so

282
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,519
We're a little worried about Fitbit

283
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,335
Let's move to the high seas

284
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:05,407
Carnival Cruise ships

285
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:13,087
So this is a really interesting story out of Cs and it I think it shows what you can do when you have a closed ecosystem

286
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:16,671
So moving from open platforms let's talk about

287
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:20,511
And this is Carnival is basically creating

288
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,303
Iot device

289
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:25,631
The ocean medallion

290
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:29,727
Have you can wear it on your wrist you can clip it on your thing it's waterproof so you can swim

291
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,263
Baby fall into the ocean eyes

292
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:32,799
So what's happening here

293
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,847
Where is this becomes

294
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:37,663
The digital representation of

295
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,711
Cruise ships

296
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:42,271
And it was created by man named John Padgett

297
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:44,063
Cool also

298
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,855
What's the guy who helped create Disney

299
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:52,767
I love the fast fast so what's happening

300
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:53,791
Is

301
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,839
This allows Carnival

302
00:13:56,351 --> 00:14:00,703
To personalize your experience so when you're walking past like a connected

303
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,471
Touch screen

304
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:05,311
It's going to read who you are and it's going to be like oh

305
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:08,383
Here's your itinerary for the day or here's the things you're interested

306
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:09,663
You're going to get

307
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,455
Directions around the cruise ship

308
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,223
From this

309
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:16,063
You're going to actually have all that you had the chance to on the web fill out your

310
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:21,183
Court papers so there's a lot of paperwork before you go on a cruise and usually you do it right before you get on

311
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,719
Now you can do it on the web

312
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:24,767
It transfers to your medallion

313
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,071
And then you can just walk on the ship

314
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,607
I think this is really interests

315
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:32,703
So this is all theoretical this is CES

316
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:33,983
Is there really working on it

317
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:36,543
But it's going to be out November on

318
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,567
The top-of-the-line

319
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,591
Cruise ships

320
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:47,295
There's a lot to learn here so I'm going to keep an eye on this project mostly because I think there's some cool stuff that can be applied to Smart City

321
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,087
I think they thought

322
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:51,135
You know what the advantage and the fact that it's

323
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,671
It's a commercial endeavor

324
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:55,487
You don't get much more closed environment

325
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:56,511
Cruise ship

326
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:03,679
Yeah and it gets back to that theme of contacts I mean if you're walking past a restaurant

327
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:05,215
On the cruise ship

328
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:08,799
Then maybe you had look for a reservation and you didn't find any

329
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,079
OpenTable

330
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:13,407
Look and say hey if someone says walking past guess what let's ping them

331
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:17,247
Hate you had you one of the spot we got a spot now just opened up come on in

332
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,271
Exactly

333
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:21,855
And they're interesting things that kind of make me a little nervous but like

334
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:25,695
If you like gambling for example it can actually give you directions

335
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:27,999
Route you pass casinos on the ship

336
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:33,375
Well isn't that convenient

337
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:36,447
This is the sky's the limit stuff we're iotb

338
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:38,239
Becomes really interesting

339
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:43,103
And I think we're going to see these cases develop first in these places like Disneyland

340
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,127
Disney World

341
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,175
On the cruise ships because

342
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:48,479
They can control everything they have all the

343
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,015
So

344
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:55,135
What's also interesting is the aspect of

345
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,927
Privacy security

346
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:57,951
In that

347
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,255
You're going to be letting the ships

348
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:04,607
System know where you are at all times more than likely which is not necessarily A Bad Thing

349
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:07,423
From a safety perspective that could be very useful obviously

350
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:14,079
But I wonder if people will say I just want to go on a cruise and I don't want them to be no one worm

351
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:15,871
Vuclip

352
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:18,687
I know they they do anyway but this is just a

353
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:24,063
Another this is a little different because this is something you're wearing to allow that to happen

354
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:26,879
As opposed to say Tamara's and what not you know

355
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:28,927
Very passive things this is an active thing

356
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,207
Will you have to wear

357
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,487
So when I said you can't

358
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,535
It means like if you want to go on these

359
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,559
Medallion chips

360
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,375
Ditmore

361
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:39,423
Hopefully

362
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,983
You must wear The Medallion

363
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:42,751
Habitat

364
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,799
It's the same as your room key

365
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:47,871
Like that let you in and out of

366
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,455
TCU have to have it now you don't have to interact with

367
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:53,247
You don't have to fill out all the personal prep

368
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:56,319
But I do want it on you

369
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:58,111
Because it's your room.

370
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,903
Key because they need to track p

371
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,183
People around the ship

372
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,463
Center for safety

373
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:05,023
Actually like in a situation like in Apache

374
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,303
Situation or even if

375
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,839
Norovirus

376
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:08,863
Comes out all the time

377
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,423
Cruise ships want to track who was on certain

378
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,191
Dax photography

379
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:12,959
Affected by

380
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:13,727
The virus

381
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,007
That's actually really

382
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,567
Useful for both the ship and the passengers

383
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,919
No doubt no doubt I I mean I do see positive things too as well I just

384
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:24,735
Just asking a question allowed here like

385
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:29,087
And I mean that you're not wearing it and you must watch everything MP3 overboard I don't know

386
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:35,231
It's not so extreme is all that

387
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:35,999
So

388
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:42,655
This ties into industrial being the hot iot of the future I wouldn't classify Carnival as industrial bi-weekly

389
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:43,935
Classifiers Enterprise

390
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:44,959
Is a business case

391
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:46,751
Again going back to

392
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:51,103
Fitbit consumer was everywhere obviously the Consumer Electronics Show

393
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:53,663
But the big money making opportunities

394
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:58,015
Really seem to be an industrial because there was a big sense of the show that

395
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:03,903
Consumers hard and we're going to get people to pay for ongoing revenue streams and

396
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:06,719
I don't know if this is really going to work

397
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,511
So tied to

398
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:10,303
All of the mini smart home platform

399
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,071
Forms I saw there

400
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:12,863
Silver Lake over a dozen

401
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,655
Some of them were from

402
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:16,191
Carriers like in

403
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:16,959
In your opinion

404
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:19,519
Asia and all that and some of them were actually just

405
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:24,639
Chinese companies that have actually stepped up in their design and like Zmodo

406
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,687
Is a Chinese company in

407
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:32,063
They're showing off some really compelling products I actually am going to try to get some and review them

408
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:36,415
And they have a whole smart home sweet and there were dozens of these maybe not.

409
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:37,951
There were at least a dozen

410
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:40,511
Ensue

411
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:43,583
It feels like the smart home stuff in

412
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,607
Consumer-oriented

413
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:46,911
I was going to get come out of ties so fast

414
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,239
You're going to need new revenue streams if you really want to be a player here

415
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:52,287
Probably going to have to be big

416
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,311
So then

417
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:56,895
All of the activity should be turning to Industrial

418
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:58,431
In Enterprise

419
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:01,247
Because I think that's where we're going to see people actually spend

420
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:04,575
And it's a lot easier you make one

421
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:07,391
Sale for example and they could be worth

422
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:11,487
Millions or even billions of dollars you know as opposed to trying to piece mail

423
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:17,375
A million consumers all around the world to purchase your products so I definitely see that a lot of bang for buck there

424
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:19,935
What I didn't see a lot of with smarts

425
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:24,543
I saw some use cases but I didn't see I didn't get the sense there's a lot of spending

426
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:25,823
They're so

427
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,615
I mean I saw so many LED can I

428
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:28,383
Nexus street lights

429
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:30,687
We should put LEDs in

430
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,223
I don't think

431
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:37,087
And again I haven't been to see us in two years so I could have changed I don't think you're going to see like the

432
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:42,463
Municipalities showing up to see what technology is out there I think that's probably a different show

433
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:44,511
So that's probably why you didn't see that

434
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:45,535
Probably

435
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:47,839
Okay you're right

436
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:50,399
Expected EPS I'll give you that

437
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,191
Can your 10 years of CEO

438
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:55,007
So that's and colds too.

439
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,543
Ten codes 10 years

440
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:57,823
All right

441
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:00,127
Okay let's talk really fast about

442
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:01,407
Comcast

443
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:02,687
Because

444
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:06,527
Last time we checked which was about a year ago it's at 500000

445
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,111
Connected homes like people using a smart home and home automation

446
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,647
Call Xfinity home

447
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,975
And I saw them at the show this was their first CES

448
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:16,255
And they were showing off

449
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:18,047
Two things worth mentioning

450
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:21,375
One is they did a deal with a company called sierant

451
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,911
To help with

452
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:23,679
Provisioning

453
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:26,495
In provisioning is the act of getting devices on

454
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:29,567
Weight gain and connected to the cloud getting them on

455
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,847
Night so that takes a

456
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:33,663
Cloud side but it also takes the consumer going

457
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:35,711
Like downloading the app

458
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:37,247
And doing whatever

459
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,015
They need to do

460
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:38,783
There so many ways

461
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:39,551
Supervision

462
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:40,319
So

463
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,855
What Comcast showed off

464
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:42,879
Was

465
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:45,439
That it did this deal with. And

466
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:49,279
Now any device that has secret software and there could be more

467
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:52,863
Are already online with Comcast public Wi-Fi

468
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:56,191
So what happens is you bring it into your home

469
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:59,263
You download the app in the app searches for

470
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,799
The most recently connected

471
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:02,079
Device to your net

472
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:04,383
Redis trying to connect to your network

473
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,407
Is Caesar

474
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:07,199
And it says hey do you want to

475
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:08,479
Activate this

476
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:10,527
And you hit the button and it does

477
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:15,135
If it's in a Comcast home and you have a Comcast router in this is important

478
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:16,928
You're not using a Comcast router

479
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:17,952
Get this

480
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,768
It will actually give you two options one is activated

481
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,048
Like the manual way

482
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,840
The other is activated on

483
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:25,376
Comcast Xfinity home

484
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:26,656
You press that button

485
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:29,984
Literally everything is automated gives you your SSID

486
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:32,544
It does all of that and suddenly your device pops up on

487
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:34,848
Which is pretty cool

488
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,408
Yeah we'll set up Simplicity is a big thing

489
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:42,016
Smart home mix one of the reasons people don't want to get things like I don't have to mess with us

490
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:47,136
So they definitely made it easier that got a new Gateway that I think they're coming out with this year

491
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:49,696
5:30

492
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:55,840
Gabby's going to say what they got the new Gateway and then all of the software features that you're talking about I think we'll actually be

493
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:58,400
Apply to the old gateways as well so you don't

494
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:00,960
Necessarily have to get the new gateway to get all these features but

495
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:01,728
I could be wrong

496
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:02,752
No you are right

497
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:05,568
I'm two for two

498
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:07,616
No wonder I have you with

499
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:10,688
I'm so glad I cannot wait to see you spell weight

500
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,528
Your nuts

501
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,368
Okay so the other aspect of Comcast that's worth

502
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:20,160
Doting is I actually

503
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:23,744
I don't have strong lovey-dovey feelings for Comcast because I've

504
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,280
Cover net neutrality in the past

505
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,816
End data caps

506
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:29,632
Which Comcast every time I say the word data caps they're going to argue with me

507
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:30,912
It's a data cap

508
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:32,192
What is a terabyte

509
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:33,472
What they done now

510
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:36,032
It's actually really nice they've created

511
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,824
Three or four years ago.

512
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:43,712
Bought a company called Power. Which made a really cool wi-fi system so way before everyone else was like

513
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:47,296
Hey wife I should have better software it be easier for Consumers power. Was doing

514
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:50,112
So when Comcast bought them I was excited to see you

515
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:52,160
Finally it has happened

516
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:54,464
The acquisition of power dog

517
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,024
Plus all the time automation stuff and

518
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,560
Good routers coming out

519
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:02,656
Put Comcast into making software on this new Gateway

520
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:03,680
It is

521
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:05,728
So user

522
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:06,496
Friendly

523
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:07,776
And it's even cute

524
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,056
So

525
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:12,640
They let you create profiles for people they let like

526
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:14,688
Many of the things you would expect

527
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:15,712
From a modern router

528
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:17,248
Such as you know

529
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:18,784
Being able to see

530
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,064
All of the devices on your

531
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:22,880
Being able to see who's associated with

532
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:26,976
Being able to see how much they're using and when they're using it

533
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:29,024
All of that is now available

534
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:31,328
And I love it

535
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,376
And they'd have cute little designs

536
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:34,144
State to have like

537
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:35,680
Profile animal

538
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:36,960
Like your spirit animal

539
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:38,752
Xboxes and Rec

540
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:42,080
The design was done in part by a guy who used to do

541
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:43,360
Nike's fuelband se

542
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:48,224
So that's all great and it offers up to nine gigabytes of Wi-Fi

543
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:49,760
You know if you have a massive

544
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:51,040
Connection

545
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:54,880
It looks nice and simple and I can't get back to you

546
00:23:55,392 --> 00:24:00,512
Bring Simplicity but allowing for control which is what you want to do with the steady want to go to control who has access

547
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:01,536
I maybe

548
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:05,632
Certain time you want to flip internet off for certain people or certain devices that's great

549
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,936
So it's not going to work was she who shall not

550
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:11,520
I was like what about voice there like we have the Xfinity X1

551
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:15,360
Yeah they got their own boys play their side I'm not surprised by that

552
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:17,152
But you know you do have to find her

553
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:22,528
Voices the invisible interface

554
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:23,808
Visible if you have to pay

555
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:25,856
I agree

556
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:28,928
News and finally

557
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:30,464
2 weeks ago

558
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,744
Her name is a week and a half ago

559
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,512
I don't remember

560
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:34,816
I purchased the GE Z-Wave

561
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:37,120
Wireless smart door sensor

562
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:38,656
Hinge pin

563
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:39,936
So

564
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:41,984
If you guys are like what the what

565
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,264
This is

566
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:49,920
That is supposed to be an invisible open close sensor for your door you basically stick it on the

567
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:50,688
Hinge pin

568
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:51,456
Of your door

569
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:52,736
In

570
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:55,552
It has a little thing that sticks out and hits the door

571
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,112
So it's kind of shaped like a

572
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:58,880
A number seven

573
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:01,184
Little arm basically

574
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,208
A little arm

575
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:05,024
It hits the door and when it goes past a certain

576
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,840
Point is supposed to trigger it to say hey the door is open

577
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:09,120
In

578
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:11,168
I looked at this and I was like oh my God I have to

579
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:14,240
The Habit is awesome so I plop down the 40 bucks on Amazon

580
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:15,520
It arrived

581
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:17,056
And I went to install

582
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,592
And that is when

583
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:23,200
I cannot recommend this product

584
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:27,040
I'm actually I printed out the return label and I'm sending it back

585
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:28,320
Probably tomorrow

586
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:29,600
Because

587
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:32,928
Set up was easy I hooked it up with my wink hub

588
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:36,256
And that was great I also hooked it up with my SmartThings Hub

589
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:39,328
And that was just a just to try it out for both platform

590
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:40,096
And

591
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:42,656
Installing it on the door was okay

592
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:45,728
I mean I just had that my hinge pins were a little rusty

593
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:52,128
So I had to let Billy Wacom out there basically you just have to take a hinge pin out put this thing on the hinge and then put the

594
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,408
Pinback I'm guessing

595
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,224
Next

596
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:57,248
But

597
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:59,296
It does not fit tight

598
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,832
To the hinge pin

599
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:01,856
Or the wall

600
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:03,136
Which means

601
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:05,184
When the door opens

602
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,232
The bass moves

603
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,768
Because the clique

604
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:11,328
To trigger it from open to close

605
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,376
Who's fairly sensitive

606
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:18,496
When you open and close the door the whole apparatus moves in does it messes with the

607
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:19,520
Operation

608
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,568
Does happen

609
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:28,480
That's that's a shame because I'm paper this sounded so good because it is essentially invisible right it's it's not like a box

610
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:29,248
Aksara

611
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,272
Something that you can

612
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:32,576
Easily see if I can fix you

613
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:33,600
Emacs

614
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:36,416
You can actually buy paintable version

615
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:41,536
Yeah so they're there it's made to be hidden but smart and informative

616
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:44,352
And I'm just going to ask this question I think I know the answer

617
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:45,632
You don't have any

618
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:50,240
Unique or special hindered or that you're applying is to unassuming

619
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:51,008
No this was

620
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:51,776
Regular

621
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:53,056
This was an outsider

622
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,896
So it was a little girl front door

623
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:58,176
It was the door to my room

624
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:01,248
Cuz I was like if that I would love to know when that soap

625
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:04,832
Right right so for an exterior door using it on

626
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,672
But it would have the same problems on an interior door

627
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,720
Even though they're not as heavy

628
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,328
I think the the big flies that it just doesn't fit tight so it

629
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:18,656
It moves when you open and close the door which means

630
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:21,216
So you can't accurately measure that point

631
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:25,824
Yes we spent 40 is so my husband and I spent 45 minutes calibrating this thing

632
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:27,616
In

633
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:30,176
We never got it to actually work

634
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,736
So we never actually got it

635
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:33,760
Close

636
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:34,784
At the right time

637
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:37,600
If you held it maybe if I duct-taped it down

638
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:40,928
Well there goes the invisible Factor

639
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,232
These were these were the

640
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:44,256
Whitney

641
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:46,560
But yes it at that point it was like

642
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:47,840
Nope

643
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:48,864
Traditional open

644
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,424
And I am going to try the census

645
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,240
Strips sensitive strips at sensitive

646
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:55,264
Two A's

647
00:27:55,776 --> 00:28:00,896
Right those are the three three mm thick strips I think that you just put inside a door framing

648
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:04,480
It's a simple open close sensor that you really can't see easily

649
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:06,272
Yes but I have heard the

650
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:07,808
They have a similar problem

651
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:09,088
Their hearts

652
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:11,648
I don't know why those are hard to kill

653
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:13,440
But you know

654
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:14,208
We might discuss

655
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:18,816
I guess the point here is probably don't want to buy this sensor

656
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:22,144
Maybe if you have really maybe my hinge pins weren't fat butt

657
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:25,728
I really don't think this was something that was actually a parent in the

658
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:26,496
Reviews

659
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:28,032
So I just want to

660
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:31,104
You are don't you worry about that

661
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:33,152
If you can somehow

662
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:36,736
Tighten the thing to your hinge pin

663
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,040
Maybe that

664
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,064
Work

665
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:46,208
I don't think we need to tighten the store in Japan I think there needs to be a analysis and redesign

666
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:46,976
Yes

667
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:49,792
That is Stacey Higginbotham

668
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:50,560
Review of

669
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:52,352
The hinge pin smart door sensor

670
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:54,144
Easy to connect

671
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:57,728
That

672
00:28:57,984 --> 00:29:00,544
Probably is good for the news Fortune of this week show

673
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:04,896
You're going to still hear a lot more about CEs from us probably

674
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:07,200
Because I still have lots of things

675
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:07,968
I think about

676
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:08,736
And talk about

677
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:10,528
But it's going to be more Blended in

678
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:11,552
With the rest of the show

679
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:13,856
Next week I'm going to talk about my

680
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:15,392
Hulk

681
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:18,720
And

682
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:24,096
Stay tuned for a message from our sponsor and our guests who is Lucy Rogers

683
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:27,680
She's going to tell you how to become a maker and give you to project

684
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:30,752
One of which is controlling a dinosaur

685
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:32,032
The other witch

686
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:35,104
Is making a SMART Bus notification system

687
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:41,504

Who is the iot solutions director at Dell here to talk to us

690
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:50,976
About blueprints

691
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:52,000
Hi Kevin

692
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:54,048
Tell us about These Blueprints and what they are

693
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:59,936
Absolutely Stacy said Nobody Does it all in iot Avenger says that they can

694
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:01,472
They're either lying

695
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:02,752
To you or their delusion

696
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:07,616
And that's why we work very closely with our partners to develop these blueprints

697
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:10,688
What seas are there use case Focus

698
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:11,712
Where we take

699
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:15,808
In a working from the industry's broadest iot infrastructure

700
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,600
Portfolio that Dell Technologies

701
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:22,464
These can offer then we work with are curated Partners to integrate their different

702
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,024
Ingredients both software and Hardware

703
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,560
And then we validate

704
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:27,840
Missions in riot

705
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:29,632
Labs to ensure that are custom

706
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:30,912
Get to our life

707
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:33,216
You're in the business space

708
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:36,288
Type of iot is actually doing it

709
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:38,336
Disservice because it's making it harder for

710
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:40,640
For Business Leaders to really understand

711
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:43,456
Where they should focus their efforts around iot

712
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:46,016
What initiatives they should be putting into place

713
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:49,088
And that's why I hear Adele really working hard to shift

714
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:53,696
From use case stories or what I call Flying Pig there's a lot of those in

715
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:54,720
In iot

716
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:58,048
Can moving more towards real deployments real r a y

717
00:30:58,304 --> 00:31:01,120
Cut through all this how you can help our customers really make

718
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:04,448
Impactful decisions around their iot an issue

719
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,776
All right what is it about the Internet of Things

720
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:10,080
Requires companies to have

721
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:14,176
You know the issue is that there's so much fragmentation

722
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:18,528
And iot today 400 different and grieving up to 400

723
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:19,552
30 difference

724
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:21,600
Platforms that analysts are tracking

725
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:23,904
And what that means is every iota

726
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:24,928
Deployment

727
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:26,464
Tends to be a snowflake

728
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,256
Might look the same from a mark

729
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:31,328
Texture perspective but really when you dig in its

730
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:35,424
Unique is totally different there's lots of custom code being written

731
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:39,008
And the challenge there is that slows down our customers from

732
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:42,592
Really getting the return on these iot initiative

733
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:45,152
And that's the reason why these blueprints

734
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:49,504
Provides repeatability because I can't we validated it in our labs

735
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,064
And ultimately our customers can then trust because

736
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,088
It's proven

737
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:59,488
That they can implement it and not have it be a snowflake but had to be something that they can manage and secure and deploy

738
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:00,256
Boy faster

739
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:02,560
Kevin I've learned so much about Looper

740
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:03,840
Where can I buy

741
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:09,216
The best place to learn more is he go to dell.com iot

742
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:13,312
We have a learning library there we include all of these differ

743
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:16,128
Blueprints actually published 20 of them today

744
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:20,224
You'll find blueprints like cold chain Logistics with our partner IMS

745
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:20,992
Evolve

746
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:23,040
Connected machines with GE

747
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:23,808
Predicts

748
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:25,600
Among 20 others

749
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:32,000
That's a lot of opportunities for you to learn about these repeatable Solutions and IRT at dell.com

750
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,216
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast

751
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:43,264
This is your house Stacey Higginbotham

752
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,056
And today's guest is

753
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:47,360
Dr. Lucy Rogers

754
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:48,640
She is the

755
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:51,712
Creator and head of maker torium

756
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:54,272
Which is an engineering consultancy

757
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:56,832
And it is focused on problem-solving

758
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:58,624
And The Internet of Things

759
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:03,488
She also has a book she's going to tell you about and she is hacked many

760
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:04,512
A dinosaur

761
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,816
So hi Lucy how are you doing

762
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:08,864
I'm great thanks have a meal

763
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,680
Oh man thanks for coming I am super excited to have you

764
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:14,240
Because you are a Peacemaker person that I follow and

765
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:15,008
Excited about

766
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,592
Guys I've got to be all Fangirl

767
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:21,408
Tell me about the book

768
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:27,296
The book is called wiring The Internet of Things it will be published by O'Reilly

769
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:30,368
Later next year hopefully april-may time

770
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:35,232
It's already available on pre-orders you got to have a look on the O'Reilly website

771
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:37,024
And it's all about connecting

772
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,072
Hardware with aerobic like

773
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:39,840
Computer

774
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:42,144
Using node red software and

775
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,960
Mqtt messaging protocol

776
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:47,520
And just how you can put those three things together

777
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:50,592
And if you have the ability to put together

778
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:52,128
Ikea furniture

779
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:56,224
You have the ability to put together your own internet so sing sing

780
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,040
It's true and we're going to talk about that later in the show

781
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:01,344
So first off let's kick it off with

782
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,672
We've been like throwing around the phrase the internet of things for years now

783
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:06,720
And a lot already in this conversation

784
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:08,256
What does that even mean to you

785
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:09,280
Who is someone who is

786
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:12,864
Probably been doing connected stuff for way before this was like even

787
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:15,424
Get the Internet of Things me the million things

788
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,704
2 million different people

789
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:19,776
To me and how I like to think about it

790
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:20,544
Is

791
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,080
Guessing something

792
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:23,104
Say

793
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,384
The toy

794
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,664
And so you won't

795
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:28,480
Put a toy in your child's bedroom

796
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:33,088
And tweet them when it's time for dinner so you want the toy to start worrying if it's it's

797
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:34,368
Toy dinosaur you can

798
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:35,648
Facts that

799
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,208
Put it on your own WiFi

800
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:39,744
Connected to the internet

801
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:42,816
Tweet something else and it will make the dinosaur noise

802
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:44,096
In your child's bedroom

803
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:46,400
Take another step further what if

804
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:47,168
I know

805
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:48,704
Elderly parents

806
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:50,240
They're on the road

807
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:52,544
And that quite happy that quite good but

808
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:55,360
I'm a little bit worried about them what if I

809
00:34:55,872 --> 00:35:00,224
Especially in person to monitor their electricity Supply and I know

810
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:01,504
My parents

811
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:06,112
Make a cup of tea first thing in the morning so that be a spike in their electricity

812
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:07,392
I want to see

813
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:08,928
Is that Spike happened

814
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:10,464
I don't want to see that

815
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,768
I just want to message that tells me

816
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,304
Other side of the country

817
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,328
That's yes

818
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:21,984
Put the catalog so everything's okay and if they haven't done that on my way to give him a ring so I want the message to say

819
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,824
Casino Newcastle Spike has been noted in electricity Supply

820
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:28,128
You might want to call your parents

821
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:29,408
Kind of Internet

822
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:30,688
Things connecting

823
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:31,456
Things

824
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:35,552
But we may not quite know about so quite we want to

825
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:38,112
Going to intricate detail but more

826
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:41,184
Insurance things make things have a life of Their Own

827
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:44,256
And then if we can take that a step further and stomp actually

828
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:46,048
Analyzing some of that stuff

829
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,352
Take Canadian industry.

830
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:50,400
Where Internet of Things is really going to work

831
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:52,448
So this gets to me

832
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:53,984
Theory of making

833
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,776
Because I think the same way you

834
00:35:57,312 --> 00:36:01,408
I got all these bits and Bobs and what can I do with them to make cool new things out of

835
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,248
It occurred to me after covering this for a while that most people don't

836
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,272
Shake That

837
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:10,112
Most people want prescribed recipes are products that are like

838
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:11,648
I do this

839
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,976
So is this an eighth thing and everyone looks like

840
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:17,536
Creativity and desire to make it how can we make it

841
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:18,560
More so I guess

842
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:20,096
Future Generations is that even in

843
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,656
I think it's really important

844
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:23,424
I think

845
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:25,472
It was a night

846
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:26,752
And

847
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:27,776
If you look good

848
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:29,824
3 4 5 year olds

849
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,640
Will they doing all the time that playing with stuff

850
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:36,992
That making things happen they using their imagination

851
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:39,040
The filing and the filing Austin

852
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:40,832
But it doesn't matter then

853
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:43,136
They keep trying again and they build on that

854
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:45,696
Episonic climb a tree they might

855
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:48,256
Full of the first Branch hunting salesman

856
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:49,280
Dinotu

857
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:51,328
Hold on better next time

858
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,608
And so this

859
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,144
Picture of learning

860
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,424
What we do when we

861
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,192
Playing

862
00:36:56,448 --> 00:37:00,288
Is really critical in to be creative or what happens if

863
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,336
What can I do when

864
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:05,408
How do I make this do what I wanted to do

865
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:07,968
Which is oldest things that we have as a child

866
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:08,992
Thought

867
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:10,016
School

868
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:12,064
Parents growing up

869
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,088
Something

870
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:14,368
Nazi sound of us

871
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:15,136
We don't want

872
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:17,952
Play anymore we don't want to be seen to be failing

873
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:19,744
But I think the actual

874
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,048
Having fun the creative bit

875
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,352
Alps Iceman and houses get

876
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:29,216
Tudo que what is it that I want to do I no longer want to just be

877
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:29,984
Even

878
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,008
Dissolution

879
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,568
Because what I want isn't actually

880
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:34,336
What

881
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:36,128
10 of the people want I want

882
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:42,016
To me and said to get Luke bespoke Solutions we're going to have to start doing them for ourselves

883
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:45,088
So for kids I love her like

884
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,392
You're a big fan of the Raspberry Pi so

885
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:48,672
Maybe this is why

886
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:49,696
But like

887
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:52,512
If I want an easy way into this as an adult

888
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:56,096
Or if I want to provide something for my kids

889
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:58,144
What are the tools you think I would

890
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:00,192
I'm going to go with the roster

891
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:01,984
Because

892
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,568
It is an expensive is 30 pounds for a Raspberry Pi

893
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:10,176
It has a base of the computing power of a computer from about 10 years ago

894
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:15,552
Answer 10 years ago you wouldn't have given anybody here you all his the family

895
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:16,832
Computer this

896
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:18,368
Thousands of pounds

897
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:21,696
You wouldn't let someone just going to hack into Old try things

898
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:24,000
With it too if you broke it that would be a big

899
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:24,768
Copeland

900
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:28,608
If you break a 30 pounds computer will not such a big problem

901
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:30,656
I'm not computer that. Moseby

902
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:31,936
Supplies the brain

903
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:35,776
Which you can hang other things off so whether you're programming it

904
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:37,568
In a programming language or

905
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:43,456
Node red which is visual flow so you can see he doesn't need to worry about the semantics of

906
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:46,528
How about through color in the right places do I need to

907
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:52,928
Finish this with a colon or semicolon on how does this work the first step but that's my knee

908
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:54,464
The computer step

909
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,488
The brain bit

910
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:57,792
What I really like is actually

911
00:38:58,048 --> 00:38:58,560
Reconnecting that

912
00:38:58,816 --> 00:38:59,840
To hardware

913
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:01,376
Putting the toys

914
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:02,144
The things

915
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,424
Some boots

916
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:08,800
That you can Suites the McCulloch and they'll change color this LEDs in the bottom of them

917
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:13,152
I bought them and they just lit up but now

918
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:14,176
Because of hat

919
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:19,808
You can treat them and they change color rather than just going to the pre-programmed color that was already on there

920
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,344
I love that you as an adult

921
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:22,368
Spotlight

922
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:28,768
So

923
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:30,560
It sounds like a Raspberry Pi

924
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:31,840
Possum

925
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:33,632
Since you got no red on there

926
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:36,960
You can learn a lot from that until your book comes out

927
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:38,752
Check it out

928
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:39,776
And then

929
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:40,800
The actuator

930
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:41,824
Parts in

931
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,640
Yeah do you just buy these from like Adafruit or

932
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:46,176
Where would I run around

933
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:47,968
This is

934
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,296
At the moment still the next the tricky stage

935
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:54,368
Because you're at the moment you still have to

936
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,648
By the by

937
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:56,672
What scooter hat

938
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:59,232
Which you put on top of your Raspberry Pi

939
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:02,560
And that enables you to connect mooses or

940
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:04,608
Next census to the pie

941
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,144
But sometimes you still have

942
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,168
How to do some soldiering

943
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:08,960
Which is another

944
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:12,032
Coupe to jump so if you don't have a soul drain line if you've never

945
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:13,056
Done and Isolde ring

946
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:19,712
My soul drink five years ago was horrendous I found some reason it is Big blowup sold everywhere I used to burn my fingers

947
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:21,248
I'll take it awhile but

948
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:25,088
Uncle Philip better but those first steps already a little bit daunting

949
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:27,392
Product School

950
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:28,672
Back inductive

951
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:29,440
Which is paint

952
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:31,488
So you can paint your own solder

953
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,840
And use that for the smaller items you can make cards and

954
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:41,728
Cause that light up with LEDs because you just painted the soda on there are lots of things to get you started in

955
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,776
And then these hot some of them have

956
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:46,848
Screw terminals so you cannot just screw the wise in

957
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,640
Adafruit

958
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:50,432
RS Components

959
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:52,480
A lot of these companies have

960
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:54,016
Bits that you can take

961
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:55,040
As a maker

962
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:56,064
And

963
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:58,112
Adafruit on Broad Street

964
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:58,880
Pi

965
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:01,952
And RS Components and many other

966
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:03,488
Websites out there

967
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,584
Showing you how to do these things there was a wonderful community

968
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:09,632
We make a community of

969
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:11,680
This is how I did this

970
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:13,728
You can follow my step by step instructions

971
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:20,384
This phone I've done a PNC but I can't get to DNS what did I do wrong

972
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:23,200
You'll get many suggestions

973
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:26,528
If you could have done wrong and how to how to get there

974
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:28,576
Okay now you are also a mechanic

975
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:30,368
Sophia

976
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:31,392
How much of that

977
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:32,672
You rely on

978
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:33,952
But I have a

979
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:34,976
At the Graham

980
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:36,000
Mechanical engineering

981
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:42,400
And also PhD in fluid dynamics of the page that I must say I'm not relying on it to have late when I'm doing any of this

982
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:43,168
Baking stuff

983
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:44,704
And actually not much

984
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,752
The degree

985
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:52,128
Inasmuch as the mathematical calculations to find out how to do

986
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:53,151
I'm not using

987
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:55,199
But my experience all

988
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:59,039
I know which materials are probably best for various things

989
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:01,343
The electronics of Greeley

990
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:02,879
From scratch

991
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:05,951
And onion Last 5 Years and not Spain

992
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:06,975
On the way

993
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:10,047
Undercoating I've learned from scratch in last 5 years

994
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:12,607
From the web and from people helping me

995
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:15,167
Okay so that it actually feels really

996
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:15,935
Doable

997
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:18,495
You're probably a smart woman

998
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:20,287
We got lots of smart

999
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:22,591
Anything you need

1000
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:23,615
Is the logic

1001
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:24,383
Remind

1002
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:25,407
To know that

1003
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:27,711
You go to do this before you can do that

1004
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:28,991
Before you can do the other

1005
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:30,015
Order of operations

1006
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:33,343
Recipe how do you cook

1007
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:37,951
Cooking recipe you can follow a lot of these things on the web

1008
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:38,975
Okay

1009
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:39,743
So

1010
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:41,023
Let's get to the

1011
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:42,047
Project

1012
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:42,815
Fortunate

1013
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:44,351
I'll let you choose

1014
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:45,119
Your projects

1015
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:46,143
I'm helping

1016
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:46,911
Best Buy speakers

1017
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:49,215
So

1018
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:51,007
Take a project and let's walk

1019
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:52,287
People threw in a little bit

1020
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:55,615
Okay I'll work with the bus project that I'm fat

1021
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:56,639
Just finished

1022
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:58,687
I gave a talk

1023
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:00,991
A while ago and

1024
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:07,391
Using raw sweet pies and what up and doing in the interactive dinosaurs that we've been working with a theme park

1025
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:09,951
A lady came up to me at the end and said

1026
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:11,487
What I really want

1027
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:13,535
Is a Visual Alert

1028
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:19,679
That tells me that in 5 minutes time the buses going to be at my bus stop

1029
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:21,983
Which gives me X. Makoto

1030
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:23,263
Go downstairs

1031
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:24,543
I'm get to the bus stop

1032
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:25,823
Just before the bus arrives

1033
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:28,895
Should be up this apps that you can look at

1034
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:30,687
As soon as I look at my phone

1035
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:32,223
I checked my emails

1036
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:37,343
So I just want something visual that flashes at me that says right now is the time to go

1037
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:38,367
Get your bus

1038
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:45,023
About this and she lives in London to transport for London have got on the website

1039
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:46,047
When the bus

1040
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:46,815
Did you

1041
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:47,839
Hub.

1042
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:50,911
A lot of the transport infrastructure now

1043
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:55,007
Space information Outlet so you cannot see it stopped because I've used

1044
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:55,775
2

1045
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:57,823
You're on your own.

1046
00:43:58,591 --> 00:44:00,127
Okay so would it be like an API that I

1047
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:04,735
You got to go in and that she have a look at it so it

1048
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:11,135
You need a little bit more understanding of what's that website will give you it is that which they write Pi that you'll look

1049
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:13,951
Okay

1050
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:14,975
Bus API

1051
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:17,791
Yep I bet I'm going to get a Raspberry Pi

1052
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:20,863
Yep you've got a real sweet I

1053
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:23,423
Buns on your home

1054
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:24,191
Wi-Fi

1055
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:27,007
So you set out to run on your home Wi-Fi

1056
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:27,775
Which

1057
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:31,615
Theoretically is very simple as long as you've got a keyboard and the monitor

1058
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:34,175
And you can just plug lighting and type in your

1059
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:35,199
Wi-Fi code

1060
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:37,759
How about you can bend take out

1061
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:41,343
The Monitor and the guy is

1062
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:42,623
Is working only

1063
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:43,391
Network

1064
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:47,743
You don't need it pumped into anything apart from the mains from then on it

1065
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:51,071
So do you need Wi-Fi

1066
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:52,095
I'm bored

1067
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:53,375
So you don't need even to plug

1068
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:55,423
The wife I don't go in anymore

1069
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:58,495
Used to in the old applies you go to

1070
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:00,031
Depay running and you put some

1071
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:02,079
Code on that which basically says

1072
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:05,919
Between the hours of 7 and 8 in the morning

1073
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:07,711
Go to the

1074
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:08,991
Website and

1075
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:11,551
How to get the information from this API

1076
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:13,599
Who tells me when a bus is coming

1077
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:16,927
And is a different number is it says it's less than

1078
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:17,951
Between

1079
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:20,767
2 in in 5 minutes then

1080
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:22,815
Something red

1081
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:25,119
SI Pat Green

1082
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:30,495
And if it's longer than 30 minutes so there's no bus coming within the 30 minutes flash red because I need to know

1083
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:31,519
That

1084
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:33,823
I've got to go and get another message

1085
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:38,687
Getting into work today I can't go to the boss because there are no buses that there's a problem with that

1086
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:40,479
About sea

1087
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:41,759
The node red roster

1088
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:46,623
The pipe is enough of put this old up online and you can just download it has its up on GitHub

1089
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:49,695
You can download my software and put it on your thigh

1090
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:51,999
And I will s*** I would like to that in the show note

1091
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:54,303
Sofas parts

1092
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:57,375
Your pie is still plugged into your keyboard cuz you're going to have to

1093
00:45:58,143 --> 00:45:58,655
Controller

1094
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:00,959
You can either do that

1095
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:05,567
To your keyboard or actually with another laptop

1096
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:07,103
Computer that's on your WiFi

1097
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:11,967
Can you use it for a web browser you can program the pi through your web browser

1098
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:14,783
Got it. You just look into that pie

1099
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:17,855
You built like this 3D enclosure and you

1100
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:20,927
Created like this LED light up bus which is adorable

1101
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:22,207
My house is full of

1102
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:22,975
Like hue light bulb

1103
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:25,535
Which does have an SDK

1104
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:26,303
And I

1105
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:27,071
I think also

1106
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:33,471
So I saw this and I was like oh how can I use my existing infrastructure as opposed to 3D printing something

1107
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:36,031
Cuz cuz I'm lazy

1108
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:38,847
Is there a way to do something like that

1109
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:40,127
Or is it just not

1110
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:41,407
Fluid enough yet

1111
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:42,687
Are we not open enough

1112
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:45,503
I believe you

1113
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:47,551
You can I haven't tried it yet

1114
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:50,367
I might now have to stop thinking about that

1115
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:53,695
It shouldn't be too complicated if you can get

1116
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:55,999
If you can control of the

1117
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:58,047
The light bulbs with your phone then you can

1118
00:46:58,303 --> 00:46:59,327
Control it with a Raspberry Pi

1119
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:00,351
Okay

1120
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:03,167
Yeah

1121
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:04,959
The Browns beat pie is too soft

1122
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:07,007
Rabbits about that's the brains

1123
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:09,055
Connected to

1124
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:10,335
A light

1125
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:12,383
Answer me I had a

1126
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:15,455
3D printed little bus that I made

1127
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:20,319
Did I put in some neopixels smelly days and I connected.

1128
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:21,343
Through

1129
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:23,391
Wemos

1130
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:24,927
The one chip

1131
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:25,695
It's

1132
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:26,975
A chip.

1133
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:30,303
Has wifionboard so you can

1134
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:31,071
Tok Twitter

1135
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:32,351
Over the Wi-Fi

1136
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:35,935
And you can program it just like you program an Arduino

1137
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:36,703
Gatlin

1138
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:38,495
Ghost and tools

1139
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:41,567
Makes your LEDs talk to your husband pi

1140
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:43,359
Did the Busby

1141
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:45,407
He probably doesn't have to be in the same place

1142
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:46,175
Azul light

1143
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:48,479
Oh nice to

1144
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:49,759
You could actually

1145
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:51,295
Build json incel it

1146
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:55,135
You can as long as I can get it on that Wi-Fi thoughts

1147
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:56,415
Turn on the Wi-Fi

1148
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:57,183
And it be

1149
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:00,511
Tied to that

1150
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:03,839
Yeah good gift for your neighbors guys

1151
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:06,143
If your neighbor is not going to look at you funny

1152
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:11,007
You sang I'm always late

1153
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:15,359
Nevermind scratch that don't make it again

1154
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:16,383
Okay

1155
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:19,711
I like this that gets to the reason why I'm going to

1156
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:20,479
Segway here

1157
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:22,271
It's the reason why we need

1158
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:26,623
Kind of that long tail Solutions because no one's going to manufacture this because

1159
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:29,695
Pasta is so intensely local you can never

1160
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:32,511
Produce enough until enough to make something like this worthwhile

1161
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:34,559
Yeah so

1162
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:35,839
Yay

1163
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:37,119
Reason number one

1164
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:39,935
Actually

1165
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:42,751
Let's talk about project number 2

1166
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:44,543
The bus was connect

1167
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:47,103
Change a website to some lights

1168
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:48,127
Basically

1169
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:54,015
What are Michael Jackson's I found Grace Van Der waals was hacking the toy dinosaur that I mentioned earlier

1170
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:55,807
Photo of a

1171
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:57,343
Small electronics

1172
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:58,623
Kit is designed

1173
00:48:58,879 --> 00:49:00,159
For 8 year olds

1174
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:03,487
And it's a Dinosaur say when you

1175
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:05,535
Pick the switch the dinosaur

1176
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:07,327
Notes head up and down

1177
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:08,095
But it's

1178
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:09,631
It's an assembled

1179
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:12,959
Sing to you slept like a 3D jigsaw puzzle

1180
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:15,263
You connect to the

1181
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:18,335
The switch in the battery and that's your electronics training

1182
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:19,615
The children

1183
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:21,663
Took you take the switch out of that

1184
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:24,223
And put in a little bit of electronics

1185
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:24,991
Which

1186
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:31,391
You can do with that very cheap electronics but I see the ordering with you you plug everything your resist

1187
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:32,671
Justice and transistors

1188
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:33,951
If you've never done that

1189
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:36,255
The full that cynical complex all that I have written

1190
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:38,815
Upload post for the magpi magazine

1191
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:41,119
Easy downloadable

1192
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:43,935
Play magazine is the wrong size

1193
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:45,471
Magazine

1194
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:47,519
How to use in that

1195
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:49,311
I can now tweet my

1196
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:50,335
Toy dinosaur

1197
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:51,359
Orthomed

1198
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:53,663
Set it up to rule when

1199
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:56,991
All the other dinosaurs roaring

1200
00:49:57,759 --> 00:50:01,343
Tweets those or even set to talk with an empty TT feed

1201
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:02,367
If you want to do that

1202
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:03,647
Celexa

1203
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:05,695
A great fun little project

1204
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:07,487
That sounds like fun I

1205
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:08,767
I'll need a soldering gun

1206
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:12,607
Note because it's designed for the eight year olds

1207
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:14,655
You can do it with

1208
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:16,959
What's called a breadboard which is

1209
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:20,031
A piece of plastic with lots of holes in that you can stick your legs

1210
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:21,055
Tronix into

1211
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:23,615
You don't need

1212
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:25,407
Trusting to any sold ring

1213
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:26,175
However

1214
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:29,503
It wouldn't be so secure so you wouldn't be officers around

1215
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:33,343
But it's it work for long enough going to be secure enough

1216
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:35,647
Tri-Cities ER ornament on your desk

1217
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:36,927
All right

1218
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:38,207
I loved it

1219
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:41,023
You're building this stuff I can't wait to see what you make Nets

1220
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:43,583
I really appreciate you coming on the show this

1221
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:45,375
Not a problem

1222
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:52,543
Well that's it for this week's show thank you so much for listening and we'll see you again next week on the internet

1223
