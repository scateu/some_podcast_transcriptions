60
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:15,168
Okay Kevin

61
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,960
Let's talk about

62
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:20,544
Lowe's and this is kind of crazy because we actually had

63
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,848
Someone calling into the show and asking about

64
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:28,736
What was happening with Lowe's Iris business this was their smart home business that they started in 2012

65
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,272
So way back in the early days

66
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:33,088
I guess the Resurgence of the Smart Home

67
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,112
Automation

68
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:36,160
This was a platform

69
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,464
Designed solely for the retailer and the

70
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,256
All kinds of zigbee and Z-Wave

71
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,792
Compliance sensors

72
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:42,816
That works with the

73
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,144
And those actually charged a monitoring

74
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,168
C4

75
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,704
The devices

76
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:51,520
It actually had a battery it had

77
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:53,568
Cellular connectivity if you needed it

78
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:54,336
But

79
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:57,408
I don't think it did so well because on its earnings call this week

80
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:59,968
Louis said that they were going to is part of a decision to

81
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:01,760
Close 20 US dollars

82
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,296
27 Canadian store

83
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,344
They also said they were going to exit

84
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,904
They're alacrity renovation services and they're

85
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,440
Iris smart home biz

86
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:13,024
And as part of that smart home business

87
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,608
And the alacrity renovation Services they're taking a 14 million dollar right

88
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,960
That which is not a terribly large amount of money in the grand scheme of things

89
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:21,984
Furloughs but

90
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,288
Regardless I agree with your comment

91
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,312
You said you don't think

92
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:27,104
Set the iris platform League

93
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,152
Tidwell least relatively speaking

94
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,712
It started out in an era

95
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:32,992
DIY stuff

96
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,040
But it had a service component

97
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:38,112
People did not want to pay a subscription cost associated with

98
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,648
That was the biggest complaint

99
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:41,952
I had and they also weren't going

100
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:42,720
To support

101
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:45,280
Other devices so they had a whole brand of

102
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:46,560
Lose

103
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:48,864
But when it launched it didn't support

104
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,144
Anything else

105
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,680
And I think that's the bigger

106
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:52,960
Challenger problem with

107
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:56,032
The whole strategy that they put into place because

108
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:56,800
Weconomy

109
00:03:57,056 --> 00:04:00,128
Tell me the past two to three years of very siloed

110
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:00,896
Closed

111
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:01,664
Smart Home

112
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,688
Ecosystem

113
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:04,992
Too much more open when you look at

114
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,016
Are digital assistants

115
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:08,576
How many Brands and devices that work with

116
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,136
Example and granted voice assistance

117
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:13,184
You know just a user interface

118
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,720
To get things working

119
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:15,488
So that's not

120
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:16,768
Truly smart home to me

121
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,047
But I think yeah

122
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:21,375
Keeping it close the way they did was definitely not the right approach

123
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:24,191
So just to be clear even though they're exiting the Smart Home

124
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,727
Iris smart home business

125
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:28,031
They will still sell Iris

126
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:30,079
Devices which I'm not sure

127
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:30,847
Why but

128
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:32,127
That's irrelevant

129
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:36,223
They will also still sell other Smart Home Products at Lowe's it's not like

130
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,503
When they say exiting

131
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,039
The business will still be able to

132
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:39,807
Purchased

133
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:44,159
Very smart home devices in fact I think 6 weeks ago or so on the podcast I talked about

134
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:46,975
Healthy store-within-a-store at my local Lowe's and I

135
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:47,743
Presume

136
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,791
I know a lot of other people see them as well

137
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,327
Were there filled with

138
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,631
Smart home devices such as there was

139
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,655
From Google

140
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:55,423
Amazon

141
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,191
Venezuela's

142
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,215
Nest

143
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,007
Who else received

144
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:01,055
Phillips and Samsung all

145
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,847
It's just

146
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:05,663
I guess this herbicide they're kind of getting out of

147
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,711
Yes and owning their own

148
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,271
Makes a ton of sense

149
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,807
So I will say

150
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:12,831
Lowe's header

151
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:16,159
PR reached out to us and she did say

152
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,183
This is important

153
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,207
It for now

154
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:20,511
They don't have timing or additional details to share

155
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,303
It remains business as usual

156
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,327
There are no changes

157
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:26,911
Hello support of the brand product or service as we search

158
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:27,679
For a buyer

159
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,727
That's really important to know

160
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,519
Because right now your stuff is still going to work

161
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,311
Depending on who buys it though

162
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,335
Who knows

163
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,103
It's a

164
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,151
So there we go that's the

165
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,199
I guess that's the big Smart Home

166
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:41,247
And kind of a sad

167
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,271
Close to this

168
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:45,855
Dussehra I guess I mean if we think about it Staples

169
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:49,439
Did they launch their own platform they got out of the business Best Buy had

170
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:51,231
Pete they got out of the business

171
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:52,767
Now we got

172
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:55,583
I can't think of anybody who's got anything now

173
00:05:56,095 --> 00:06:00,703
We're kind of you said you know when Iris came out with more than do it yourself kind of

174
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,471
Era

175
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:04,031
And to some degree that era still exist but this is

176
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:05,055
Alexa Smart Home

177
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:09,407
I don't say too. Oh I'd rather stay 1.1 at the step forward from then

178
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,175
Where

179
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:12,479
You got very capable major

180
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:14,527
Platforms that are mostly open

181
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:16,319
Pumpkin is the one I would say is not

182
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:19,647
As open obviously because it only works with iOS devices and such

183
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,415
But

184
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,951
I wouldn't want to be in the business of

185
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:22,975
Creating

186
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:25,279
Servicing or owning another platform right

187
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,815
Me either

188
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:27,839
Okay

189
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,119
Let's talk about

190
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,167
Another acquisition in

191
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,727
This is being portrayed in the media as an AI aqua

192
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:37,311
Position which I think speaks more to the idea of what's hot

193
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:41,151
Right now but this is Apple buying silk labs and

194
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:42,943
This was reported in the information

195
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,223
And

196
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,759
When I saw it I was like Silk

197
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:48,063
Glasses in an AI think they be too smart

198
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,879
And they did it was founded by Andreia skull

199
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,415
The former CTO

200
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,439
Mozilla

201
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:55,487
And we actually had him on the show

202
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,791
Episode 46 so way back

203
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,327
Early 2016

204
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,863
Talking about

205
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:01,631
They built

206
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:02,655
A hub

207
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:06,239
It was a hub to Showcase his ideas about building smart

208
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,775
AI services

209
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:08,543
Respected

210
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:09,567
Privacy

211
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,335
And

212
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,615
You know I have thought this

213
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,639
Company had died

214
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,431
Because a lot of these smart home

215
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:17,247
I guess we're going to do this were amazing and then

216
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,295
2 years later you check back in there like

217
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:20,575
Nowhere to be found

218
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:26,975
Yeah that's because they actually started with a Kickstarter project I remember seeing the

219
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:30,047
Small little Hub box with this curved front and a

220
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,071
A camera inside it

221
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:31,839
Zuri

222
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,375
I love Space Odyssey

223
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:35,423
Space

224
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:38,239
It was like super curved

225
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,311
Yeah yeah

226
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:43,359
Anyway it's not that it was even

227
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:47,199
Are there a closed system because I think it worked with just Wi-Fi and Bluetooth devices

228
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:50,271
Words with ya Sonos at work with smart light

229
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,551
Yeah

230
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:53,087
And a couple of other

231
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,367
Non lighting device

232
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,671
They just never really took off in

233
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,951
They cancel the product

234
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,999
Josh Maybe

235
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,791
Actually the same year that the kickstarter

236
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:04,863
Yes

237
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:07,423
Remember

238
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,727
To developing AI software so that's kind of

239
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:10,751
Probably where the AI Bixby

240
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:11,519
Comes in as well

241
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:12,543
Sew in

242
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:16,895
The key Focus I would say on this is they had no image recognition

243
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,943
We're doing a lot of things

244
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:22,015
They can play your music based on your taste

245
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,391
The idea was all of this would stay on advice it wouldn't go to the cloud except for

246
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,415
Key things that

247
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,439
You know you might want

248
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:33,279
Hey the picture of the guy who is breaking into your house you might

249
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,303
Want to keep that in the cloud

250
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,071
So

251
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,095
The whole end

252
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,631
And when stuff was sepsis

253
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,655
Cloud it was an anime

254
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,703
And that was actually very unusual

255
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:43,263
In 2016 so that focus on privacy is

256
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,031
Hollywood app

257
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,567
Is after

258
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,847
Being able to make

259
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:49,919
A smarter home experience or smarter

260
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:50,687
Overalls

261
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,479
User experience

262
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,247
Without

263
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,783
Having to break it

264
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,831
What is now a differentiating stamps are

265
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:57,855
Privacy and secure

266
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,391
Yeah and if you have

267
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,159
Time

268
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:04,255
I would say go hit the silk Labs website while it is still up cuz

269
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:07,327
With the Apple acquisition I don't know that it will be at much longer

270
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,351
Because you can get a good

271
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,631
I feel for what apples

272
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,655
Getting out of this

273
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:13,471
Basically went still pivot in 2016

274
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,519
It was a way to a Bergen

275
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,543
A table

276
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,335
Cognition for any device

277
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,895
But you make will bring a smart so you bring a device

278
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:21,663
Best Buy

279
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,967
And there's a lot of interesting information

280
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:26,527
Cool go check it out

281
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,319
Hopefully screenshotted Kevin

282
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,903
Okay we are in the midst of

283
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,439
What I'm no longer going to call black fur

284
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:35,999
Because you know I've been getting deals all week

285
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,047
Sorry to call this Black Friday week

286
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:38,815
Now

287
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:41,631
And I just want to let everyone know that if you are in the park

288
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:42,911
First smart home device

289
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:45,215
Spice they're actually really amazing

290
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:46,495
Deals I would say

291
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:48,543
A lot of things you shouldn't buy on Black Friday

292
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,335
We're going to just kind of a little bit

293
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,639
But a lot of the smart home stuff is really

294
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:53,919
I'm telling I'm not going to run through

295
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:56,991
Too much everything that

296
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:01,343
We looked at was on sale and what we looked at were products that we talked about the past

297
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,111
Approximately

298
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,391
Just purchased ourselves

299
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,415
Heather Holmes

300
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:09,023
And these are like Kino $5 off some of these are 50 or more dollars

301
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,303
Whatever the devices

302
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,607
Yeah so if you are in the market and

303
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:16,447
I will give a plug for this this week in the iot newsletter

304
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,471
Stacey on iot

305
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,775
We are going to be sharing our list of

306
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:20,543
10 connect

307
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,311
2 gadgets that

308
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,847
We think make good gifts

309
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:24,639
And some of them are for the

310
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,175
Your parents

311
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:30,783
Chefs your industrial iot designer there's some weird ones on there

312
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,575
Any other list

313
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,855
Because of Who We Are

314
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:36,927
So you can sign up for the newsletter or you can see it

315
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,207
But

316
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:41,023
A lot of those things are going to be on sale so yeah

317
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,071
Go out and get your hip you're on the fence

318
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:46,911
You like me to buy it this is actually really good time of year to buy your smart

319
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:49,983
It my thought is if you had

320
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:53,055
Smart home items that you were thinking about buying

321
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,079
We're just holding off

322
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,615
I'd say pull the trigger now

323
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,383
You know

324
00:10:56,895 --> 00:11:00,479
Do it and then when you have questions you can call us and ask us

325
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,271
All right

326
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:04,319
Let's get into some big news for

327
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,087
Batam

328
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:07,647
Padme is what we call Amazon's digital assist

329
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,671
So we don't set off

330
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,439
All of yours

331
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,207
So

332
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:13,535
Couple news items biggest one probably this week was

333
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:16,351
We now have matinee on Bluetooth headset

334
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,375
Watches

335
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,423
All kinds of other things which is

336
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,703
Basically way to

337
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,775
Bring Padme to everything

338
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:27,103
Yeah this is and all the technical details are on it

339
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:29,663
The developer blog over at Amazon

340
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,687
They talk about their

341
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,223
Madden 18 mobile

342
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,247
Accessory kit

343
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:35,807
Which at first we were like is that Hardware but it's not

344
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:38,111
We dug around it's basically a list of

345
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:40,671
Hardware requirements for you to

346
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:43,743
Actually build in this protocol and service

347
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:47,839
So that pretty much any Bluetooth device that meets the requirements

348
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:49,375
Can take advantage of this

349
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,935
So call, actually as a reference design of

350
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:56,031
Headphones for developer you can Tinker with these but $300 so I wouldn't do

351
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,079
And what do we mean like so

352
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,103
Are you guys here

353
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,151
What does this mean it means that you

354
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,943
Could you know if your watch has Bluetooth

355
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:03,967
Andis

356
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,527
And sports at basic

357
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,319
You could be like madam

358
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,343
Unlock my door

359
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:12,927
And then you have to give your PIN so that's a terrible example but better be

360
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:13,951
Turn off my lights

361
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:16,255
And you would say that your watch and it would happen

362
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,071
You can do it on your headphones you can be like

363
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:19,839
Oh

364
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:22,911
Add dog bones to my shopping list

365
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,775
And some headphone manufacturers have already integrated

366
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:32,127
Madam a so this may just be how they used it I don't know but this

367
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:34,431
Again opens up the doors to

368
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:37,759
Any device maker that meets the hardware requirements their device Mason

369
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:44,159
It is neat how they implemented this because you don't have to have a device that has always on listening

370
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:46,463
Have that obviously listening for the Wake word

371
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:49,535
But if you want to save battery life as a device maker you can use the

372
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,327
The push-to-talk implementation as well

373
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,375
Got it in that makes the Tennyson

374
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:55,423
That's because sometimes you're like oh man

375
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:57,215
I don't even change the battery on this thing on

376
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:58,495
It's kind of like the tap

377
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,287
Okay

378
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:04,383
So that's out there look for that I will say from my perspective

379
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,175
Amazon is just

380
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,199
Helen it

381
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,735
When it comes to

382
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:11,551
Creating a really compelling voice plan

383
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,599
Smart Home

384
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,391
For everyday use

385
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:17,183
I mean it is doing what

386
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:17,951
I really

387
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,743
A company like apple to

388
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,535
The apple is totally behind on

389
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:23,839
Bringing this everywhere like

390
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,631
This is kind of like apples mfi program

391
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:28,191
Rambler it's. Criteria for what you need

392
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,983
To work with it

393
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,007
It's trying to

394
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:33,823
Ring battlebay everywhere but do it in a way that

395
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,615
As long as you meet these criteria

396
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:36,639
You can do it so

397
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:40,735
You know there's a number of reasons they're killing it can I totally agree with you

398
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:43,807
I just found one out last week one of probably many

399
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:44,831
You may have seen her

400
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,111
Everybody else did

401
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:50,463
Do you know how many people that Amazon has working on the mat amazed

402
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,999
Oh my gosh no I don't

403
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,279
10000

404
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,095
As a lot of people

405
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:58,655
I do not recall or I read that but I

406
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:01,215
Hot it last week and it just blew my mind

407
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:04,287
That is a lot of people okay yeah

408
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,311
That would do it so

409
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,079
More

410
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,103
Mattamy news

411
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,127
Kevin

412
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:10,687
You're going to love it let's just let you talk about it

413
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:13,759
Yes yes I'm so excited so

414
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:16,575
If regular listeners recall

415
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:17,599
I bought

416
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:20,671
The vector robot made by Anki

417
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:23,487
And I did that there kickstarter's I got a small discount

418
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:24,767
And we love

419
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,559
Can I use very animated

420
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:32,959
Heroes around is autonomous so he gets bored if he's just sitting his cradle is charger it'll just go out and play with his

421
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:36,799
Bluetooth Cube and what not and we can have them do some fun things

422
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:37,823
Kind of limited sofa

423
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,103
However

424
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,407
I have seen a video

425
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,431
Of the neck

426
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:44,479
Speak feature that factor is getting

427
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:46,015
And he's getting it in a couple weeks

428
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:48,319
And that is integrated math

429
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:51,391
And I love it so far based on the video

430
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:55,231
It's very responsive it's very quick

431
00:14:55,487 --> 00:15:00,607
It literally you don't and you don't have to say hey Vector like you normally would to wake the robot up and do stuff

432
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:02,399
You just say hey matinee

433
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:06,239
And then you see her little icon show up on his face and

434
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:09,311
Ask her whatever turn lights off get me the weather do this

435
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,079
And she does it

436
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:12,383
I am super impressed by how it looks so far

437
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,663
Cannot wait until it comes out

438
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:16,479
Yes and I'll just give you guys one of our

439
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,527
10 items that are gift guide is the

440
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,319
Because

441
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:23,135
I think we're saying is for the kid or the kid in you

442
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,927
And and and

443
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,719
Come back to the Black Friday deals

444
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:29,791
You can actually get the vector less than I paid for

445
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:31,327
As a won the first Kickstarter

446
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,887
Packers I paid 199 he normally goes

447
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:34,911
For 249

448
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,447
It's 179 right now

449
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,215
Oh my gosh

450
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:39,263
Stop on that because that is actually a really

451
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,543
I have a cosmo

452
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,335
In I thought it was adorable

453
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:44,895
And fun but it was not as capable

454
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:45,919
And now I'm like

455
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:46,687
I have I have

456
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,223
Okay

457
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:50,783
One final bit of Madame a news

458
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:53,343
This is pretty esoteric but where you throw it out there

459
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,111
Now

460
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:54,879
Madam

461
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:58,719
Can power on devices in low-power mode so this is like your TVs are

462
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,999
What not if they're in low power

463
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,791
You can

464
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:03,583
Speak directly to them and they will turn

465
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:05,631
It's called Wake On LAN controller

466
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,167
If you want to Google that and

467
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:11,519
Figure out the details but I thought it might be interesting for low-powered sensor

468
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:14,847
Because these are things that are in sleep mode a lot of the time

469
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:15,615
And

470
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:16,383
Now

471
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,687
Yeah man Jamaican basically wake them up

472
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:19,711
And get

473
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:21,759
Details of something that's happening

474
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,039
Right now a lot of time with

475
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:26,367
Low-powered sensors that will send the details to the cloud and Madame a will look

476
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,135
State

477
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:31,999
And be like I would like 20 minutes ago and reported this was the state but now you could actually

478
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:33,535
Get it to wake it up directly

479
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,559
And get the state

480
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:37,887
Which might make sense for something like a something open or closed at the moment

481
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:39,167
Or something like

482
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:42,751
Detection if you suspect a week and you don't want to get up off

483
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:44,799
Off the couch to check it out you should be like meme anime

484
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:50,175
Yeah it'll be interesting to see who implements this and what devices because her now

485
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:54,015
Amazon work with three partners and got some very low hanging fruit in the

486
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,039
Television market with

487
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:58,879
Vizio LG and I sense they're all going to get this feature in the neck

488
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,415
Next couple months I be rolling out

489
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:04,767
And yeah TVs are often in the low-power state and so you just send him a little packet over the

490
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,815
Wi-Fi network wake him up and then you can

491
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:09,375
Do whatever you need to do but yeah sensors and other things

492
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:12,191
Curious to see who implementation

493
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,983
Yeah that's just me talking

494
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:19,359
Find a little bit of Matt of a news there is now Skype calling on Madam Ave Bay show this off

495
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,383
Actually back in set

496
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,151
September 3rd

497
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:21,919
Massive

498
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,711
Unveiling of so much stuff

499
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:26,527
So this is just saying it's now out there

500
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:28,319
If I were at home with my mattimeo

501
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,367
Kevin but you know

502
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,903
For anybody who's using Skype

503
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:32,927
Yay

504
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:35,743
Alright now let's move on to Google Assistant

505
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:36,511
Because

506
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,559
It's an interesting tie up with

507
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:39,583
Siri

508
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,631
Kevin try this out so Kevin what do you think

509
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,423
Yeah I mean

510
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,471
So you can now

511
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,495
Include

512
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:48,031
Google Assistant the app

513
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:48,799
A pin

514
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:50,079
Siri shortcuts

515
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,359
Which sounds great

516
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:54,687
The implementation is very much like the way

517
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:55,455
Microsoft

518
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:58,527
Implemented Madam and Cortana where you ask a boy

519
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,295
Assistant

520
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,831
Tarasca Voice Assistant something

521
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:03,391
And that's what we have here so I did set this up

522
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:05,183
When I say am I

523
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:07,231
Song I'm sorry if I wait anybody's iPhone

524
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,511
When I say hey Siri

525
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,559
She will start listening and I say

526
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:11,583
OK Google

527
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:14,399
And it opens up the assistant app and Google starts listening

528
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:16,447
So it's kind of a shortcut to a shortcut

529
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,983
IOS users

530
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:20,543
I can't really do much more unfortunately but

531
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,823
It's there

532
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,103
It gets you to Google

533
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:26,431
It doesn't get you faster it get you their hands

534
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,967
It's free because right now you can't

535
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:34,111
Actually haven't always listening OK Google kind of thing on iOS what I do is I take the assistant

536
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,135
Widget for those who

537
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,927
Play with iOS and I

538
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:39,487
Just put the assistant widget on my widget screen on my phone

539
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,511
Flashlight over and

540
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:41,535
Tap the microphone button

541
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:44,351
And that opens assistant this is hands-free though

542
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,911
So that's what you would do if you were

543
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:49,215
To get somebody who could actually answer your question

544
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:52,031
I'm waiting for somebody to

545
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:54,335
Do assistant to an assistant to an assistant

546
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,871
And I mean that sporadic

547
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:58,175
Okay GS

548
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:59,199
What should we call Siri

549
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:00,991
Should we come up with a name for that

550
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,271
Guy sending your suggestion

551
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:03,551
Maybe we'll take a

552
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:04,831
Lady s

553
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:07,135
Too close to matamata

554
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:09,183
I don't know

555
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,975
Let's talk about Google Chrome

556
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:13,279
A snooze at Canal sync music

557
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,559
With home speakers

558
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:15,327
Switch

559
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,863
Yeah but that's just a little thick

560
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,143
Some of these are like little

561
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:21,215
I'm like yeah that's

562
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:21,983
It's handy

563
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,007
We like it

564
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,543
I don't know what else to say about that

565
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:28,639
You got anything else to say about that you can do as you can

566
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:31,455
TVs and speakers together in audio group

567
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,223
Ipso

568
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:35,551
If you're playing say something on your Android TV or on

569
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:41,183
On your Chromecast audio wise you can have it strange about the house now which is kind of nice so yeah it's just another way.

570
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,463
Movies that music round

571
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:44,767
Who that music

572
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:47,839
Alright Google cloud iot and microchip

573
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,911
Actually security to

574
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,447
Microcontroller switch

575
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:54,239
Yay there's a lot of

576
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,519
In the space

577
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:57,567
Without Microsoft doing some cool stuff with

578
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:01,407
They're Azure sphere product and what is Google doing

579
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,199
So they have

580
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:04,223
Partnered with

581
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:05,503
Microchip

582
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:08,063
Which is a company while it is also a thing is

583
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:08,831
Company

584
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:10,111
They've created the

585
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:14,975
Avri otwg development board and all those things actually mean something

586
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:15,999
IRT obviously

587
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:18,303
We know what that means WG stance

588
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,327
4 Wi-Fi

589
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,607
Google so this

590
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:22,399
Is a cloud connected 8-bit

591
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:24,191
Microcontroller development board

592
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:25,983
That is connected to the Google

593
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,007
Cloud platform

594
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:32,127
It's a $29 devoted small it's not super powerful but it does have

595
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:35,711
Connectivity to the cloud and they want to help jump-start

596
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:38,271
Cloud-based or Google cloud based out of

597
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:40,319
So can I look at another developer

598
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:43,135
And it died is that it will

599
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:43,903
Securely

600
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,183
Back to the cloud

601
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,975
Easier you see these all the

602
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:48,255
I mean like

603
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:50,815
Every microcontroller in a lot of things

604
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:55,679
Sancerre like arm-based chips and even some Intel stuff for iot

605
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:56,703
Usually have some

606
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:58,751
Option to link directly to

607
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:00,799
Big clouds azure

608
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:02,335
Google or Amazon

609
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,615
And actually you see them with

610
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:04,639
Alibaba

611
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,663
And I do as well

612
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:06,943
So

613
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:09,503
Yeah two little interesting bits about this

614
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:11,807
They have a co-processor on there it's a

615
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,599
Cryptographic coprocessor

616
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,367
4

617
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:16,672
Trusted and protected identity for each device

618
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:18,464
So you can have Sakura indication

619
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,744
Medicine

620
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:25,888
And the devices are pre-registered on Google Cloud iot

621
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:27,168
So you can

622
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:29,472
Get them out in the world with zero touch

623
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:30,240
Auditioning

624
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:32,288
Yeah that is very cool that is all part of

625
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:34,848
So sweet

626
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:35,872
Okay

627
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,944
Moving into cool gadgets that you may or may not want to buy

628
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,712
Abood

629
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:42,272
Has a new smart home security device

630
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:43,808
Called iota

631
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:45,344
And this is

632
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:46,624
Edible mix

633
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,904
A really compelling

634
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,184
Sensor

635
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,720
The sensor and hub kit

636
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:51,488
4

637
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:52,256
DIY

638
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:53,280
Home Security

639
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:55,072
This is a

640
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:57,120
You know what the closest thing I can think of is kind of like a

641
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,912
It's got a camera and it is

642
00:21:59,168 --> 00:21:59,936
Github sensors

643
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:01,984
You can add other Abode sensors to this

644
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:03,776
It comes with optional

645
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:05,568
Cellular backup and

646
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,848
Connection plan

647
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:07,616
So

648
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:10,432
Security device is to

649
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:11,200
259

650
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:12,480
Mexican

651
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:16,064
Black Friday pricing if you want to put it with a

652
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,368
Connectivity plan that's going to be

653
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,392
309

654
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:21,184
That's your 4G connect

655
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,720
Searching for backup and that includes

656
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,512
Yes

657
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:25,280
For one year

658
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:30,400
The cool thing about the Iota is it's going to have

659
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:31,424
Sea waves

660
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,960
Zigbee connectivity

661
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:34,496
Camera that's 1080p

662
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:35,776
And

663
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:39,104
Again integrated backup with 6 hours of battery life

664
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,128
If you want it

665
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:42,944
I mean their stuff is their original dear is

666
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:44,480
And this will also can

667
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:45,504
Next back to their original

668
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,272
Kirra swell

669
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,808
It is very much like

670
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:49,600
The canary I think which is what I have

671
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:50,624
Is part of the

672
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,416
Yeah this whole security

673
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,952
Like I feel like we are

674
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:55,744
I'm surprised we haven't gone further

675
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,280
Better yet but there's been like

676
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:59,328
Security has often been thought of

677
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,352
I need a sensor

678
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:02,656
This is open is closed but

679
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:04,192
Comedies like Piper

680
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:05,728
Troll

681
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:07,776
Sucked into

682
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:09,056
Walmart.com

683
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:11,360
Canary and now this our

684
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:13,408
Can I get a little bit at a different way they're like

685
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:15,712
Pictures one or two devices you put around your house

686
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,504
Activity sensors

687
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,808
Camera and they like listen for Stuff

688
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:20,576
It's different

689
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:22,368
And it's wrong and then let you know

690
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:25,952
And that also included there as the echo

691
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:26,976
Guard

692
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:29,792
Vanguard versus can I listen for breaking glass and such

693
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:31,328
I forgot about that yes

694
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:34,400
Which if you have an echo it's going to get that but no extra

695
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:35,424
So

696
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,448
And I think a smart

697
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,984
I think that's a better way to

698
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:39,520
So that's just

699
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:41,568
So that's out there if you're into that

700
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:45,664
And you want a different type of home security or if you got a boat stuff and you want

701
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,944
The camera functionality

702
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:47,712
Answer

703
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,760
Okay other things that are out

704
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:50,784
That we care about

705
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:53,856
Kevin a new smart display

706
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:57,440
It is a

707
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,976
Yes Google Assistant

708
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:00,768
Built-in so it is a

709
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,560
Smart display similar to the

710
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,864
JBL and Villanova once that

711
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,888
I've been out for

712
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,936
Couple months we both have the

713
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:08,704
Lenovo

714
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:11,008
And this is from LG

715
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:17,152
It's the xboom AI thinq you smart display how much longer they can make that name I

716
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:18,176
Don't know but

717
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:23,552
It's very similar to the existing ones in the market so assistant is built it and it's got a built-in

718
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:25,088
Camera for video calls which

719
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:28,160
They also comfortable Google home hub is not headache

720
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,184
Russell

721
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,720
Just worth a mention as a difference

722
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:36,096
Chromecast built-in it's got an HD touchscreen Bluetooth streaming support I think the

723
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:38,656
Big thing here for LG

724
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:42,240
Stephanie not design it kind of looks like a tissue box on its side to me but

725
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:43,520
That's beside the point

726
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:45,056
Pictures of two big speakers

727
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:47,616
With Meridian Audio zedvance

728
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:48,640
Technology so

729
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:52,224
Probably a better speaker than some of the other ones that are on

730
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,296
On the market it's normally prices brand new

731
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:59,648
29999 for an 8in display in those speakers

732
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:00,416
However

733
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:03,488
Since they just launched it they've got a promotional price of 199

734
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:06,560
So that's where the Boom

735
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:07,584
Comes in I'm guessing

736
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:09,120
The High Castle

737
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:11,424
Cuz I'm telling you it's a tissue box on its side

738
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:12,960
Piano speakers

739
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:14,496
They're not the fanciest design

740
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,312
The bamboo backing

741
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,920
I think I like mine more than you like

742
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:24,736
You do love yours I mean I like that

743
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,528
I love my

744
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:28,576
Sister watches TV on it all day long

745
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:31,392
Kevin's going to be in Byron

746
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:32,416
That's my

747
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:33,184
Prediction

748
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:34,464
All right

749
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,232

Scott

Play Kevin and Stacy this is Scott from

781
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:38,976
Cincinnati

782
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:40,768
I am interested in getting

783
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:41,792
My daughters

784
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:43,584
Started in home

785
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:47,424
One has an apartment one has a condo and was looking for the best

786
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:48,704
To get them started

787
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:51,264
They're not programmers are do-it-yourselfers

788
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,544
I just want something that they can

789
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,824
Shut up and

790
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,104
Basically forgot about

791
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:57,408
We have a lot of Apple equipment

792
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,432
But I'm

793
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,200
Insurance that

794
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:00,736
That's for The Voice automation they would

795
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:01,504
Caesar phone

796
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,272
Tablet

797
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,552
And they don't always have those

798
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:06,112
Listed in your ID

799
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:07,904
What would be a good

800
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:10,720
System or young people in their first

801
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:11,744
Apartment or condo

802
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:13,280
Thanks for your help

803
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:15,072
Looking forward to hearing your ass

804
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,376
Oh Scott you are a good dad

805
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:20,448
And I don't know how much money you want to spend so where

806
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:23,520
We're going to go all the way in

807
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:26,592
We really could okay the first thing that we think

808
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:30,688
You should buy regardless of what kind of digital assistant you might have for your child

809
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:31,712
Or children rather

810
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:32,480
Is

811
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:33,504
A canary

812
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,528
We just talk about

813
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:37,856
Despite it is a really awesome security system is

814
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:40,160
It's great for renters you just pop it in there you could have

815
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:41,696
The camera facing the front door

816
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:47,072
The cool thing is it not only has the camera it has all these sensors that

817
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:48,352
I can tell you what's going on

818
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:49,120
House even

819
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:50,400
When they're not there

820
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:52,448
And so you can see like oh

821
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,728
There's a weird noises

822
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:55,776
Maybe it's not a Robert

823
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:57,056
Maybe it's your dog going

824
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:58,592
I don't know but you'll know about it

825
00:27:58,848 --> 00:27:59,872
Which is kind of nice

826
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:00,896
And it is

827
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:02,432
The canary right now how much is

828
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:06,528
So now is the time to get a canary because they are

829
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:07,296
Free

830
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:09,344
With a membership

831
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:15,744
Yep and I should tell you that I do pay for a membership on my canary Goodwin or is it

832
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,304
All of them

833
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,096
Wow

834
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:21,376
All of them

835
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:24,448
So I have the $170 all in one

836
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:26,752
That's the camera and the climate monitor that you are

837
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:31,360
Alerting to but they do have just a regular camera only without the sensors 99

838
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:32,384
Endoflex

839
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,688
Is 199 that's an indoor outdoor

840
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:37,248
They probably don't need a secondary camera but if they do

841
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:40,320
So right now they're all free with the membership

842
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:41,344
Holy cow

843
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,392
Go get to one for each of your daughter

844
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:46,208
Okay did you have reduced prices if you don't want to

845
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:48,000
Hey you know the service fee and

846
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:49,792
Salon so I think they're all

847
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:54,144
$50 the all-in-one is $50 off the view is just the camera that's $50 off

848
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,680
Endoflex is $30

849
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:58,496
And you pay for the subscription and you find it worthwhile

850
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:05,152
I do although most of the alerts motion detection and the snapshots of what's going on my house are my dog running around

851
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:08,736
I'll be in class and my Apple watch will buzz in the middle fast

852
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:10,272
There is normally around the house

853
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:11,040
And

854
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:12,320
In case you're wondering

855
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:13,088
The

856
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:14,368
Terry has home kits

857
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:16,416
But it also has

858
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:18,208
Limited Google in Amazon

859
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,512
So what it does is it can tell you like

860
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:22,560
The temperature but right now it doesn't give you

861
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:24,096
Visual displays for

862
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,656
However Canary says that

863
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:27,424
Basically

864
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,192
They're working on

865
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:31,264
They are talking to Google and

866
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,544
Amazon about

867
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,568
Deeper integration

868
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,592
Mary

869
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:36,640
But for now they support

870
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:39,968
Mattamy on the Echo Show and spot for displays

871
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:40,992
And Google Assistant

872
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:41,760
Google home

873
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,296
But not with the display

874
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,088
There you go

875
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,880
So that'll keep the daughters

876
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:47,648
Safer

877
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:49,184
What can I do for

878
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,976
I don't know seeing in the dark

879
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:52,512
Seeing in the dark

880
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:53,280
I like that

881
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:54,560
Lady

882
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:55,840
We decided that

883
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:56,864
We didn't want to

884
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,144
Send you down the Hub

885
00:29:58,912 --> 00:29:59,424
So

886
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,216
We are going to recommend you by the

887
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:02,752
Tp-link

888
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:04,288
Casa that's Casa with a k

889
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,080
Smart Wi-Fi

890
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:07,360
LED bulbs

891
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:08,896
I am going with

892
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:11,200
I kind of want colors for them because they're

893
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:12,224
Post-college

894
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,808
Just having some colors is kind of nice but if you just want to if you want to get to

895
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:16,832
Japan CD

896
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:18,624
Dimmable are tunable White

897
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:20,160
Range from about

898
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:24,512
$20 to about $30 depending on if you want dimmable or tunable White

899
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:25,536
So

900
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:27,072
Those are

901
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,608
They're good lights

902
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:32,448
They work with Google Assistant they work with Madam a don't work with homekit

903
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,472
So

904
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:35,776
Keep that in mind a couple bulbs there

905
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:37,824
In their lives or in their fixtures

906
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,616
Define the downside is

907
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:44,224
They will have to leave their light switches on all the time and if the power goes out

908
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,760
In their homes then

909
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:46,528
Yeah the lights

910
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:48,320
Lizard like the downsides

911
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:51,392
If they have homekit

912
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,440
Probably would

913
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:54,720
Say maybe the life

914
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:55,488
Text bulbs

915
00:30:56,768 --> 00:31:00,096
Yeah but they're super expensive soap

916
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:02,656
Yes indeed so there you go and then we also

917
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:03,936
It'd be nice and

918
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,496
For them to be able to connect there

919
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:07,776
Devices

920
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:08,544
2

921
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,080
But we haven't actually talked about it

922
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:12,384
Mitchell sister

923
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:13,920
I don't recommend Siri

924
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:16,480
You're fine with that

925
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:20,064
So I would go with either of Google assistant or madam

926
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:24,672
I would recommend on the cheaper end with a display the Google home hub

927
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:26,464
That is the brand new

928
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:30,304
Tom Hudson Google branded smart display

929
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,608
Google branded smart display right now it is

930
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:33,632
$99

931
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:34,400
Black Friday

932
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:35,424
Normally it's about a hunter

933
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:36,448
$50

934
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:42,848
So that's one option the other option is going with the Madam a universe and in that case you

935
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:44,640
Who would get probably an echo.

936
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:48,736
Unless you wanted to go all fancy and get an Echo Show with this player and Echo spot

937
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:50,528
What's the display I would just do it.

938
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:51,296
Honestly

939
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:54,624
Yeah unless they're going to listen to music then maybe get

940
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,648
The full-sized Echo

941
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:57,696
There you go with the second gen II

942
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,000
Which is very nice so

943
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:02,304
Those two and now that you've got those

944
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:04,096
Bunch of picture ecosystem

945
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,120
How do you say

946
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:06,912
Give them away to make their television

947
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:09,984
Smart because they can build these routines around stuff like

948
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,008
Movie time

949
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:12,032
Impress their friends

950
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:12,800
Lights dimming

951
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,592
TV turns on to Netflix

952
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:17,408
So for that you're either going to go with a Chromecast.

953
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:18,176
Like 35

954
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:20,992
If you're in the Google world or an Amazon fire

955
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:22,016
TV stick

956
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:23,296
Anime inside

957
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:25,344
That's about 25 bucks so

958
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,624
But that in and you should be able

959
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,928
Control your television using those options

960
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:30,464
If you wanted retained

961
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,488
Neutrality

962
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:33,280
I have a $99 Logitech

963
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:36,352
Harmony home hub

964
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:37,632
And that also

965
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:38,656
Covers things like

966
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:39,680
Speakers

967
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:40,704
If they have external

968
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,472
Speaker smatswich

969
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:45,056
So it's like it's on the basics and it's not terribly

970
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:48,640
It is not you got television lighting security

971
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:49,920
And a digital assistant

972
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:52,224
Which you know and if you want to throw in some spots

973
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:52,992
Spark plugs

974
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,272
They range from

975
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:59,136
Ridiculously cheap like right now for Black Friday Amazon has their smart plug for like

976
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:00,416
Like five bucks extra with

977
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:01,184
If you buy a.

978
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,464
Warren Echo thing

979
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:07,328
Otherwise it's $25 and for any Google related smart plug

980
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:09,376
You can go with WeMo or the tp-link

981
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:10,400
Casa Sol

982
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:11,424
That get you started

983
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,984
And hopefully your daughters will open those

984
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:14,752
Love them

985
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:16,288
And feel safe secure

986
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:17,056
And

987
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:19,360
And they they can't even communicate with each other

988
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:22,944
Using the smart speakers because there's calling built-in a boat that

989
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,248
Yes unless you get one the anime version

990
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,528
The other the Google version

991
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:28,320
...

992
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:30,368
So don't do that don't do that

993
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:32,672
Just get your whole family sucked in on one device

994
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,768
All right and all of those can move with them and their systems that

995
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:37,792
Ingrosso

996
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:39,072
That's

997
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:41,120
Apples for long time to come

998
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:42,144
If they want

999
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:42,912
All right

1000
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:45,984
That concludes this portion of the show

1001
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,032
And if you stay tuned you're going to hear about

1002
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:48,800
I will

1003
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:50,592
Printers with malware

1004
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:51,360
And

1005
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:52,384
Diabetes

1006
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,944
How The Internet of Things is changing

1007
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,248
Care for diabetes and also

1008
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:59,552
Why security is becoming so

1009
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:00,576
In medical

1010
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:01,344
All devices

1011
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,160
So stay tuned for all of this and we'll see you next week

1012
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:12,096
Hey everybody we're taking a break from The Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor this week

1013
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:13,120
Fender and I have

1014
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:14,400
Alex Gallant Whois

1015
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:16,960
Chief security researcher at bitdefender

1016
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:17,984
You're just talk to us

1017
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,264
About printers

1018
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:20,288
Alex

1019
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:22,336
Statistics from about 2000

1020
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:24,896
Defender box units running in North America show that

1021
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:26,432
Half of iot Gadget

1022
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:27,968
Identified as

1023
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:29,504
Had a weak password

1024
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,808
This could indicate that owners never bothered

1025
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:33,088
Factory access

1026
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:35,136
Or they just chose a really bad

1027
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:36,416
But really

1028
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:42,048
How much damage could a printer do

1029
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:44,352
Access

1030
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:20,448
Wow

1031
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:21,984
So it sounds like someone

1032
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:22,752
Could use this printer

1033
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:24,800
Privacy how could that have

1034
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:12,416
This is why we're actually

1035
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:20,096
Unsecured

1036
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:25,728
You should probably get

1037
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:31,872
Scary so what can I use or do if they discover that

1038
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:33,664
Best and want to secure their printer

1039
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:38,016
First of all

1040
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:46,976
Especially

1041
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:55,168
Make sure.

1042
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:59,520
Awesome so where can I go to find out more about bitdefender

1043
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:13,856
Welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast

1044
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:14,624
This is your house

1045
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,904
Stacey Higginbotham

1046
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,696
And today's guest is Mike

1047
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:18,464
Nelson

1048
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,000
How are you doing

1049
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:21,536
Hey Stacy I'm great

1050
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:22,560
Thank you thanks for having me

1051
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:25,376
I'm super glad you're going to be on the show

1052
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:28,448
Because you have a job

1053
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,216
Will probably

1054
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:32,032
Touch on a little bit

1055
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:33,824
What is a talk about using

1056
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:34,848
Two devices

1057
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:36,896
Which

1058
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:40,736
It feels like a really big opportunity

1059
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:45,088
Talk to us first a little bit about your history

1060
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,112
With a disease

1061
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:47,648
Absolutely I'm excited

1062
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:49,952
Discussion with CIA I was like nah

1063
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:52,256
With type 1 diabetes at the age of

1064
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:53,024
16

1065
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,304
So I've had it for

1066
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,840
Coming on 24 years

1067
00:37:56,096 --> 00:38:00,192
And it's been amazing to see the evolution of treatment I mean what I was diagnosed

1068
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:01,984
I had to poke my finger and weights

1069
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,264
45 seconds

1070
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,312
To get a glucose reading that I have

1071
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:06,336
How to take a shot

1072
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:08,128
Insulin about 45 minutes

1073
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:10,176
Before I ate the lobby on set

1074
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:11,712
And today

1075
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:14,528
You compare that to the technology and the benefits of

1076
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:16,064
Evolution that's happened

1077
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,088
Today I

1078
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:21,184
Get a glucose reading from a sensor that sits on my arm every 5 minutes

1079
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:27,072
High insulin

1080
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:28,096
Also this thing

1081
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:32,704
Dramatic improvements in the info and then I can take a shot right before I have to leave

1082
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,008
And the insulin gets into my system and

1083
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:37,568
Becomes active right away so just a dramatic

1084
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:39,360
Change org last 24 years

1085
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:43,712
And the technology is doing a lot of things to make the management of diabetes

1086
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:44,736
Much easier

1087
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:45,760
Awesome in

1088
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:48,064
For your parents when you are 16

1089
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:50,880
Imagine that's a really overwhelming

1090
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:53,440
Like oh you got it

1091
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:54,208
Be responsive

1092
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,744
For the 16 year old boy

1093
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:57,280
Maybe amazing

1094
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:59,840
That's a lot. So what kind of tracking

1095
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:00,864
Was in place

1096
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:01,632
What was your life

1097
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:03,936
It really wasn't for my parents

1098
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:04,704
Terrifying

1099
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,008
I think that a remarkable job

1100
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:08,544
Responsible

1101
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:11,360
Stay on top of my blood sugar

1102
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:18,016
You're not really responsible but you're getting into that age

1103
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,296
Encourage me to

1104
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,576
Weather I was playing sports

1105
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:23,648
Make sure I check my blood sugar still there if I was

1106
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:29,024
Sleepover at my friend's house to make sure I check my blood sugar before I went to bed and making sure that wasn't dropped

1107
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,560
But the truth is they had

1108
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:32,352
No way of knowing and

1109
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:33,632
The technology is such

1110
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:34,912
Today where

1111
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:36,704
You know I travel to work

1112
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,728
Regularly

1113
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:39,264
And I wear this

1114
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:45,664
Continuous glucose monitor that has a Bluetooth connection to my mobile device Linux

1115
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:48,736
Cloud and I can share my what's

1116
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:49,760
Sugar levels with

1117
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:52,064
My wife so what I'm traveling with my blood sugar

1118
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,600
Drop some middle of the night

1119
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:54,880
She'll get him noticed

1120
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:55,904
Call the hotel

1121
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:56,672
Help me get

1122
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:57,696
The attention that I need

1123
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:58,720
The Peace of Mind

1124
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:01,792
It comes from that connectivity has been just like janky

1125
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:04,352
All right and now

1126
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:06,144
As a parent unfortunately

1127
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:08,448
You have a lot more experience nausea

1128
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:09,472
I just personally but

1129
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:10,240
With your daughter

1130
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:12,032
She is also been diagnosed with

1131
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:13,312
Type wooden actually

1132
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:14,848
Before we get to this we should talk to

1133
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:15,872
Skip a little bit about

1134
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:16,896
Type 1 vs Type

1135
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:17,664
Type 2 diabetes

1136
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:19,456
Yeso type 1

1137
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:20,224
Pretty easy

1138
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:24,576
Type 1 is a disease where the pancreas actually completely stops working

1139
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:25,856
It's an autoimmune

1140
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:28,928
Disease that's caused by your body attacking the pancreas

1141
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:29,952
Your body just stopped

1142
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:31,488
Producing insulin completely

1143
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,792
Type 2 is typically triggered by

1144
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:37,120
Whether it's obesity or women during pregnancy

1145
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:39,168
But it's where the pancreas

1146
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:40,192
What's effective

1147
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:41,472
And there are oral meds

1148
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:43,008
We taking

1149
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:46,848
Treat that whereas with type 1 insulin injections

1150
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:47,872
Are required

1151
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:50,944
The pancreas

1152
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:55,296
Completely stops working because the body attacks it whereas with type 2 it's just

1153
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:58,624
The pancreas can't keep up with the needs that your body has

1154
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:03,232
Okay and when there's a problem like when there's too little sugar or too much

1155
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:06,048
Can really injure yourself in both case

1156
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,864
Fall unconscious and

1157
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:09,632
Yes

1158
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:11,680
If you were to take too much insulin what happens if

1159
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:18,336
Please let me know some of your listeners may have felt a big workout you get a little bit light-headed a little

1160
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:20,896
That's typically symptoms of low blood sugar

1161
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:24,736
And your body does a really good job naturally regulated

1162
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:27,296
Because your pancreas only releases

1163
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:28,576
As much in Salinas

1164
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:30,368
But with diabetes

1165
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:31,904
You have to act as your own thing

1166
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,184
What type 1 diabetes

1167
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,232
And so you have to know how much insulin

1168
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:37,536
Put into your system so if you put in too much

1169
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:39,072
And then you don't eat enough.

1170
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:42,400
Cover the amount of insulin that you've taken it could be catastrophic

1171
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:44,960
It can put you into what's called a diabetic

1172
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:47,008
Tacoma where you lose consciousness

1173
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:48,544
It could become very damaging

1174
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,895
Okay so just not till like belabor the point here but this is something that

1175
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:54,175
Is really

1176
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:55,455
Tough to manage

1177
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:56,479
It requires

1178
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:58,527
Paying attention to a lot of

1179
00:41:58,783 --> 00:41:59,295
Different Factor

1180
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:00,319
And

1181
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:02,879
Consequences are pretty dire so

1182
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:03,903
Your daughter

1183
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:04,671
She is

1184
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:05,439
4

1185
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:07,231
Yes to turn 4 this year

1186
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:08,255
And renamed

1187
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:09,023
Olivia

1188
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:10,047
She is just

1189
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:11,583
The sweetest little girl

1190
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:14,911
Last year's a little over a year ago she was

1191
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:16,447
3 I was out of work

1192
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:17,215
Scrapping

1193
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:18,495
I got a call from my wife

1194
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:24,127
15 minutes

1195
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:24,895
What are the signs

1196
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:25,919
Type 1 diabetes

1197
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:27,711
Did you try to actually your body's natural

1198
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:28,735
Responses to try

1199
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:30,783
Watch the sugars out of your system

1200
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:34,111
So you get really thirsty and try to consume a lot of water to try to

1201
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:38,207
Disperse the sugars that she was having that symptom in my wife called and said

1202
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:40,767
Yes I took him to the doctor in my heart

1203
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:42,559
Knowing what

1204
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:45,375
The Simpsons aren't you know I hope for the best but

1205
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:49,727
Probably the worst

1206
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:50,495
4 blood sugar

1207
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:54,335
I was really high and so we kind of self-diagnose training took her into

1208
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:55,871
The doctor and they confirmed that

1209
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:57,663
She was a type 1 diabetic

1210
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:59,967
And so what does that mean

1211
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:00,735
For a child

1212
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:01,759
What does that mean you have to

1213
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:02,783
Just start doing

1214
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:04,319
Yasso

1215
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:06,367
Diabetics require insulin

1216
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:07,903
Before every meal

1217
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:09,439
Olivia and myself

1218
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:11,487
Take the right amount of insulin discovered

1219
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:13,023
Food that we're going to eat

1220
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:14,303
And so my

1221
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:15,583
Sweet little four-year-old

1222
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:21,215
We started by doing a finger poke and she's now emerging is now using connected technology so she no longer has

1223
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:22,495
Fingerpoke switches

1224
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:23,519
Been amazing

1225
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:29,919
But we look at her blood sugar and see where she is and based on the readings that week at we will administer a certain amount of

1226
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:32,991
Going to try to keep her blood sugar in the right range

1227
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:33,759
Cancel

1228
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:35,039
We do that and then it's

1229
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:36,319
Continuous monitoring

1230
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:38,111
She goes to school

1231
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:42,207
Season preschool and so when she goes to school we send her a little meter with her

1232
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:47,071
So that we at all times have connections we know what her blood sugar is at all times

1233
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:48,351
A friend's house

1234
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:51,423
When he goes to tumbling we send her little meter with her

1235
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:53,727
And it gives us the Peace of Mind

1236
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:55,007
Shandong time

1237
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:56,799
What her blood sugar is and so

1238
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:58,079
Still outside from the

1239
00:43:58,335 --> 00:44:00,383
Insulin injections and

1240
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:02,943
That it really is a disease that you just have to monitor

1241
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:07,295
And you have to pay attention to and do the right things to keep your blood sugar in the right range

1242
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:10,879
Okay in Fright now there are lots of options out there I know that

1243
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:11,903
They're definitely

1244
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:13,695
Connected options out there that

1245
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:15,743
Let you monitor your own

1246
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:16,511
Or someone else

1247
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:17,279
Is blood sugar

1248
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:18,047
Surely not

1249
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:18,815
Basically

1250
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:20,607
And then there is a whole subset

1251
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:21,631
Parents

1252
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:22,399
Some people out there

1253
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:25,727
Together their own devices to do this

1254
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:28,031
Talk to us about the options that are out there

1255
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:28,799
What kind

1256
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:30,335
Factors you think about is

1257
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:33,407
Yeah so you don't from me it's really just

1258
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:35,455
Knowing that all times when her sugar is

1259
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:36,223
And

1260
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:38,783
The fact that I could put my phone down right now Stacey

1261
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:41,343
And pull up and see where her blood sugar is

1262
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:42,111
Is

1263
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:43,391
Dutch I can't tell you

1264
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:44,927
Peace of mind that I can't visit

1265
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:46,719
I didn't have that she goes

1266
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:49,535
Tumbling if she goes to a friend's house or she goes to

1267
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:52,607
Glucose reaction and she goes low

1268
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:55,679
Jenna Bentley could pass out and nobody would know what's going on

1269
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:57,471
And so having that

1270
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:58,751
Data in front of us

1271
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:03,871
The track it at all times and it's not just there but it my phone will start beeping at me

1272
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:05,663
If your blood sugar starts dropping

1273
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:08,991
How to quickly and so it's almost a preventative way to

1274
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:09,759
Channing Frye

1275
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:10,783
Extract

1276
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:14,367
Continuous glucose monitors are a great

1277
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:15,135
Innovation

1278
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:18,207
Aside from glucose monitors and I think that's the most

1279
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:19,743
Exciting innovation

1280
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:23,583
But I've seen them last 20 years the next is really what's happening with

1281
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:24,863
Insulin pumps right now

1282
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:26,655
Insulin pumps have been

1283
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:33,055
You wearing like a pager on your belt and you program the amount of insulin that you need and it administers it through it

1284
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:35,871
Tube disconnected in your belly at all times

1285
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:36,639
And

1286
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:38,943
Insulin pump

1287
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:41,759
But insulin pumps now are starting to develop

1288
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:43,551
Where

1289
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:45,087
They have the capability

1290
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:47,135
When your blood sugar starts to go up

1291
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:49,183
The insulin pump is smart enough to

1292
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:51,231
Send a text that and start to

1293
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:53,023
Administer insulin

1294
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:53,791
True

1295
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:56,095
A connection that has with the glucose monitor

1296
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:56,863
So

1297
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:00,959
Glucose monitor in addition to sending the reading to my phone

1298
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:01,983
It also send it

1299
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:02,751
The pump

1300
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:03,775
And the pump

1301
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:07,103
Reads that and then makes a decision based on the levels

1302
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:07,871
And can help you

1303
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:08,639
Self correct

1304
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:11,967
To keep you in the right range and it's just amazing technology

1305
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:12,991
And you know

1306
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:13,759
Benefits

1307
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:17,855
Open up the madness that disease with those types of technology is just

1308
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:18,879
Awesome

1309
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:21,951
It's probably comforting to have this level of data

1310
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:22,719
Available to you

1311
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:23,487
You on your phone

1312
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:25,535
Are there things that you

1313
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:27,071
Are concerned about Earth

1314
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:28,095
You're kind of like

1315
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:30,399
Who did this

1316
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:31,423
Yeah that's a great question

1317
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:35,263
Everytime I pull up my phone and I look at is glucose reading

1318
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:36,543
In the back of my head

1319
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:37,311
Because of what I do

1320
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:38,591
Professionally I think

1321
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:40,639
Integrity

1322
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:41,919
Is that accurate

1323
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:45,247
Inaccurate Stacy as if

1324
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:47,039
Glucose reading

1325
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:48,831
Comes to my phone and it says

1326
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:49,599
300

1327
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:50,367
50

1328
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:53,439
Their blood sugar is really a hundred and I administer

1329
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:55,487
Her insulin based on that reading

1330
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:56,255
That event

1331
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:57,279
Can be catastrophic

1332
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:00,351
Utilizing glucose monitor

1333
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:01,375
That's my boy

1334
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:03,167
Integrity

1335
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:03,935
Data

1336
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:06,495
And making sure that the readings that I'm getting

1337
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:08,287
Valid and so that when I

1338
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:10,847
Creeper and give her the insulin it's going to be the right

1339
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:13,151
Right so that data doesn't get up

1340
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:13,919
Go to the cloud and then

1341
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:15,199
And somehow get sent to the wrong

1342
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:15,967
Play Store

1343
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:18,271
Your data is mixed up or anything like that

1344
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:20,063
Yeah or a man-in-the-middle attack

1345
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:24,671
Of course somebody manipulates the data and you know it ends up with an incorrect value

1346
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:27,487
Cast true crime stories I can see these now

1347
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:29,279
Okay

1348
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:32,095
And I can't even really rely on my

1349
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:35,167
Home automation systems to work in concert like

1350
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:37,727
That's so I still have problems making sure that when I

1351
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:38,751
Leave my house

1352
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:40,287
Lights actually turn on

1353
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:41,567
Like they're supposed to after 7

1354
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:44,127
So the idea of relying

1355
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:45,407
Something for

1356
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:47,455
Your safety and your daughter say

1357
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:48,479
Especially

1358
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:49,759
That feels very fraught

1359
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:50,783
So

1360
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:52,063
How do you evaluate

1361
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:53,599
Disease are connected Prada

1362
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:56,927
Yours connected to the internet or do they have a cloud connection

1363
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:58,207
They have a clock next

1364
00:47:58,463 --> 00:48:00,511
Bluetooth

1365
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:02,815
Amanda wifi-connected

1366
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:06,399
Okay so you are the head of iot security attack

1367
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:07,167
Company called digits

1368
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:08,959
So it's not like you're

1369
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:14,079
Not like your normal person running through life

1370
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:16,639
How do you evaluate the

1371
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:17,663
Security of the state

1372
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:19,455
Yeah you know

1373
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:22,783
Consider myself a unique consumer in that regard where

1374
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:27,135
I don't think most consumers when you go and buy these devices are thinking about

1375
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:28,927
The security posture of them

1376
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:31,999
And if they're vulnerable to malware or man

1377
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:37,887
Getting in and taking control of the device

1378
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:39,423
Have to worry about that

1379
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:41,983
I'll tell you the story I mean I went in

1380
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:43,519
When my daughter was diagnosed

1381
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:44,799
They require diabetics

1382
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:47,103
Go to the hospital and they get the blood sugar under

1383
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:50,431
Education

1384
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:54,015
Medical devices

1385
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:55,295
Some of which I

1386
00:48:55,551 --> 00:49:00,415
Had Direct knowledge of Canada security posturing what they're doing and you know it occurred to me how

1387
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:01,183
Personal

1388
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:05,279
Spices can become for consumers very rapidly

1389
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:06,303
And

1390
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:08,607
You know I've been working to solve these challenges

1391
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:09,375
4 years

1392
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:10,399
In my profession

1393
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:11,423
It all

1394
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:12,191
Different vertical

1395
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:14,495
And all the sudden I was hit with this

1396
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:17,055
It's very personal dilemma

1397
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:18,335
Mike Ashley

1398
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:21,151
What if something were to happen to this device while my daughter

1399
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:24,479
Let's get control of that infusion pump

1400
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:27,295
Edward to manipulate the amount of

1401
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:29,087
Trucks that is being administered

1402
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:31,903
Those things in the results of those kitty cats

1403
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:34,719
So as a consumer I tried to take a deep breath

1404
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:38,047
And say I don't believe that their malicious actors in This Hospital

1405
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:39,583
Daughter

1406
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:43,167
And even though I know the security vulnerabilities in this device

1407
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:46,495
Had to take a deep breath and say you know I don't think the rest

1408
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:48,799
Because of a lot of

1409
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:49,567
Factors

1410
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:50,591
But those risks

1411
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:51,871
Depending on

1412
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:53,151
This circumstance

1413
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:53,919
Risks

1414
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:57,503
Can be real and so it's consumers I think education and under

1415
00:49:57,759 --> 00:50:00,063
10 things that they can do with personal device

1416
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:01,855
Good password crack

1417
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:03,903
Making sure that

1418
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:04,671
Hardcore

1419
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:05,695
Credentials

1420
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:08,511
Part of devices are you know those types of things

1421
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:10,303
I think education is important

1422
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:15,167
But ultimately Stacy I really think that the furred needs to be on the manufacturer

1423
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:16,703
I don't think when

1424
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:19,775
You are to take your kid to a hospital or what I took Olivia

1425
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:22,591
I don't think I should have to ask hey is the device

1426
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:23,615
Connecting two

1427
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:26,175
That's being used to treat her is that at

1428
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:26,943
Secure device

1429
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:29,503
What doctors would look at you like you're crazy

1430
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:31,551
Yeah most doctors wouldn't even be able to know

1431
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:33,343
I mean maybe like

1432
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:35,647
Yeah there's no way they would install

1433
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:38,719
I believe it's consumers we have the right to assume

1434
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:40,255
Security and safety

1435
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:41,535
And if that

1436
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:43,839
Security and safety isn't better than manufacturer

1437
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:45,631
Just need to act responsibly

1438
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:48,191
To get into a place where they are secure and safe

1439
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:52,287
Sure know let's talk about is a consumer not just in the

1440
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:54,079
Hospital but when purchasing

1441
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:55,871
Insulin pumps

1442
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:57,151
And glucose monitors

1443
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:59,199
Continuous glucose monitors for your daughter

1444
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:00,223
Did you

1445
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:00,991
1

1446
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:02,783
Were there lots of options I mean

1447
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:05,855
Prescription device so unlike Could you actually

1448
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:06,623
Legitimately

1449
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:08,671
Security

1450
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:09,695
Yeah

1451
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:11,487
You can I don't think most consumers

1452
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:14,047
Can I mean you can call the company and you could ask

1453
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:16,607
And they could tell you about the different types

1454
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:17,375
Communication

1455
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:18,911
Protocols in what they're doing

1456
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:25,055
Data is being encrypted

1457
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:27,615
You have to get the right person on the phone on the other end

1458
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:30,175
Yes

1459
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:34,015
Cuz I can tell you I talk to people all the time and I'll ask these questions

1460
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:34,783
And they're like

1461
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:36,575
I don't know

1462
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:41,695
It typically takes a couple phone calls to get connected to the right person

1463
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:43,743
I do believe that that's going to be

1464
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:45,279
Become more transparent

1465
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:48,351
I think that manufactures and we see this manufacturer

1466
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:52,447
Starting to disclose the things that they're doing around data encryption

1467
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:56,287
Hostler practices those are two that are really low-hanging fruit

1468
00:51:56,543 --> 00:51:59,615
But you know I think consumers need to be aware of those and

1469
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:03,199
Either go to the website to look to see if they say anything about it

1470
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:04,223
Or ask a question

1471
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:08,575
I'll tell you the Food and Drug Administration FDA

1472
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:11,391
Is getting stronger and stronger on there

1473
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:12,415
Requirements

1474
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:13,695
Connected devices

1475
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:15,999
It's because of some of the exploit for the Papas

1476
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:18,303
And so I think the FDA is

1477
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:19,583
Working really hard

1478
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:21,375
To provide assurance

1479
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:22,399
That

1480
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:27,775
I talked about that consumers should know that these devices are safe and I think the FDA is working really hard

1481
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:28,799
Figure out

1482
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:30,847
What mechanisms they can put in place

1483
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:31,615
Attest

1484
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:35,199
Send checks to make sure that the connected devices are going on in the market

1485
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:37,247
What kind of messaging

1486
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:38,271
How do you think

1487
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:39,551
Manufacturers

1488
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:40,319
Start trying

1489
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:42,111
Bay what is really complicated

1490
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:43,135
To Consumers

1491
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:45,695
Like is it like a Good Housekeeping seal if

1492
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:46,463
Approval

1493
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:47,743
Some people talk about

1494
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:50,047
Nutrition label for data security

1495
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:52,095
I really don't know it all seems kind of dumb

1496
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:53,887
Yeah it is

1497
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:56,703
Heard a lot of discussions around what

1498
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:58,751
Spam and really there's no

1499
00:52:59,007 --> 00:53:00,799
Clear I would not say that there's any

1500
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:07,199
Strong evolution

1501
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:08,479
On a medical device

1502
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:09,759
Is the stamp

1503
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:13,087
Safety that people are looking for but challenges a lot of

1504
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:14,111
Devices that work

1505
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:17,951
Approved by the FDA 5 years ago are now getting hacked and so

1506
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:20,255
I think devices that have been cleared in the last

1507
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:21,791
Couple years have a lot better

1508
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:23,583
Security protection than one

1509
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:26,399
Five or ten years ago that they still being used

1510
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:27,423
Hospital

1511
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:29,983
Okay I'm going to put my faith in the FDA

1512
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:30,751
Meanwhile

1513
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:33,055
You can put your faith in

1514
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:37,919
Globally

1515
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:43,807
And that team bear that just working on medical device security I think they're demonstrating

1516
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:46,623
Four other regulatory bodies in other countries to follow

1517
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:47,903
Excellent and

1518
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:50,463
There is really nothing more personal than

1519
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:51,487
Hearing about

1520
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:52,767
Your story or

1521
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:53,535
Water store

1522
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:56,095
Clearly people's lives at stake

1523
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:58,143
It's worth it

1524
00:53:58,399 --> 00:53:58,911
Okay

1525
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:00,447
