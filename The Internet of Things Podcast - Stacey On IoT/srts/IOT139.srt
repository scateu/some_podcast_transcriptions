Happy to giving

39
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:50,848
Thanksgiving

40
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:52,384
I think we did

41
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,408
Yes October

42
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,944
Starting November I don't even know

43
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:57,248
I'm sorry Canada

44
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:00,832
And for the rest of the world that may or may not celebrate Thanksgiving

45
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,368
I'm actually sorry to

46
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,136
Because

47
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:04,672
Who doesn't love a day where you just sitting

48
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,488
Okay

49
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,280
We

50
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,816
Are going to zoom through the news

51
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:13,120
Because there's really very little of it so far

52
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:15,936
The biggest news is

53
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:17,728
The Apple homepod

54
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,312
Which is Apple's answer to the Amazon Echo and Google home

55
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:22,592
Has been delayed

56
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,384
This is surprise you Kevin

57
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:26,688
It does surprise me it delayed

58
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:27,456
Yes it does

59
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,992
Yes it does

60
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:35,392
It's a price because they showed this off several several months ago they even had units working units for the press to listen to

61
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:37,440
Do you understand that software

62
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:40,000
One piece of it that maybe they need to work on still

63
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:42,048
Siri they certainly need to work out of my pay

64
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:48,448
Opinion and they said he'll be out by the holidays and now it's not coming out until early 2018 I don't think it's like a supplier

65
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:52,544
Supply chain issue a parts issue anything custom internal and Hardware

66
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:55,360
I guess it is software and maybe

67
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:58,432
Like I'm hoping there was still working on making Siri smarter

68
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:00,480
I was going to say I bet it's a Siri issue

69
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,272
I bet it's also

70
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:04,064
Okay so

71
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,392
Part of me that is so frustrated with apple in their smart home efforts and

72
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:08,416
Continually

73
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:10,976
Oh we're good at home kit

74
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:17,632
This announcement of homekit and then this gradual like

75
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:20,448
Roll out of services and then this retrenchment with

76
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,216
Okay

77
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,496
Maybe don't need a search chip

78
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,264
After a bunch of

79
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,032
Companies

80
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,056
Went out and did that

81
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:27,104
So that's all very frustrating

82
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,640
What I will say though

83
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:29,664
Is

84
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,712
So I didn't find this surprising

85
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:33,760
At all because Apple his

86
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,296
Consistently

87
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:38,624
Pushed forward with his incomplete version of

88
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,648
What it thinks

89
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:40,672
The smart home show

90
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,208
And

91
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:43,744
It feels to me that it

92
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,304
Not only does it not really have a Clear Vision

93
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,120
I think it's also getting stuck with its privacy

94
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:50,400
And

95
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:53,472
Kind of the way that it's segmented its

96
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:54,752
Entire ecosystem

97
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:58,336
So I think we see that with a couple things I think we see it with

98
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:00,896
You know it's decision to change out

99
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,432
Desertification chip-in make

100
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:04,224
It software authentication base

101
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,504
I think we're going to see

102
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:08,320
It with the problems with Siri we've seen so far

103
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:12,160
So I think what's Happening Here is probably apples trying really hard to

104
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,720
Figure out how to push forward in the Smart Home

105
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:17,791
The way it is historically push forward

106
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:21,375
In the mobile ecosystem and I think it's kind of realizing that it doesn't

107
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,143
Always work

108
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:24,447
And I don't disagree with anything you said

109
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:27,263
Especially at a high-level I think

110
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:33,151
The series is going to be in the homepod it's going to be the same Siri that exist today in a phone to control things and they already

111
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:34,943
So again

112
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,223
Noah

113
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,783
No argument there it's not great but

114
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:41,599
And maybe that's why they haven't they realized

115
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:44,159
Of course I realize that Siri is not

116
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:46,719
The best experience for users I have to

117
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:47,743
Thanks ad

118
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:50,559
But they realize when you put that in a

119
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,863
You're trying to conquer a new ecosystem with

120
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,399
The terrible AI witch

121
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:57,983
In some ways might need that Apple realizes that the AI is but

122
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,007
For the Smart Home

123
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:03,615
I don't know I could be I am frustrated with Apple

124
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,919
Because it kind of jerks around

125
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,967
What's the industry in Industry adoption

126
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,271
In a lot of ways a lot of people

127
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:14,367
Are holding off on the smart home to get homekit certified stuff

128
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,135
And

129
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:18,463
Right now if you're going all-in at home kit you don't have

130
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,999
Kind of a democratic

131
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:21,791
Accessible way to control your

132
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:22,559
Your home

133
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,887
You know that isn't based off the phone and I think that's

134
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,423
Really is stumbling block

135
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:33,311
See that's true I mean a lot of homekit devices obviously will work with other hugs as well and that's

136
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:38,175
That's why I don't think it's hurt the market too much but I don't disagree they move markets and

137
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,967
This is not helping in general

138
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,759
Even their partner

139
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,039
Are freshmen

140
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:45,087
I cannot tell you how many times I have

141
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:46,367
Sad

142
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,135
About that

143
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:51,999
If you were hoping to get that for the holidays

144
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,023
You can just now

145
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:55,583
Series taking the holidays off

146
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:58,399
There you go alright so we have a correction to me

147
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:00,191
Because last week

148
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,471
We got a call

149
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,775
And I feel terrible that I answered this run

150
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,567
This is why you should play with their gadgets from

151
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,591
More than a day before Easter

152
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:08,383
Bad Stacy

153
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,919
Wise

154
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,455
$20 Home Security

155
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,735
That we talked about

156
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:15,295
I said that you didn't send stuff to the cloud

157
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,087
That is because I was not

158
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:17,855
Testing it

159
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,391
At first with

160
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:21,183
Motion detection

161
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,719
I was just texting you

162
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:27,327
Playing with it as a live camera cuz I tend to play with things minimal features first and then build up

163
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,631
To all of them but when you build up

164
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:32,447
Can you add motion detection all your data is sent

165
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:34,751
The cloud so we did say that it did not send things

166
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,287
But it does

167
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,823
So that's really important to know

168
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:40,383
You can save everything to an SD card

169
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,663
That is all still true

170
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,455
And if you don't want to send anything

171
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:49,599
I think the cloud I did talk to one of the founders of the company and she said that if you don't use the motion detection

172
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:54,207
Then basically everything candy store to your device which is effectively what I was doing

173
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:59,071
It's interesting that they can't do the motion detection on device admin

174
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,607
Are they using

175
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:04,959
The cloud to do processing or the video up to the cloud in store

176
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:06,751
Now there is no storage fee for

177
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,287
So

178
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:10,079
It's actually really interesting

179
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:12,127
Company I talk to the founders

180
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:12,895
And

181
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:16,735
Sunset from a company in China so the camera Hardware is licensed

182
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:17,759
Company of China

183
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:24,159
But the software they did themselves and their whole model is these are people from Amazon their model is to

184
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:27,743
Basically build the cheapest products they can

185
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:30,047
And then Branch out and other stuff

186
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:33,375
They're like it's Amazon metal great customer service at a low low price

187
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,399
The merchants

188
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,679
Solo margins to them

189
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:36,959
Low-cost to you

190
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:41,567
But presumably this she says it's the same Hardware that's inside the nest I

191
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,591
Like really

192
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,383
And they do have

193
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,151
The money

194
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:51,295
They've said they built in the capability obviously

195
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:54,623
Store your videos so just store the motion capture

196
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,391
Videos

197
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,183
And not

198
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:04,095
Which really motion-capture isn't going to take up gigs and get to space

199
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,375
That's right you're not doing everything

200
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:06,911
But still

201
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:08,703
I was really intrigued by this cuz

202
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:13,567
You know that this is just the same gear Hardware that's inside the nest cam

203
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:15,359
When a nest cam sells for

204
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,127
Joshua

205
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:16,895
150

206
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:22,527
Ridiculous

207
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:23,551
After 1:30 I nest

208
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:26,879
Pretty astonishing

209
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:30,719
So yeah just Kim basic Nest cam two hundred bucks

210
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:31,999
So this is

211
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,535
A tenth of the price

212
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,327
Very audacious

213
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,095
Product

214
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:36,863
Very nice

215
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:37,887
Cell

216
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,423
That is our correction

217
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:40,447
But

218
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:43,007
We're going to keep talking about it because

219
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:45,311
Oh I we should have Jingle Bells

220
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:48,383
I don't have any

221
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,431
Sorry

222
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:53,247
Where's my any one of those like radio DJ

223
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,271
Sound machine

224
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,063
Need a soundboard

225
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:58,623
You're welcome

226
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:03,999
This is our Internet of Things podcast 2017

227
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,279
Holiday gift

228
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,047
Guide

229
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,583
So we

230
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:13,983
For our holiday gift guide everything on it we have tested unless we tell you otherwise we will be very

231
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:16,543
Clear because we don't want to send you

232
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,591
Home with a crummy product

233
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:25,247
We also try to do different things each year so this is why you won't see my old favorites like neutrons are Hue Lights

234
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,271
It's which we all

235
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,807
Can we talk about all the time

236
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:29,343
Play we like them

237
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:32,415
We don't have a single bulb on here traditional bow

238
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,183
We don't

239
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,463
Yeah that's a big

240
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:36,511
Departure for us

241
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,047
So

242
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,327
We

243
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,119
Have broken up into categories

244
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,143
Set wake up a smart home

245
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,167
We've got

246
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,191
Kids stuff

247
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,727
We are stocking stuffers

248
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:46,751
And we have

249
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,543
Crazy expensive

250
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,335
Yes

251
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:51,359
Because

252
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:52,639
What's not

253
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:53,407
Why not

254
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:59,295
Let's get this party started with the reason you probably listen to the show which is smart home stuff

255
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,855
My first pick is

256
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:03,391
The wyze cam

257
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,439
Which is wyze

258
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:09,791
It is $20 this is the one we just talked about

259
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:10,815
And

260
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:11,583
Gosh

261
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,607
You can actually use it as a

262
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,399
It is very small

263
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:19,263
There's a fully-functioning security camera it works really well

264
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,543
I bought one a couple

265
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,079
Weeks ago it arrived

266
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,127
Gosh

267
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,919
I feel like I could just like set this up any

268
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:28,223
And it's one of the few that you could

269
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:30,271
In-store on the MicroSD card

270
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:34,367
Yes you can store your data on the MicroSD card it will go to the cloud though

271
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,135
And

272
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,159
What else

273
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:36,927
About it

274
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:39,999
It's got everything it's got HD it's got night vision

275
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,023
It's got

276
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,047
Two-way audio

277
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,583
It's cut

278
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,607
Music detection

279
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:50,495
It's one of the few though it doesn't yet work with any of existing smart home hubs or does it

280
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:55,103
It does not work with any smart home hubs now I will say that when I talked to the founders they were like

281
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,175
Okay honestly

282
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,711
Not everybody has a hug.

283
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:03,039
So this is actually it you know cuz a lot of them would

284
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:03,807
Rick Larsen

285
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:06,367
Kevin Grayson so that's fine

286
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,159
Yeah so if you are like

287
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:14,559
What's a smart home security stuff people are all worried about her maybe are going out of town and you want to have a camera you just keep in the drawer and you just

288
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:15,839
Throw up when you know

289
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:16,863
Leaving

290
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,143
Twenty bucks wyzecam

291
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,167
Check it out

292
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:19,935
Okay

293
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,215
Speaking of cameras

294
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:24,799
We got a lot of requests for the outdoor camp

295
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,079
And

296
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,359
My favorite

297
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:31,967
Floor bang for your buck good price is the Arlo Pro Outdoor

298
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,247
Now

299
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,551
There are three versions of the Arlo camera

300
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:36,831
There is a

301
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,111
Wireless

302
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,135
Outdoor camera

303
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:44,767
Has moral batteries don't get that it's expensive compared to the pro which is what we recommend

304
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,559
And that is it

305
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:47,839
Wireless

306
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:49,119
Outdoor camera

307
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,655
It's rechargeable

308
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,191
Mikasa by a little extra

309
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,727
Sure thing if you wanted to slide it in

310
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:54,751
And in charge

311
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,079
I like this

312
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:01,151
It is again motion detection activated

313
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:03,967
You can arm it when you leave and you'll get all these notifications

314
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,247
People come in and out

315
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,783
I think it's a great product

316
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:12,159
These but you still have a rechargeable battery so there's no hard wiring so it's simple to install

317
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:15,487
I suppose use these indoors if you need to but there

318
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,791
Certainly rated to be used Outdoors as well

319
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,559
Yes

320
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:19,839
And I've had my

321
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:21,119
In those places

322
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,399
They are lovely

323
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:25,727
They do have a pro to version

324
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:30,335
It is more expensive and has a siren and that's designed act as a moor

325
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,127
Featured security system

326
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:37,759
I believe that one does 1080p video where is the one we're recommending is

327
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,295
720P

328
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:42,367
I don't really think that's a huge deal breaker by any means

329
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,647
You know

330
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,695
This is if you just want to see what

331
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,743
Exactly exactly

332
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,279
Mine actually don't

333
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:55,679
I don't have them up most of the time I throw them up when I go out of town or when I have kids on my roof then I set them up

334
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,447
On the roof so weak

335
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,471
You can keep an eye on them

336
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:00,799
I actually work with a lot of

337
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,847
What devices we went through and we thought about

338
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,383
Which cameras work with the most

339
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:10,271
Thanks The Nest also work with a lot of things but we didn't like them mostly because their Hardware

340
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,039
Tired so

341
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:11,807
You have to have an outlet

342
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:15,135
Okay moving on to the smart speaker sex

343
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:17,439
Yeah we actually have

344
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:20,767
2 in looks plain why I'll take the first one then stay so you can

345
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:21,791
Take the second one

346
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:27,679
If you're all in on Amazon's platform for a digital assistant

347
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:30,239
Or you would like a choice in the future

348
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:35,359
I wish dental assistant to use I would recommend wholeheartedly the Sonos one which is

349
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,895
Pretty much a brand new products

350
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:42,271
Obviously Sonos has been around smart speakers for a long time they pretty much pioneered multi-room audio

351
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:44,831
Wireless multi-room audio in the house and

352
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:47,647
This works with just about every music

353
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:51,999
Streaming service known to man it's ridiculous how much support it has

354
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,791
Waiters work with

355
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,839
Amazon voice services

356
00:13:56,095 --> 00:14:01,215
Today and Sonos is going to be adding Google Assistant support in 2018

357
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:04,031
So it's nice because you don't make a choice

358
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:10,687
These are $199 each the sound quality is outstanding better than any of the other Smart Homes

359
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:14,015
Speakers that I've tried which are mostly the smaller size ones like your

360
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,295
Echo dots

361
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:20,159
Google mini and so on even the regular Echo and the Google home

362
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:23,487
This is better sounding than that so for 199

363
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:28,095
Don't know if I have any Black Friday deals on this cuz it's so new of a product but you know what

364
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:30,143
I would pay full price have one for this

365
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:33,983
But if you are looking for a bull

366
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:37,055
And you maybe you're like

367
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:40,383
My other smart speaker recommendation is the Google home

368
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,943
This is great if you are all in on Google

369
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:43,967
Like me

370
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:45,503
Google file

371
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:46,527
But even a thing

372
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,831
It's also the better of the

373
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,879
You're looking at Google vs madam

374
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,951
Google is actually smarter and

375
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,231
I have

376
00:14:55,487 --> 00:15:01,631
Doubled up in my house and I'm finding that I'm using Google for more and more things like just last night I added

377
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,399
To my calendar

378
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:04,191
And it just happened it was

379
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:04,959
Awesome

380
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:08,031
You know those kind of things are starting to be

381
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,311
They just

382
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:12,127
Seamless so it's pretty cool it works

383
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:16,991
The Google home now last year we didn't recommend it because it didn't work with this many smart home devices

384
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:18,271
What does

385
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:20,319
It works with a lot of the big one

386
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,343
It doesn't work with everything

387
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:25,695
But it does work with a lot of the Philips Hue the SmartThings the wing

388
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,487
Like 72

389
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,511
Devices so

390
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:29,535
Lots of toys

391
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:32,095
And the Black Friday deals are looking like

392
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:32,863
You could get one of these

393
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:33,887
499 bucks

394
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:34,655
So

395
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:41,055
Go on in that's a good price and I waited to buy mine until I got all the decorations with the smarthome bits

396
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:45,407
So I agree we was not worth the recommendation last year but it's really good

397
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,943
Okay so

398
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,479
Google home if you like it

399
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:50,015
If you're looking for a hug though

400
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,039
Kevin

401
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:53,599
Yeah people know I have a soft spot for this hug

402
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:58,463
Because I purchased the first edition of it but now they have a second edition so I would recommend

403
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:00,767
Especially because it's on sale for the holidays

404
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,559
The wink Hub 2

405
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:04,863
Find it for about 69 bucks right now

406
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:10,751
I work so just about every device I can think of because it's got all the right radios inside it's got

407
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:13,055
Phi Phi Scott Bluetooth and Scott

408
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,847
Cindy it's got Z-Wave

409
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:15,871
So

410
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,407
I've purchased my own

411
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:23,807
Very happy with it the second generation was well worth the upgrade because there's more memory inside more storage of faster processor

412
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:26,111
There's much less lag when I say

413
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:31,231
To a Google home or some other device turn this light on it just happens quickly now so

414
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:33,279
Very very happy with the wink Hub 2

415
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:36,863
And I would say that if you know what those radios are in your interest in this

416
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,399
Can you somehow still don't have a hub

417
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:41,215
I would say do this over the Amazon Echo Plus

418
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:42,495
Cell which is

419
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,799
Advertising itself as a smart home hub but

420
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:45,567
Isn't it supposed to be

421
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:51,199
There's one more Hub / media / everything

422
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:55,807
Yeah I kind of feel funny putting this in here

423
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:56,575
But

424
00:16:56,831 --> 00:17:02,207
I have to recommend something that I bought and use everyday it's the Nvidia Shield TV

425
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:05,535
You're probably saying why is he recommending an Android TV

426
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,815
Boxwell

427
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:12,959
Couple recent one it's on sale for $150 or $107 with the actual game controller

428
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:16,543
And that way you can play Android games obviously runs Android apps

429
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:20,383
It's Android TV as well it's got Google Assistant built in

430
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:26,783
So you can use either the remote switch has a microphone or the game controller which has a microphone and speak to Google Assistant

431
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,831
At any time when using the TV

432
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:32,159
Indeed it will also be adding little microphones

433
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:34,207
That you can plug in around your house

434
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:37,535
And that will communicate to Google Assistant as well those are not out yet

435
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,071
I have not used them yet but

436
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,375
This is one reason I bought the shield TV

437
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,911
But on top of that

438
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:47,263
Recently Samsung being selling the SmartThings link

439
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,543
For $40

440
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:53,407
I actually snag one for $10 on sale I don't know what the sale prices are going to be over the holidays

441
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:55,711
But even for $40 what it is

442
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:59,551
Is a USB stick that you plug into the back of the Nvidia Shield TV

443
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:05,951
And it basically has a SmartThings software and add zigbee radio to the Nvidia Shield TV so now

444
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:07,999
Essentially turn your set-top box

445
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,023
Into

446
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:12,095
A SmartThings Hub as well so you kind of get it

447
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,375
Two-for-one special

448
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,143
Crate

449
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,935
Video streamer 4K

450
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:18,239
HDR I can handle anything

451
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:20,543
And then you get the smart home hub bits as well

452
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,311
Got it

453
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:24,383
Cities next to devices are rounding out our Smart Home

454
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,663
And that is the

455
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:28,991
Are the smart thermostat we are picking for the ecobee

456
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:29,759
4

457
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:30,783
Wishes

458
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,367
The ecobee thermostat has all the fun features you know and love and

459
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,903
Makeupplus the sensor

460
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:36,927
Plus

461
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,719
It's gotten anime inside so you

462
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:39,487
You can talk to it

463
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:43,327
Have things happen and it's only $200 on Amazon

464
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,863
Which is a pretty good price

465
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,935
And it does work with homekit as well so you don't have to

466
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:49,471
You can use it in an iOS alarm

467
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:50,239
And then

468
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:52,543
Wi-Fi mesh networks are

469
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,359
Smoking hot again this year and

470
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,431
We're torn

471
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,455
We're just going to be our

472
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:02,271
We can recommend to that's fine

473
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:03,807
All right

474
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:06,367
I will unequivocally recommend a mesh Network

475
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,903
For anyone who's going to get in to

476
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:08,927
So

477
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,207
Our two favorite

478
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,487
Chris Kevin's is

479
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:13,023
It's the Google Wi-Fi

480
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,047
And that's because

481
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:15,327
3 pack only cost

482
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:21,727
289 at full price I'm sure there will be some on sale in the coming weeks and it's just drop dead simple it works really real

483
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:24,031
Well I know some reviews said that other

484
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:26,591
Products had better Ranger better throughput but

485
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:28,383
Everybody I know and

486
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:31,199
I bought my own 3 pack everybody I know says it's

487
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:35,551
Plenty good it may not have the advanced features of some other mesh network products but

488
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,087
Again simple setup

489
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,135
Anybody can set it up and it just works

490
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:42,207
And I am going to is expensive

491
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,999
Remind me to do my Eero Plus

492
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:47,071
And this is the second generation Eros

493
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:48,095
It's got one

494
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:49,119
Main brain

495
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:53,983
Euro and then it has to beacons and beacons also double as Night Lights this will cover up

496
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:56,031
Scubbers my house just fine

497
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:57,567
And that is 399

498
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,127
Love these things

499
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:03,711
So yeah if you have a 1 to 2 bedroom home

500
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:06,527
You can probably get away with a $300 set

501
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:08,063
Supposed to $400 set

502
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:12,159
And then it also offers a lot of really good

503
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:13,695
Kind of add-on features

504
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,487
Trolls Plus

505
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:16,511
If you want to spend money

506
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:18,815
An additional $10 a month gets you

507
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:21,375
Parental safety kind of features

508
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:23,167
And a security service

509
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,751
Those are mesh Wi-Fi

510
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:32,127
So before we continue on with our gift list let's take

511
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:38,527
A moment for a word from our sponsor we are taking a break from the podcast

512
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:44,415
Message from this week sponsor sponsor is sparkcognition and I've got

513
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:49,023
Shuja was general manager of the industrial internet-of-things effort

514
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,047
To talk about

515
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,327
Sparkcognition

516
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:56,959
Respond spark ignition is an AI company and you guys are really working to help

517
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:00,287
Industrial iot companies improve their efficiency

518
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,567
And improve their

519
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:02,591
Safety

520
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:03,359
Is correct we are you

521
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:05,151
Bringing together a lot of different

522
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:06,431
Capabilities within order

523
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,199
Intelligence

00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:08,479
Data analytics app

525
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:09,247
B1

526
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:12,831
Caviar dressing use cases such as predicted failure

527
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:14,367
All catastrophic events

528
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:16,928
And also automating a lot of the prophecies

529
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:23,328
Industrial world looking at security data Within These industrial environments to make sure that nobody should ever

530
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,096
What is happening

531
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:26,656
So data analytics is a big piece of it

532
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:32,544
But we are bringing different pieces of artificial intelligence to make that analysis and make that the application

533
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,312
Tomorrow bus

534
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:34,592
Thinking tactically

535
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:38,944
Do you have an example of maybe one of your clients and how they used AI to change their

536
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,504
Business absolutely Flowserve

537
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:42,528
Which is the largest

538
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:43,808
Pump manufacturer

539
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:45,600
In the US is one of her clients

540
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:47,136
Take a predictive failure in a

541
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:48,928
Bump a few hours in advance

542
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:50,464
The applied are algorithms

543
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,000
And now they can extend

544
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:54,560
Forewarning of a pump failure by 6

545
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:57,120
Today's status fundamentally change their business

546
00:21:57,376 --> 00:22:02,496
They can sell prediction of the service which is really supercharged aftermarket business

547
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:08,128
What are some of the critical steps to ensuring a successful implementation

548
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,736
The key to successful implementation would be to think big

549
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:14,272
Strategically and act

550
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:15,296
Practically

551
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,320
What that means

552
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:22,208
Addressing the big picture problems concerning The Bold and the c-suite intend addressing the business outcomes

553
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:24,256
Building a good Roi story

554
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:27,840
AI at the end of the day is a technology it should be dyed

555
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:28,864
Close liquor.

556
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:34,240
Is outcome the second thing that very important is the people Aster Cafe because it's new technology

557
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:37,056
And fix unproven technology or a lot of

558
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,592
The client's feet got to

559
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:44,992
Engage the people and get to buy and so they don't feel nervous about it and they start trusting the technology that it can

560
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:50,624
Delivers the business outcomes that are looking for

561
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:52,928
The biggest risk that I seen

562
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:54,720
And people jumping

563
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:57,792
To conclusions about what the technology can do

564
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:59,840
The dog building the right foundation

565
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:01,120
Safari examples

566
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:03,936
The organizational structure could be something that is

567
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:06,496
It's not supportive of an AI implementation

568
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:13,152
It could be the lack of data or available data within the ideal environment to be able to support some of the artificial intelligence

569
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:16,736
Algorithm soap between the organizational structure and people

570
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:18,016
And the

571
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:21,344
Technical infrastructure needed to deliver a i Solutions

572
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,392
The two big things that I've seen

573
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:24,416
Text major risk

574
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:27,488
And where can we find out more

575
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:29,024
To find out more

576
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,816
Visit sparkcognition

577
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:31,840
Dot-com

578
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:44,640
Now what is go beyond the smart home into

579
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:51,040
For children I'm going to do both of these cuz I have my daughter playing with some of the stuff so first off for kids

580
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:53,088
Two are probably between the ages of

581
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:55,136
If I don't know 5 and 8

582
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:55,904
Diving

583
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,672
9

584
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:58,720
Maybe the Kano motion

585
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:04,096
Cat this is $30 all this is it's a little tiny sensor you can plug into

586
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,376
Computer and

587
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:07,424
You wave your hand over it and things happen

588
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,960
So your kid can

589
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:10,496
Beatbox vacant like

590
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:11,776
Use it to control different

591
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:13,568
Games and they also

592
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:15,616
As everybody loves to do as a parent

593
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,640
Can use it to teacher

594
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:18,688
Decode style tell you

595
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,504
When my daughter saw the learn-to-code feature shoes

596
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:23,040
I want this again

597
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:25,600
She's a little over it

598
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:30,464
But it's so easy to use I made her set everything up she was totally fine my daughter is 11

599
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,000
So she's a little out of the age

600
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,048
But she said it was fun

601
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:34,816
So

602
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:36,352
2999

603
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:38,400
Fun little present you can get for a kid

604
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:41,472
The other is

605
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:46,336
For the older set and that is the littlebits R2D2 Droid inventor kit

606
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:47,616
For a hundred bucks

607
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:50,176
And I have not tried this

608
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:51,456
So this is one of those that we

609
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:52,480
We have not tried

610
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:55,808
But I have use a little bit stuff extensively

611
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:56,576
And it's

612
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:57,344
Awesome

613
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,624
It's well put together

614
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,648
My daughter loves her Lil

615
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,184
And so

616
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:04,256
What does kit is is you build a little R2D2

617
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,280
So cute

618
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:06,304
And

619
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:08,096
You get all these parts

620
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:09,120
And

621
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:11,680
An app that goes with it and you basically

622
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:13,984
Build it I don't know how to say that you build the

623
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,008
Little Droid

624
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,800
And then you learn how to use all these other

625
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:18,336
Parts so

626
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:25,760
I kind of want this to get a little 12-inch artoo-detoo is got a Servo control of a DC motor proximity sensor

627
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:27,552
A lot of fun with us

628
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:30,112
It's a little nicer

629
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:31,648
We've had the little bit

630
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:33,440
Like they make a kit

631
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:34,720
It has all of this stuff in

632
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:40,864
And you can buy that use that but it's not sometimes for kids without a project idea

633
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,680
This is nice because it gives them something to build for

634
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:47,776
But then they can always use these parts with the other little bit stuff and

635
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:49,568
How to start building their own stuff after

636
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,592
Switches

637
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:52,640
QR

638
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:53,408
Cute

639
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,432
OtterBox

640
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:56,480
Verisign kid tested mom

641
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:58,016
Who used to say that

642
00:25:58,528 --> 00:25:59,552
I forget but I

643
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,856
I can remember the commercial that I've heard it a gazillion times

644
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:03,648
You did not come up with that Stacy

645
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,464
All right to the stocking stuffer

646
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:14,656
Well you cannot go wrong with a Bluetooth tracking device in my opinion I mean these things are like the size of a roughly a quarter quarter

647
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:15,936
Dollar and

648
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:22,592
You can attach them to bags you can attach them to weave hatching the keys actually attached one to my mailbox key so that

649
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:24,896
Play we all know where the mailbox key is cuz

650
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:27,968
Somebody in and I won't name names but I usually leave it in my

651
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:30,528
Pants pocket after getting the mail and then nobody can get the mail

652
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:33,088
So I'm going to recommend the tracker

653
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:33,856
Pixel

654
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:36,416
Which is the newer model the old Bravo as I think

655
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:38,464
Tumi be discontinued but the pixels

656
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:40,512
Are now the latest model

657
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:45,632
You can listen to make noise using your phone so that way you can find whatever you're attached to

658
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:50,240
They're speaking the Bluetooth in your phone to get closer and closer to them so you don't lose anything

659
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:53,568
Right now looks like they're on sale 5 pack and be found

660
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:55,616
4999 so 10 bucks

661
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:58,944
Apopka attach to whatever it is that you need to keep track of

662
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,016
You got a Bluetooth tracker makes it easy to find whatever you need

663
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,552
Got it okay

664
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:05,344
Now here's my controversial pic

665
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:08,160
I know that you know that I do not own this

666
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:09,440
I have played with it

667
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,464
In the beta store

668
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:13,024
And I will also say that I

669
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,560
Can't say it cuz my husband listens

670
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,096
Cast but I might get this

671
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:18,400
So this is the floss time

672
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:20,192
This is a $40 device

673
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:21,472
Granted

674
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:22,752
It's a little silly

675
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:27,616
This is for people like me who don't floss as religiously as they should

676
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:28,640
It is a

677
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:35,296
Pretty looking device that you stick on your mirror and basically every night it looks at you and it gives you an LED :-) or

678
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:40,160
Turn LED sad faces smiley faces if you pull out the floss and presumably floss your teeth

679
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:43,232
And is this something that would motivate me to floss my teeth

680
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,512
It actually proud

681
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,584
I would want to smile at me

682
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:53,216
Also I would be like somewhere there's a server that says oh my God she never fought this

683
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:55,008
Validation

684
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:56,288
Yeah I don't

685
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:57,312
Most of my things

686
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:58,336
What's flossing

687
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:05,504
You know if you have kids you can get for them and

688
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,272
They have little

689
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:07,808
Snap-on covers the earth

690
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:08,832
I like frogs and stuff

691
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:09,600
Never cute

692
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:13,440
That you do have to buy a special

693
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:14,208
Show results

694
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:16,768
So is this

695
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:18,304
Smokin hot deals

696
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,352
Is this a really interesting device

697
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:22,400
Yeah

698
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,472
40 bucks

699
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:26,496
And

700
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:31,104
Stocking stuffer is for the smart home Aficionado in your

701
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:33,152
Who is likes to touched

702
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,944
Mike's buttons

703
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,224
Which totally describes me

704
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:39,040
So this is the fibaro Z-Wave button

705
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:41,088
It comes in eight different colors

706
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:41,856
They are

707
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:43,392
Gorgeous I love you sexy

708
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:46,976
It has six scenes that you

709
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:47,744
You can set up

710
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,512
And it's

711
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:53,120
You set up a scene it's triggered by different Taps so 1 tap 2 taps

712
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:55,680
Set an alarm for

713
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:57,472
I don't have any

714
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:59,008
It's a fight app setup on

715
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:00,544
Cuz that's a lot of tapping

716
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:02,080
I love to sing

717
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:03,616
It's pretty it's out of my

718
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:05,664
Set a table by my couch and I just

719
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:09,504
Monitor wall if you want it does only

720
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,784
It only works with smart

721
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:17,184
Or if you want to use like for Barros hubs you need a hub that will support all of the

722
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,720
Fibaro features in right now

723
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:19,488
Link does not to

724
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,536
SmartThings

725
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:22,304
Only

726
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:27,168
Does it work with if this then that or no

727
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,448
It will work with this

728
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:31,776
It works with them

729
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:32,544
But only three

730
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:34,080
Gotcha

731
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:34,848
No k

732
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:35,872
Oh by the way

733
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,408
This is news

734
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:38,432
Gift guide

735
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:39,200
Pek

736
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:40,992
Your room is now

737
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:41,760
Work with it

738
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:44,576
Yeah

739
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:46,112
Give a cat a ride around the house

740
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:48,160
Tops on

741
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:50,720
All right in

742
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:52,000
Finally

743
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:53,280
My favorite cat

744
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:58,400
What About Bob

745
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:02,496
Okay so here's my first crazy expensive pic

746
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:04,544
It's almost like a light bulb but it's not

747
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,592
It's the nanoleaf Aurora

748
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:07,360
Rhythm

749
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:08,128
This

750
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:10,432
Is an awesome product that one of my friends house and I played

751
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:11,968
It for like an hour and I love it

752
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:17,600
It is $230 for the starter kit it is both homekit and

753
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:19,392
Madam a enabled

754
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:20,416
Plus there's an app

755
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:21,184
And

756
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,536
It what are these are these like six triangles that are connected to the internet

757
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:26,560
Colors

758
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:27,328
You

759
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:30,144
Can set them up in a pattern so it's like artwork

760
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:31,424
Aura night light

761
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:34,752
It's brighter than a night light but it's pretty non-functional

762
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:35,776
It's just cool

763
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:37,056
Is this how you spell

764
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:39,104
Spotted it dances to music

765
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,128
That's the Rhythm

766
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,432
This pretty sweet

767
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:45,248
And you can control it control base features with

768
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,808
So I like this

769
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:49,344
The really neat looking like.

770
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,648
I don't like you said their triangular and then

771
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:53,696
You get these little connectors and you just

772
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:57,280
Daisy chain them together in any pattern that you want and then

773
00:30:57,536 --> 00:31:00,864
Let me see you can constantly change the light panel in your house it's kind of

774
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:02,144
It's just like a really in

775
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,168
Interesting

776
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,960
Transport up to 30

777
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:05,728
Panels on one

778
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:08,800
A lot

779
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:10,848
Yeah

780
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:18,272
I get the duty of explaining why something cost $1,500 is

781
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:19,552
On our list

782
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:25,952
The June oven I know we've talked about it so many times you had that you had

783
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:28,512
Because Stacy bought hers then

784
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:32,096
She told me about it I'm like maybe I'll try this for my wife

785
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:35,936
My wife loves it and we use it every single day

786
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:41,056
So if on the off chance you haven't heard about it the June oven is a Smart Oven

787
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:42,080
It looks like a

788
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:43,872
Big toaster oven

789
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:46,432
Not something to put a 20lb turkey in

790
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:51,552
But for most other things it's perfectly fine I've got ceramic heating element it's got a

791
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:53,856
Built-in camera inside the oven

792
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:58,976
It runs on Android it's got a nice really nice looking touch screen panel to

793
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:05,632
Put any presets in or change the temperature or set the timer it even now works with Madam a so I know

794
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:06,400
SA

795
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:11,008
Pay meteme preheat the June oven for me and I wanted to stunt it it's great

796
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:16,384
Really interesting in that they have a food database so when it recognizes the food that you put in

797
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:22,528
It literally knows how long to cook it and it tells you either you're on your smartphone or on my Apple watch reasonable

798
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:24,320
The food is done it just

799
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:27,392
I have not been able to cook something poorly with a just Cooks

800
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:32,512
Perfect for us every single time and recently I love that they've added new recipes

801
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:37,120
They will walk you through how to make something and then you just put in the oven and boom it's done

802
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:40,192
So couldn't recommend it enough for use it every single day

803
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:41,472
My husband even

804
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:43,520
Hey are you going to put the June on this list

805
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:44,544
As like

806
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:47,104
Okay good

807
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:49,920
So the non-smartphone loving people in our lives

808
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:51,200
It is pricey

809
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:52,736
The crazy expensive

810
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:56,064
Finally in the crazy expensive

811
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:56,832
SeaTac

812
00:32:57,856 --> 00:33:00,160
Throw this out here cuz I've wanted one for like a year

813
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:01,184
You're in a half

814
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,464
Almost two years actually

815
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,000
Because I first saw that CSN

816
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:05,280
So

817
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:07,584
Almost two years the cleverpet

818
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,632
This is a $300

819
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:10,656
Connected

820
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:11,936
Toys for your

821
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:12,704
Dog

822
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,240
It's like Simple Simon

823
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:17,056
To treat dispensing Simple Simon

824
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:20,384
4 less than 20

825
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,152
4 hours

826
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:23,200
I'm recommending it because I've already had two

827
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,528
Your dog may not like

828
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,136
This is kind of a crazy

829
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:33,184
Purchase but I put it on here because

830
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:34,464
ICarly

831
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,744
It's kind of Awesome

832
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:36,768
So

833
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:39,584
You know if your dog goes for it I could see them really going

834
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,632
For it and it it's so far entertain my dog

835
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:48,288
It's got like three lights built-ins as you said Simple Simon and the Dogwood n Tryon

836
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,568
Hit the Light

837
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:51,872
You're the lights get the food

838
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:55,200
The end goal is the lights will go off in a pattern

839
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:57,760
And your dog will mimic that pattern to

840
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:58,784
Get a treat dispenser

841
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,552
Do it nice

842
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:02,368
He's at the stage where it will

843
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:03,136
Hit

844
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:04,160
The light

845
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:05,184
To get the tree

846
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:07,488
Again we are only

847
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:08,768
Flowers in

848
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:09,536
So

849
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:10,816
It seems dirty

850
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:12,352
My dog has already attacked it

851
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:15,424
I want the treats

852
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:16,960
I'm like forget the lights

853
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:18,496
Mrs. Japan

854
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:21,056
So there you go

855
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:22,848
Set fire to 3

856
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:23,616
$300

857
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:24,896
You could do worse

858
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:25,920
Already

859
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:26,688
That

860
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:27,712
That is our gift

861
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,528
Playlist

862
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,600
We got our cheapest thing at 2

863
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:34,368
Think about boats

864
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:35,136
Discounts for the

865
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:35,904

Hi Stacy and Kevin

881
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:14,816
This is Aaron from Wilberforce Ontario Canada

882
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:16,096
Do you have any recommendations

883
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:18,144
4 ways to control outdoor Christmas lights

884
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:22,240
Is there anything capable of running a high-wattage deicing cable

885
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,264
We got three

886
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,544
The school last night here

887
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,824
Definitely in need

888
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:27,872
Aaron

889
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:31,968
What a really appropriate question right ahead of the holidays

890
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:32,736
And

891
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:34,016
We can only answer half

892
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,880
Because while I am very familiar with outdoor modules and

893
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:39,648
Light control

894
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:42,208
Living in Texas I have no sense

895
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:44,000
I didn't even know you could actually put things on your

896
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:50,144
I got to get rid of that ice and snow in Canada

897
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:50,912
Nothing

898
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:51,680
Popped out at

899
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:53,728
I think so if anyone knows

900
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:55,520
And lives in the great Frozen North

901
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:58,848
And has an automated or connected solution to

902
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:03,456
Heating cables on roofs hey info at iot podcast. Calm and we will share that

903
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:06,272
So question

904
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:07,808
Many people will benefit from

905
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:09,344
Outdoor holiday lighting

906
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:11,136
And how to make it smart

907
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:12,160

Options

The first is what I have used for the last

910
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:19,072
Which is the Jasco Z-Wave

911
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:21,120
On off outdoor module

00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:37,504
Speaks Z-Wave so that's where all of you guys who have that capability

921
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:38,784
If you don't

922
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:40,064
There are now

923
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,344
Wonderful new options

924
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:42,624
That I have not

925
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:43,904
But

926
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,464
So I would recommend these are all in the same price range

927
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,536
The Z-Wave ones are 35 they get more expensive actually

928
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:50,560
Closer to Holiday

929
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:51,584
You might pay as much as

930
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:53,888
But I also see in these are

931
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:54,912
Well rated

932
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:59,008
The G by outdoor WiFi plugs that work with Madam

933
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:00,032
And with an app

934
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:02,336
I would recommend an app go mad at me all the way

935
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:05,408
Wifi-enabled

936
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:06,688
Switches they have to

937
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:07,712
They are also

938
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:12,064
Outdoor rated make sure you use outdoor-rated ones though case cuz you don't want to mess around

939
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:13,600
Not appropriate

940
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:17,184
Covers for your lights cuz if they're GFI they're going to go off in

941
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:19,232
Miss out on your holiday lighting

942
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:21,792
So the options on the Wi-Fi front

943
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:26,400
IHome also makes a Wi-Fi one for 40 bucks that only has one Outlet

944
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:27,424
Which may or may not

945
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,240
Be fine for you and again Wifi works

946
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:32,800
Google Assistant

947
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:34,592
And Siri voice

948
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,128
Which means it has a

949
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:37,920
For the home

950
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:39,968
People I devices also make

951
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:41,504
An outdoor

952
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,272
Module

953
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:44,576
It is $70 usually

954
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:46,880
It's between 60 and $75 to pen

955
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:52,256
It has two outlets so if that's something you could take advantage of its basically like

956
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:55,584
If you've got two right next to each other you might as well just get that one

957
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,352
And you

958
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:57,376
Consolidating

959
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:58,144
The same price

960
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:01,472
Those are your options for outdoor lighting

961
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:03,264
My other Pro tip

962
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,032
For you

963
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:05,056
Is

964
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:10,688
Instead of doing if you got a mixed-media like you've got a bunch of different options like in Dora

965
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:12,224
Maybe switches made for

966
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,784
From somebody else put it all through voice can

967
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:15,808
Sedgwick

968
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:16,832
Google Assistant

969
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:17,856
Spell routine

970
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:20,672
Build the scene through Amazon a

971
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:22,976
Are do it with homekit so you can just

972
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:24,000
Activate

973
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:26,816
Because if your house is anything like mine what it is

974
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:28,352
Will end up with this like I'll just tell

975
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:29,376
I have seven

976
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:30,144
Or a

977
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,168
I think I have eight

978
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:31,936
Christmas light

979
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:33,472
All play

980
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:35,520
So I just group them all on

981
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:36,544
And then I'm like

982
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,312
Madam

983
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:38,336
Turn on

984
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:39,104
Christmas

985
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,640
And that poop everything comes out

986
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,944
And if you're crazy like me you can also do

987
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:43,968
Matinee

988
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:46,272
Turn on Christmas Eve which for me is like

989
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:47,808
Quieter setting

990
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:48,576
So it's

991
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:49,856
Like a little less festive

992
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:51,648
Pure lights just for Christmas Eve

993
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:53,440
That is my advice to you

994
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:55,232
Again heating information

995
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,536
If you know any things

996
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:01,376
A lot of people

997
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,424
And if you guys have

998
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,192
Have a question

999
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:05,216
Kevin what is that

1000
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:08,544
That number is 512

1001
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,104
62374

1002
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:11,872
To 4

1003
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:15,968
