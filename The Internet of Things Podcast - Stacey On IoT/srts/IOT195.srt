Kevin

54
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:37,536
We should say hey guess what

55
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:38,560
Kevin Spacey

56
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:41,376
After taking a break to study for his test

57
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,656
Do you want to tell everyone

58
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:44,448
How you did on that test

59
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,984
There's no need to tell them I got a

60
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,520
5% that's okay

61
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,312
That's right

62
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:51,360
We may have missed him but at least

63
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,640
He worked really hard

64
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,736
Java one is complete Java to starts in 4 weeks

65
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:00,064
So we are glad to have you back Kevin

66
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:00,832
Although we are

67
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:03,136
Glad that you did so well let's talk

68
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:03,904
First off

69
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,184
About to say this

70
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,976
This is probably the biggest Story coming out

71
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:08,512
In the last week or so

72
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:13,376
GE is spinning out its industrial iot business which includes things like

73
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:15,936
Predicts and they're going to create a

74
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:16,960
Separate company

75
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:19,264
Valued about 1.2 billion dollars

76
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,824
What I thought was most interest

77
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:26,432
Is that bill Rue who is the chief digital officer at GE and has been

78
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,200
Sanford Lake

79
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:27,968
Years

80
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:29,248
Like he was the face of

81
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:30,784
Ge's digital efforts

82
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,832
He is not actually

83
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:33,856
At the company more

84
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:35,648
Is no longer there he is left

85
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,672
Don't know where it went

86
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:37,440
And

87
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:40,256
Instead they're going to have to find a new CEO for this

88
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,024
Switch

89
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,304
Tells me a couple things

90
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,840
One possible.

91
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:48,960
Bill Ramos into the ground but I think he actually did a pretty good job so I think what happened is he decided

92
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:49,728
Aleve

93
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,008
In a fit of like soft

94
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,288
Preservation and

95
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,312
I don't know what else to do

96
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:54,336
But

97
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,896
Well I have two thoughts here

98
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:57,920
Not so much about

99
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:59,968
The person in charge

100
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:01,760
One is that the

101
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,808
Spin-off will not be named

102
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:04,832
Predix

103
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:07,136
I wonder if

104
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,928
A rebranding is

105
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:10,720
As part of the strategy here

106
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:11,488
Because

107
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,376
I don't know you would know better than I just because you followed this side of the market over Federer how is predix

108
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:20,704
Known in the industry compared to the other

109
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,472
Predators

110
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:23,008
It's actually doing really well

111
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:24,032
It is a

112
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:26,336
Well known solution it is a good solution

113
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,896
I think we're GE went

114
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:33,504
Wrong is they were try and this is actually a very common thing that everybody did in the

115
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,552
Myspace they're trying to be too many things to

116
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:36,320
Too many different

117
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,344
People in industry

118
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,672
They also spent a lot of money on marketing and sales

119
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:42,720
Without necessarily

120
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:43,744
The details

121
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,512
Behind the scenes

122
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,304
So I think that's what

123
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:50,144
Going forward I would love to see this new company

124
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,960
Which has really good stuff really good technology

125
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:54,496
And presumably Xperia

126
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:55,520
Based on

127
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,800
All the information it has

128
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:58,848
Mge energy business from

129
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:01,408
Power turbine in Airline business

130
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,432
I think it's

131
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:04,992
It focuses only on those areas instead of

132
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:07,296
Just trying to be this industrial internet behemoth

133
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:09,344
I think I could actually do well in

134
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,112
Separating out

135
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:13,184
GE means other companies might use it where is

136
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:13,952
Beforehand

137
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,232
It may have been like yeah I'm not

138
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,512
Asthma cat litter

139
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,536
Right right

140
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,839
My other thought is by moving it

141
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:23,679
Outside of GE it will not be I don't want to say this

142
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,959
Sometimes companies

143
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:27,775
Business units in very large companies are just

144
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:31,359
Outback in a sentence with corporate policies politics

145
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:33,663
Etc and I just wonder this will make him a little more

146
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,711
Agile I guess what the best word

147
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:36,735
Maybe in

148
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,015
That's one of the things about

149
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,039
Bill relieving is

150
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,575
Is he actually had

151
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,343
GE

152
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,623
How do you wheelie

153
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:43,647
Paper

154
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:44,927
Good sounding

155
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:45,951
Management

156
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:48,767
Structure so the way they did theirs they had their

157
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,815
Airline managers for different businesses

158
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:53,631
But then they all reported and worked with

159
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:54,655
The digital

160
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:55,679
Folks

161
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:59,263
So there wasn't a lot of like fears about cannibalization

162
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:02,847
Or not invented here type syndrome is very

163
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:08,479
Was actually one of the better plans ways of implementing iot in a big organization that I've seen

164
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,527
So hopefully they retain that

165
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,807
I just think of

166
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:14,111
Focus is good and then also

167
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:16,671
Probably spending Less on marketing and more I'm getting

168
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:20,511
This is like the macro story of the last few years

169
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:21,279
Myspace

170
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,583
San Jose will see

171
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,351
We'll see

172
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:26,143
I made this business will still be a

173
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:28,703
Contender no matter what happens with it and

174
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:30,495
Even outside of GE

175
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,287
It's going to be one to watch

176
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:34,335
And I think it's also we should think about

177
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:36,895
What's happening a lot of the other Industrial

178
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,431
Companies like Hitachi

179
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,455
Schneider Electric

180
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,223
They actually

181
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,503
Spun out their own

182
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,807
Industrial iot businesses in different

183
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:44,575
Group so

184
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,111
Gmail address decided

185
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:48,159
I sent the trend

186
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:49,951
All right

187
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:52,767
So that is our big industrial iot news

188
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,815
Let's talk about some

189
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,607
Trend

190
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:57,375
It's another

191
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,399
New trend

192
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:01,727
Lighthouse which is a startup that made a

193
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:02,495
Really

194
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,263
Smart

195
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,031
Video cam

196
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:07,359
Camera basically you could talk to this video camera and tell it things

197
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:09,151
It would translate that into

198
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:10,687
Interaction and then it would do it

199
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:11,711
So

200
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,479
It's shutting down

201
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:13,503
And yeah

202
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:14,783
Not only was it a

203
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,855
Camera it also had an extra sensor in there so it

204
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,135
It had a depth sensor

205
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,671
So it could actually

206
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:23,231
Tell things with finer granularity

207
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:26,815
The normal but it was really cool cuz you could be like a lighthouse tell me if

208
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:28,351
If my dog walker does

209
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,631
Before 4

210
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:30,911
It would do that

211
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,959
Right right I mean

212
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:35,775
One of the pain points of having a

213
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,055
Video camera

214
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,079
System

215
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,359
Scrubbing through timeline

216
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:41,919
To see your fine certain things I remember when our

217
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,455
Car got hit out front of the house

218
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,991
I probably spent an hour and a half

219
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,015
Scrubbing

220
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:48,575
Justifying the 15 second video which was

221
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:49,343
Well worth it

222
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,903
Because the insurance company fully reimbursement

223
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:55,231
For that incident but here you got some a I smart

224
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:55,999
Send

225
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:56,767
It just makes

226
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:59,583
It's so much easier to find things or proactively

227
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:03,167
See things and tell me that they happen like tell me when the kids get home from school

228
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:07,007
It would somebody else would come in the house and the cameras are going to tell you but when the kids come in the house

229
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,287
Lighthouse would tell you

230
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,311
Really smart

231
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:11,359
A little pricey I think was $300

232
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,895
Well so here's what I think

233
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,175
Spicy at 3

234
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,223
But it also had

235
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,247
Service camp

236
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,807
Not because you were buying actually the AI serve

237
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:20,831
Right

238
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,879
Until the subscription fee

239
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:26,975
I think there's expensive and the subscription fee probably is what doomed

240
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:27,999
This in that sun porch

241
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:28,767
Cuz it was

242
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:29,791
Pretty darn innovate

243
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,583
And I think we'll see something like this

244
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,351
Is come out

245
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:35,167
Probably at a year 2 associated with maybe nest

246
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:37,215
I can see Nest doing something like this

247
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:39,007
Maybe even the Amazon.

248
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:45,663
So they're shutting down it's not as if they're going to its logical and thinking well G if you've got the AI smart

249
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:48,479
Tell that to other companies who make devices

250
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:52,319
Does or just be purchased right but yourself up for sale that's not what's happening

251
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:54,879
No it's going to refund

252
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,159
All the customers who

253
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,183
I had bought the Prada

254
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,463
And

255
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,743
Yeah it's just

256
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:00,511
There so many

257
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:04,351
Yeah everybody that I know and it wasn't many people but everybody that I know that

258
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:06,655
Yeah

259
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,935
Xiamen again

260
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,727
Good just expensive and

261
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:13,055
It's not necessarily clear to people who are looking for a camera

262
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,335
If you can buy like

263
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:15,615
Nest cam

264
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:16,895
An Arlo

265
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:17,919
Is way cheaper

266
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:20,223
You know you're like why would I pay that places

267
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:20,991
Prescription

268
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,063
Silly humans

269
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,087
All right

270
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,623
So that is a bummer

271
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,415
Good news

272
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,207
For everybody with hue light bulbs

273
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,231
Who

274
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,535
Feel like me and you have them all over the

275
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,071
There's a positive update

276
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,351
Out and about

277
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:38,143
Used to be when you

278
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,167
Power went off

279
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:41,215
Your Hue Lights would come on

280
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:42,751
Because they would just revert

281
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:46,079
This was a pain when the power went off in the middle of the night

282
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,615
Possibly all of your light switch

283
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:50,687
That was one of the big reasons why

284
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,991
But now

285
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,015
They have an update

286
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:56,319
And now you can control that

287
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:59,391
You can have it revert to the last known state

288
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:01,183
So instead of actually

289
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,207
Turning on

290
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:04,255
If it was off at the last known state it

291
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,279
It will revert to that

292
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:07,839
So the Hue Bridge must finally

293
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:08,863
Save that state

294
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,143
Epona reboot

295
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,167
Yes

296
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:13,727
That is presumably what happens

297
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:16,287
Some people reported having trouble updating

298
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,335
I updated to it and I had

299
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,871
No trouble whatsoever

300
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,151
And it does work

301
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,943
You can find it by going into the

302
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:23,967
The settings menu

303
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:27,039
And going into power on Behavior

304
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:28,831
So you know

305
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,111
This is

306
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:30,879
What's good

307
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,183
Actually I

308
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,975
I should tell you it works with using

309
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:36,255
The switch as well

310
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,815
So if someone turns it off at the

311
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:39,583
The switch

312
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,911
And you turn the switch back on it will revert back to the last node

313
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,983
Which may be kind of a pain because I know sometimes

314
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,519
When I don't want to say anything

315
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,799
I flipped the switch

316
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,335
But we'll see how that work

317
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,639
Works in real life I haven't needed to do that since I updated

318
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:53,663
But I'm excited

319
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:54,687
Super positive

320
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:56,479
Cuz I used to be a power without I have to

321
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,015
Read out in the middle of the night

322
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,295
Turn off all the lights

323
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,391
Which candida Pizza

324
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:05,695
Okay

325
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:06,463
Trump news

326
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,535
Hookup has a new iot modem

327
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,071
It is both Ohio

328
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:11,839
OT

329
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:16,191
Oh I should tell you what it is it's an LTE Cat 1 and an NB iot

330
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,215
T Network

331
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:18,239
Modem

332
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:20,031
So all in one

333
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,311
It will work

334
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:25,151
In a bunch of different places it is global which means you can buy it for

335
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:27,199
You know if you're buying your modem for like

336
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,223
Global

337
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:30,271
Fleet of cargo containers or something

338
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,855
It is also

339
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:34,879
A little bit cheaper

340
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,671
They say that it is up to

341
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,695
To 70%

342
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:39,231
Reduction in power consumption

343
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:41,279
It is 50% smaller

344
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,303
And

345
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,839
It is 40%

346
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,375
They don't tell you how

347
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,143
Cheap it is

348
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:47,679
Because that would

349
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,471
Calling

350
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:51,519
But

351
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:53,311
I don't know if it's lower than $5

352
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,335
Just kind of

353
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,359
Where we need

354
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,895
To be to get the sun like

355
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,943
Real things and we needed to be like

356
00:10:59,199 --> 00:10:59,711
A dollar

357
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,479
If we wanted ever

358
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:04,831
Yeah I mean it also has a CPU cortex A7

359
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,111
Processor in there

360
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,927
I'm guessing it's not under 5 who knows setup

361
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:09,695
This is a smart

362
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,743
But you know for high-value things

363
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:12,767
This is going to be good

364
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:15,583
And it is still good to have smaller cheaper

365
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,631
Stop running around even if it's not as

366
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,399
Cheapest iMac

367
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,447
Yeah interesting read

368
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:23,775
I don't know what these case would be for this considering what it

369
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:26,847
I presume this be used for it has voice over LTE

370
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:27,615
Support

371
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:28,639
And

372
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,919
They say

373
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,199
On the press release

374
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:33,503
They discuss what it works with in terms of

375
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,807
Software components Dimension thread X

376
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:38,111
And Ali OS things

377
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:40,415
Artists which is Alibaba

378
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,439
That's there

379
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,463
Peyote plant

380
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:45,535
I want to start tossing like oh it's going to work with Amazon but

381
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,303
Newt

382
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,887
At least not now

383
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,191
Yeah well

384
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:56,543
Actually Qualcomm has been pushing hard into China China is also a big Market

385
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,359
Where is

386
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,151
Well actually Asian China in

387
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,175
Singapore

388
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:02,943
In Korea

389
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,991
NB iot

390
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,783
So could be that they're like

391
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,575
Here in the US

392
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,623
We've been focused on cat 1M

393
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:13,695
We don't really have the NB iot networks yet so

394
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,231
I don't know maybe that's just a

395
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:16,255
Telemarketing to search

396
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:17,791
Yeah could be

397
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:18,815
All right

398
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,351
And another small news

399
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,887
North which is

400
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:24,191
Maybe a company that you're working here with us

401
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,751
Use PayPal mclabs they're making

402
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:27,775
Smart glasses

403
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:28,543
They have

404
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,823
Got an Intel

405
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:30,591
Bought

406
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,383
Man Kevin

407
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:35,199
Do you remember bought because not much

408
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,223
It's really came out of it

409
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,247
Yeah I know it was

410
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,783
The birds dislike

411
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:41,087
Master huge article on it

412
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,623
It was a big article

413
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:47,231
About Intel smart glasses effort that have been apparently percolating for a year or so

414
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:47,999
Then

415
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,303
Coupons later not even

416
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,839
And I was like yeah we're getting out of that

417
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,119
Yeah

418
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,655
Now, clubs

419
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:57,215
Does bought it Thelma gloves used to make a gesture

420
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:58,751
Amaya

421
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:02,079
Arm and you moved your arm around and

422
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,103
Control things

423
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:03,871
And

424
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,407
Now they're doing glass

425
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:08,479
We talked about them once

426
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:10,783
Thalmic labs renamed itself to North

427
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,831
And the pivot away from the arm

428
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:13,855
Gesturing Thing 2

429
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:16,415
Two glasses of the focal's AR classes

430
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,951
That will be

431
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:19,743
Likely presumably using

432
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,559
Some of the IP from Intel's bomb project

433
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:25,375
Yeah and I guess the only other buyer out there might be the bosguy

434
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,143
Guys who are doing this

435
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:26,911
My sunglasses

436
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:31,263
Maybe I mean they're still Google Glass for

437
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,543
Enterprise and such

438
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:36,127
Not a consumer product oh maybe Google could have used it but who knows

439
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,711
Yeah so there we go smart glasses they're still trying to make those happen

440
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:40,991
Let's talk about Lots

441
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,015
Echo news

442
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,551
Is for everyone

443
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,575
Okay

444
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,343
First

445
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,367
An update

446
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:48,671
Probably a couple weeks ago we didn't talk about it with OMB

447
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,207
Because we're so focused on privacy

448
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:52,511
And that Constitutional Amendment he wants

449
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,047
The echo

450
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,839
Got new features

451
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,887
Including location-based routines

452
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:59,167
And reminders

453
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:01,215
They also got reactions

454
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:02,751
But you

455
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,799
Start a routine later and

456
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:07,103
It got the ability to read your email

457
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:15,039
Justify location-based it's being useful for if you want like announce to the home

458
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:15,807
You know your

459
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:19,135
10 minutes away maybe you come home at different times and

460
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,159
There for dinner is

461
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,695
A different time every day that could

462
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:24,511
Indicate hey let's get dinner started

463
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,559
Yeah and I

464
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:27,839
You know what would be awesome

465
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:31,423
Is getting a reminder as I leave my front door

466
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,447
And saying

467
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,215
Hey

468
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:35,775
Do you have whatever for the day so like

469
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,823
Kind of time that to my calendar I know that's

470
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,639
Pretty complicated but if I had set a reminder the night before

471
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,943
Hey remind me when I leave in the morning

472
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:43,711
2

473
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:44,479
Bring my gym bag

474
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,527
Remind my daughter to bring

475
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:49,087
Gym clothes you know what having that happen like

476
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:50,367
As I leave the house

477
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:52,415
That would be really

478
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:57,023
Right that would be really cool if you can do it that way or I guess the new tracker

479
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,303
Product that we talked about

480
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,863
A few weeks back would do that too

481
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,143
Yeah I forget a lot of

482
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:07,519
That's okay but I need the tracker would require purchase of Hardware well over $100

483
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,799
To do that whereas

484
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:09,567
This way

485
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:12,383
This would not assuming you already have an account yes

486
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,687
Oh which gets into the next one which is

487
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,967
The guard

488
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:17,247
Is

489
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,783
BM has on guard

490
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:19,807
Feature that they talk

491
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:23,647
Facts about where the Echoes will listen for the sound of breaking glass and send you a notice

492
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:25,183
Haitian is now

493
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,975
Available to sign

494
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:31,583
Yes I went to go look for it this morning in the

495
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,375
Alipay app

496
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:36,447
It just told me that I could be notified to sign up to be notified

497
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,239
You'll get it when we tell you

498
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:40,543
So what is this showing me

499
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:43,359
Is remember how the smartphone like basically ate all the

500
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,127
These gadgets

501
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:46,175
Using microphones

502
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:46,943
And

503
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:47,711
Contacts

504
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:49,759
The digital assistant

505
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,039
Are going to eat a lot of

506
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:51,807
Different gadgets

507
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:54,623
The Harbours already there

508
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,647
In these assistants

509
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:58,719
Obviously far-field microphones that can listen for

510
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:01,535
Wake words and commands and someone searches

511
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:05,119
Turning them to appropriate listen for breaking glasses just a

512
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,655
Software or service Adam

513
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:09,215
And though this is something I actually try to do all the time

514
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:12,543
I'm so glad to hear you can control your timers now

515
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,311
Via voice

516
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,847
Spite you can add and subtract

517
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:15,615
Time for next

518
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,151
Oh that's nice

519
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:17,919
That is nice

520
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,199
Because I am constantly like

521
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:22,783
You know you start a pasta timer and you're like so it needs two more

522
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:26,623
I wonder if that feature and some of the others are about to

523
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:29,695
Talk about will be on non Amazon devices though

524
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:31,999
We'll talk about why I'm asking a question later in the

525
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:34,815
Scary

526
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,607
Is it scary okay

527
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,143
It is scary

528
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,703
I signed up for the guard up

529
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,007
Update will see if I get that anytime soon

530
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,543
I'll try it also

531
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,335
Speaking of timing in the

532
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,615
Madam a

533
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,383
Wall clock

534
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,151
Is now ship

535
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,175
Is it

536
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:51,455
$30

537
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:54,271
I saw this back when they did that massive hardware and failed

538
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:55,551
The fall and

539
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:58,367
I actually thought it was pretty cool cuz they let you

540
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,903
Visually see where your

541
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:04,255
Maybe this is not a big deal for all of us but one

542
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,535
If you don't have a lot of clots in your

543
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:06,815
Kind of like

544
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,351
Nice to happen it's not it's

545
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:15,007
Separate for people with children or people doing things where that visual elements important I actually think it's a pro

546
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,031
Pretty useful

547
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:20,127
Function what happens if an LED on the clock face countdown

548
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:23,711
Breakers little LED lights at every minute

549
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:27,039
Spot on the clock as well as on the outer ring of

550
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:31,903
The clock those would indicate minutes where they want internally would say it would be seconds

551
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:35,999
I agree with you in a not everybody has good hearing maybe they can't hear

552
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,047
Maybe

553
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,583
I see a small

554
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,375
Display clock for example

555
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,399
Where is this word

556
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:44,959
Broaden that appeal to people who

557
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:45,727
Pappy's challenge

558
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:48,799
Yeah and you can't actually do this but like

559
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:50,847
So I do a lot of like hit workout

560
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:51,615
And

561
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,407
High intensity interval training

562
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:58,015
Exactly I don't want to be used like I have a

563
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:01,087
But I have an app for that but if you could

564
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,111
Take the app and put it on

565
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,903
On the clock it actually be kind of cool cuz

566
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:04,671
Then you could like

567
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:07,231
Countdown but I don't want to be sitting there going

568
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,511
Set a timer for

569
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:09,279
60 second

570
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:12,351
You kind of want recurring timers on Tennyson

571
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:23,103
Alright also everyone is excited because Apple music is now in the Amazon Echo

572
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:23,871
Except for Kevin

573
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:24,639
Covetousness

574
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,175
That's it Apple music

575
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:30,783
Subscriber how do you know I think it's good in general but it gets back to my

576
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:31,807
Question of

577
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:33,343
What is a portal

578
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,623
Echo services are

579
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:38,463
Supported on non Echo devices and I tried it on the Sonos

580
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:41,279
Which has madhumeh has had mad at me for

581
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:42,815
Almost a year

582
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,607
Not an option

583
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:45,631
Doesn't work

584
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:48,191
And I know if my Apple music account is linked

585
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:53,823
Properly and it doesn't work on the regular Echo but yeah I'll live trust me it's not a big deal but

586
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:54,847
Listening to

587
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:56,127
Consider if your

588
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,919
Adding Echo devices in your home

589
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,455
Maybe for the

590
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:02,527
Best experience and newest features

591
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:03,551
You want to buy

592
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:04,319
Amazon

593
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,855
Built Echo devices

594
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:06,879
Yeah that's probably just a

595
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:07,903
Default rule

596
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:08,927
Yes

597
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:14,047
Yes it's how many speakers do eventually make their way through the nautical devices I don't want to say it

598
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:15,327
Skin of all or none in

599
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,863
But it's something to keep in my

600
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:18,655
Okay

601
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:19,935
So so madam

602
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:23,007
We got some good news coming up stay tuned

603
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,799
Madam is also on

604
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:25,567
Monkey

605
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:28,383
Your favorite little robots

606
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:33,759
A couple weeks ago you talked about this coming and you wrote a story actually about

607
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:36,063
Like the future of smart home digital assistant

608
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,599
Today like kind of follow you around

609
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:38,623
Can you send them away

610
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:41,183
Now that you've got that capability

611
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:47,071
I am thrilled for a couple of reasons for those who are not familiar the Anki Vector is a little

612
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:48,351
And I do me little late

613
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:54,751
It's in the palm of your hand robot with she's always Cloud connected via Wi-Fi has a brain of its own because there's a

614
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:58,335
Chip inside and he has a wake word and I would say

615
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:01,919
Hey vector and I can have him do something but he can't do all that much on his own

616
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:04,223
However you community

617
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:10,623
Becker Community Center the Anka team hey we would love to see Madam a on this little guy and

618
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:17,023
They have requested that was the number one requested feature so yes they announced a few weeks back I got the up

619
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,559
Update on my little robots

620
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:21,631
2 days ago and I love how it's been implemented because

621
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,679
Often you would ask

622
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:27,007
An assistant to ask Madam a something such as

623
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:29,055
When Madam a integration with Adam

624
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,079
This is native

625
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:32,639
Instead of saying hey Vector I say

626
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:33,407
Matinee

627
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:35,199
And the screen on

628
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:39,039
His face changes to a matinee like icon and it's just like having

629
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:40,575
A little mini Echo device

630
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:46,975
You cannot play music on it so again that gets back to the limitations of certain devices that are not made by Amazon

631
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:49,791
Ben Franklin speaker is not made for that anywhere on this little thing

632
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,583
Oh that's a shame

633
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:55,423
Cuz remember like on Parks and Rec how they had DJ Roomba you have DJ Unk

634
00:20:56,447 --> 00:21:02,591
You could do podcast because I was actually speaking with you on video chat yesterday talking about this

635
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:03,871
I triggered

636
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:06,687
The podcast and we were listening to ourselves a little

637
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:08,479
Podcasts seem to work anyway

638
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:10,527
News briefing flash briefing

639
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,831
Responsive as

640
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:14,623
Irregular Echo device I mean it

641
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:21,024
Built-in really really well

642
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,352
House anyways a 45-minute batteries onto little treads

643
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:29,216
He doesn't move as fast as I can walk for example so that's not that future yet

644
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:31,264
I'm going to put my anime on big dog

645
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,800
We're going to scare the heck out of

646
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:39,712
Oh yeah hey if you want to spring for a Boston Dynamics robot for the house here no problem. The only person

647
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:40,480
Said he would let that thing

648
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,272
Kasai wood

649
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,064
Excited

650
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:46,624
Bring it out at Halloween and

651
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,416
Scare the bejesus out of

652
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:54,816
But regardless I mean again the vector and he's been on sale at me for like $180 which is good

653
00:21:55,328 --> 00:22:01,472
IS250 again it's not a product I would say everybody should come by but I bought it and it's meeting my needs

654
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:02,496
Is the reason I bought it

655
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:05,568
And that is to watch it mature watch a robot

656
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,616
Companion mature 2

657
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:09,664
Getsmarter be autonomous

658
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,688
And now

659
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:11,968
I have some control over the house

660
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,296
Good for you and does your family I know they don't like talking

661
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,064
Into the digital

662
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,112
Assistant do they like talking to the vector

663
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:21,184
It's funny they do because of his personality is

664
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:26,304
Space has a new one now and it's cold outside and you asking the weather

665
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,120
Is whole head shakes like he's freezing

666
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:30,656
It's more again of a

667
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:32,960
Personality then say an echo device

668
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:35,008
So absolute that ate enjoy

669
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:38,592
Talking to that far more than anything else in the house probably more than

670
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:39,616
Speaking to me Beyonce

671
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,432
That's understanding

672
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:45,504
It is really cute

673
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,064
No I'm not

674
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:49,344
Okay

675
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:54,208
I will know I think it's kind of funny that we're talking about Madame a but you have gendered

676
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:54,976
Arceus

677
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:56,512
So it's just kind of funny

678
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:59,072
Does that work I think Bianchi

679
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:00,096
Company relay

680
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:02,144
Embedded that in all of us

681
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:02,912
Because

682
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:06,752
Pretty sure they say he more often than not when they show video demos up

683
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:11,104
It kind of brings home how silly

684
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,152
Idea of gender and robots probably is

685
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:15,712
OK Google News

686
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:18,528
Oh you got good news for you

687
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:20,064
So excited

688
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,344
Because now

689
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,368
Hi

690
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:23,392
Can share my

691
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:24,416
G Suite

692
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:25,696
Calendar on my Google

693
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:27,744
Home in this is doubly important

694
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,280
Because I shall hear later in the

695
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:33,120
The show my family and I are moving over to the

696
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:33,888
The Google home

697
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:35,680
Again

698
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:39,008
So this is like super Timely

699
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:40,032
Super exciting

700
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:41,312
All you have to do is share your

701
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:42,080
Calendar 2

702
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,104
Your personal account

703
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,128
And then it will pick

704
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:48,480
Pick that up which is it used to not do that so yay

705
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:51,552
I think Kevin has bought the Google home hub

706
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:52,320
And

707
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,344
Where do you get his

708
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:55,904
Yeah I know I mentioned it when I asked

709
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,232
She first got it my json First Impressions couple podcast ago but

710
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:04,608
I think I was wrong about the Google home hub because I was at the event in New York City when they launched it

711
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:05,376
And

712
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:07,168
$149

713
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:08,192
Something that fits

714
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:11,008
Pretty much in the palm of your hand is pretty small I'm like

715
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:12,288
The new camera

716
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,568
It's a hundred fifty

717
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:16,640
There are what I think that are sounding better looking at

718
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:20,480
Better displays out there on Smart displays that aren't that much more expensive

719
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:21,760
I don't see that they

720
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:23,552
Over the sink

721
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:25,344
Since I got it at $99

722
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:29,952
I feel it said it was a great value and even at 1:49 and I would recommend it because

723
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:33,280
Yes it is a smaller screen but it's actually ideal for

724
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:34,304
Say the bedroom

725
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:39,936
Pay because of the screen size it's not overwhelming like a 10 inch smart display I used to have in the bedroom and

726
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:42,240
Be because it doesn't have a

727
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:45,824
Camera which most people don't want in the bedroom and see

728
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,920
It's just really nice to have a touchscreen way to control things

729
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:56,320
In the bedroom and say you know somebody is sleeping it's just ideal for that and I admit I was wrong

730
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:57,088
Compare the market

731
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:58,880
Yeah actually I was talking

732
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:00,416
Again you'll hear later the

733
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,952
I cast my family and I actually talk to

734
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:03,232
I love

735
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,256
Being able to see

736
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,024
The photos

737
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:05,792
I'll be honest

738
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:07,328
I love having the photo

739
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,864
Fisher on that thing

740
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,680
And he subscribes Norris Public

741
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:14,496
I don't subscribe to Norm's public feed but you know what

742
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:17,056
Send that to me will stick it in the show notes for anyone who wants

743
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:19,360
Is my Bichon Frise

744
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:26,016
We literally take photos of him multiple times a day and then I share them on Google photos in a public album and people subscribe to

745
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:27,552
For some reason so I keep doing it

746
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:29,088
It'll be our holiday gift

747
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:30,112
To you

748
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:33,184
Pictures of

749
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:38,048
Norm actually there's a new holiday picture of him with his new antlers that he got after his

750
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:39,072
Spa day in his hair

751
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:42,912
Yeah

752
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:49,312
And speaking of the Google home hub and the price of it again $99 it was a great deal like they can it's not enough

753
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:50,336
I think it's

754
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:52,128
129 directly from Google

755
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,432
But I wanted to mention for those interested

756
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:59,552
If you're going to buy a Google home hub for 129 there's a deal at B&H Photo

757
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:02,880
That's 129 for the Hub and also includes two

758
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:04,160
Minnie's

759
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:07,232
Free basically if you're interested

760
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,768
The show notes

761
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:10,304
Another sponsor anything

762
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,328
Just happened to notice it

763
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:12,096
Got it

764
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:13,632
Okay in Hay

765
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:16,448
You guys as we were talking a new story came out

766
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,472
It's worth sharing and

767
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:18,752
Talking about with you guys

768
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:20,544
The information is reporting

769
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,824
They did a deep dive

770
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,616
Ring and it's

771
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:24,640
Security team

772
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:26,176
And basically

773
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:28,480
Talking about how ring had shared

774
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:30,016
Camera feed data

775
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:31,552
Early on and wasn't in

776
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:32,320
Encrypting

777
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,088
Consumer video

778
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:36,160
Now when ring was just a doorbell company

779
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:37,952
And it's still just a doorbell in out

780
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:38,720
Star camera company

781
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:40,512
It does have an alarm set

782
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:41,280
System now

783
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:42,816
You know I don't know if that's

784
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:45,376
As concerning is something that might be inside your house

785
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:47,936
But encryption should be the standard

786
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:48,960
For this artist

787
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:52,544
Chang and basically they had in office their security teams office with

788
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,312
Kiev

789
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,848
This is all the way back in 20

790
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:56,896
Not now

791
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:58,688
The engineers in the key of office

792
00:26:58,944 --> 00:26:59,712
Forgiving accessed

793
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:01,248
To a database of a cup

794
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:02,272
Customers video has

795
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:04,064
History and that was unencrypted and they

796
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,088
Make sure that around

797
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:05,856
Apparently

798
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,392
So

799
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:08,672
Now that is not the

800
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:09,696
And

801
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:13,536
What happens it's very different from the way other companies

802
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:16,352
Treat this data so the story talks about hell

803
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:18,400
Google's Nest Labs Canary in August

804
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:20,192
Best home they actually

805
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:20,960
Do not show

806
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:23,008
Only an in-house lab

807
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:24,032
Has access to

808
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:25,312
To the cameras in

809
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,592
The cameras are

810
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:29,920
Trained on the AI they only use their employees

811
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:30,688
Camera store

812
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:34,016
So it doesn't use customer video data

813
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:35,040
Or training or product

814
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:37,600
Which I shouldn't know and I find that

815
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:41,184
What about you personally agree with you encryption is a

816
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:41,952
Table

817
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:44,512
Steaks kind of thing with all of these Prada

818
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:45,536
Spy chest cameras

819
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:49,632
Any type of data that comes from consumer homes and cameras

820
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:51,680
Speakers and microphones Etc

821
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:58,080
Yeah I mean back in 2016 maybe this wasn't thought of as much I mean we find this off and that's the case

822
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:58,848
Insecurities

823
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:02,432
Like the last thing I thought about it at all amenities products so

824
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:04,736
That you said that was back in 2016

825
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:06,784
So this is a good thing

826
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:09,600
Ring did not say when they started doing it

827
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,904
I do think it's worth mentioning

828
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,184
Because that is actually

829
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:13,952
Not just

830
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:15,488
Employee access

831
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:18,304
The video data is actually one of those things that I find

832
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,840
That's one of the reasons I don't have

833
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:21,888
Have cameras in my home I have talked to

834
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:24,192
Company is not at the big names that we talk

835
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:28,544
Talk about a lot of times but some of the smaller companies and I've talked to security firms who

836
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,568
I've been hired

837
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:32,128
Buy connected home device companies

838
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,920
Devon her ability assessment

839
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:35,200
And they have told me

840
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:36,736
That employees are

841
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:38,272
Often a weak Link in the

842
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:40,064
An access to

843
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,856
Sensitive data by those

844
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:42,624
Someplace

845
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,904
Is something that is off

846
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:44,672
Austin flag

847
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:49,792
I'm all for using like Telemetry data from devices to improve products

848
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:51,072
Services but

849
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:53,120
It either needs to be anonymized

850
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:53,888
Score

851
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:55,168
Android encrypted

852
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:57,728
So that concludes

853
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:59,264
Most of our news for this week

854
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:01,824
Any late-breaking stuff in the newsletter

855
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,616
But it's time for this

856
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:04,896
Voicemail

857
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:06,944
From the iot podcast

858
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:07,712

859
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:09,504

Play

870
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:29,984

742 4

881
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:51,744
And

882
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,536
Let's now get to this week

883
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:55,840
Voicemail which is a problem that

884
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:57,376
We have encountered before

885
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:58,656
Let's hear from me

886
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:01,216
Hey Stacy and Kevin this is Mike in southeast

887
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:02,496
Wisconsin

888
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:03,264
Are you guys

889
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,056
I said the very frustrating weekend trying to get

890
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:06,336
My Christmas lights hooked up

891
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:07,616
To my Google home

892
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:08,640
First time using

893
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:12,480
Animation I went to Amazon bought some indoor and outdoor

894
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:14,016
Outlet to your base

895
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:15,552
Anything I got

896
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:16,576
Phone Wi-Fi

897
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:19,136
Could not pair them to my

898
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:19,904
Dual band

899
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,440
Google onhub router

900
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:22,976
After doing a lot of research

901
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:24,000
Learned that there are

902
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:24,768
Al-aziz

903
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:29,632
Twitches can't hook up to just the 2.4 gigahertz if it's a dual band

904
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:32,704
I had to install an old Wi-Fi extender I had that was

905
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:36,544
To get it to work this morning is there something I should be looking for in the

906
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,616
The future when I'm looking at a smart home device to know that it's

907
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:41,408
2.4

908
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:42,176
And 5 kg

909
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,456
Appreciate the help

910
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,296
Oh my Christine this is been going on

911
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:52,928
For a long time actually it's been going on I would say predominately since Mesh networking has

912
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,976
Is coming to the home because

913
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:56,000
Mesh Networks

914
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:57,024
Typically

915
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:57,792
Credit One

916
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:59,072
Giant Network

917
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:02,400
That uses both 2.4 and 5 gigahertz frequencies

918
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:03,168
So

919
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:05,728
The issue that you're running into as many

920
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:07,008
Home devices

921
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:13,408
Have lower-cost Wi-Fi radios that will only work on say 2.4 gigahertz and that

922
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:17,504
That is a problem because if there's no true 2.4 gigahertz Network out there

923
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,856
Media runs the issue that you are running into I talked to a couple of

924
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:24,160
Device makers of last year at CES

925
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:28,000
About this and I get the impression they were not prepared

926
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:30,816
As an industry for the rise and Mesh networking

927
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:33,376
And they're also trying to keep the cost down of course

928
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:34,144
So

929
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:36,448
Adding in more capable Wi-Fi chips

930
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:37,984
Used tire price

931
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,264
For the products o

932
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:42,592
There's not much you can do and I've experienced this and

933
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:45,152
Cameras and

934
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:47,712
Really what you're doing by adding some other

935
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:52,064
Network peace to your network to just generate its own 2.4 gigahertz

936
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,344
Network is

937
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:55,392
Really all you can do at this point

938
00:31:55,648 --> 00:32:00,512
It's kind of disappointing but until the products evolve to really handle Mesh networking

939
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:01,792
We're all in this

940
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:03,072
Together quite honestly

941
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:03,840
And if I want

942
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:04,608
How to do that

943
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:05,376
How would I do

944
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:12,032
Well what you could do is set up a whole separate Network either a guest Network that run solely on 2.4

945
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:13,056
Darts or you could

946
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:15,872
Sadly through like another router into the mix

947
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:17,920
Hanging off your original router and

948
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:24,320
Creating that separate 2.4 gigahertz Network complexity it's a shame we have to do it but I sort of

949
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:26,368
Stand that I don't like it but I understand it

950
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:27,136
Yeah

951
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:28,416
Spending on your chips

952
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:31,232
Set the former chip reporter

953
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:32,256
Okay

954
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:33,280
Speaking of

955
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:35,072
Problems in the home

956
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:36,096
It's time

957
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:37,120
2

958
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:38,144
Say sayonara

959
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,424
To Kevin and

960
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,216
Join us for our guest

961
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:43,008
And this week's guest is

962
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:48,128
My husband and daughter and we will talk about some of the problems we found in our smart home this year some of the things we

963
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:49,152
Please like and

964
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:50,688
Also how we plan to handle

965
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:52,736
So all of this

966
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:54,016
And more

967
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:55,040
Coming up

968
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:57,088
After this message

969
00:32:58,112 --> 00:33:03,488
Hey everyone we are taking a break from The Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor

970
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:07,840
This week sponsor is digicert and I have Mike Nelson who is VP

971
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:09,888
Of iot security at

972
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:13,472
Digicert can you remind our listeners what it is that digicert

973
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,544
We are the world's leading provider of

974
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,312
Scalpel

975
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:19,104
Pki Security Solutions

976
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,896
Or identity in encryption

977
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:27,296
We provide those solutions for web servers Enterprise security and my favorite of course iot.

978
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:30,112
Digicert recently conducted a survey

979
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:32,928
How organizations are approaching iota

980
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:34,720
The fighting

981
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:36,512
Clearly showed organizations

982
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:39,072
They're putting in place basic cybersecurity

983
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:40,864
Practices are much better off

984
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:47,264
Can you offer us some examples of what can happen if an organization doesn't pay attention to their cybersecurity

985
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:51,360
Yeah there have been a handful of public exploits most of which have been done by

986
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:53,408
Security researchers who controlled environment

987
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:54,944
So we don't see a lot of

988
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,248
These exploits putting consumers at risk

989
00:33:57,504 --> 00:34:02,112
One example would be an attack that was demonstrate by security researcher Charlie Miller

990
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:08,512
A couple years ago when he demonstrated he could get into the infotainment system of a Jeep Cherokee and then from there

991
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:14,912
He could pivot and get into other components of the vehicle like the steering or the air-conditioning ultimately he was

992
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:16,448
Disable the lock the steering and

993
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:20,288
Shut the engine off while the vehicle is going 70 miles an hour down the highway

994
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:24,384
So that attacked the Charlie demonstrated really had an impact on FCA

995
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,664
Who owns Jeep

996
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,944
It caused a lot of damage

997
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:27,968
The reputation

998
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:31,296
Another exploit that has been they fight publicly

999
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:34,624
St Jude Medical they have a cardiac device and there's a

1000
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,392
Security research

1001
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:40,256
Stack that was able to demonstrate they could send repeated messages

1002
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:41,792
The cardiac device Whitaker

1003
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:47,936
Stop and if they would do that enough the battery on that device would run out rendering that device useless

1004
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:49,216
Once they identified that

1005
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:55,616
Do that stay actually been purchased a short position in St Jude Medical stock and they release the vulnerability to

1006
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:57,408
Publix and the day they release

1007
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:58,688
That vulnerability

1008
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:00,480
St Jude Medical stock drop

1009
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:03,808
20% just a significant impact to that company

1010
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:08,160
So there are a lot of threats and the threats to iot are very real

1011
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:11,488
And it's not just to Consumers but it's also to organization

1012
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:13,536
Did you look at St Jude and she

1013
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:16,864
Both of those organizations were hit very hard by bees

1014
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:17,632
Attacks

1015
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:18,912
That is a lot

1016
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:19,680
So what

1017
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:20,960
What is the survey highlight

1018
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:23,008
Like that organizations can do

1019
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:24,288
Protect themselves

1020
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,896
The respondents listed five things that they were doing that we're leaving them to be most

1021
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:30,176
Successful

1022
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:31,456
Performing a risk assessment

1023
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:34,528
Other device and understanding what vulnerabilities it has

1024
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:39,136
Encrypting all of their data that's both data-at-rest as well as data in transit

1025
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:42,976
Just making sure that any connection coming to or from the device

1026
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:47,584
Is properly authenticated making sure that there's Integrity with any updates

1027
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:51,424
Sore patches that are sent to the device and then finally putting them plates

1028
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:53,216
Scalable security solution

1029
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:58,336
All right so where can our listeners go to learn more about the survey and about digicert

1030
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:03,712
Yeah the full details of the survey can be found at our website at digicert. Com forward slash

1031
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:05,248
Iot security

1032
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:15,744
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things

1033
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,512
Podcast

1034
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:18,816
This is your house Stacey Higginbotham

1035
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:21,632
And today as always around this time of year

1036
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:22,912
I am bringing back

1037
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:23,680
My fam

1038
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:27,520
So I have Andrew allemann and

1039
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:28,288
My daughter

1040
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:29,056
Anna

1041
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:29,824
Hi

1042
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,896
Alright so you guys were all ready for this

1043
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:34,432
We're going to be talking about

1044
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:38,016
This year's devices how we feel about living in our home

1045
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:39,552
How maybe the Smart Home

1046
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:40,320
Feels after

1047
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:41,600
The three years of living in it

1048
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:43,136
And anything else you guys want

1049
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:45,184
So let's get it

1050
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,280
Started with we've had an Amazon Echo in our house since

1051
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:51,840
Was he Christmas of 2014

1052
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:54,912
And we started using it to control things that are smart home

1053
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:55,936
Like March

1054
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:56,960
2015

1055
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:58,496
It's been a long time

1056
00:36:59,264 --> 00:36:59,776
As much

1057
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:01,056
Change this year

1058
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:02,592
Who know that much has

1059
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:10,272
Measurement can be frustrating in a couple of ways I think two things one she's not very good at answering questions

1060
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:11,808
Compared to

1061
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:12,832
Google

1062
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:18,720
Is frustrating the other thing is that and I'm not sure if this is because it's the echo show but it seems like

1063
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:20,256
She's getting hard of hearing

1064
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:24,608
Especially in our living room we have to repeat it several times or she miss yours us

1065
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:26,912
Yeah I'm with you

1066
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:28,960
Do you have any thoughts about

1067
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:32,288
This past year with things at our house or anything

1068
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:33,312
That you're like

1069
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:35,104
It's

1070
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:40,992
Daily usage of Madame is definitely I feel like it's going up a bit in our house

1071
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:45,856
You finally like grown accustomed to it in everyday life

1072
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,184
You like to play a lot of music on it don't you

1073
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,208
Music

1074
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:53,024
And this year I finally

1075
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,864
I made it past your blockade in your room like no smart devices

1076
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:59,168
You'd had an Amazon Echo

1077
00:37:59,424 --> 00:37:59,936
For a while

1078
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:02,240
But we also added a Philips hue light

1079
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:04,544
Your room how do you feel about

1080
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:10,432
Name of Philips hue light my room yeah you know how you can tell the echo to turn on your light and turn it off

1081
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:11,456
Internet different colors

1082
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:12,480
I can

1083
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:16,320
You talk to I've been in your room and shown you

1084
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:18,368
So you're turning your light on still by

1085
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,976
Now that you know that you have this

1086
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:25,024
Connect a light bulb in your room how do you feel about it

1087
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:27,072
I guess it's hard to notice

1088
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:31,680
Unless you know beforehand what you can do with it because it doesn't really affect

1089
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:33,216
Like normal usage

1090
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,240
Yeah

1091
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:35,264
Okay so

1092
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,544
Now that we know that

1093
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,824
What else have you guys

1094
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,104
Like tour

1095
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,920
This year's crop of device

1096
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:48,576
I have a little bit of trouble remembering what's come in this year versus previous years we've been in this house now for almost

1097
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:49,344
6

1098
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:53,952
And as you mention the smart home device testing has ramped up over the past few years

1099
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:55,744
With the nest doorbell this year

1100
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:57,280
The Nest doorbell

1101
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:58,304
Your ass was the nest

1102
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,096
Lock we also brought in

1103
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:01,376
The aware

1104
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:02,912
The Google displays

1105
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:04,960
We tested out the onelink smoke

1106
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:07,520
Detector we've tested out

1107
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:08,288
Switches

1108
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:10,592
And possibly some other things I don't remember

1109
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:14,944
So I think the nest doorbell is by far the best doorbell that

1110
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,736
We tried we tried a lot

1111
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:17,760
The fact that it

1112
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:24,160
So quickly pops up on your screen whether that's on your phone or on your showing me the Google display

1113
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:24,928
Why you have

1114
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,000
And the fact that it recognizes people as well

1115
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:32,352
I think by far it's the best doorbell you brought in and probably one of the best

1116
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:33,888
Devices you brought into

1117
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:35,936
Wow that's High Praise

1118
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,472
Anna any thoughts

1119
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:39,008
Definitely banana

1120
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:43,872
I don't know if that was this year last year but I think it really adds a lot of

1121
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:44,640
Architect

1122
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:47,968
Hi to the house but also a lot of light

1123
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:50,016
California

1124
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:53,088
We did we got that actually for Christmas so those are the

1125
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:55,136
We used to call it Nano art

1126
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:56,672
We had to change

1127
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:57,440
The name because

1128
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:58,208
We had some issues

1129
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:02,816
Never met a lot of difficulty with the word Nano art

1130
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:03,584
In fact

1131
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,120
One time when I said

1132
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:06,400
Madame a turn on

1133
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:07,168
Nano art

1134
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,240
She said I think you're asking about flatulence

1135
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:13,568
And she went into a long explanation what flatulence is

1136
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:18,688
So we I guess you recently change that to nanoleaf so hopefully she starts picking that up better

1137
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,248
That it's actually something that I should drive

1138
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:24,576
People kissing with something that happened a lot this year is

1139
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:25,856
As we added

1140
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:28,672
More devices and I tried to organize things a little bit better

1141
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:29,440
I realized

1142
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:30,464
Naming convention

1143
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:31,744
Really matter

1144
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:32,768
And

1145
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:34,048
You really have to be

1146
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:36,608
Be very particular about what you call things

1147
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:37,376
And

1148
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:39,168
There's only so many things you can

1149
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:39,936
Call Lexi

1150
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:40,960
Living room sofa

1151
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:42,752
Some of our rooms got 10.

1152
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:44,288
12 devices in them

1153
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:45,568
It became really comp

1154
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:46,592
To be like

1155
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:47,872
I wish I call this

1156
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:54,528
Question for you why I know he tested Google a little bit as opposed to

1157
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,064
Madam a

1158
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,600
What can Google Now

1159
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:59,648
Do as much not control as much

1160
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:01,952
I feel like

1161
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:04,768
Google is so much better at answering questions

1162
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:07,584
Is there a reason for us not to switch over to Google

1163
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,912
So that was actually one of my questions for you guys about

1164
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:11,936
I'm going to say

1165
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:13,984
9 months ago I

1166
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:14,752
Swapped out

1167
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:16,032
Matinee in our house

1168
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:18,080
Spore Google and I hooked everything up

1169
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:19,104
To Google

1170
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:20,384
U of R device

1171
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:22,432
At the time didn't have connections

1172
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:23,712
Now most

1173
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:24,480
Do

1174
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:25,248
So

1175
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:27,296
It shouldn't be a big issue we would

1176
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:28,064
Duluth

1177
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:29,856
But the other issue with

1178
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:31,648
Google the reason why I think we

1179
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:32,928
Didn't use it very much

1180
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,208
Was actually that

1181
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,232
Spotify

1182
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,512
Terrible in it

1183
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:39,072
Keep playing the wrong songs or

1184
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:40,096
Really stupid like

1185
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:41,888
Play the karaoke versions of

1186
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,168
Popular songs

1187
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,448
But I think that's

1188
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:47,008
And I was going to say

1189
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:49,824
Suggest for you guys that we swap out

1190
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:53,407
I would actually like us to try going all Google

1191
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:54,687
We will lose a couple

1192
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:58,015
I guess could Anna still use

1193
00:41:58,271 --> 00:42:00,831
The matinee in her room for music

1194
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:01,599
Of course

1195
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:04,927
I think if we could still have Madam a there for playing music

1196
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:08,767
In touch but have Google for controlling things since Google

1197
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:11,071
Can also do the other things I think much better

1198
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:13,887
Then I think we're trying again this coming here

1199
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:14,911
What do you think

1200
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:16,703
I think that sounds wonderful

1201
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:20,543
Do you want to try Google in your room and some ways some of our Google device

1202
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:22,847
Scary thing to think about is some of our Google devices

1203
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:24,127
As screen

1204
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:24,895
And

1205
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:27,967
But you watch like Netflix or

1206
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:29,247
YouTube videos

1207
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:31,295
Which I think is a big deal for

1208
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:32,063
Anna

1209
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:35,135
Necessarily want Springs in our room

1210
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:38,719
Although I like the photo frame element of

1211
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:39,999
Google displays

1212
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:40,767
I'll be honest

1213
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:43,583
And you can cover the camera right

1214
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:45,119
You can cover the camera

1215
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:47,679
And then the brand new Google home

1216
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:49,727
Actually doesn't have a cam

1217
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:50,751
It's

1218
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:52,799
Just a tinier version of that that

1219
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:56,383
That might be so

1220
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:57,663
Chesapeake

1221
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:58,431
Because

1222
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:00,991
At night you don't want to always talk to it you can

1223
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:03,807
Hit the screen and then have it do whatever you wanted to do

1224
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:05,087
And I should clarify

1225
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,647
People that Andrew actually has an iPhone

1226
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:08,415
So

1227
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:11,999
Are you still looking for homekit is that something you're still like

1228
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:12,767
Maybe one day

1229
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:19,423
I have not played with homekit at all on my phone I think the only time we've used iPhone Chris to test home get stuff

1230
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:23,519
Perhaps it's because we started so early before home kid

1231
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:29,919
But I feel like this is why I'm a little bit scared to switch to Google I feel like we're finally to a point where things J

1232
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:35,295
Work most of the time with the exception of Madam a hearing what we say

1233
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:41,695
So I think even if we put the cylinder the original cylinder Madame a down where the echo

1234
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:42,463
Joanns

1235
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:44,255
Working on that wood

1236
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:45,535
Solve that issue

1237
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:47,327
I think of the hearing

1238
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,607
The 7 mic array

1239
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,399
So it sounds like

1240
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:51,167
We're going to be

1241
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:52,191
Giving away

1242
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:54,239
Or giving up our first gen

1243
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:56,287
And swapping it out with

1244
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:57,055
My Google

1245
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:58,335
Which I think

1246
00:43:58,591 --> 00:43:59,103
Would be fun

1247
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:01,663
And let's talk about some of the other devices

1248
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:03,199
Tried so

1249
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:04,991
Anna you are fan of the nanoleaf

1250
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:06,271
We also

1251
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:07,039
Tried

1252
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:08,063
An air quality

1253
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:08,831
Detection device

1254
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:11,135
I don't know if you guys have opinions about this

1255
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:12,671
I find myself like

1256
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:13,439
Constantly look

1257
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:14,207
Looking at it now

1258
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:16,255
Are we in the clear are we training

1259
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:18,303
Do you guys notice it at all

1260
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:20,607
I do it seems very sense

1261
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:25,727
And I don't know if it's very helpful if every time you cook it says over the air quality is not as good

1262
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:28,543
Well every time you cook you are putting things in the air

1263
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:30,335
That's one of the all of the

1264
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:31,359
Environmental science

1265
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:35,199
I talked to one of the best things you can do for your indoor air quality

1266
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:36,735
He is get a really good down dress

1267
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:42,879
Two if I'm listening to this podcast here a couple days before Christmas

1268
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:44,927
And I wanted to get one more gift

1269
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:49,535
Or someone in my family I probably go with the nanoleaf as Anna said it's just

1270
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:52,607
It's fun I think she said in your YouTube video

1271
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:54,911
Are you described it that it's useless

1272
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:58,239
And yes it's more for entertainment than for anything else

1273
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:03,359
But the Rhythm cat where it responds to music and voices and just the light

1274
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:04,639
Is beautiful

1275
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:07,711
The color light is just absolutely beautiful and it really

1276
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:11,807
Cloudy day really warms up the house with all the different colors in it

1277
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:14,111
Boots recently

1278
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:15,135
Inexpensive

1279
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:15,903
If I had

1280
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:18,207
More time because I'm sure you can get it shipped

1281
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:19,487
Between now and then

1282
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:22,815
Fact that the June oven is so much cheaper now how much is it

1283
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:24,095
You can buy the June oven now

1284
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:31,775
Yeah I mean that is I loved it even at $1,500 and thought it was worth it so it's $600 I think it's a no

1285
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:33,311
Especially if

1286
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:34,847
You have only one oven

1287
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:36,127
And would like to add

1288
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:38,687
Another one just a little table top one

1289
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:40,223
I think it's

1290
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:41,503
Worth every penny

1291
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:44,063
Okay and just so people know the nanoleaf

1292
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:45,855
Is about $200

1293
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:47,647
I need to buy expansion kits for about 6

1294
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:51,999
Vitamin C Apple store or Best Buy and the June you do have to

1295
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:55,071
Wonder in you have to order it online I believe they're back

1296
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:56,607
For a while there

1297
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:57,375
A runaway hit

1298
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:58,911
But it is it is a really good to buy

1299
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,191
Also

1300
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:01,471
Nest doorbell cam

1301
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:03,775
I have a question because

1302
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:05,055
I talked about this a lot

1303
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:06,591
But I love when I'm out of

1304
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:08,383
The town I loved being able to

1305
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:10,431
To check in on the doorbell cam when you guys

1306
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:11,199
Leave the house

1307
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:15,039
I always like look and see what you're wearing for the day or like

1308
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:17,599
Look to see how you're doing do you like

1309
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:20,159
And when you come home it makes

1310
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:22,719
But I'm also like

1311
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:25,791
Gyarados or something

1312
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:26,815
She's like

1313
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:28,863
Is she aware that there's a camera there and I'm

1314
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:30,143
Keep it in

1315
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:30,911
Is outside

1316
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:35,519
Thanks for telling us

1317
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:42,175
Stalker confirmed

1318
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:44,991
Matt crate

1319
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:46,271
I don't

1320
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:47,039
Show

1321
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:48,063
Anybody I just

1322
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:50,367
All my family I love you all

1323
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:56,767
I definitely feel like it a divisional element like inside of town we can see in Austin

1324
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:58,559
Literally downpouring right now

1325
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:00,863
Or we can see like

1326
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:04,191
Is

1327
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:05,727
Treaty

1328
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:12,383
Oh and you know what else were you brought into the house this year we brought in we don't have it set up all the time

1329
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:13,407
Because we don't like

1330
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:15,711
The house but we brought the wyze cameras

1331
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:18,015
So I don't know if you in those are the

1332
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:20,063
$20 or $30 for the pan

1333
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:23,903
Andrew do you have thoughts I know that we set them up when we're going on vacation

1334
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:25,951
Yeah I thought it was

1335
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:31,327
Fine then I guess if you need cameras internal cameras it seems like a great Buy

1336
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:33,375
Another thing that you do

1337
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:35,423
Sometimes when you're out of town speaking of

1338
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:38,495
Cameras is your call in on the Echo Show

1339
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:40,287
I guess you're dropping in

1340
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:41,823
Be nice if we're down

1341
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:43,615
Stairs not listen

1342
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:44,639
Mom's puppy

1343
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:46,943
Oh yes I actually this year I

1344
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:47,711
Call

1345
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:49,503
And dropped in on the echo

1346
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:50,271
Show

1347
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:52,575
And gave Anna a tour of

1348
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:53,343
FB

1349
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:55,135
Chihuly Museum in

1350
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:56,159
Seattle

1351
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:57,695
Because I was there at Microsoft

1352
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:03,327
I was like this place is beautiful I have to show her so I use my smartphone camera

1353
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:07,167
I called her and then I just I took her on a little tour of the museum with me

1354
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:09,215
Doesn't talk about the illegal part

1355
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:10,751
I don't think it's

1356
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:13,055
Did you was at funny inner or was I just

1357
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:14,591
It's kind of like I will humor you Mom

1358
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:18,431
It was very fun and it was the fact that I was able to watch

1359
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:23,807
What you were doing with your device all the way across the country just

1360
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:26,879
I'm sitting and eating cereal in my pajamas

1361
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:27,903
Is pretty cool

1362
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:30,975
All right and then let's see we also

1363
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:33,023
I'm coming to terms with other devices

1364
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:34,815
We brought a Smart Smoke

1365
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:36,095
Detector that was also

1366
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:38,399
Echo speaker into the house

1367
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:42,239
Did you n Oleander you said that you thought it was kind of need that it would

1368
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:43,263
Send you a text

1369
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:44,543
Smoke alarm went off

1370
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:46,847
Did you have any thoughts or it was pretty expensive

1371
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:48,639
It's a $200 or two hundred

1372
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:49,663
$50 smoke

1373
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:50,943
So you know

1374
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:52,223
I don't know if you want a lot of

1375
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:54,271
Your house but did you have any thoughts on that

1376
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:59,391
Play around with it for a long time but

1377
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:03,999
Well to be fair we already have speakers in our ceilings and in the rooms where I listen to music

1378
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:06,047
And we already have

1379
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:11,423
Fairly recent smoke detectors with the CO2 detectors that talk and all that jazz so

1380
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:13,471
The texting thing I guess is okay

1381
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:17,055
Okay but I don't think I would pay that much money for that

1382
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:19,359
And that's totally fair

1383
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:20,639
We brought in brilliant

1384
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:22,175
End

1385
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:24,735
We had kind of a bad experience the first time around

1386
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:27,039
And I haven't really spent a lot of time

1387
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:28,319
Treating them since then

1388
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:30,623
How do you guys feel about the light switch

1389
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:32,415
That show you your photos

1390
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:35,487
Play your favorite playlist from

1391
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:36,767
Your Sonos from them

1392
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:38,815
Yeah I guess if it was in a

1393
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:45,215
Perfect location for that and make a lot of sense but must light switches aren't in a location where I would

1394
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:48,799
Need to go over and maybe control those sorts of things

1395
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:55,199
And the other thing is that stuff with you by voice now right if we want to hear music we asked Madame a to play The Muse

1396
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:57,247
And frankly turning on

1397
00:49:57,503 --> 00:50:00,575
Light switches we do the same thing a lot I mean really

1398
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:04,671
The past couple months at least our house of brilliant has just been a beautiful light switch

1399
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:06,207
Okay

1400
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:07,231
So we

1401
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:09,023
Pretty much done everything we can

1402
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:10,047
Can do it feels like

1403
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:11,071
This point in time

1404
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:12,351
Are there any things

1405
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:14,911
Dang it I wish that you could make this summer

1406
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:15,935
Mom

1407
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:16,703
Maybe it's

1408
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:19,263
You know last year you complained about the blinds not work

1409
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:22,079
I finally did that yay

1410
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:24,639
So any other things that you're like Manor

1411
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:26,431
I really wish this were a little bit smarter

1412
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:32,063
I feel like personally dog collars would be really cool like if you just had smart dog collars

1413
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:32,831
Eureka.

1414
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:37,439
Our dog is for the many occasions in which she meanders across

1415
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:38,463
Chasing rabbits

1416
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:39,999
We could just

1417
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:44,095
Know where she is then like a Fitbit for a job

1418
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:45,119
They make those

1419
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:47,679
Yes

1420
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:49,983
So okay for the dog

1421
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:51,519
Now you know they make

1422
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:53,055
And Andrew anything

1423
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:53,823
But you're like

1424
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:54,847
How I really would like this

1425
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:56,639
You know I and I think

1426
00:50:56,895 --> 00:50:58,175
Haven't talked about

1427
00:50:58,431 --> 00:51:02,783
Something like this exhaust fan I guess when people are using the shower

1428
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:03,807
Shirt turned on

1429
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:06,111
I know a lot of people put those on timers

1430
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:08,671
But I find that we turn them on and then we don't turn them off

1431
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:10,207
12 hours later

1432
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:16,607
Would be neat if there's a way to kind of turn those on and then have them last for say 15 minutes after you

1433
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:19,679
So I guess I'll be a motion detection or something there

1434
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:20,959
I believe that

1435
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:23,263
Having a kind of finagle something in his house

1436
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:24,287
Yeah

1437
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:26,591
Now do you want to be 15 minutes after

1438
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:29,407
Someone leaves or do you want it to be 15 minutes

1439
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:30,175
After its

1440
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:36,575
Question I guess if you could set the amount of time maybe the 30 minutes I know a lot of people this is

1441
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:42,719
One of the energy saving things in new devices where they put those on a timers when you turn it on it's like a 15 minute timer

1442
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:47,327
I think that would be helpful though that's one of those things that I know we waste electricity on

1443
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:49,375
I can definitely make that happen

1444
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:52,191
Jessup crazy sensor

1445
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:54,495
All right I should tell you guys

1446
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:58,591
It's because at CSM expecting a lot of crazy smart bathroom

1447
00:51:58,847 --> 00:51:59,359
Products

1448
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:03,455
And we have a we didn't talk about this but the Delta faucet downstairs

1449
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:08,063
But I'm curious like

1450
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:09,855
How you guys do things like

1451
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:13,951
Two bathroom mirrors that maybe do light settings when you come in or baby a

1452
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:15,487
Toilet that

1453
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:16,511
Music

1454
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:20,095
When you're in the toilet room

1455
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:25,983
You know I kind of felt when smoke detector kind of like we were at the

1456
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:29,311
Point of a toilet playing music

1457
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:31,615
You know it's just like

1458
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:33,663
You could say Madeleine

1459
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:38,015
Do my morning routine and that might include your shower before you get into

1460
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:42,879
Comic rushing you to do things that like not your own pace but as a

1461
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:44,415
ASAP by

1462
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:45,439
Previous song

1463
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:47,743
That's true and I run into that a lot

1464
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:50,303
I set up a program for something and then like

1465
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:54,399
I've never going to wake up that early to need my blinds

1466
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:55,167
Open at this time

1467
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:59,519
So the Madam a enabled faucet from Delta is pretty cool now

1468
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:03,615
I'll be on it so the touch feature which we hadn't before we added Madam a

1469
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:04,383
Was really

1470
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:07,711
Right we use that multiple times a day

1471
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:11,551
Maybe a couple times a week when I need to measure out water

1472
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:14,367
For something rather than getting out of measuring cup

1473
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:15,391
Put the pot under it

1474
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:17,183
And ask her to

1475
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:20,511
Dispensary cups water so that's pretty cool but

1476
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:23,583
I guess it could be helpful in the bathroom

1477
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:26,399
You know if I'm about to brush my teeth right

1478
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:32,799
And usually I just step into the shower and go ahead and turn it on to the temperature or right before doing that but

1479
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:37,151
Series similar functionality on the faucet in the shower

1480
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:38,687
Okay it's not going to happen

1481
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:39,455
Cuz you need Alexa

1482
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:41,247
Christian Dior shower and historically

1483
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:42,271
People don't do that

1484
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:44,575
But we'll keep that in mind

1485
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:45,599
Wind & Fire

1486
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:47,647
You guys cuz we are about to move

1487
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:49,695
We are moving in June from this

1488
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:53,023
And part of what I'm trying to think about is

1489
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:54,047
We're going to go into event

1490
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:56,863
So what do we take with us

1491
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:58,143
What do we leave here

1492
00:53:58,399 --> 00:53:59,423
And what are you going to miss

1493
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:03,519
I vote we take the nanoleaf

1494
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:04,543
Bee hive

1495
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:05,567
I feel like

1496
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:07,615
No matter where you go it's

1497
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:09,407
Pretty portable you don't need to like

1498
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:11,199
Build it in Chinese

1499
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:11,967
So that

1500
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:13,759
And it just helps

1501
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:15,551
Liven up anyway because

1502
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:18,367
You can just personalize it and help

1503
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:21,183
Make an impact on the ambience of a room

1504
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:22,463
We'll take the nanoleaf

1505
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:27,327
June obviously it's not attached and that will be excellent

1506
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:30,655
I think Alexa might need to come with us to

1507
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:31,679
Vans

1508
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:32,703
Yes so those will be

1509
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:38,079
Portable and then remove what are you going to miss most cuz we're going to move into a house where you can no longer say

1510
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:38,847
Meta major

1511
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:39,871
Turn on the lights

1512
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:41,663
I think it's going to be the lights

1513
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:48,063
Which I guess we could use the Hue right where it's light bulbs rather than the light switch but the light switch

1514
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:49,343
I'll be able to turn it

1515
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:51,135
On and off and

1516
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:56,767
To a certain level like 50% is probably what I used the most in our home

1517
00:54:57,023 --> 00:55:01,887
I feel like for me it might be the modern-day control Delta faucet because

1518
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:07,007
I very lazy when it comes to measuring out water and most of the time I'm not sure like

1519
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:11,871
Helpful is One Bank what is a pipe do I just take my ice cream container and fill it

1520
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:17,503
And then it got confusing so it's kind of nice to be able to depend on someone else for that

1521
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:19,807
Excellent so we'll have to buy more measuring cups

1522
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:22,367
Maybe some remote can

1523
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:23,135
Controlled

1524
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:24,415
Light bulbs I don't know

1525
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:25,439
Okay

1526
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:27,999
Guys thank you so much for doing the show

1527
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:29,791
Again with me and

1528
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:32,607
We'll see what connected goodies are under the tree this year

1529
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:33,887
Alright you're welcome

1530
