00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:12,032
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast I am your host

2
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:13,312
Stacey Higginbotham

3
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:14,336
And this is my

4
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:15,104
My co-host

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,128
Kevin tofel

6
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:18,944
And we are here to talk about

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,224
That's awesome things

8
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:22,016
And moonshine

9
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:25,856
Let's get started with the news that Oral Roberts

10
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:30,464
I don't know how to stay religious University the

11
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:33,536
That's kind of what it is

12
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:35,584
That's what it world

13
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:38,912
So this university has is putting

14
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:40,960
Mandatory fitbit's on its students

15
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:47,616
Which a lot of people like crazy but it's important to note that students actually before they were

16
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:49,408
Stuck with mandatory fitbit's

17
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:51,456
To track people's Motion in health

18
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:52,224
Fitness

19
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:54,272
They actually had it

20
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,064
Fitness and activities

21
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,088
Beforehand

22
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,112
So

23
00:00:58,624 --> 00:00:59,136
This is

24
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:00,160
Yes

25
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:02,720
A technological upgrade but it is not

26
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:04,256
Like

27
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:06,816
Like totally crazy so

28
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:08,864
I think it's a little crazy what do you think Kevin

29
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:15,520
Oh I don't know I'm in there fighting the Freshman 15 that's often so happens in my son will be a freshman this fall at his university

30
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:17,312
It'll be curious to see what happens there

31
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:20,384
Again late like you said they've been requiring students to

32
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,664
Kind of monitor

33
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:24,224
Aerobic activity and such manually

34
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:29,088
This kind of adds more data to the to the process and makes it simpler I'm in

35
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:30,368
If you're wearing Fitbit

36
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:31,648
Got your Fitbit account

37
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:35,232
You know you don't have to to manually do really anything which is kind of nice

38
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:37,792
I don't have the students feel about having the

39
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:40,352
School have access to that data

40
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:42,400
You know overall I think it's a good thing

41
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:44,448
It's a lot of data

42
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,472
You shouldn't have to log

43
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:48,032
Well I don't know if you had to log your sleep data

44
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:51,616
I'm just thinking about all the data that my Fitbit

45
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:54,944
Not sure which fitbit's there

46
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,480
Getting exactly

47
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:57,760
You know some of them

48
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,552
Log more data than others

49
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:05,696
And there's the one they're using doesn't have GPS so it's not like the school can actually see where everybody is or isn't

50
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,744
Which is a plus I think

51
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,768
That is a plus

52
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,608
Now you can see what people are psychoactive

53
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,424
One of the quotes in the article in the guardian was

54
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,496
When they're on spring break in Africa or South Africa

55
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:19,264
Weekend

56
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,568
You don't see how active they are in like

57
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,408
Yeah

58
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:28,736
I like the intent here and there trying to do something

59
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,784
Positive

60
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,576
Yeah yeah

61
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:34,880
And it says it is an issue

62
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:37,696
The real issue that they're trying to resolve them it's pretty

63
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:41,536
I would say you know everybody goes to college and games away but it's it's a common

64
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:43,584
The common challenge so

65
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:45,888
You know I kind of think it should be

66
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:46,912
An opt-in

67
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:47,680
Saying

68
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:48,448
But

69
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:50,752
There are technically I think requiring this

70
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:51,520
They are

71
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:55,360
Let's let's twist it a little bit

72
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,640
What if you're in

73
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,408
Lawyer

74
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,688
Had you often

75
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,736
You know

76
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:02,272
Nothing Forest

77
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,832
I'm pretty much okay with

78
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:07,136
Any opt-in solution

79
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:11,488
Quite honestly you know as long as I've got control and I make that choice so

80
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:14,304
I'm going to say person I don't have a problem with that

81
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:15,328
No

82
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:17,632
What if your health insurance starts doing this

83
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,192
If

84
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:23,776
Himmler

85
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,408
Yeah and I think you know whether you agree with it or not I think that's kind of where we're heading

86
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:31,968
I don't think it's very far-fetched to think that in

87
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,760
Five years or less

88
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:34,784
You know that's the

89
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,832
More common than it is today

90
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:42,464
You know I'm in it it's helping the business the insurance company better managed healthcare and

91
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,768
And subscribers so I know

92
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,632
I don't know if it's to the point where it's almost like the whole privacy thing when they kicked up ears

93
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:50,912
I got one still going on

94
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:52,192
At some point

95
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:55,264
You know what if we have to give if we want to get something in return

96
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,056
Now I will

97
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,592
I would be in

98
00:03:59,360 --> 00:03:59,872
You know there's a

99
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:04,736
All the lawsuits there's I think a class action lawsuit right now against Fitbit for accuracy

100
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:05,504
Are there

101
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,784
Heart rate monitor

102
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,320
I believe it is the heart rate monitor

103
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,088
So

104
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:11,136
I am kind of intrigued by the idea of

105
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:13,696
Man once someone sues over this then

106
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,232
Do we get the lawsuits

107
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,768
You know well

108
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:19,071
How accurate is this anyway do we have

109
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:19,839
Federal settings

110
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:23,679
Which I actually think is an interesting kind of question because

111
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:29,567
There's even some doubt about the 10000 steps is that a really great gator health

112
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:35,455
I will be the first to argue you know that maybe it's not the best gauge maybe because I only

113
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:37,759
Achieve like 6000 steps a day

114
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,039
WeChat

115
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,831
I just admit that

116
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,623
Everyone who listens to the show

117
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,927
6000 steps a day

118
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:47,743
You don't my resting heart rate still at like

119
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,535
Channel 52

120
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,303
So

121
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,095
Okay

122
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:59,007
Yeah I mean you and I are mostly work-from-home people so it's not like we're walking to catch a bus or walking around

123
00:04:59,263 --> 00:04:59,775
City that much

124
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:00,799
Turn the work today

125
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:04,383
I still like the idea of having that goal in the end

126
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,223
The apps and devices I'm using these days you let me set that goal I don't have to

127
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,575
Make it a default 10,000 or live with that I've actually got mindset to 8000

128
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:17,951
It's a guideline and I think it's good to have because it it gamify something so that way you can

129
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:18,975
You know

130
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:20,767
They have something to shoot for during the day.

131
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:26,399
That's true maybe we should be partners Kevin we just had our steps together

132
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:31,519
I would be embarrassed cuz some days I barely even

133
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:40,223
I'm pretty good now I've been running everyday since the beginning of the year so rough about its

134
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,271
It's almost 2000 steps for every mile

135
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:45,855
And most days I don't even have to go walk around which is good

136
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:50,207
OKC and I even take like yoga or Barre classes and I'm

137
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:50,975
I'm still not itchy

138
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:56,863
That's not true it's a different type of thing you're not achieving steps

139
00:05:57,119 --> 00:06:00,447
But the steps is not the end-all be-all again it's a guideline away

140
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,471
A simple wave

141
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,007
Everybody can

142
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:05,567
Get a little healthier at least be more Health aware that's all

143
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,871
So Oral Roberts may or may not

144
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,407
Be pleased with us

145
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,687
Our insurance

146
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:15,295
So we hang on

147
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:19,135
Aren't there some insurance firms already doing this like made with an automatic or

148
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,927
Or someone will give you a reduced rate

149
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:23,231
Automatically

150
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:27,839
Exactly

151
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,631
I wasn't thinking about it

152
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,447
It just rolls right off of the time

153
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,495
I would have to double-check

154
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:37,055
What if someone is so USAA

155
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:40,127
Infested and automatic and is researching using

156
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,991
I do not know if they actually have a program in place yet for ottoman

157
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,855
I was thinking actually of progressive I'm pretty sure they have something that you can plug in and

158
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,135
What's my next one

159
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,671
The progressive

160
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,207
It's on black box

161
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:54,975
State it is

162
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:57,279
A 6-month program though

163
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:59,327
It is not a program that

164
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,863
Continuously running

165
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,679
And it's not then it is an option

166
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,447
And

167
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:06,495
You share your data with them for 6

168
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,287
The driving dead

169
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,591
So yes

170
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:13,919
I probably would do it

171
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,199
I believe

172
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:18,015
Are going to be some kind of

173
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,807
New stuff this year so

174
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:23,135
State Farm is looking at this USAA

175
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:26,719
Is also looking at this and so is American family

176
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:27,999
Which has

177
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:31,071
Have some interesting kind of investments in the space

178
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:37,727
This year should be the year that insurance starts getting kind of crazy Innovative with some of the stuff

179
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,519
Look for it

180
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:40,543
Okay

181
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,847
Let's move on to

182
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,127
This week's news

183
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:46,175
Which was actually kind of big

184
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,199
On Monday

185
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:47,967
Alphabet

186
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:48,991
Reported earnings

187
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:52,063
For the first time that broke out all of the little bit

188
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,855
The alphabets in a little bit

189
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,135
Cleverly called it

190
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,159
Show the other bats

191
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,183
The other guys

192
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,975
And Google reported

193
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,255
75

194
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,583
With a B

195
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,887
Revenue that's Olive

196
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:06,655
Google

197
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:07,679
And

198
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,727
That's 23-point

199
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:10,751
4

200
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,543
23 points

201
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,567
Ford

202
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:15,359
I was deciding how far I wanted to round

203
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:18,175
23.4 billion

204
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,479
Again with the b in operating in

205
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,319
For the year so that's for all the 2015

206
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,599
That's a lot of money

207
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,135
Mostly an ad Revenue

208
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:29,183
Little better that's probably from the cloud

209
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:29,951
Segment

210
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,743
And then the other bets

211
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,023
Include things like

212
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,047
Nest

213
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,583
Project access

214
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:36,863
And

215
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,655
Those are probably the ones that are made

216
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:40,191
Money

217
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,983
Made for deer

218
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:44,799
448 million

219
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,103
And they had an operating loss of

220
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,127
3 point

221
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,919
6 billion

222
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:50,687
With me

223
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,711
Yeah so

224
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:52,735
It's a big loss

225
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,015
But

226
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,551
The money that it made

227
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:58,367
That's coming from things like nest

228
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,391
And

229
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,159
Viber

230
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:03,999
It's kind of disappointing because I was hoping to see Nest make

231
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,023
A lot more

232
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,047
And

233
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:12,447
Recode actually had a story back in November where they expected Nest annual sales to be 450 million

234
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:17,823
Yeah this is just under that if it 448 million for all of the other Revenue

235
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,359
Yeah and we were I mean

236
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:21,151
Google actually making money

237
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,431
Fiber in

238
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:24,735
A couple of like three or four cities now

239
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,551
Provo Kansas City Austin

240
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,599
Where they have actual customers

241
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:33,183
So granted they probably don't have a lot of customers

242
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,487
But they're making money on those guys to

243
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:36,511
So

244
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,303
The nuts and bolts of it

245
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:42,143
When I saw this number was maybe the nest business isn't as big as we thought it was

246
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,263
I don't know that that means

247
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,335
Shouldn't have spent the was at 3 billion dollars

248
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,103
Sunrise

249
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:51,871
Amnesty

250
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:53,663
3.2

251
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:55,711
Yeah

252
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:58,527
I meant okay I mean that's that's a big figure I'm in the end

253
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,319
Eli getting back 10%

254
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,599
This particular year

255
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:08,255
At best because they're ugly said there are other things that Google can make money on in the other bets category or segment again

256
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:10,815
But I think it's a long-term investment

257
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,863
Wasn't just the hardware it was

258
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:15,679
Just the technology and so on so I

259
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:18,751
What the remains to be seen that how Nest expenses business

260
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,287
Cuz right now they're really what

261
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,311
Just a couple products

262
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,591
There's Nest cam

263
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:24,639
Protect and then there

264
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,431
Sprite

265
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,199
Alright so

266
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:32,319
Nest eventually be the smart home brand for all of Google products

267
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:34,367
Ways to say I don't know yet

268
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,135
Swelling

269
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:38,207
The other thing to think about is Nest as a proxy for the home

270
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:38,975
The smartphone

271
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:40,511
And

272
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:44,863
Coming away from all this I I was kind of struck by that number because

273
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,143
WeMo

274
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,423
Has admitted that

275
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,191
Has admittedly

276
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,215
This is something to be ashamed

277
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,495
But they have

278
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,263
One point

279
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,287
5 million

280
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,079
Yeah we met

281
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,103
Chamillionaire

282
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:00,991
That's looking at this number

283
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,015
Furness

284
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,575
But maybe a million user

285
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:07,391
Assuming all of that revenue is for nest

286
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,183
Max of 2

287
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:15,327
United States around 1.25 Ash maybe 1.5 the same as we do it best

288
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,375
Yeah assuming all

289
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,143
And

290
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:21,215
That's most people who have one Nest product

291
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:22,495
Usually

292
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:26,591
I'm going to guess have another one I mean I'm just thinking if you have a nest protect

293
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,615
She probably have

294
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,687
Most likely

295
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,967
The people I know with an s

296
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:32,991
Respirtech usually have

297
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,271
Multiple Nest protects

298
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,575
Sprint

299
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,879
So that's an interesting time now

300
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,415
I will say

301
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,463
Last year in

302
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:48,863
Early late in the fall kind of timeframe last year is when Nest started announcing Partnerships with ATT with American

303
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:51,679
Family with a lot of like the insurance and security forms

304
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,215
Was like hey

305
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,239
You sign up for

306
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:57,823
If you sign up for like ATT service or

307
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,103
Do you want to get like

308
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:01,151
An insurance discount

309
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,175
What give you

310
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:03,967
Nest protect

311
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,551
Discount so

312
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,319
That's

313
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:14,463
It's going to take time for that to kick in

314
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,487
1 state right now

315
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,559
That'll be really interest

316
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,655
Yeah we might get a better idea on that in the next

317
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,959
1 or to Coeur d'Alene

318
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:27,775
Reports now that we're getting is Breakout by segment

319
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:31,359
So and it'll be worthwhile to see

320
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:33,663
I mean it'll be nice to see some more

321
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:36,479
Segmentation possibly on fiber

322
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:39,039
As the FCC starts releasing more

323
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:42,879
We might be able to get more interested more information there too

324
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:45,439
On how how fiber penetration is going

325
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:52,095
Yeah I don't know because I mean when I had heard that they were in a reorganizing to alphabet never going to report by side

326
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,119
Simonson's salon

327
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:56,959
I figured we'd see bits from each company here but really

328
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:59,519
All the non cortical Google companies

329
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:02,335
Under alphabet where Lumpkin child are bats in

330
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,615
And I listen to the car

331
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:08,479
Call Annette some in other bets include their efforts on

332
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:11,039
The smart contact lenses with verily

333
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:13,087
But we're not seeing all that broken out

334
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:15,391
We are a step closer to the big picture but

335
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:17,183
Not that much closer

336
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,207
I wouldn't expect

337
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,023
I mean all of these

338
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,047
So young

339
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:26,911
If you're a startup trying to do anything you don't want to be all transparent with

340
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,703
What are bats and efforts

341
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,751
Cuz then other people will like

342
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,031
Do with that data

343
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:34,079
Yeah that's good point that's good point

344
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,103
This way there

345
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:44,831
Now if you're like a smart home company if you're like

346
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,623
Ecobee or Honeywell you're like

347
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,695
Wechat data

348
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:51,231
It's not great day. But

349
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,511
It's a little bit more clear

350
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:55,327
And now maybe you feel better or make me feel worse I don't know

351
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,375
By The Way We Were

352
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,399
Looking for the

353
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:03,007
Quarterly revenue for Google in the other bets just before the show here and

354
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:04,031
I just found it

355
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,847
They're a bunch of tables on the bottom of the press release so

356
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:11,199
If you're curious the other bets for the holiday. Which I would think would be good for

357
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,223
Sacred nest

358
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:14,783
Was 151 million in revenues

359
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:17,855
Prior quarter was 142

360
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:21,439
Then summertime 75 last March 80

361
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,463
So

362
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:26,815
10 holiday 2014 was 106 million * 151

363
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,863
Million for 706

364
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:29,887
Year-over-year

365
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,423
Brother bets

366
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,703
Oh so it went down

367
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:34,751
You know I went out from 106

368
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:35,519
I'm sorry

369
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:39,359
06 December 31st 2014

370
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:42,687
To 100 to 1 million December 31st 2015

371
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,711
Misspell that advertise

372
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:47,039
All the fancy psychedelic Nest as I saw everywhere

373
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:47,807
Okay

374
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:51,647
Well let's move on from moonshots to something for the

375
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,975
Tinkers at we got two things for the Tinkers actually

376
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:55,743
Bring it

377
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,279
1 is

378
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,815
How to build your own

379
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,095
Amazon Echo

380
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,375
Kevin

381
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:04,191
This is interesting it's an echo clone

382
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:07,519
But it doesn't use and it surprised me when I saw that the details of it

383
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,799
It doesn't use

384
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:11,615
Amazon support services that Google services

385
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:13,663
What I thought it would but it doesn't it

386
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:16,223
It's actually using IBM Watson

387
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,527
And the Intel Edison board

388
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:21,855
Getting Watson for the speech-to-text that's kind of interesting

389
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,135
So

390
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,927
So if you if you don't trust

391
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:25,951
Amazon

392
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:26,719
For some reason

393
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:34,399
That's your choice but you'll need an Arduino

394
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:36,447
Expansion board for the Intel Edison

395
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,775
USB micro Bluetooth speaker Keno odds and ends

396
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,311
I have plenty of the my closet

397
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:44,127
And then a working knowledge of node. Js

398
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,479
Nodejs

399
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:55,647
Codes actually in this and then I'm assuming we're going to Lincoln the show nuts all the code is is here on GitHub and in the

400
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,671
Blog post

401
00:15:56,927 --> 00:16:02,815
Showing you how to make it work I mean like here's how it how it tried ties into DuckDuckGo is instant answer API

402
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,351
4 searches for example women

403
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,399
It if you're into coding at all

404
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:08,703
It's kind of interesting just to look at I think

405
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:11,007
Yeah and it's not $180

406
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,543
If you bought all these parts

407
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:13,567
You're probably looking at

408
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,103
I don't know what the

409
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:18,175
Expansion board in the

410
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:20,223
An Intel Edison Hardware goes for

411
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,783
I would think most people have a USB mic

412
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:25,855
Probably a bazooka Bluetooth speaker that they could use

413
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,159
I was following the links and I thought it would be like

414
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,951
Oh here's where you can buy it

415
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,231
But it it's just that

416
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:33,791
System architecture

417
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,071
Yeah

418
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,351
Corazon

419
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:37,631
All right

420
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:40,703
So I'm going to put the links in the show notes cuz

421
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,519
You know I know there enough of you guys out there who are like

422
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:46,079
Crazy enough to want to do this so you do build this

423
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,359
Let us know how it went

424
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:53,759
Because I would love it so info at iot podcast. Cam is where you would tell me or send me an email to tell me

425
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:54,783
Funny how this goes

426
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:57,343
Before we talk about our next kind of developer Orient

427
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:00,671
Two thing actually don't let's talk about that first and then we'll get to our last

428
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:01,439
Segment

429
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,207
Sure

430
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:06,303
I don't know if any of our listeners or you Stacy

431
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:09,375
Back this Kickstarter project but I did it

432
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:11,679
It's for the pine a64

433
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,471
Oh I remember reading about

434
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:14,495
I did not back

435
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:15,775
Okay

436
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:20,895
I couldn't not back it was $15 that I think I upgraded to the $19

437
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:21,919
A 64

438
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:22,943
Plus board

439
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,807
It's similar to a Raspberry Pi it's got a cortex a53 chip

440
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:33,183
Valley 400 GPU and I got the one with extra memory so I think I got a gig of RAM on it

441
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:38,815
And it's got 4K HDMI output so it's like a nice little TV computer let's see. Let's do that

442
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:41,631
I don't have it yet they haven't started sending them but it's

443
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,399
You know

444
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:44,959
Hey I could always use another 3 by 5 in

445
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:46,239
Computer mouse so why not

446
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:48,799
But I just found out last week

447
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:51,615
And I did not know this when I ordered it but now I'm really glad I ordered it

448
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,663
That they are going to have

449
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,455
Modules that will

450
00:17:55,711 --> 00:18:01,855
Fit in with this and I'm looking to the models right now aside from the USB serial programmer module

451
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,135
Also

452
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:05,439
An ambient light sensor you can get

453
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:07,487
A humidity sensor

454
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:09,279
Actually see me the end temperature

455
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:11,071
A Z-Wave module

456
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,375
A Wi-Fi remote module so there's

457
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:19,519
There's some iot stuff here we can do with this fruit with this little 15 $20 Gizmo excited now

458
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:21,567
No I'm noticing that the

459
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:23,359
The net working on this though is

460
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:24,895
Or

461
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:25,663
100

462
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:26,943
This is on ethernet

463
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:27,967
As opposed to what

464
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:34,623
Correctly there is a Wi-Fi module that you can get and they're also experimenting with power over ethernet not working

465
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:35,903
Yeah so

466
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:38,463
A lot of different options

467
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:41,023
Originally was just going to be this little computer and

468
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,559
Run Android on it

469
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:46,399
Zumpano's Linux and all that but it seems like they've expanded it

470
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:47,935
Far beyond that now

471
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,727
But the gpus you could use it

472
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,519
Media player gaming platform

473
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,311
Farm to absolutely

474
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:56,639
Absolutely anything for you know 20 bucks or less

475
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:59,967
When you confront so for people who like

476
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:03,039
Are into this sort of thing you could run open wrt

477
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,063
So

478
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:04,831
Hey hey

479
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:08,415
If you want to be a writer for you or you could run openhab which is

480
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:10,207
Open Smart Home

481
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,231
Kind of platform

482
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,559
People come on the show

483
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:15,327
For a while

484
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,607
So one day

485
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:17,887
One day it's going to happen

486
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,167
So that's

487
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:20,191
Worth noting

488
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:23,263
As I'm scrolling down and learning all about this

489
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:26,079
I'm so okay well cool as you get the

490
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,639
Let us know what do you plan on doing with it

491
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:35,295
Are you I was just going to make a little Linux machine and do some media and whatnot but now that these modules are going to be

492
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:37,343
I don't have the pricing at they've announced it

493
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:40,415
Now I'm thinking you know what else can I do from smartphone perspective

494
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:46,559
Not that smell every good to get them on the show and talk about

495
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,327
So yeah

496
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,351
Maybe I'll make you

497
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,143
Hahaha

498
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:53,471
Look at that snout

499
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:56,799
Didn't have this before the $59 I owe TPAC

500
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,847
Includes the

501
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:02,943
Little computer 8 gig micro SD card with openhab on it

502
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:07,295
Power supply enclosure Bluetooth 4.0 and Wi-Fi module

503
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:09,599
And Z-Wave plus aniyo car

504
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:11,135
39 bucks

505
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:12,671
Wow

506
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:14,463
Womp womp

507
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:15,743
That's so sad Trump

508
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,279
Yeah that's a sad trombone

509
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:19,583
There we go

510
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:24,191
Alright Movin right along we got a comment from listener

511
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:27,263
Last week that's worth sharing this is from Nick

512
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:29,311
Last week we talked about

513
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:31,615
What do we talk about we had Scott Jensen on the show

514
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:34,943
Google and he talked about

515
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:39,551
Moving our smart devices with us and he gave his home an email account

516
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:40,831
Because

517
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:41,855
He was like

518
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:45,951
How about making his light switches smart he was using NC on light switches

519
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:47,231
And he was like I don't want it

520
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:51,583
Associated with me I wanted associated with the house so he gave us house a Gmail account

521
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,143
Except he's kind of hurt by it

522
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:56,447
So

523
00:20:56,703 --> 00:21:00,543
He didn't like his idea he he wants a better identity kind of issues this is

524
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,335
Flash

525
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:04,383
Things that he will make better possibly

526
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,407
In his life

527
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:06,431
So

528
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:08,223
Nick Roden and was like

529
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:12,831
Scott mentioned that you wouldn't take her smart devices with you when you move much like he wouldn't take your dishwasher

530
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:18,976
I don't take my dishwasher because I expect my new house to have a dishwasher left behind by the other owners

531
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,768
The same goes with a stove

532
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:24,352
The refrigerator's on the other hand people usually do take those with them when they move

533
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:27,680
So it's not expected that you would buy a house with a refrigerator

534
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:28,960
So I bring my own

535
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:34,336
But for a smart device I don't expect to buy a house with smart devices because most houses don't have them

536
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:38,688
So if I sell my house with all my setup and move to a new house I'm going to have to start

537
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:42,784
From scratch if I put several thousand dollars of smart devices in my home

538
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,832
What's money lost when selling my house

539
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:51,232
And I can't really say my house is worth more because of those devices because most people right now wouldn't pay the extra cost of having

540
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,024
That's a really good point

541
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,328
And I know I would not pay the X

542
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,096
Patrick Hospital

543
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:57,120
And I love her

544
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:58,912
Yeah

545
00:21:59,168 --> 00:21:59,680
Highwood

546
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:00,704
I

547
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,240
Probably would not know

548
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:04,544
You know we put the solar panels on her house and

549
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:06,848
That added about $30,000

550
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,384
To the appraised value because

551
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,712
Clearly they're not coming with us for not taking down 41 solar panels

552
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:14,272
When we move there permanently attached to the house

553
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:17,088
Turn on my smart home stuff I would definitely take with me

554
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:18,624
And

555
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:22,208
Would I pay more for a house that already had it

556
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:24,768
I kind of want

557
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:29,632
The choice of what I want to use so I don't know a kind of trying to go straight and say well hey

558
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:34,240
Either take it out or leave it I don't care not paying more for it I don't think I pay more for a house because it was

559
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:35,776
Fit in with that kind of stuff

560
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:38,336
Yeah kind of depends on how

561
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,360
Well spit it out

562
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:42,176
Many people today already pay for

563
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,968
Certain types of media system

564
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:45,504
Sounds like you pay more for it

565
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,784
In-ceiling speakers

566
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,064
You might

567
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:55,744
I would maybe like a projector an HDMI HDTV projector its mountains at the ceiling with a screen

568
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,512
But I don't think

569
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:57,536
Alarm system

570
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:01,120
Irrigation system that's connected

571
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:03,424
I'm just that I'm starting to that mean Lake

572
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,448
Yeah

573
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:07,776
I mean there's something to that happen if you got a whole package of these things

574
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:12,640
But you're not going to break them out and see what a house is worth $4,000 more because I have all these things so you know

575
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:13,664
Will you just

576
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:17,504
Someone is having a pitch one day

577
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,272
You know that's like

578
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:20,320
Smart Home Tech is the new granite countertop

579
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:21,600
In a sense

580
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:23,648
A granite countertop is not going to make it

581
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:24,416
Break

582
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:25,440
Your house would have

583
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:28,256
A certain price level

584
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:34,912
If we can we can sell our house last year cuz we didn't have Granite for go ahead

585
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:37,728
I have Corian

586
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,312
But

587
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:43,360
At a certain level people

588
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:44,640
Expect certain amenities

589
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:46,688
Countertops

590
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:47,712
And I think

591
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:48,992
We're going to get to a point

592
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:51,808
We're at a certain level people are going to look at your

593
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:55,136
A better irrigation system or Nest Thermostat or

594
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,672
You know that kind of

595
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:58,976
Things like it really high-end homes

596
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:01,024
You expect smarter lighting

597
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:01,792
You really do

598
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:03,328
Liquor store store

599
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,096
So

600
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,888
I will let you know what

601
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:11,264
I agree with you I guess I question the timing I think it's I think we're a long way off

602
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,080
From those types of things impacting homes

603
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:15,360
For all but high-end homes

604
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:18,176
And I would be curious if any of our listeners

605
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,968
Have sold their home

606
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:22,272
With and without Smart Home Stuff

607
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:28,160
And if that effective negotiation or price I would love to hear from somebody who's actually gone through that and

608
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:29,696
Desmos princess Asher

609
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:31,232
Okay so listeners

610
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:33,024
If you make yourself

611
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:34,560
The Amazon Echo

612
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:36,864
Or if you were Soldier home

613
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:39,936
Add a smart device or a smart

614
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:42,240
Kind of home automation system that is helped

615
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:44,032
Affect the value of your home

616
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,312
Please

617
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:48,384
Sandestin Outlet info at iot podcast.

00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:50,688
Stay tuned

619
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:51,712
4 hour gas

620
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:52,736
2 is awesome

621
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:53,760
It is checked

622
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:54,528
Kenosha

623
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,320
Who is the CEO of Starry

624
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:58,368
Which is a brand new

625
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,672
Brand new just launched last week

626
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:01,952
ISP

627
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:04,512
That is going to start in Boston

628
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:05,792
You may remember chat

629
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:07,584
Is the CEO of Ariel

630
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,144
If he is now launching and ISP

631
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:11,168
4

632
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:14,240
It's actually using millimeter wave technology

633
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:19,360
You don't have to worry about that the reason he's on the show is because there is also an Internet of Things component

634
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:21,152
To his Broadband offering

635
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:24,480
So once again chat is taking on the big boys

636
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:31,136
In this case he's taking on the entrenched isps and he's scared to talk about what he's

637
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:41,632
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast I am your host

638
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:42,912
Stacey Higginbotham

639
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:47,008
And today I have a special guest for you this is Chet kanojia

640
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,336
And he is the CEO of Starry

641
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:51,360
Paycheck

642
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,384
How are you doing today

643
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:54,176
I'm well thank you

644
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:56,224
I am so excited

645
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,856
To have you on the show because you were combining two of my favorite loves Broadband in The Internet of Things

646
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:04,160
You guys lunch story last

647
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:05,440
Last week and it was up

648
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:06,464
Big

649
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,024
Freaking so why don't you go

650
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,816
I telling everybody

651
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:12,608
Seriously what story is

652
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:16,960
Sure so sorry was known as project decibel while we were developing

653
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:21,312
But basically it's it's kind of think of it as a entire communication

654
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:22,848
If you will

655
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,640
It starts with

656
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:28,224
Depending on which way you look at it either from home or or some

657
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,808
The goals of companies to provide a

658
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:32,832
Broadband access

659
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:34,368
A way for using

660
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:35,904
Wireless technology

661
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:37,696
Olympics

662
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:42,048
Second is in home appliances that combine and simplify

663
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:46,144
Interfaces the consumer has to the internet

664
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,704
Goal ambition

665
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:51,008
And goodies for the passion is to make

666
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:54,080
Things that are simple easy convenient

667
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:59,712
Consumers will adopt them more and then get a greater benefit out of them

668
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:00,992
Okay so

669
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:02,016
You were doing

670
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:03,296
Broadband service to

671
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:06,112
People and just just to get people really excited

672
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:07,136
How fast

673
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,416
Is this internet service

674
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:09,184
It's going to be

675
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:12,512
Sonar technical test we've tested up to a gigabit

676
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:17,888
But we think ultimately will be able to do more but that's the max that we've demonstrated to ourselves and I

677
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:19,936
Oh wow okay

678
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:20,960
I don't usually hear

679
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:23,520
Technical test we can do a gigabit

680
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:27,616
And then we think we can do more I usually it's the other way around to do it take a bit but really

681
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:28,640
You're going to get less

682
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:29,664
So

683
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:31,712
Okay

684
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:32,480
So

685
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:34,784
The idea is I can ditch my

686
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,808
Traditional IRA

687
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:39,648
I put one of your devices if I have a house it's going to be

688
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:40,672
On a window

689
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:43,744
I stick this in there

690
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:45,280
It's going to take

691
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:46,304
Your

692
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,840
Crazy

693
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:50,400
It's crazy technology guys don't worry about it

694
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:52,192
But on the inside of the house

695
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:53,216
It turns into Wi-Fi

696
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:55,520
So outside of the house it's

697
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:57,056
7 millimeter waves

698
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,592
Y'all can worry about that later

699
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:00,384
Inside of the house it's Wi-Fi

700
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:02,944
There is another device

701
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:04,224
It's called

702
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,528
Let's see what is it it's the starry

703
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:08,576
It's called The Starry station

704
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:10,112
And

705
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:10,880
Is

706
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:12,928
Wireless router

707
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:13,952
Plus AI

708
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:14,720
Hub

709
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:19,072
An Android application platform all combined in the

710
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:20,608
Awesomely beautiful looking

711
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:25,728
It is very pretty I am kind of excited that we have this this

712
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,568
Huge number of pretty routers like devices in her home

713
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:33,408
So the story station is kind of what we will focus on here

714
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,176
Because

715
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:35,456
This is the Hub

716
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:36,736
For you guys

717
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:40,576
It has Bluetooth it has 11 AC Wi-Fi

718
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:43,392
We spent a lot of time optimizing

719
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:45,952
Power amplifiers in antenna design in.

720
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:47,232
Maximize coverage

721
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:49,280
It has zigbee

722
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:51,328
As well and

723
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:56,704
It will also we would also launch a Extender with it soon which basically

724
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,008
Creates a tunnel between

725
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:03,104
Abuse isolation and extender to extend the reach in

726
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:07,968
More concrete type of construction on brick and masonry Caprica

727
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:08,736
Instructions

728
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:10,016
My situations

729
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:12,064
Okay so I do have to ask

730
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:13,344
Because this is going to have

731
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,112
Bluetooth

732
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,136
Busy Bee

733
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:15,904
The Wi-Fi

734
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:18,208
Sounds good it's got the Android Bass

735
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:20,256
You told me before the show that

736
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:22,560
You know one day it might upgrade to thread

737
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:25,632
Why no Z-Wave

738
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,680
So we went back and forth

739
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:33,824
Turn on the decisions and betrayed use to put in there and put a long time to at least two months there was a lot of

740
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,408
Passionate debate inside the company I think we broke down the

741
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:38,944
Coyote Channel alarm

742
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,480
Debating the same

743
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:44,576
I think the conclusion we at least of it seemed reached was

744
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:47,904
Unipower started thinking about some a power perspective

745
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:51,744
Which method zigbee made a lot of sense for low-power applications

746
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,840
Ble obviously program applications include

747
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:58,144
Bridging two speakers from Wi-Fi etcetera

748
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,168
And

749
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:02,240
Your Instinct was that a lot of

750
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:04,032
People were beginning to build

751
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:07,872
You know Wi-Fi into these devices as opposed to Z-Wave and we saw

752
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:09,408
As a roadmap

753
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:12,992
Nothing that deter deciding if we had zigbee and

754
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:16,576
Wi-Fi and Bluetooth we wouldn't be able to cover a lot of Apple

755
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:18,880
And you know this is not you know

756
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:21,440
You know I mean this version of the product has.

757
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:23,488
Things change in the future

758
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:25,792
I'm sure we'll upgrade or change our approach

759
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:27,072
But that was for the Box

760
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:27,840
Can going into

761
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:30,656
Okay is there a port on the back where I can plug

762
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:34,752
No the radios built into the device itself

763
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,568
I'm okay

764
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:38,336
So

765
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:39,360
Let's talk about

766
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:45,504
Why you decided to combine because this is probably more Salient to the normal people out there who listen to the podcast

767
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,040
Why you decided to say hey

768
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:48,320
I'm going to be

769
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:49,856
Be an ISP

770
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:52,672
And I'm going to provide an iot hub

771
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,208
I think that some

772
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:55,744
Approach we take is

773
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,512
Experience

774
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:58,304
And I think of my experience and education

775
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,072
Expect a lot of pee

776
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,096
Feel the same way

777
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,632
Is when you don't have

778
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:06,496
Environment in which you providing the entire stock it is very difficult

779
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:08,544
To provide a great experience to Consumers

780
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:14,176
So we wanted to do the entire and do anything to make sure the experience that we could put our name behind

781
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:17,248
And you know I Grand and get passionate about

782
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,808
Was controlled by us in terms of equality

783
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:22,368
Right now in attempts to be

784
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:27,232
You know you have an ISP that has a cable modem or or DSL modem or whatever

785
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,280
Particular transport to use

786
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:30,304
And then they

787
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,096
Either package in

788
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:33,888
The cheapest possible access

789
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:36,960
When did they can find or encourage you to go by

790
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,568
You know I'm more sophisticated wireless router AP

791
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,640
The problem is at the service provider they don't have any

792
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:46,944
Control over the software intern

793
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:47,968
Quality Inn

794
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:48,992
Upgrades in

795
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:50,016
Women's

796
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:51,296
And it just frustrates

797
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:52,064
Consumers

798
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,904
Same thing applies to iot devices yuan ultimately to think about it

799
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,184
Entire ecosystem

800
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:01,792
That can be managed by the consumer anywhere anyhow easy to deploy and simple

801
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:05,376
Do you want to have access to the entire software stock so you can

802
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,656
Really provided gradle

803
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:07,424
Experience

804
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,984
I'm even Bluetooth pairing as such you know half the

805
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,264
People stumble on it

806
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:12,544
Writing and then

807
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:16,128
Pairing any of these other things devices are daring and a Wi-Fi

808
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:18,688
Extender is yuno a science project for an average

809
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,224
I shouldn't be that hard

810
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:22,272
Nothing what ends up happening is people

811
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:23,040
Call

812
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:25,088
The service provider ended up set of the cellar

813
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:26,112
Service provider

814
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:27,648
Somebody else's phone

815
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:28,928
Compared to what

816
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:31,744
I don't know why I try to avoid

817
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:35,584
That is our goal is that you don't have to call us

818
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,352
Which is why

819
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:38,912
We put it at Android screen in there

820
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:39,936
Because we think

821
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:41,216
We can then develop

822
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:43,008
Great network-level application

823
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:49,152
That you will be able to control know and hope Nina perhaps in the future will open that up as a open outside

824
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:53,760
Okay so let's talk about that cuz you just kind of opened up this whole

825
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:55,296
Addition

826
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:56,320
In

827
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:58,112
About to dig into it so

828
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:59,904
Are you guys thinking about

829
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:05,792
Adding sensors and other devices or are you thinking more like you're going to bring in third-party device

830
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:09,376
I think we will try to develop a few of Our Own

831
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:13,216
But I think we we think that's opening up that platform and

832
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:13,984
Stables

833
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,800
The software and Hardware integrated software Hardware environment

834
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:23,200
Poor People's example that makes sensors and take the burden away from them to have to add cell yet another hub

835
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:28,320
Anna's Pizza software that goes with it as opposed to just writing an app in Android app

836
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:30,368
Okay

837
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:34,976
Sew-in in you're not going to do any weird for version of Android like the Amazon did with

838
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:36,256
You know it's fire stuff

839
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:41,888
No it's it's pretty stock-standard I apologize I don't remember if it's lollipop or not but I do

840
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,496
Okay that you don't have to you don't have to worry

841
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:49,312
I won't ask you if you're on marshmallow or

842
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:50,848
KitKat or lollipop

843
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:52,128
Actually

844
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,664
Lollipop would be relevant

845
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,688
Because of the BL

846
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:58,016
Oh so nerdy so nerdy chat we won't go there

847
00:33:58,528 --> 00:33:59,040
Okay

848
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:00,064
So

849
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,856
Check you have

850
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:03,648
A Thornton is peace

851
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:04,928
And your previous

852
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:05,696
Start up

853
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:06,464
Ariel

854
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,280
In that case you were

855
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:11,072
Upsetting the cable company

856
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:13,120
With the ability to

857
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:16,448
Basically stream and record over the air TV

858
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:19,264
The shutdown

859
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,312
Buy a court case unfortunately

860
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:24,128
I was really eager for it to come to Austin so I was

861
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:26,944
Sad because I can actually get over the air TV in my

862
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:27,968
My house

863
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:31,296
But

864
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:33,600
I'm sure you probably learned a lot

865
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:34,368
And

866
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:38,464
I'm curious what did you learn that you think might apply and in this particular

867
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,256
Business that you're starting at now

868
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:45,632
Sure it's interesting. You know people's first reaction is as you raised

869
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:47,936
Is that we are going to get a raise

870
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:51,008
That's a nice piece in and I just don't understand

871
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,336
Why we live in a system where a

872
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,128
Competition Amina obviously

873
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,968
An Amazon sells you a bunch of stuff and sodas in a Walmart

874
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:02,784
Nice competition it's Greg everybody created

875
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,600
You better products and their services and attract customers

876
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,416
That's for the model in the

877
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:09,440
Access

878
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:13,792
And I don't understand why that is the case I mean I know why it is the case but I don't understand why

879
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:14,560
People think

880
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:17,120
Somehow it's not a good idea then and now

881
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:19,680
Oh I think it's a great idea I'm really excited

882
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:25,312
Little I know you are and I think a lot of pockets are but just ascend

883
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:27,616
Companies that the reaction tends to be

884
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:29,152
Well we don't like this

885
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:33,504
Okay great let's see what you can do and then we'll push the boundary to and and

886
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,040
See what happens when we the best

887
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:37,600
Approach is the best company win

888
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:39,648
And in the study room for everybody

889
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:42,976
And in particular I think people don't like upstart

890
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:44,512
It's doing that I don't understand that

891
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:46,048
Ew that's a lot of

892
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:47,328
Great Innovation and

893
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:51,168
Interesting ideas come out of people that are not encumbered by the conventional

894
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:52,448
We're thinking about

895
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,264
But be that as it may

896
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:56,544
Either we learned of

897
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,312
Fitbit in

898
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:58,592
I dare you

899
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:00,384
You know a lot of that was

900
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,712
How to build a technology company while

901
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:04,480
Your buildings

902
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:06,528
Facilities based infrastructure

903
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:10,368
Stop because area was also a city-by-city build-out kind of a model which is

904
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:11,136
Ghana

905
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:12,160
Different than what clean

906
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:13,440
Here

907
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:14,976
We learned how to

908
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:18,304
Market online which was great we learned

909
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,328
That we

910
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:22,400
We started started we made sure that we

911
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:23,936
Entire marketing

912
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:26,496
What is the foundational marketing team of Ariel

913
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:28,544
I wish it was with us they won

914
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,616
Because we learned the hard way that it's so hard

915
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:38,016
To build a Marketing Group after the fact and when you don't date on the right foundation to the bottom over the same Fields team

916
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:40,064
The hand of all the areas

917
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,344
Expansion came over

918
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:44,416
The same RF tmall revolve you say augmented the team

919
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:45,440
On the other side

920
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:46,720
Outside quite a bit

921
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:51,328
But yeah it was ultimately the team had a lot got a lot of

922
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:53,888
Confidence out of execution material because

923
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,984
When we started area we have it was sort of this like oh my God how we go

924
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:58,752
Going to do this

925
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,288
Like what do you mean you have to like

926
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:02,080
Rent buildings and rooftops

927
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:05,920
Cities in United stall stuff in you know rent cranes do you know

928
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:07,200
Raise boxes and

929
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:08,736
Air conditioning

930
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:10,016
Those nuts

931
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:12,832
And we learned a lot and how to get it done then

932
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:13,856
Got a lot of confidence

933
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:15,136
Starting distance

934
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:20,000
That look like this mysterious set of things that need to happen to light activated service

935
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:24,096
What we kind of did it we know what the mechanics are and we've learned a lot

936
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:26,400
In terms of how to do it faster better as well

937
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:28,448
Those what kind of dog

938
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:31,264
Execution things that we took away from

939
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:32,288
.

940
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:37,664
Starting dinner in a lot of other ways a lot of innovative companies that have come in you know people mailman.

941
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:40,480
Products and services

942
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:42,784
Tend to be very useful that I'm thinking

943
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:44,064
Uber another country

944
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,368
Things like that that have had challenges

945
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:47,392
In the Clarence of the week

946
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:48,160
Incumbent

947
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:52,768
Climate and I think that the biggest distinction between Ariel and some of those company

948
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:56,096
Please was the we had a single point of failure which was

949
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:57,888
Federal court versus

950
00:37:58,144 --> 00:37:58,656
How you did

951
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:00,448
Beauty legal framework

952
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:01,472
State and city in

953
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,008
Mini Plus

954
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:05,312
So I think avoiding a single point of failure is

955
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:06,848
Another key lesson

956
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:10,432
It was unavoidable in areas case because copyright

957
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:12,224
It is what it is

958
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,784
That was a that was a good lesson to learn that

959
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,624
And if you're going to push the boundary in any way shape or form not that that's

960
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,928
The case here but that was just a good academic last

961
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:23,232
That tried to distribute arrest

962
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:25,536
I like it

963
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:26,304
All right

964
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:28,608
And for people who are

965
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:33,472
Oh my gosh how can I get this can you tell us a little bit about what start

966
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,752
Is going to cost

967
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:41,920
Starry station which is the iot Wi-Fi blue ble all combined have which is going

968
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:47,552
You can reserve it now on our website it goes to sale and get clothes on sale next week I think February 4th

969
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:50,880
On Amazon as well as our website

970
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:52,928
Is $249

971
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:53,952
So you can order that

972
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:57,024
The stories Internet Service Wichita Starry internet

973
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,304
Will start beta

974
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,096
In Boston at the First Market

975
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:01,888
In the summertime thing with Target

976
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:03,680
And then

977
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:08,032
Much like we did with the area we let it soak for a few months learned a great deal

978
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:08,800
Entrance

979
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:09,568
How to do it

980
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,360
Better faster

981
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:13,920
Build our support infrastructure with that as well

982
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:15,968
And then we'll start rolling that out in

983
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:18,016
Testing multiple more cities

984
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:21,088
Okay any word on

985
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,368
The cities that you plan

986
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:29,280
Not at the moment I mean you know obviously some of our test licenses are public information but I wouldn't message

987
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:33,632
Primarily focused on making sure that we have testing done in

988
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:35,168
Various different types of

989
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:37,984
Biological geographical and

990
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,568
In the weather conditions with them but we have not finalized this

991
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:44,128
But again it's a start-up I think it's fair to assume

992
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,176
That you fish where the fish are

993
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:52,576
And so we will probably go after underserved markets and or where that is only itching the coax provider with

994
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:53,344
ESL

995
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:56,928
In order to you no bring a better dynamic

996
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:58,464
Excellent

997
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:01,536
One more thing because

998
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:03,584
This will actually run on the day

999
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,632
Your Starry station goes on sale

1000
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:08,448
Is there a reason for me to buy the starry station

1001
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:10,240
If I'm not in line to

1002
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:12,032
To get Starry internet

1003
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:13,056
Absolutely

1004
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:14,336
Because if you

1005
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:16,384
Are frustrated with your Wi-Fi

1006
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,152
In terms of its

1007
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:18,688
Performance throughout your house

1008
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:25,088
If you're frustrated with not having simple and easy apps like I like I don't know if you have children but if you want to have school

1009
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:28,672
We have a great app on the station called screen time which allows you

1010
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:34,816
To set up policies on and filters for your children so they can email be online and certain hours

1011
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:40,448
Block other things Etc. So all those apps that new parents would find easy and simple to use

1012
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:41,728
Essentially just

1013
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:42,752
Clicking top

1014
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:47,616
It has really cool interesting features that will make your life much easier for example

1015
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:48,896
It monitors

1016
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:50,944
To put on a poor client level

1017
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:56,576
And actually then also on the wide area network and creates an entire Health score for you to tell you

1018
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:58,368
Which devices may be struggling

1019
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,720
What day are SSI levels are and adults example if you got

1020
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:03,744
An Apple TV

1021
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,560
That is attached to a 2.4 gigahertz

1022
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:09,376
N Signal because the power in a power 10

1023
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,472
It'll automatically detect a days greeter couplet at 8

1024
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:14,752
Inferior

1025
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:18,848
Pizza Spectrum it'll create a five gig version of that Network

1026
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:20,384
Pop up something to say to you

1027
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:23,712
We are going to now connect you with Apple TV to the V Gate Park

1028
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:26,272
Standing enforce that connection and

1029
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:29,088
It's not really smart learning

1030
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:30,368
Features built into it

1031
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:32,416
That'll allow you to

1032
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:33,952
Make life easier

1033
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:38,560
If you go to YouTube you're not like you know the one Tech person in the household becoming an admin for the entire day

1034
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:39,328
Extended family

1035
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,120
So it's a better router

1036
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:41,888
For your family

1037
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:42,912
Better

1038
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:43,680
Performance

1039
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:44,448
Easy

1040
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:50,848
Simple and you know we designed it in a really interesting way which was the screen is for the hero

1041
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:52,895
The product really two reasons

1042
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:54,175
1

1043
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:56,735
With a better user interface but the second thing is

1044
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:57,759
Yeah I'm sure you know

1045
00:41:58,271 --> 00:42:03,903
You know most people will stick their AP somewhere or router somewhere in a Dusty shelf behind a bunch of book

1046
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:05,183
Bookshelves etc etc

1047
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:06,975
Which potentially hurts

1048
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:07,999
Performance matters

1049
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:11,327
Putting a screen in building an Ambien

1050
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:13,631
Play that is continuously telling you the help

1051
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:14,655
At a glance

1052
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:16,959
Wokano ask people

1053
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:19,007
Basically the move it in

1054
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:20,287
It's somewhere that they can see it

1055
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:21,311
As a result

1056
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:25,663
Routers are becoming like

1057
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:27,711
The superheroes of the home network

1058
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:28,991
It's so fun

1059
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:31,551
I'm loving it

1060
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:33,343
I

1061
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:34,111
Half life

1062
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:36,159
3 access points that

1063
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:37,695
May soon be upgraded

1064
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:41,279
I'm going to wait till y'all have an extender

1065
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:42,815
Because I I don't need

1066
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:44,095
I don't need three

1067
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:50,239
$350 access point one $350 with a next

1068
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:52,543
Exactly I need to I need two or three

1069
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:53,823
I have a weird

1070
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:55,615
So okay

1071
00:42:55,871 --> 00:43:00,991
Chat thank you so much for coming on the show I really appreciate it and I cannot wait

1072
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:04,575
To see what you do and till you get to Austin because despite

1073
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:06,623
A plethora of gigabit providers

1074
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:07,903
I still got nothing

1075
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:09,695
You still stuck with Time Warner

1076
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:11,487
I'm still stuck with Thai border

1077
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:13,279
There we go

1078
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:18,143
Great thank you so much for having me this is a lot of fun

1079
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:24,543
Thank you for listening and please join us next week on the Internet of Things podcast
