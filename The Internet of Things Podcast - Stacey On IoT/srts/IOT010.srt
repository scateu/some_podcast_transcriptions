00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:12,544
Hey everybody this is the fortune Internet of Things podcast with your hoes

2
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,336
Stacey Higginbotham Andrew

3
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:15,360
Co-host

4
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:16,640
Kevin tofel

5
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:17,664
And you

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,784
Astute listeners might have noticed that we added a brand name to the beginning of our podcast

7
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:24,576
That is because

8
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:26,880
Nothing about the show will change but

9
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:28,160
Fortune is now going

10
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:29,184
To be affiliated with

11
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,488
So if you guys aren't aware of the IMF

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,536
Senior editor Fortune Magazine

13
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:34,816
And Kevin you are a

14
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:37,120
A contributing writer at ZDNet.

15
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:41,728
Later in the show Kevin and I talked about the ecobee3 thermostat

16
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:44,288
After we recorded the show we found out

17
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,336
Did some of the information that we had was

18
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:47,104
Was incorrect

19
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,408
The ecobee3 thermostat

20
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:50,432
What is homekit

21
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:51,200
Compatible

22
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:52,736
Must be purchased

23
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:54,784
Now the existing ecobee

24
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,064
Trees are not

25
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:56,832
Homekit

26
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:57,600
Compatible

27
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:58,368
And now

28
00:00:58,624 --> 00:00:59,648
Onto the show

29
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:01,440
All right so getting

30
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:04,000
It started with this week's news we should start with

31
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:04,768
I don't know

32
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,560
Google IO

33
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:09,888
Yeah let's do that since I Google I always last week

34
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:10,656
And

35
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,472
Not too many surprises there

36
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:16,800
In terms of everything it was announced and even some things that weren't announced

37
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:17,568
But I expect

38
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:19,104
Brillo

39
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,688
Became reality we heard about Brillo before Google IO

40
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:25,504
And the Rumor at the time was it would be

41
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,528
Google's

42
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:27,808
I'll call it second

43
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:30,880
Attempt at The Internet of Things cuz I do remember their Android at home

44
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:33,952
Effort back in 2011 that really went nowhere

45
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,768
I think it's time as we might have talked about on the Pryor Show

46
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:39,328
But yesterday announced Brillo which is

47
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,960
I guess you could say it's a small slice of Android for later devices that you may have around your home

48
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:46,496
Are there also an ounce

49
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:48,032
Weave which

50
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:50,848
Are your thoughts on Stacy because

51
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,128
It was kind of like this

52
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,408
Nebulous

53
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,968
Platform was going to tie everything together

54
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,504
They also said

55
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,576
That they would be Wi-Fi Bluetooth sport as well as

56
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:03,392
Thread which I think again we talked about it last show so

57
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,928
New products

58
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:08,256
Announce this kind of reminds me of what Apple did last year

59
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:10,560
At WWDC in 2014

60
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:11,840
Hey working at home kit

61
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,120
And you're not smart home

62
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:15,168
300s and yada yada

63
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:19,008
It only just now a year later the Racine products for that so there's no

64
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,312
Willow products at this is Google

65
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:24,128
Doing what they do they put the platform of the tools out there

66
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,408
And hope that developers and

67
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:26,432
Hardware partners

68
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,200
Support them

69
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:28,480
So exact

70
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,528
I think there's a lot going on

71
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:31,296
Behind the scenes

72
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,064
Google

73
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,880
I've got to be honest I talked to a lot of people

74
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:38,720
Those before Google IO and then after Google IO to figure out a little bit

75
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:43,584
More about brillo and I have heard so many conflicting reports

76
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,608
Conflicting they're just

77
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:50,496
Brillo could be so many things to so many people and it sounds like Google's not even sure

78
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:51,264
What they're after

79
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,056
You're like I can't even get specs

80
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:53,824
On

81
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,176
The processing power of the memory footprint needed to run Brillo which is

82
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:00,736
It's going to be an OS for the internet of

83
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:02,784
It is designed to be lightweight enough

84
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:06,112
According to the two minutes that Google devoted to it

85
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:06,880
Hey Google

86
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,464
To be lightweight enough to run on you don't blocks

87
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,744
And small device

88
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,864
Says but also be powerful enough that it could power you know industrial internet operations like

89
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:17,888
No farming

90
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:18,656
And

91
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:19,680
Machines

92
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:20,960
So

93
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,496
I kind of look at that

94
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:28,640
Wow you just basically defined the entire ecosystem inside we're going to build something that's going to run on that

95
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:30,432
And it's a stripped-down version of Android

96
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:31,712
And so I think

97
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,528
I don't know if there's a one-size-fits-all there

98
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,808
Google has the

99
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:36,576
Props

100
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:38,112
And Acumen to do it

101
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,904
When I look at Merlot

102
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:44,000
It could compete with some of the other operating systems out there such as

103
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:46,560
Arm is doing an embedded OS

104
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:48,096
That's a little bit lighter weight

105
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,376
There's a lot of

106
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:50,400
Custom

107
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:51,936
OS is out there

108
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:55,776
For iot that come on a lot of the chips

109
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:59,360
And then there's a lot of custom platforms out there from

110
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,640
Kind of a lot of these

111
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,688
Cloud providers that work with both

112
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:03,712
Hardware and

113
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,992
The cloud side sole

114
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,528
Electric imp

115
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:09,856
They do a Wi-Fi module plus a cloud side thing

116
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,136
There's particle

117
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:14,208
They've got modules plus a cloud support side thing

118
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,232
So

119
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,512
It looks like

120
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,791
Google could be going

121
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,071
After all of that

122
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,607
Ennui

123
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,399
I don't even know what to tell you

124
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:25,215
They showed two slides

125
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,495
Did I think they should actually

126
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,775
Sephora total slides

127
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,823
Related to iot one of which was like

128
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,359
Google The Internet of Things

129
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,639
It does lie detector

130
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:34,687
Satisfy that actually showed

131
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:36,991
Brillo it action and there was actually

132
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,527
People were very excited about

133
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:39,295
A TV

134
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,831
Be listed among the devices

135
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:44,159
Controlled and yes I do think there is going to be

136
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:47,999
A home entertainment component here because it just makes sense

137
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,559
And then there was the weave slide which showed

138
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:51,583
Basically

139
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,375
Brillo at a circle with Brillo

140
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,655
Weave in the cloud

141
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,447
Are the arrows all went around

142
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:58,751
And there's a little bit of code

143
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,335
You know some people were trying to parse

144
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,103
The code and

145
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:05,919
I am not sure if that's great or not I look at we

146
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,455
They said it was

147
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,479
Communications

148
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:09,247
Schema

149
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:11,295
They were very careful not to call it a proton

150
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,343
I still think it's going to

151
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,391
Pete with all join

152
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,415
Anaya tivity

153
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:17,439
So

154
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,719
The idea is to

155
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:21,791
Talking about what device is schema that says what a device

156
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:24,351
Is it communicates what a device does

157
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,167
And that is exactly what both

158
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:29,727
The Intel kind of iotivity

159
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:36,127
Standard is trying to do and that's Intel and a bunch of other companies Bandit around them and then Qualcomm

160
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,687
Other companies are doing all seen

161
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:39,967
And all join

162
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,503
With you all seen Alliance

163
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,807
And that's exactly what that's trying to do

164
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,111
And we've looks like it might sit on top

165
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,391
Top of that or

166
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,695
Do the same thing but it might be kind of

167
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,463
A couple layers

168
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:55,327
But I was going to say you know a little bit more about the

169
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,863
So I'd be curious like

170
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:59,167
Schema versus a protocol if you know what that means

171
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:02,239
Will a schema defines data

172
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:06,847
So I asked her to get that I mean you have your new might have XML schemas and in

173
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,639
Apps and web pages and such

174
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:09,919
The thing is

175
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:10,687
I think

176
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,991
Principle I agree with everything you just said

177
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:13,759
It's

178
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:18,623
Ultimately this is so far very confusing because you said Google is very specific

179
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,927
To say that we wasn't protocol

180
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:21,951
And here's the funny thing

181
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:25,279
If you go to developers. Google.com oberlo

182
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:27,583
Which is where you should find everything about furlough

183
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,119
You have one webpage

184
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,911
And a contact form on it

185
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,959
And right smack in the middle of the web page it says

186
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:35,519
Weave the iot protocol for everything

187
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:38,847
So they're sending a lot of mixed messages here I think

188
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,639
It just matter what you

189
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:43,967
You originally said that they're just going after the entire

190
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:44,991
Space here

191
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,271
And

192
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,831
Yeah I don't think that's a smart approach

193
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,415
I can imagine I'm not going to say that Apple's going to be successful here

194
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,951
I think Apple will be at least

195
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,743
Initially more successful because

196
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,791
They focused on very specific bit

197
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:58,559
Accent Home Care

198
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:00,351
We'll talk about that in a minute

199
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:04,191
I will say so the one thing that we didn't talk about and we should

200
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,983
They said that

201
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:10,591
Android devices will automatically recognize devices running

202
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,359
Brillo

203
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:16,479
So consumers Ed even people running like Android tablets and stuff and Industrial Ave

204
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,247
Vacations

205
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,527
That's a big deal

206
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:21,855
Because that gives it that kind of home kit

207
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:22,879
Capabilities

208
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:23,903
In the sense that

209
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,183
Boom you have automatic

210
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,207
Hey

211
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:26,975
Look it's a

212
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,255
You're at your phone will be like

213
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,535
Yo it's a

214
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,071
It's a TV running

215
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:33,631
Brillo or it's a door lock running Brillo

216
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,167
I know what it is I can talk to it

217
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,215
Presumably using weave

218
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:37,983
So that's

219
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:40,287
That's worth noting because I that could be

220
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,103
Huge because the Android ecosystem is huge

221
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:43,871
Massive

222
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:48,991
One other one other related pointer that Google says that support for weed is built into Android

223
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:52,575
And easily available for iOS so typical for Google they will

224
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:59,231
Make their services available for iOS even it was a smaller group of people with a very engaged group of users

225
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:04,095
I'm happy to see that because I'm all about the whole cross platform support I switch phones over time

226
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:07,679
My phone is collecting dust right now and I have an Android phone this week so

227
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,471
Again typical Google I'm glad

228
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:11,263
All right

229
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,311
So so yes that that's

230
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:15,359
What we know so far about Brillo in

231
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,127
Weave

232
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:20,991
Alright next up also at Google IO I was really excited about this

233
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,015
Because I'm So Into

234
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,295
Fashion and also

235
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,575
Because I hate screens

236
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,135
Kevin knows who I know

237
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,695
Is Project Jacquard

238
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:30,463
Which

239
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,999
Is one of Google's advanced

240
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,279
Technology project

241
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:34,559
What it is

242
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:37,119
Is Project Jacquard is a way to weave

243
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,399
Conductive thread

244
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,679
Into any type of

245
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,215
Google

246
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:44,287
As a partnership with Levi's if they announced at Google IO

247
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,335
That they're going to work together in

248
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,615
Kinect developing

249
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,151
I'm guessing conductor

250
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:49,919
The cloth

251
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,967
Conductive cloth is not new

252
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:56,063
We've actually talked to some companies like own signal makes

253
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,599
Shirts that use conduct

254
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:58,367
The cloth

255
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,135
Wechat at

256
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,159
A company that makes

257
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:02,719
Socks I actually have a pair of them right now

258
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:04,255
Constance Aria

259
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:07,839
And the socks are some sort of Fitness socks and they have conductive threads

260
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,167
What this does is this basically like

261
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,703
Yuan the fitness side

262
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,519
But you take all kinds of like heart rate respiration

263
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:21,919
Pressure sensors all this kind of stuff is built into the fabric and then it communicates to an electronic device

264
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:25,503
And it goes to your smartphone and all these Fabrics are actually washable

265
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,039
Once you take the little

266
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,063
Electronic

267
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:28,831
Pod out of

268
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,879
And project soli

269
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:34,719
Is really interesting even beyond the clothing project soli is

270
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,023
Google using radar

271
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,327
A device emits radar and then

272
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,375
It can detect

273
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,143
Beer

274
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:47,007
Tidy little motions in your fingers in disruptions in the radar signal

275
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:50,847
And it reads those is basically another gesture interface

276
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:53,663
So if you put that on the fabric you can like

277
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:58,015
Pinch the fabric or like big tiny little gestures on the fabric

278
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,551
And you're basically

279
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,087
Creating a touch interface on

280
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:02,623
4

281
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:03,903
Wherever

282
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:09,791
Yeah this is this is all interesting as you said we've we've had the conductor fibers before I test of the arm signal shirt

283
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:12,351
Got my respiration heart rate and all that fun stuff

284
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,631
Washable vest

285
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,423
With these fibers in them

286
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,215
Your test of the socks and whatnot

287
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:23,103
It's the twist here obviously Google is going after interphase as opposed to gathering information

288
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,919
I'm not sold at that

289
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,455
Going to take off

290
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,735
And the thing is

291
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,015
For most of the advanced

292
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:32,063
Technology projects in Google group

293
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,343
They want to go from

294
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:37,695
Idea to product within two years or their thought is we spike it

295
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:40,767
And in two years I don't know the Ring of interfaces

296
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,047
Hilton to close

297
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:44,095
Listen and have people accept the fact that

298
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,631
Yeah you can use her shirt

299
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:47,935
To swipe through screens on your phone and such

300
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,727
I think it's very ambitious

301
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,007
And it's interesting

302
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,079
What are the things they talked about using it on furniture

303
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:58,431
And what if you take it outside clothing and you think about it as

304
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,479
Anything where there's fabric

305
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,247
EXO

306
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:04,831
Sure like so your chair that you're sitting any kind of like a captain's chair and

307
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,623
And the change things

308
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:10,207
That displays on your screen that you're staring at on the run your desk and so on

309
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:15,071
Yeah I mean it. Just moves the interface from close to something else

310
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,863
Other than the screen

311
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,143
I don't know I mean

312
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,471
Furniture we we we still even talking about embedding

313
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:28,127
Wireless charging into furniture for three or four years and that's nobody's really interested in that either side

314
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:32,735
Doing is one thing but having people mainstream people really go after it is another

315
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:33,503
Well yes

316
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,319
I haven't found anybody

317
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,343
I've not seen it

318
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,111
Inaction yet

319
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:41,695
I don't even have and I try and get all the way to stuff

320
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,743
End tables pretty clunky

321
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,279
That's that's

322
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,047
Keep around

323
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:46,815
I don't know you

324
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,095
All right

325
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,119
Let's see

326
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,399
What else do we have

327
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,167
Oh

328
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,959
Other exciting news is

329
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,495
Tuesday in

330
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:58,079
London a researcher security researcher from OpenDNS

331
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:00,383
I should get a really interesting presentation

332
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,663
Related to

333
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:04,223
Corporate networks and The Internet of Things

334
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:08,063
This I hate this acronym but people

335
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:13,183
Love to talk about BYOD which is This Acronym of bring your own device into the network it have

336
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:17,535
Years ago when everybody

337
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,583
I was doing it at least a decade ago

338
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:24,447
You're such a rebel you're an early adopter Double Trouble every day

339
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:30,847
So what's interesting about BYOD is now with all these crazy connected gadgets

340
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:35,967
OpenDNS as research has shown that there is actually a BYO iot

341
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:36,991
Movement happen

342
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:37,759
Hang and

343
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,295
What they did is

344
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,087
They looked at DNS

345
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:41,855
Records

346
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,671
Did they can see from their clients

347
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,439
Stay host

348
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,975
DNS servers

349
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:47,999
So they looked at

350
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,791
Basically call-outs from

351
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:50,559
Devices on

352
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,583
Clients Networks

353
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,167
Stussy like what devices were on the networks and where they were calling out to

354
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:58,495
And they discovered that a lot of Highly secure

355
00:12:59,007 --> 00:12:59,775
Industries

356
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,311
Have a lot of really in

357
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,871
Secure connected devices from the home like

358
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:06,431
Ness and drop cams and

359
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:08,479
Smart TVs and things that

360
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:10,783
They may not be insecure

361
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:14,111
We're leaving the home but for a corporate it Network they're not

362
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:14,879
Up to

363
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:15,647
Corporate it

364
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:18,463
Par I guess would be the way to think about it yes Kevin

365
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:21,279
Oh absolutely not these things

366
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:25,631
And you know I come from the rebellious side where I was bringing stuff in all the time

367
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:29,471
But the fact that matters East things to bring risk into the Enterprise

368
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,519
In terms of you know losing

369
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:32,287
Potential

370
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,055
Data

371
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:36,895
Becoming infected spreading malware or viruses throughout the network

372
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,943
Git level

373
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,223
So this is this is

374
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:43,551
If this is a problem I mean especially in regulated in

375
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:46,367
Right where that method the data is

376
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:49,183
Has to be protected and someone is over that's that's it

377
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:49,951
That's a big issue

378
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:54,047
It is but this report to be clear was not trying to uncover a hat

379
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:57,887
This is talking about a pattern of behavior that enterprises don't even

380
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:58,911
Real Isaac

381
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,215
What struck me about it

382
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:03,519
Was the recommendations which were

383
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,311
The consumer devices

384
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,591
Need better.

385
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,871
Segmentation for corporate net

386
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,663
Cuz right now they're built

387
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,943
For consumers in

388
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,015
Did it needs to be aware of where there traffic is going

389
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:20,671
And he gave the example of the Samsung Smart TVs which a couple months ago I believe it was as they got in Allah

390
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,719
A lot of trouble over in the news because

391
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:24,511
The terms of service

392
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,535
Noted that

393
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,607
These are boys control TV so the TVs were listening

394
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:29,631
For their wake

395
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,191
Basically all the time all the time

396
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,215
And

397
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:35,263
This researcher pointed out that

398
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:38,335
A lot of these TVs are in boardrooms where

399
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:39,615
Companies might hold

400
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:40,639
Very important

401
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:42,175
Insecure beatings and

402
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,967
Did you really want something

403
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:44,735
Could be

404
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:49,855
Listening all the time have that capability and was attached to the internet in a way that

405
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:53,439
Wasn't necessarily secure and was also apparently calling South Korea

406
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,207
Ito

407
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,231
Is it malicious

408
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:56,255
Probably not

409
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,535
Could it be exploited

410
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,327
Yeah

411
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,887
So that was kind of a really IOP

412
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,191
Report it don't freak out but I would say

413
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:07,775
Suggest if you're if you're in corporate it you may want to check out there

414
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:11,359
Report otherwise if you're building a connected home device

415
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,919
When they sneak into the Enterprise

416
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:17,247
Maybe you should think about that market in Star Building better security

417
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:20,063
What just building better security but documenting it better

418
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:20,831
Because

419
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,367
That will only help everyone

420
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,159
Finally

421
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:26,463
We'll go to our final bit of news

422
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,487
Which is

423
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,535
Homekit devices

424
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:30,559
Are coming

425
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:31,839
Very soon

426
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:34,655
Really soon

427
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,471
That to our

428
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,775
Get ready for my music Kevin r

429
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,055
Minit review

430
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,127
So let's let's

431
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,407
Talk about some of the devices

432
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,199
What we think about

433
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,735
Yasso

434
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,271
A lot of these devices

435
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:54,879
We heard about them before it's just now becoming an availability thing we have the

436
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:57,951
Apple WWDC or worldwide developer

437
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,743
The conference next week so

438
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:02,047
I'm sure all these were some of these

439
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,839
Harbor Partners will be on stage

440
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:04,607
Show off

441
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,887
Homekit devices

442
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:06,911
I think

443
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:11,775
I'm not mistaken the first one is currently available solutreans

444
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:15,359
Caseta Wireless line is that correct I said it correctly

445
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:20,223
I think it's caseta I take a setup but I'm pretty sure it's cuz he died I talk to Lutron and I

446
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:25,599
Okay well that's what I got to write that most the caseta wireless line of switches and dimmers

447
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:27,647
Among the first products

448
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:33,023
The starter kit which I think has two dimmers two remotes and two pedestals

449
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:37,375
Humsafar to 2995 Apple Stores will sell it

450
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:41,727
So as other locations I know Lutron put out a big press release about it today

451
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:42,495
Making a big

452
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,263
Splash

453
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,055
So there's that one right there

454
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:50,687
Smart home which is what I've shop many many times over the last 10 years they've got their insteon hubs

455
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:53,503
Well now the new $150 insteon hub

456
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,527
Pro is

457
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,063
Compatible with homekit

458
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,087
It looks like

459
00:16:57,343 --> 00:17:02,975
That's not going to start shipping until July but you know I know you can order it today cuz I looked at ordering when I actually added to my car at the

460
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:03,743
Check out

461
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:07,583
I have a older insteon Hub here States and I suspect

462
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:08,863
I'm guessing it's not

463
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,143
Firmware upgradeable

464
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,167
2

465
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,447
My understanding

466
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:14,495
Cuz I talk to insteon CEO

467
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,775
At CES

468
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:22,175
And I asked him this question thinking about you and your insteon care and he said that you're going to have to buy a new one because

469
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:23,711
The

470
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:26,783
WiFi and mfi certification stuff inside

471
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,831
Certain ships only certain chips

472
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:30,111
Are going to be

473
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,135
Needed and

474
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,415
Probably don't have

475
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:33,951
No probably not

476
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:36,511
Pains of being

477
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,279
Early adopters

478
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,095
Let me tell you because you use that Smart Hub

479
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,167
So so much yes

480
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,191
I used to

481
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,215
I used to

482
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,495
Anyway

483
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:48,287
To you and I I think

484
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:51,871
Well you switch your thermostat quite a bit I'm I'm kind of sold on the nest

485
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:53,407
I know you swapped yours out

486
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,175
2 * 2

487
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:57,503
I don't know if you tried the ecobee3 but now that is homekit

488
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,271
Compatible

489
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:00,063
Sell directly to the Apple Store

490
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,855
In Apple Store it is

491
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:05,951
It does say as of today at 2 to 3 weeks delivery window it's $250

492
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:10,047
Disable controller from your iPhone iPad so on and so forth the auto way to text

493
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,583
Cancel very similar to nest

494
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,375
Can't think of any major

495
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:17,727
Differences between the two and I don't know if you know of any but

496
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,287
To see what a set-up guide

497
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,567
This is by

498
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:22,591
Farm I

499
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,359
Favorite

500
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,383
Thermostat

501
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,151
Ww3

502
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:28,223
Made by probably my favorite favorite thermostat

503
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,783
So

504
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,063
Awesome

505
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:35,135
Because ecobee learn from the nest

506
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,439
And took all of their like

507
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:39,743
Nerdy openness sensibilities

508
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:42,303
And crammed a beautiful design wrap around it

509
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,607
And then they went one up above nest

510
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:46,143
An added sensors

511
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:49,471
So with the ecobee3 you get a sensor

512
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,775
And you can buy additional sensors

513
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:54,591
That you put in rooms outside the thermostat

514
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:59,199
And they actually communicate back to the thermostat and then there's the magical Outlet

515
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,503
The tell your thermostat

516
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:02,527
Oh hey

517
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,063
This room is like

518
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:08,159
85 where is back in that cool hallway that you're in it's like

519
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:09,951
78 Sol

520
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:12,767
Maybe we need to crank up the are a little bit more because

521
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:14,303
This is the priority

522
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,607
You can buy additional sensors

523
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:20,447
So you can add it to as many rooms as you have in your house or as many rooms as you

524
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,215
You want to monitor

525
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:22,495
And

526
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:23,519
I love it

527
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:24,287
I really do

528
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:31,967
Weird constantly working at home but the thermostat is downstairs and we are both upstairs so

529
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:34,783
Sometimes we are hot when it's cold downstairs

530
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,087
The sensors should help with device

531
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:39,903
Olor devices because of the line of device

532
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:42,207
Message from Elgato it's bees product line

533
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:44,255
These are relatively inexpensive

534
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,791
Just kind of nice but they're mostly

535
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:48,607
Sensors in an information-gathering device

536
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:49,375
So you can

537
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:54,495
You can get the indoor air quality temperature and humidity inside you can you put it outside sensor and

538
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:57,567
Sketcher temperatures are pressure and so on outside

539
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:58,847
Their door

540
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:01,151
Sensors for open and close actions

541
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:03,199
Which is interesting but also

542
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:06,271
Keep track of what time those open and close and also the duration

543
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:10,623
And so you know maybe you can find out if somebody left the back door wide open and they're letting all the

544
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:12,671
Flies in the summer or something like that

545
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:14,463
And also you can add

546
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:17,791
Smart's to appliances through the eve energy

547
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:20,607
It basically sits between

548
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,655
Well it's really for four lights I would say

549
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:24,703
Put a lightbulb in this and then you put this

550
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:27,007
This into an outlet and you can measure the

551
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:29,055
Power consumption and also turn

552
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,591
They switch on or off

553
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:34,943
So these all Ranger price for about 40 to $80 so little

554
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:36,223
Less expensive

555
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:39,295
And that fits with how much most sensors right now

556
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,087
So

557
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:42,623
I'm looking at those in

558
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:43,647
That to me

559
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:45,439
Strikes me is very much

560
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:48,511
In competition with all of the kind of smart home

561
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:53,375
I was out there cuz a lot of those have a lot of sensor options for SmartThings has a bunch of sensors

562
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:59,775
Weibo actually has just announced align its es&l Salina sensors that still aren't on the market yet but

563
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:02,079
Presumably are coming out in time for the holidays

564
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,103
So

565
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:05,919
It is kind of odd to me actually because

566
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:09,247
And this is great because we have as our guest

567
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:12,831
On this week's show Chet Pipkin who is the CEO of Belk

568
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:14,879
Owns WeMo

569
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:16,416
We're going to be talking about

570
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:17,952
Why the rush.

571
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:21,792
Add sensors would write down most consumers seem to be buying

572
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,120
One-off devices to perform a single function

573
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:27,424
Are people really ready to grab

574
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:29,728
And by all these sensors so

575
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:31,008
We can look forward to that

576
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:35,360
Yashow from a review perspective

577
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,128
Cossetta's

578
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:39,456
Now I'm exhausted I've lost

579
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:40,736
Casita

580
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:41,504
Casita

581
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,552
I cannot recommend them

582
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:44,832
Like I loved

583
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,160
They are functional even when they're not connected

584
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,696
They are just really a great

585
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,256
Product you do have to install

586
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:53,280
The switches

587
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:57,888
You have to rip out your existing switch box which isn't hard but can intimidate some people

588
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:00,704
So you may want to get an electrician to do it if you're worried about

589
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:03,264
Turning off your breaker in messing with the wires

590
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:06,080
But they are amazing and

591
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:07,616
The remote controls

592
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:08,384
They work with all

593
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,688
Kinds of things I'm really curious to see if homekit

594
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:16,064
Will support using those remotes later on with other lights like used because

595
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,088
That's something that

596
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,648
I could do with the Staples connect Hub and I actually

597
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:21,952
A lot of value from doing that cuz I

598
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:22,976
Connect a bunch of

599
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,256
Desperate

600
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,280
Devices

601
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,816
Penguin remote control

602
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:28,608
So look for that that would be cool

603
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:30,144
And then

604
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:33,472
Can't recommend that Highway

605
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:35,520
And thieves product line

606
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:36,800
I mean it looks like

607
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:39,872
I will tell you though

608
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:45,760
Looking at all those white boxes I'm not sure if I really want those in my house especially with a lot of other War

609
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:48,576
Multifunction device is coming that will do

610
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:50,624
Indoor air quality temperature and humidity

611
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:52,928
Like those sensors from

612
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:56,512
Humidity and

613
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:57,280
Temperature

614
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:58,560
So you may not

615
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,584
Need bees

616
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,400
Just think about it

617
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:06,496
It been with a lot of these products safe for the insteon Hub you don't need a hub

618
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:11,616
And so that leads to one last question that I have for you and I think it's very time we considering next week

619
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:14,688
After WWDC will be recording another show

620
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,712
Do you think

621
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:18,528
There's a new Apple TV that acts as a homekit hub

622
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:23,392
I hope so there has to be if you've got these open close sensors and things like this

623
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:25,184
There's no reason to have

624
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,488
Sensors if you're not going to have

625
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,512
Them

626
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:30,048
Trigger action

627
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:31,840
Especially with other devices

628
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:32,608
Guess

629
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:35,936
Just notifying you that a door open and closed

630
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:37,728
Is not exciting to the average

631
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:39,776
So

632
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:43,360
You want to know that that door open and close did you want that to trigger

633
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:44,384
Your lights.

634
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:45,664
Or

635
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:46,688
Say something

636
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:48,736
I don't know what I said to do that

637
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:52,064
And to do it consistently even when your phone is away from home

638
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:52,832
You need a hug

639
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:53,600
Inside your house

640
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:57,440
So I think I think you're right and I do think we will see that next week

641
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:58,464
That's

642
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:01,280
I assume it's going to be an Apple TV but

643
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:04,096
Maybe they'll be a coloring box and it will Doom

644
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,400
We will see

645
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:07,936
Awesome alright

646
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:09,216
That's it for this week

647
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:09,984
And

648
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:12,544
Stay tuned for our guests who again is checked

649
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,848
Pipkin the CEO of weibo

650
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:16,896
And we will see you next week

651
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:22,528
After we do more from Apple and we will have an exciting device review with the ring doorbell

652
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:24,576
And it will be a lot of fun

653
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:25,600
Thanks for listening

654
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:35,072

00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:47,360
Hello and thanks so much for having me here

661
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:49,664
I am really excited I was

662
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,712
Just before the show started I was talking

663
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:52,736
Chat Noir saying

664
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:55,552
You guys have a great business because I think I have bought

665
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:57,600
More products from Belkin that I have either

666
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:58,624
Lost

667
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,416
Store has stored in a box

668
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,440
And then we bought

669
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:03,232
Because I needed it and I couldn't find it

670
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:05,024
So ye on you

671
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:09,632
Spell thank you very very much for all of that we've been around for about

672
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:11,936
30 years or so so we would hope

673
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:13,728
Set you have at least a few things

674
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:14,496
Stacy

675
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:17,312
I do might the reason you're on the show is because I have

676
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:18,592
WeMo products

677
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:20,384
WeMo is your lineup

678
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,152
Connected

679
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:22,176
Home Products

680
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:22,944
Sand

681
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,296
They include connected Wi-Fi light switches connected Outlets

682
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:29,088
Confusingly you guys call a switch

683
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:30,880
Connected cameras

684
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:32,928
And an upcoming line of

685
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:33,952
Sensors

686
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:36,000
And a bunch of other things light bulbs

687
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:37,024
Actually also

688
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:39,584
Yeah we've actually been building up

689
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,120
Platform for about

690
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:43,680
6 years I'm not always

691
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:47,008
That excited about this term of like smart home or

692
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,360
Connected home but I don't think we have found a better way to be able to

693
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:53,408
The kind of talked about that but it is

694
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:57,760
Short of being able to enable experiences that people want

695
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:00,064
To have hey I want my lights coming up

696
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,856
On when the Sun goes down

697
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:05,184
I don't want my irrigation system to

698
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:07,744
Water when it's raining outside

699
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:09,280
Big Apple to unlock

700
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:13,376
These kinds of experiences for folks is really fun place to be

701
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:18,496
I think it's a good one you've been very open so far you guys have done a lot of work with

702
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:20,032
If this then that

703
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:21,056
Which is a connected

704
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,152
Platform that lets you link devices to web services

705
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:30,016
You actually are one of the two companies that work right now with the Amazon Echo

706
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,040
And

707
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:36,416
For a long time I have had devices on the SmartThings platform that work with WeMo

708
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:37,184
Pad

709
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:37,952
What

710
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:38,976
Appear to be hacked

711
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:42,560
WeMo things with applications on my phone such as

712
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:44,352
Reach or you know me

713
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:49,472
So I'm very curious because this week we are in the middle of a bunch of news in this space we

714
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:50,496
With Apple and Google

715
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,312
Both announcing pretty big

716
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:54,336
Efforts

717
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:56,896
Where is WeMo going to play

718
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:58,432
This is all sort of

719
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:04,832
Unfolding the way that we would have helped it too and that's great to see other folks coming on

720
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:07,648
Okay now you are not a apple

721
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:08,672
Apple homekit partner

722
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:10,208
Write like a formal app

723
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:14,304
Yeah we're not announced formally today

724
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,632
So we're in did really close dialog

725
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:19,936
To figure out on a collective basis

726
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:20,960
What's the best

727
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:23,008
Way to really enhance

728
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:24,544
And further

729
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,312
Stand

730
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:30,432
Liam homekit if experiences and the WeMo experiences

731
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:31,456
In the bath

732
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:32,736
Possible way

733
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:36,832
A couple weeks ago I got on the podcast and was a little frustrated with me Moby

734
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:37,856
Because I couldn't

735
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:38,624
Use

736
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:39,648
My

737
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:44,000
Switch exactly like I wanted to I kept having issues with it

738
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:46,560
Kind of understanding what state it was in

739
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:49,376
And I suspect it was because I was using it with

740
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:50,144
Too many

741
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:51,168
Apps

742
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:52,448
So I was

743
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:56,800
I would turn it on with my Amazon Echo and maybe I would turn it off via SmartThings

744
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:57,568
And

745
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:59,360
Sometimes it just would

746
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:01,152
Worker wouldn't know where it was

747
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:03,968
So I would love to get your take on

748
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,296
Is this a problem that I'm experiencing because I am just

749
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:08,832
Crazy and using way too many app

750
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:09,600
Applications

751
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:11,904
I know that some developers have expressed

752
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,672
Appreciation with

753
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:14,720
Keno cloud and I just love to hear

754
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:16,000
As a user

755
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:17,792
What should I be doing here

756
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:20,096
And is there anything that we most trying

757
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:22,656
I don't know address

758
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:23,424
These issues

759
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:24,704
Yasso

760
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:27,008
Our promise and our

761
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:29,312
Commitment around the WeMo brand

762
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:34,688
Would be for us to do everything we can do to make

763
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:38,016
Those experiences you you are having

764
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,832
Reliable land

765
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:42,624
Consistent as we

766
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,392
Cam

767
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:44,672
And it is

768
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:47,232
Inevitable that this is going to get

769
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,816
Increasingly complicated for all of us

770
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:53,376
So working off of the WeMo app

771
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:54,912
Is complicated

772
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:57,728
For us but it should be really simple for the

773
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:58,752
User

774
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,544
Being able to

775
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:05,920
Access of Leverage off of all of the insights that exist on the internet

776
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:09,760
Is it dark outside is it light out dumb side

777
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:12,832
When is it that I want my lights coming on and off

778
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:14,368
I don't want to think about it

779
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,136
Can I just

780
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:16,160
Hook in

781
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:20,256
To I'm all of that data using if this then that

782
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:22,816
Now I want to be able to use my voice

783
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:25,120
Using my Amazon Echo

784
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:26,400
Our goal

785
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:30,240
Is 2 a make that a very straightforward and very reliable

786
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:31,264
Experience for you

787
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,616
There are some folks out there who are packing into WeMo

788
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:36,640
It's a little

789
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:39,200
Chopper to make those a really robust

790
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:40,480
Experience

791
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:41,504
And I think

792
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,272
Over

793
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:43,040
Time

794
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:44,576
You'll see

795
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:48,160
More and more of us working together in a formal

796
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:50,720
Authorized way to help

797
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:55,584
To ensure that your experiences are really I want you can count on

798
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:59,168
And that you are really good at a lot of benefit joy out of

799
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:00,960
I'll blame my

800
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:01,728
The acne

801
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:03,776
And we're hacking into the

802
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:05,568
Are hacking into the WeMo cloud

803
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:06,848
All right

804
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:08,384
With the idea that

805
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,152
You guys

806
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:10,432
Launched at CES

807
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:11,968
A bunch of

808
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:13,248
Shutters

809
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:19,648
Which I thought was actually kind of an interesting move because it seems kind of like a step back in the sense that most people right now

810
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:21,440
I'll seem to be gravitating towards

811
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:22,976
What off devices

812
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:26,304
Why did you guys launch all these sensors

813
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,072
When

814
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:28,352
A lot of people

815
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:30,144
Seem to be launching

816
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:36,800
Kenneth Comcast and ATT and all of these could have bigger vendors are coming into the market and they're saying Hey will do all these

817
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:38,848
Centers and all that for you and then you die

818
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:41,408
Just bring in your bring your own one-off devices

819
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:42,688
Which

820
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:45,504
Height of seems like it might be easy for consumers I don't know

821
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:49,344
So I'd love to hear your take on kind of where you think the Market's going and

822
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,624
Why you guys are

823
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:52,928
Betting on the sensors being

824
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:53,696
A big deal

825
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:54,720
We think that

826
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:56,000
The markets in what

827
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:57,536
Boomers

828
00:30:57,792 --> 00:31:01,888
To Adorn unfolding in a way that we thought they were likely to

829
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:02,656
First

830
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:03,936
We thought that it was

831
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:07,008
A really critical thing for us to do to build out this

832
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:08,032
Platform

833
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:09,056
That would

834
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:10,336
Easily

835
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:13,408
Port and allow lots of different

836
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,688
Experiences

837
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:19,552
Do all work as one experience for folk over the coming years

838
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:22,880
So while you're right there's a lot of

839
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:23,904
Success

840
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:27,232
From one brand or another with the singular type

841
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:28,000
Experience

842
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:29,792
Overtime

843
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:33,376
We think that it is inevitable that people will want

844
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:39,008
Everything in their home to work well with one another we are think that there's

845
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:39,776
Benefit

846
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:43,872
I'm not being able just to kind of sense one spot in your home

847
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:48,480
But rather to a be able to take a look at your whole home

848
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:51,808
So you will see our thinking around

849
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:53,344
Sensors and

850
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,880
And switches being

851
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:56,672
It's easier to add one

852
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:02,048
And it's easy to on the add more so I can have as little

853
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:05,120
Of my home or as much

854
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:05,888
My home

855
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,680
Sort of covered

856
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:08,960
Censored

857
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:10,496
Monitored

858
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:11,520
And then

859
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:16,128
Managed IT exactly the way that I would want that to Abby

860
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,968
And it's great for Belkin to because I found with my smart home gadgets

861
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,504
No one can buy

862
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:24,576
Yeah that's a really really big piece

863
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:26,368
Ivar's thinking to is

864
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,184
Some of those other brands who I'm named

865
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,232
And the way that the mothers are thinking

866
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:34,048
About this people would have to make a big

867
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:35,840
Commitment upfront

868
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:37,376
Said they might have to

869
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:39,424
Commit to a monthly fee

870
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:41,472
That's an asking people

871
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:43,008
For a lot

872
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:44,288
If what they want

873
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:48,640
Two-a-day was just one thing or they want to see how that one thing

874
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:49,408
Works

875
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:50,432
Prior to adding

876
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:51,712
A second

877
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:53,760
So let's

878
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:55,296
Let's talk about the rest of Belk

879
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:57,856
Can because you guys also on the Linksys brand of router

880
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:01,184
And I have always been kind of really interested in

881
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:02,976
The role that the router can

882
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:06,816
Play in the smart home because I think like the specialized hubs are

883
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:08,864
Dirt their tradition kind of

884
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:10,144
Thing and

885
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:11,424
All that kind of

886
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,472
Mini radios that live in the router

887
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:19,616
Any intelligence that you need in the home will probably also live in the router baby lives in a set-top box I don't know

888
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:21,408
Epicurious like

889
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:23,200
What your thoughts are there in

890
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:26,784
How you'll have to work with vendors and what kind of intelligence

891
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:28,320
Ends up getting

892
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:29,344
Pushed into the router

893
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:31,648
Still weren't fortunate space

894
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:34,208
As a total organization here because

895
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:37,280
In addition to a WeMo we

896
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:39,328
I also have Linksys

897
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:44,192
We've been in this wireless router space for longer

898
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:47,264
Then that we have been doing WeMo item so

899
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:52,384
It is always been our thought that Wi-Fi will be a early

900
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:56,480
Predominant way of us looking things up in our home

901
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:58,272
The Wi-Fi's got

902
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:01,088
A couple of limitations also

903
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,416
One of those is the amount of power that it takes

904
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:07,232
2 I run that Wi-Fi signal

905
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:08,000
So

906
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:12,864
You mentioned zigbee zigbee another kind of radio that

907
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,400
People would not be

908
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:15,936
Nearly as

909
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:18,240
Comfortable with as Wi-Fi

910
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:22,080
And we don't want people to I'm even have to think about that

911
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:25,664
So the way that we approach the non

912
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,200
Wi-Fi way of

913
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:28,224
Getting

914
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:30,784
Smart devices hooked up in

915
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,064
My home

916
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:32,832
Is

917
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:35,904
Do offer the WeMo link for the WeMo link

918
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:40,768
Is a Wifi to zigbee bridge but it's a really curated experience

919
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,560
With specific saying

920
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:49,216
Our first thing is are smart bulbs both ones made by WeMo and

921
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:49,984
So

922
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:51,776
Wi-Fi is going to play

923
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:55,360
Really big role is as it does already as

924
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:56,384
The big waves

925
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,432
Getting things connected in my home

926
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,248
All of that takes place through

927
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:03,040
My wireless router

928
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:05,344
And we've got a lot of great experience with

929
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,368
Linksys

930
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:08,160
All of this will work

931
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:09,440
Two I'm gathering

932
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:11,744
More and more seamless way over time

933
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:15,328
All right as a consumer I look at a lot of things

934
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:17,632
This stuff and I'm really excited about it

935
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:18,912
But I also

936
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:20,960
And looking at it and thinking

937
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:22,240
Holly golly gosh

938
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:24,032
This is very expensive

939
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:25,056
So

940
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:26,848
When I look at the

941
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:27,872
WeMo Outlet

942
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:29,408
I purchased mine

943
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:30,432
3 years ago

944
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:31,968
And it was $50

945
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,272
And it is still $50

946
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:35,040
Switch

947
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:36,832
I felt by now that the pricing

948
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:39,392
Would it come down quite honestly on this

949
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,440
And then I

950
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:44,512
Also look at things like the connected coffee pot

951
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:46,560
Is $149

952
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:49,632
That is a lot to pay for a coffee pot

953
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:50,912
And I understand that the

954
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:52,704
Coffee pot is not just like

955
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,496
Hey we put a Wi-Fi radio in

956
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:55,264
But

957
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:57,824
When can we kind of expect to see

958
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:58,848
Prices come down

959
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:03,968
Really excited to be able to bring these new kinds of

960
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:05,248
Experiences in

961
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,784
Benefits to a

962
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,832
People's homes into

963
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:09,856
People's lives

964
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:16,768
Like I'm you wear I'm highly motivated to be able to find ways to a be able to do that

965
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,096
Static even better cost benefit

966
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:21,376
Overtime

967
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:24,704
And a little bit of it depends upon our

968
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,728
Perspectives

969
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:29,568
For example prior to the WeMo sensor

970
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:30,592
And switch

971
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:34,944
The only way that people would be able to benefit

972
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,248
From some of those capabilities

973
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,576
Would have been to get actually

974
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:43,136
A multi thousand-dollar system

975
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,416
Brought them in

976
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:45,440
To their home

977
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:47,744
Maybe with recurring

978
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:50,560
Charges every every month so

979
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:52,096
The huge cost

980
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:52,864
Benefit

981
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,400
That we might brought

982
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:55,680
On day one

983
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:59,520
Was a celebrated I think that correctly in that moment

984
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:01,312
But now

985
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:05,152
Couple of years has gone by so I think we have a new

986
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:06,688
Perspective on

987
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:08,480
What things should have cost

988
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:10,016
While you I'm haven't

989
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:11,040
Seeing the price

990
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:13,600
Of that switch go down

991
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:14,368
Yats

992
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:18,976
I think it's something that we will see for sure in the coming years

993
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:20,768
And I think that on

994
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,888
Did the appliance side with things like coffee pots and heaters and

995
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:27,680
Other things that

996
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:29,472
We have in our homes

997
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:31,264
In most cases it's

998
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,544
The high-end

999
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,104
Of them everything that is first being brought

1000
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,384
End of a smart home

1001
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:38,688
And I think that I was at my

1002
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:39,968
Braids down

1003
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,760
Into

1004
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:42,784
Lower price

1005
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,064
Point items

1006
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:47,904
Will see them cost of connected items come

1007
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:48,672
Down

1008
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,720
Well I look forward to that

1009
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:52,256
And then finally

1010
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,304
This is a fun one for you

1011
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,840
What devices

1012
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:56,864
Do you want to see

1013
00:37:57,888 --> 00:38:01,216
For me it's the kinds of experiences that I want to have

1014
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:02,240
At home

1015
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:06,592
I look forward to a system that works well with one another

1016
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:09,664
And what it is that damn I expect out of that system

1017
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:10,688
Gosip

1018
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:13,248
Virtually every single day

1019
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,296
So used to drive me nuts

1020
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:17,088
But I couldn't get into my

1021
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,904
Garage from outside of my house

1022
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:21,952
Then I was delighted that I could

1023
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:24,000
Could do that off of my WeMo app

1024
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:24,768
Then

1025
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:29,376
I was irritated again that I was driving away from home but I couldn't

1026
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:32,704
Get WeMo to do that for me automatic

1027
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:36,288
So my expectation for what it is

1028
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:40,128
But I wanted my own experiences and my own home

1029
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,408
Go up

1030
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:44,992
Every time that I get something done I wanted to

1031
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:49,088
Do more that'll be a both a little bit of a curse

1032
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:50,624
Integrate

1033
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,160
Ability for

1034
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:58,560
Future great experiences that WeMo and the mothers can unlock for

1035
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:02,656
As the systems work in a more holistic way

1036
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:04,960
As soon as my smartphone connects

1037
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:06,240
To my

1038
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:08,800
Smart Wifi Linksys router

1039
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:11,104
My system knows that I'm home

1040
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,152
Things should be able to

1041
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:15,456
Happened for me automatically

1042
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:18,016
With about me I'm thinking about it

1043
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:21,088
So these holistic experiences

1044
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:25,696
Everything working to gather in a seamless fashion

1045
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:27,232
Is definitely what I'm looking

1046
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:28,000
Forward to

1047
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:28,768
Me too

1048
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:29,536
I'm

1049
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:33,632
Going one harder though I'm looking forward it to it happening

1050
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:36,704
Even though not all of my devices are in the same platform

1051
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:38,240
I think I'm crazy

1052
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:44,128
Let's hope that you're not as crazy as of your thinking

1053
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,200
I'm I'm with you I will drink to that only I'm not drink

1054
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:48,480
All right

1055
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:52,064
Thank you so much for coming on the show I really appreciate it

1056
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:57,184
It's really really good to hear thank you for having me and I look forward to seeing you soon

1057
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,256
That's all for this week show stay tuned for next week
