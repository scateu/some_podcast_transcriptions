00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,776
Hey everybody Welcome to The Internet of Things show

2
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:14,592
This is Stacey Higginbotham and my co-host

3
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:15,616
Kevin tofel

4
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:21,504
And we are coming to you today from lovely New York city so I'm going to apologize if you hear honking or text

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,784
Tcaps in the background

6
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:24,576
I'm not in my studio

7
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:25,600
It Kevin

8
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:27,392
What's your excuse for the day

9
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:31,488
It's early in the morning that you woke me up for this ship

10
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:33,536
I have no excuse now

11
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:39,424
It's very early in the morning for Kevin so let's let's talk a little slower today we'll take it a little easier

12
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:41,472
Starting off with

13
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:42,752
The big news this is

14
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:44,288
The day after

15
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,312
Apple's big

16
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:46,848
Keto diet at

17
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:49,664
W is a WWDC

18
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,944
DC

19
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:56,064
It's WWDC worldwide and appleland is one Kit Kat needed word

20
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,600
Okay that's what I thought

21
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:00,928
Someone the other day was trying to tell me otherwise

22
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:02,720
It's not

23
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:04,256
So this is the day after

24
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:06,304
WWDC

25
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:07,328
And

26
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,120
I was looking for a lot

27
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:11,424
A lot of news around homekit

28
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,752
As you guys probably could tell having listened to our previous two shows

29
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:16,288
And Kevin

30
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:18,336
Do we get any news around homekit

31
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:19,616
We got bikers

32
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:22,176
We did we got

33
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:24,480
How do you say we got very little

34
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:26,272
And now you're right you're right

35
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:28,576
It's the bikini was very

36
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:34,976
Pactiv a lot to talk about but the focus was not on homekit for sure it was certainly on iOS 9

37
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:37,536
IOS 1011

38
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:39,840
Apple pay in Saint sauveur

39
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:46,240
Don't get really barely got a mention there was talk of the new devices that are currently available and then

40
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:51,360
They turn more towards the future and said here is what we're going to have funeral homes

41
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:54,176
Punk it will be able to support window blinds and

42
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:58,272
Other sensors and you'll be able to remotely access your homekit

43
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,040
Devices

44
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,064
Through iCloud

45
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,904
Which is interested in say through your Apple TV because we found out last week

46
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,208
That is one of the ways you will actually do that

47
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:08,256
True and actually there was no apple.

48
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,024
TV news

49
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,304
Again Butkus

50
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,072
Nothing

51
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:13,120
They did have the streaming media service

52
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,400
So

53
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:16,192
I actually talk to you

54
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:20,800
Stewart Lombard who is the CEO of ecobee because I was very

55
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:21,568
Curious

56
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,920
About the ecobee last show we speculated originally that the ecobee

57
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:28,224
3 which was going to be homekit supported

58
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:31,040
It would get an over-the-air software update cuz that

59
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:33,088
Made the most sense for my perspective

60
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:40,000
Especially considering they launched this thermostat in September 2014 after homekit was even announced

61
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:44,352
What we found out later and we had a correction on the show was that

62
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,400
Actually

63
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:49,216
You have to buy a new one and people were not

64
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:50,240
Happy

65
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,008
No

66
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:54,848
And I can understand that means spending a $250 on a thermostat

67
00:02:55,616 --> 00:03:00,480
Install a gate in your house and then realizing it less than a year later it's basically not going to be

68
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:02,016
Compatible with homekit

69
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:04,320
If we get something that's important to you that

70
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,344
That's a real bummer

71
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:11,232
I I would agree with you let me here's a question and not and it's okay if you don't know the answer I don't know the answer either but

72
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:17,888
Yes we know that Apple announced the homekit platform look at last year's WWDC so last May or June I forget which month

73
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:18,656
It was last year

74
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:25,568
And it's been talking to her partners and so on and so forth and has the homekit certification program and there's a little hunk it logo for

75
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:26,848
For that certification program

76
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,992
Did ecobee and other Hardware partners that matter have the homekit logo on the products that they've been selling up to this point

77
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,016
I'm betting not

78
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,296
No they haven't

79
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,392
So ecobee basically it was one of the first four devices

80
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,928
I got certified last week

81
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,976
The others with a Lutron

82
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,768
Specific Lutron hub

83
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,304
Specific insteon hub

84
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,608
Is it alegado

85
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:50,400
A group of sensors

86
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:55,008
That will not be back out or they will not be on the market anytime soon

87
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,312
In talking to Stewart because

88
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:02,432
I heard enough complaints from people I was I was like I got to talk to this guy and figure out what's going on

89
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,968
He told me

90
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,784
But what happened was sometime after

91
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,064
After CES

92
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,344
Basically

93
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,112
Apple

94
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:16,512
Made up its mind and went with the hardware-based security solution which meant that the existing products

95
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:20,607
Existing ecobee3 products on the market we're not going to be upgradable

96
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:23,679
Obviously he was very disappointed by that he said

97
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:25,727
He said he thought about it but

98
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,263
He wanted to get his product

99
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:30,591
Updated it out and certified by Apple

100
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:34,431
And he was acknowledging that his other users are going to be kind of left out in

101
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,199
Nicole

102
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:35,967
But

103
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:36,991
They're still going to get

104
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,783
Updates for all the other stuff

105
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:39,551
It's just not home

106
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,623
It's definitely a catch-22 for any

107
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:45,951
Hardware maker or device maker this space because you

108
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:50,559
Don't want to upset your existing customer base they're the ones that are helping you move forward to begin with

109
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:55,167
But you don't want to miss the opportunity being one of the first quarter quell first people to

110
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,447
You know p

111
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:59,263
Certified and be in the Apple store and have

112
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,287
That wide

113
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:03,103
Range of availability at such a tough call

114
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:05,151
Exactly he hears a quote from

115
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:05,919
Storage

116
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:06,687
He told me

117
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:10,527
We could have held back on homekit and left our existing model in the market

118
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:14,111
But we wanted to involve the platform as quickly as possible

119
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:18,719
No matter when we decided to do the upgrade there is always going to be someone who bought the

120
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:19,999
The products last month

121
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:21,535
It's true

122
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,303
It's true

123
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,607
So the reason

124
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,655
Herb for anybody

125
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:28,447
What is this

126
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,263
It looks like it boils down to Apple security

127
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:34,335
Its or at least in this case Lombard said that

128
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:38,687
Apple required a security coprocessor to actually be in the device

129
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:40,735
And they open till

130
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,527
Currently January when they told

131
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:44,575
Ecobee said it wouldn't be

132
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,903
Supper a credible they were going back and forth like

133
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:50,975
Would it be software upgradable or would it have to be Hardware

134
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:54,303
And apparently Apple chose Hardware with his co-processor

135
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:58,143
And that actually has big ramifications because it sounds like

136
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,471
That wasn't actually known until after CES

137
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:05,311
So when I talk to Philips the makers of the hue light bulbs at CVS

138
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:11,199
They implied strongly that their customers would have access or their customers would be upgradable

139
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,991
They didn't come out and say it

140
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:17,599
But the implied very strongly that their customers who are their existing customers

141
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:18,623
Wouldn't have problems

142
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,391
Switch homekit

143
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,439
What's actually happen

144
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,231
Philips hue light bulbs

145
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:25,279
They're homekit certified that hoe

146
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,559
Whole package won't come out

147
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,583
Until September

148
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:30,399
And it is going to require new hardware

149
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,679
Black Phillip says

150
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:34,239
They will make sure that their existing

151
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:35,263
Hue light bulb

152
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,543
Holders will

153
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,335
Let's see what was there quote

154
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:40,895
All existing hue light sources will be made

155
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,431
Compatible with homekit

156
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:48,831
Apple's homekit support will launch this fall and Philips Hue will help existing users to upgrade their system

157
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,903
So I don't know what kind of help I should be looking for 4

158
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,183
Yas

159
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:58,559
I am turn on I doubt it's going to be a trade in program I have no idea what it's going to be maybe some reduce rates

160
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,095
Basically this is

161
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:02,143
This looks to be about security

162
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,935
Which is very important to a

163
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,727
And

164
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,263
From a user standpoint that's

165
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:13,663
Crate I was at a conference last week where the CMO of Home Depot actually raised her hand and asked a panel of smart home

166
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,455
Manufacturers

167
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:17,503
What is the deal with security

168
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,527
How can we

169
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:22,111
Sell these things to Consumers when there's a big concern about this

170
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:24,415
And if the CMO of Home Depot

171
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:28,767
Which is a retailer that stocks a lot of these products is concerned about security then

172
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,071
You know what baby apple made the right back here

173
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:33,631
I don't think they made the wrong

174
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,935
Decision here I think choosing

175
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:36,959
Tighter or

176
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:41,567
Security that you can control and some other way shape or form is much better

177
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:46,687
It's just that the timing of it and the communication to Partners and sew onto made it

178
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:49,247
We see this a lot it's not just that

179
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:53,855
I also don't want to pick on any single company in here but we see this a lot especially in this space

180
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,903
Plan people have great plans

181
00:07:56,415 --> 00:08:00,255
The details are still murky when the plans get announced platforms are announced

182
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,047
And then over time as

183
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,071
Details come

184
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,607
Qunar workout

185
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,887
Ultimately

186
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:08,191
Consumers are either left flirting cuz they

187
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,471
But earlier products

188
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:11,263
It's something is change of the platform

189
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:14,847
Or something to that effect it's it's it's really really tough It's

190
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,639
Frustrating

191
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:19,711
Especially in this space because I've been doing this for

192
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:20,991
5 years old

193
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,527
Do-it-yourself home

194
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:23,807
Stuff

195
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:24,831
It's frustrating

196
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,927
It is so the moral here is the moral here don't be an early adopter

197
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:33,023
Well I mean I'm I'm always going to be one because it's in my blood

198
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,327
So it's hard for me to say that kind of feel like

199
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,119
I shouldn't say that but yeah

200
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:40,703
There's there's a lot of great products out there and they offer so much

201
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:41,727
Thomas

202
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:48,127
But at the end of the day may make sense to not go with version 1 of anything and then wait for v2 I mean that's that's pretty

203
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:51,199
And nodejs in iot space but

204
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:53,503
Phone watches wearables whatever maybe

205
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:54,527
There we go

206
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:59,647
Well out there was some watch news so that the second iteration of the Apple watch

207
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:00,671
Since you haven't

208
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:03,487
Apple watch are you excited what did you think about the

209
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,255
Futuristic

210
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:09,631
I think what we're moving real fast and we went from watch OS want to watch OS 2 in a matter of

211
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,399
6 weeks

212
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:14,239
Cuz that's what that one else watch os2 for their Apple watch

213
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:18,079
I am excited that the whole Apple watch experience has been

214
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,871
Mostly good for me it

215
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:23,199
Been disappointing in terms of apps because there really are no native apps

216
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:25,503
From third parties only from Apple

217
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:28,831
And the glances in the notifications and such

218
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:32,927
They can take time to get from the phone which is where the

219
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,463
Watch apps are really running now

220
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:36,511
So it's been a frustrating experience

221
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:39,583
Watch os2 should help that because it gave developers the Opera

222
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,631
Opportunity the tools I should say

223
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,935
To build native apps so

224
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,031
Some of the some of the interesting bits here there's going to be more

225
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,079
Customizable faces

226
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:51,359
Really liked actually the

227
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:54,431
The time lapse face I don't know if you got to see any of this Stacy but

228
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:57,759
You can take a time-lapse photo and then when you when your watch

229
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,551
Activate to show you the time

230
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:03,647
Time lapse washer take place so it's you know you might get a boat going across a

231
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,975
River really fast in a time lapse matter what I was just kind of Interest

232
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:12,351
App developers will get to create their own was called complications on watches Witcher

233
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,399
Little data points so

234
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,191
Instead of having just the

235
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:21,567
The Apple only type choices for what you can put on your watch face you'll be able to say put your

236
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:24,895
Your next appointment or your travel schedule for example or

237
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:26,431
They showed

238
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:28,223
The charging rate of your

239
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,247
Hybrid car

240
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,783
Just like the activity

241
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:33,343
Rings that they have on there today

242
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:37,695
So your car is charging little ring won't close up you know so you can have that on your watch

243
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:40,511
So developers to create that which is awesome

244
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,535
Whatever they want

245
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,815
And complications

246
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:43,839
Ventura watch

247
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,631
Compilations actually

248
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:48,959
That's a realtor it's a real watch Turbo I thought I think

249
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:51,007
It's like all the little

250
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,335
Any

251
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:57,407
Yeah any additional information other than the time

252
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,455
Libya complication watch the date

253
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,223
Today

254
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,759
The time zone exactly

255
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,551
So there you go so

256
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:07,647
Wow I just sent that early in the morning

257
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:08,927
Okay

258
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,463
So outside of app

259
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:11,999
I have

260
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:14,303
Because I was in San Francisco last week

261
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,327
Meeting with startups

262
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,119
I have an amazing

263
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,399
Start up that I have to

264
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,167
To tell you about

265
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:21,471
They're making an intelligent oven

266
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:23,263
So

267
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,799
Play The Jacksons can I just

268
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:26,079
Punch numbers in

269
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:29,663
Just have it's almost as cool so here's what they're did

270
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:32,223
These guys are making a countertop oven

271
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,247
And they

272
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:37,087
Instead of just being like I'm going to put some Wi-Fi in it and it's going to be smart

273
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:39,391
What they've done is they've added

274
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,671
A camera

275
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,207
On the roof of the oven

276
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,231
That

277
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:45,023
Looks at the food inside they've added

278
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,815
Integrated thermometer probe

279
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,887
Now that you can shove into the food and then they've added

280
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,679
Sensors in the feet

281
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:52,447
Of the other

282
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:53,727
So

283
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,775
The oven itself can become a scale

284
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,311
So what happens is

285
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:59,359
If you stick like a roast

286
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:02,175
You take a roast and you stick it in the oven you're going to pop

287
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:05,247
Thermometer in there so it knows the temperature inside

288
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,015
The chicken

289
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:08,319
The camera is going to recognize

290
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:10,111
That there's a chicken in the oven

291
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,903
It's using the same sort of

292
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:15,487
Computer vision algorithms that Google and Microsoft working on

293
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:18,815
It's a little easier for them because there's a lot

294
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:19,839
Fewer

295
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:22,399
Food classes that they have to teach the computer

296
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:25,215
Because everything taste like chicken

297
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,263
This is a bagel taste like chicken

298
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,311
Descale

299
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,079
Elements

300
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,615
Measure the weight of your check

301
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:33,407
So basically what you do

302
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:35,455
Ability as you can tell the

303
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,223
Open

304
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,783
Capacitive touch screen on the front

305
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:39,807
Of course it does

306
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:41,855
In-N-Out

307
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:42,879
I should say that but

308
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,671
I never want to touch

309
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:47,231
Spike my hands get so greasy I'm like I don't want to touch

310
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,255
You know anything

311
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,279
Any touch screen

312
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,583
It wouldn't be nothing without a knob anyway

313
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,631
So you can pop your chicken in

314
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,935
You say hey I want to roast chicken

315
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,983
Set your timer

316
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:01,055
It will set your temperature it will do all of that for you

317
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,919
Because it knows how much it weighs it knows it's a chicken at knows the temperature inside

318
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:06,943
As it's been cooked

319
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:07,711
Anna Scott

320
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,479
Panchos

321
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:11,551
Recipes and stuff inside and the ability to kind of

322
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,367
So it's pretty amazing

323
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,647
The other thing about it

324
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,183
And you can also do your own

325
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:19,487
You do not have to follow if you're like

326
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,023
I am smarter than you

327
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,327
Call the June oven so I'm smarter than you June

328
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,607
You can do that

329
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,655
And it also has

330
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,679
Adapt

331
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:34,335
But the nice thing about the app is with all of the stuff you don't actually to keep going back and checking on your food so even if you don't try

332
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,639
You can look at the camera in

333
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,431
See the food inside of you like

334
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,967
My chicken looks almost done

335
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:41,759
And you don't have to keep opening in the oven

336
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:42,527
So that's

337
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,319
Someone who is like

338
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,855
A little Taipei in

339
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,647
You know makes things all the time

340
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:48,671
And has a husband who

341
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:51,743
Petrified of food that's not cooked to the proper temperature

342
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,279
Would be amazing for me

343
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:55,071
So this it's on your countertop

344
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:58,911
It has its about 22 in across

345
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,703
The big Square thing so it

346
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,751
It would replace its large

347
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:03,775
The other thing

348
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,055
About this is

349
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,359
They built it of new materials

350
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,151
And they really rethought

351
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:11,967
The oven in a way that I think is amazing like

352
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:13,247
The heating elements

353
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,271
AR

354
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,551
Carbon nanotubes

355
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:16,831
Basically

356
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,367
Carbon fiber nanotubes

357
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,647
Steady up

358
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:23,487
Superfast for your oven to preheat to 350 degrees in 4 minutes

359
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,023
Which

360
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,815
That's impressive that is nice

361
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,863
And there's like all kinds of like

362
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:33,727
Oven features I'll call them Thursday consulted with Michael Mina who is a chef

363
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,263
About like

364
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,055
Oven features you need

365
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,591
Zoe's

366
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,127
Easy Bake Oven to.

367
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:42,943
Exactly it's a it's a fancy toaster oven

368
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,223
So

369
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:46,015
Considering that a wall oven

370
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:50,367
How much does it cost

371
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,135
Okay

372
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:51,903
It cost

373
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,695
$1,500

374
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:56,767
Well that's actually less than I

375
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,303
Expected but then again

376
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,327
It is small

377
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,887
It is small so you cannot cook a turkey

378
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,215
A traditional half sheet cookie sheet cannot fit in it

379
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:06,239
You have to get

380
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,263
Especial

381
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,823
It will fit a 9 by 13 baking

382
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,871
Which is the traditional kind of

383
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,663
Baking pan that use for cakes

384
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:18,783
It'll come with its own stuff too but you can buy special size

385
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,831
Cure for smaller ovens believe in

386
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:24,671
They're not it'll fit a tray that is 11 in by 16 in

387
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:28,511
That's actually about an inch smaller around a half sheet

388
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:30,303
A traditional half sheet

389
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,071
Trey

390
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,351
So

391
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,119
Is it

392
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,655
Replacement oven

393
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:37,471
For most things

394
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,239
Probably

395
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:39,519
Yeah

396
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:42,079
For everything know you can't cook your Thanksgiving turkey

397
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:43,871
Right right

398
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:51,807
Traditional wall oven does cost between 11000 in like if they can go up to it like crazy high things I've got a

399
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,087
Double wall oven that was like

400
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,879
3500 I think

401
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:55,647
So

402
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,671
Athens or not

403
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:58,719
Cheap but this is probably

404
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:02,815
Unless you're you know Young and Living in a small apartment this is probably not

405
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:03,583
Replace rubber

406
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:07,423
Yeah I put a burrito saying about being early adopters

407
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,471
Exactly

408
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:12,287
I really I really do I like that they

409
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:15,103
I like all the sensors I've seen that piecemeal

410
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:18,687
We talked about super mechanical waves you can Heather CEO in the podcast

411
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:24,319
Talk about the range thermometer and the intelligence that adds there's the meld kitchen knob the oven knob

412
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:28,159
That does a similar kind of learning thing that helps you it has

413
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,439
A knob that

414
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,207
Controls

415
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:32,767
Your stove start your stove top

416
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:36,095
And what it does is it measures the

417
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:38,911
Temperature of whatever you're cooking on the stove

418
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:41,215
And that it automatically adjust

419
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:47,615
Burners basically back or up to keep that temperature in the rate range for doing whatever you're trying to do

420
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:50,687
Is this a currently available or is it coming soon

421
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:53,247
You can pre-order it

422
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:54,271
Starting this week

423
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:56,319
You have to put $95 down

424
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:58,111
If it will not be out

425
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,135
Until spring of

426
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,159
26

427
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:06,559
I was going to say if it's out soon I give it a year before Samsung buy these guys

428
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,095
There you go well

429
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,631
Make it two years now

430
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:14,495
Make it two years I've seen I seen the oven at baked me cookies they were delicious

431
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,263
So

432
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:17,823
I am sitting

433
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:20,127
Really can I justify a 50

434
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:24,991
But I'm not my rule is I don't buy until so

435
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:25,759
Something's actually on

436
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,807
On the market that price point

437
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:30,879
A small

438
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,671
A small toy pet I will not buy

439
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:37,023
A $1,500 oven on sale right now I would agree

440
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:39,583
But hopefully someone will because

441
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:43,423
There's a lot of innovation here I like the way they're thinking about it

442
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:45,215
It's hard to read

443
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,495
I made it really is

444
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:52,895
Yeah I agree with you I love the idea that they have going on here I would like to see it expand

445
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:58,015
Tattoo traditional size ovens and to be honest and I'm not trying to downplay what they've done by any means

446
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:58,783
When I say this

447
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:05,695
I mean you could add these types of sensors and things to traditional ovens and that's why I said what I said about Samsung who does make tons more

448
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:06,463
Appliances

449
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,487
So

450
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:12,095
To me this is a precursor for what you met at Sea in a standard traditional oven

451
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:12,863
In

452
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:13,631
Your five

453
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:14,399
8 years

454
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:17,727
And did you just replace all of your appliances

455
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:20,543
Thank you thanks thanks so much for reminding me though

456
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:26,943
We just did that thank you so much you know if it makes you feel better I just bought all my appliances only 2 years ago so I feel like

457
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:29,247
I can't really buy a new oven

458
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,015
Probably

459
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:35,391
Alright so that's the June oven and I really excited about that partially

460
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,719
In other news this week

461
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:39,999
There is a

462
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:40,767
Wink

463
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:44,351
By my least favorite home hub is having

464
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,911
My understanding is that

465
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:47,935
Wink

466
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:49,983
The software platform

467
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,519
Has been for sale

468
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,567
Actually several months

469
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:56,639
And now I'm hearing that quirky

470
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:58,175
Which is the company that

471
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,711
Is producing a lot of

472
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:00,479
Hardware

473
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:04,319
It's the product development shop that produces a lot of the hardware for wing

474
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,879
Techquickie is getting out of manufacture

475
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,415
That is pretty

476
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:09,439
That's big

477
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:10,719
Big news

478
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:13,023
It's not necessarily surprising

479
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,815
But it is kind of

480
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,095
I don't know it's

481
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:17,119
Kind of sad

482
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,143
To see

483
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:20,447
Sunday that had so much support

484
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,215
Court

485
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:24,799
Are there still their parents are still available at Home Depot I know that

486
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:27,871
They are and they just had a couple weeks ago

487
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:29,151
They had a big sick

488
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,431
Security snafu

489
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:33,503
Where certificate

490
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:34,783
Some people's hubs

491
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,855
They couldn't even update over-the-air because of this problem

492
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,903
So they actually had to send their wings

493
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:40,927
Cubs back

494
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:43,231
Which you can imagine did not make

495
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,023
Customer is very happy

496
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:46,815
So

497
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:50,655
Yeah I'm clear what all is happening at

498
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:54,751
Winkle actually called them and try to figure out but I haven't heard back from anyone at Winker Corky

499
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,031
So

500
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,335
That is what we know now but

501
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:00,895
If you guys are in the market for a home hub do not buy a Wii

502
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,455
I'd be cautious

503
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:05,503
7

504
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:06,527
I'll be diplomatic

505
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,343
Speedway on Lake

506
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:11,647
We never you never know what's going to happen

507
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:15,487
Honestly I mean you know we've seen companies at 4

508
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:21,375
You know you thought they were down and out and then they get picked up by somebody else in the product line continues does it happen often no

509
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,399
But it does happen

510
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:27,007
Thirsty I'm sure there's a lot of people that have this product out there so that you know they're going to want

511
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:30,079
To keep using it in One support and so on and so forth so

512
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:31,615
It's it's hard to say what's going to happen

513
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:32,895
Maybe Samsung

514
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:33,663
Pick some up

515
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,455
And with the

516
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:38,527
Fix it there you go I mean it's a perfect example of what

517
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:41,087
Would probably be a best case scenario everything

518
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:41,855
Yes

519
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:46,719
So now we have Samsung buying another company we talked about and possibly wink

520
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:47,999
This is our speculation

521
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:50,047
Samsung is not actually buying us company

522
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:52,863
Okay

523
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:53,631
So I think

524
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:55,167
This week we don't have a guest

525
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:59,519
Because I was so hopeful excited that Apple would do a bunch of cool home stuff

526
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:00,543
Wentworth

527
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,335
I know it we did not

528
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,871
Schedule a guest for this week

529
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:06,431
Which now in hindsight I feel like

530
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:12,063
Why did I do that Tim Cook was just too busy today to come on the show on porchlight talk about on

531
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:15,391
It's true and you know I would have settled for Jony Ive

532
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,720
Sell aluminium

533
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,512
Say that all day long

534
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:24,096
So I think that means that it is time for our

535
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:26,400
5-minute review

536
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:28,704
All right

537
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,496
Today's review is ring

538
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:32,288
It is a $200

539
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,056
Connected

540
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:33,824
Doorbell

541
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,872
And I've had this on my

542
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,432
It's actually not installed

543
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:40,736
In my doorbell and we'll get to that in a second

544
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,784
What this is is

545
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,320
You place this doorbell

546
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:46,624
It's about the size of a smartphone

547
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:49,440
Either wired into your doorbell

548
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:51,744
Or you can just bounce it

549
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:55,584
If it is Wireless so it it talks to the internet via Wi-Fi

550
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,400
It what it does is it has a camera and a microphone in

551
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:00,704
It when someone rings the doorbell

552
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:03,008
It opens up a video feed of that

553
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:03,776
Person

554
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,312
And you can talk to them in

555
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:06,336
And say things like

556
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:09,920
Hey leave the package downstairs I'll come grab it or

557
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:12,224
You can even pretend to be home when you're not home

558
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:13,760
And

559
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:14,528
It's

560
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:17,088
Actually really need device I have wanted a video

561
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,112
Doorbell

562
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:21,696
Almost since I started covering the smart home because I have a

563
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:23,744
A rooftop deck in my house in

564
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,512
What we all

565
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:26,048
Go up there in the sky

566
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,840
It's more like the spring

567
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:29,376
We like to go up there and

568
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:30,400
Order pizza

569
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:33,472
I have friends over but we can't hear the doorbell Up on the Roof

570
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,008
So this way

571
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:37,568
We could both hear the doorbell cuz it brings to our phone

572
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,616
If you install it

573
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:42,944
In place of your existing doorbell it will also ring

574
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:46,784
If you wired into your wall basically it will also bring your actual name

575
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,552
Mechanical door

576
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:49,344
And then

577
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:50,624
Ring

578
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,720
Is going to launch a product this month called the chime

579
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:56,256
That for $20

580
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:58,304
It basically if you don't

581
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,864
Connect it to your mechanical doorbell it will still ring

582
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,144
In your house

583
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:02,912
So

584
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:04,448
That's kind of what it does

585
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,752
And here's some things I learned about it

586
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:07,776
Install

587
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:09,568
1 this works

588
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:13,408
Ring used to be known as a company called Orbot and their original doorbell

589
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:16,224
Having a lot of issues people really didn't enjoy

590
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:16,992
Using it

591
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:19,040
The video feed wasn't good

592
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:20,576
Appear very fast

593
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:25,184
This is much better this the video feed is almost instantaneous

594
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:30,304
The challenge I had with these and I have no idea how your doorbell is oriented

595
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:33,888
But my doorbell is not oriented on the same wall

596
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:34,912
Is my door

597
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:36,448
So

598
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,728
My doorbell

599
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,520
Is that a right angle

600
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,288
To my

601
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,056
Door

602
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:42,080
Yeah

603
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:46,688
Yeah so it makes the camera so basically what I'm looking at an Indian people also

604
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:47,968
When they ring the doorbell

605
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:48,992
They don't realize there's a

606
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:51,808
What you're going to see you

607
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:52,832
Depending on how high

608
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:57,440
Right it's probably a wide-angle lens I'm thinking but still here with the height

609
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,464
It is a wedding

610
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:00,000
So you can see a lot of

611
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,816
Not very flattering

612
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:07,680
Camera adds 20lbs best wide angle

613
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:11,008
I didn't install it to my actual

614
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:12,800
Doorbell so I don't know about it

615
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:13,824
Mechanical

616
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:15,104
Efficacy rate

617
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,152
For ringing the doorbell

618
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:21,248
So I mean I'm sorry you guys nor do I know how easy it is to install

619
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:22,272
From a wired

620
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:27,136
Perspective and you said it was mechanical so does it physically press your doorbell button if you install

621
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:29,440
Electrical

622
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:31,232
The electrical signal to the thing that

623
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,280
It doesn't actually

624
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:35,584
Sorry it sent it to The Chimes

625
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,632
What's inside your house

626
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:40,704
So I stuck it on the outside of my

627
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,752
Dorin because it's a review

628
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:43,776
Daughters are harder review

629
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:48,896
I had to like command tape that sucker

630
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:51,456
Is a lot of double-sided tape I had to create some padding

631
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:53,760
Even so

632
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:56,064
Famous Amos very changkyun ugly

633
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:57,088
But

634
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:58,624
And then I covered up my doorbell with

635
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:00,416
Ring The Ring

636
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,952
Which provided a lot of

637
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:02,976
Fusion at Birth

638
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,280
Yours doesn't have

639
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:06,048
To be set up.

640
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:08,096
Yours could be pretty

641
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:09,888
And

642
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:11,680
Although if your doorbell is Orion

643
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:13,728
Does your doorbell face out

644
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:20,128
Mine faces out we live in the sticks and really I don't think our doorbell has been running for years but it does face

645
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,688
So it was neat to be able to see

646
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,040
Cuz it's motion it has a motion sensor so when people started walking up to the door

647
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:27,808
Which trigger Inlet

648
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:29,344
So

649
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:34,720
If the UPS guy was coming and had a package I can actually make it down the time to sign the package before he like

650
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:38,048
Which is usually what

651
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:40,608
They have places to be I guess

652
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:41,888
So

653
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:43,424
$200

654
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:44,960
It's the ring doorbell

655
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:46,752
And you can buy it

656
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:48,288
Amazon at their website

657
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,080
Best Buy

658
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:52,128
And it is

659
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,200
You know if you're in the market for something like this

660
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:58,528
It seemed to do well I will let you guys know that I am getting a

661
00:25:58,784 --> 00:25:59,296
A Skype

662
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:00,832
Which is one of its competitors

663
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:01,856
Very soon

664
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:03,136
So if you're

665
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:04,928
Want to listen to see how

666
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:05,952
That door.

667
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:06,720
Comparison

668
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,096
You know you have to mount the two of them together now so we can have a b testing for

669
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:13,888
You know video and audio and all that

670
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:16,192
So your chest but I actually have

671
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:18,496
Two front doors with doorbells

672
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:19,520
Believe it or not

673
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:21,824
My house is oriented so

674
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:23,360
I have two entrances

675
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:24,896
A front in the back

676
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:28,480
Can't wait to get into the house and they both look like a front door with a doorbell

677
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:29,504
So

678
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,784
I can actually

679
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:32,832
You won't choose which ones

680
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:33,600
You get to

681
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:36,416
There we go

682
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:37,696
So that is

683
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:38,464
Play

684
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,256
Review of the Ringling

685
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:43,072
I'm going to say sorry

686
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:43,840
The ring

687
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,632
I have one question about it.

688
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:46,656
Hit me

I don't think it works with any it's not integrators supported into any of the existing

694
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:02,784
I could be wrong because

695

Doorbot

700
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:11,488
So there's hope

701
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,512
But

702
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,328
Because of the doorbot

703
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:16,096
Kind of

704
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:17,376
Reviews

705
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:18,912
I'm not sure how

Recorded

707
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:20,704
It is

708
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:23,008
But this is the new version

709
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,032
Much better

710
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:26,080
And that

711
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:28,640
Unless you got any other grape grape connected

712
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:30,944
Home news are great news on the

716
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,208
