00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:12,032
Welcome to the Internet of Things

2
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:13,056
Stacey Higginbotham

3
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,856
Hi it's great to be here I have been such a fan in following

4
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:27,392
Your podcasting

5
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:31,232
Been on it before so it's great to be costing

6
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:36,352
And for those of you guys who are deeply concerned about Kevin tofel he will be back next week

7
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:37,120
This week

8
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:38,144
Man

9
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,168
We have hit

10
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:41,728
Because

11
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:43,008
Today

12
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:46,848
How to say Google but it's been so long since I've been spending Google

13
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:51,456
Andy Rubin who used to be and was the co-founder of

14
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:52,224
Danger

15
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,760
Which was bought by Google in

16
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:58,368
Turned into the Android platform has come out talkin about playground his

17
00:00:58,624 --> 00:00:59,392
Hardware incubator

18
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:01,184
It sounds really exciting

19
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,744
Oh my gosh does it sound exciting

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,024
I can't even

21
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:06,816
Stop thinking about what the

22
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:07,584
Potential is

23
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,376
So I have to tell you guys first

24
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:11,168
Carla is a product designer who

25
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:12,192
Specialty is

26
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:13,216
Smartlogix

27
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:15,520
Actually pretty smart

28
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:16,800
Custom Sounds

29
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:20,640
So playground is basically Ruben is going to design

30
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:23,968
Books that are going to feed into neural network

31
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,296
So basically they're robots basically

32
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:28,832
I'm part of the board

33
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,112
I was calling at the Borg

34
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:31,648
I shouldn't

35
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:34,720
He's designing products that are hopefully a little bit more future Pro

36
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:36,512
It's kind of his idea

37
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:39,840
A hundred percent sure what exactly

38
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:40,608
Designing

39
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:46,496
One of the first things that they talked about in this article and we're sourcing this from a wired article that is really dumb.

40
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:48,032
Is a dash cam

41
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,056
Smart dash cam

42
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:52,640
So let's say you had a video camera in you

43
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:57,504
Your car for example and it will know the car's location

44
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,784
Automatically

45
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,552
Attract it

46
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:00,320
Footage

47
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,112
It will

48
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:03,904
Be able to know what's happening

49
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,928
Driver as well as

50
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:05,696
What's happening

51
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:10,048
Around the world and if you then crowdsource all of that you can be

52
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,072
Recording

53
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:13,120
Everything that is happening

54
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:15,936
In an entire area and that will be

55
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:17,472
He also moving so

56
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:20,544
What's exciting about that is that that's any

57
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,592
Ugly Wicked thing to half

58
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:23,360
Build

59
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:25,152
In today's world

60
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:26,944
And what Andy is

61
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:30,528
Proposing with playground is to have one place

62
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,576
Where I somebody

63
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:33,856
Wanted to develop

64
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,392
Like the dashcam

65
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,416
Could have

66
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:37,184
All those

67
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:37,952
Parts

68
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:40,000
Together so you know you need

69
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,024
GPS

70
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,304
Camera

71
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,072
And you need

72
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,608
Incredibly smart artificial

73
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:45,888
Intelligence to be able

74
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:47,168
How to recognize faces right

75
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:50,240
Recognize objects interface that with

76
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:52,544
Maps data for example

77
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,872
And then you also have all of that

78
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:57,152
Stuff communicate

79
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:59,200
Continuously

80
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:03,040
So we're talking about systems were talking about Hardware

81
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:04,064
We're talking about

82
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,344
A lot of processing

83
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,928
And he's proposing that wood playground somebody who want

84
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:09,696
What about

85
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:11,488
Something like that could

86
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:13,024
Do it Under One Roof

87
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:19,680
Which is pretty cool cuz the only other place that I can think of there's like maybe four or five places where you could do that today in there

88
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,216
Google Microsoft

89
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:22,752
Amazon's 819

90
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:25,312
81926 labs

91
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:27,616
126

92
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,664
Amazon

93
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,200
Amazon's lab effort

94
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,760
Maybe I am Samsung

95
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:40,160
Yeah so you really can't do that unless you're a big company and when I talked to startups that are trying to do crazy cool

96
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:43,232
Things

97
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:47,584
This wicked cool voice interface cloud

98
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,192
Facial recognition products

99
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,216
Awesome

100
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:56,288
And then you know that later I get it and I'm like

101
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,312
Wow this is

102
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,080
It's not great

103
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:02,944
Six months after that Amazon sends you something like the echo in your life

104
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:05,504
This is what they

105
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,040
And you're like sorry

106
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:09,088
Public playground this could all like

107
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,392
Maybe happen which is kind of cool

108
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:13,184
But it's probably likely

109
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,256
I don't know what do you think these guys might build this stuff and then

110
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:18,303
What are the big companies just coming in

111
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,143
Wow

112
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,679
Buy the thing to pay bill

113
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,959
I think that

114
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:26,751
The playground part of it is

115
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,287
Most exciting life

116
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:34,687
Like you said just the fact that they will all be facilitated Under One Roof cuz one of the biggest issues that we have

117
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:36,479
With everyone developing products

118
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:37,759
In the

119
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:39,807
We know we might call The Internet of Things

120
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:42,111
Robotics whatever you want to call it is that they don't

121
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,391
Play nicely with one

122
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:45,951
Another right they're all using different protocols and

123
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:49,535
They don't connect with user experience

124
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,559
Which is what I really care about

125
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,607
Is terrible

126
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:56,447
So you know the idea of uniting forces

127
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:59,263
Has so much potential I think

128
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,823
For good hopefully they're not

129
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,103
Things that are being

130
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:05,151
Bought by big companies but

131
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:07,455
You know I have I'm I'm such a Utopia

132
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,735
So I always have a fan

133
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:09,503
ICF

134
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:10,783
The next

135
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:13,087
Mom and Pop Shop being a

136
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,879
IRobot developer

137
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:21,279
Robot developers that are designing using protocols that will work together and maybe

138
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,303
Oliver

139
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:24,607
It's like the Android Robot developer

140
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:25,631
Kind of concept

141
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,423
Yes okay

142
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:29,471
And I'm thinking of like the little like

143
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,007
Similar but different

144
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:35,871
Is that same that different what is the Android advertising slogan are you familiar with it

145
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,431
You don't have to do with it

146
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:42,271
You know what it's because I've been to the movies and I played it before all the movies I've been to lately

147
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:45,599
Surprisingly

148
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:50,207
I surprisingly don't have a lot of commercials in my life these days

149
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:52,255
Cord-cutting

150
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,583
Okay so

151
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:58,655
As a practice

152
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,423
Kid stuff

153
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:04,031
Would you a Medusa sound like an idyllic kind of place to develop stuff for

154
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:05,055
Disesteem

155
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,847
What else would you like to see here

156
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,127
It sounds like

157
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,919
An extremely idyllic

158
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:15,039
Place to build stuff you know I think that there are so many ideas and like the story that you talked about

159
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:19,391
When you meet people who have a new product they're developing and then a year later

160
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:21,951
They run into so many roadblocks and I think

161
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:24,511
Those roadblocks can be solved by

162
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:28,863
In touch with the right people and being able to collaborate

163
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:32,447
Owen and recognizing where your knowledge ends

164
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,727
Someone else's knowledge

165
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:34,751
Begins

166
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,287
So I think that

167
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,567
What he's building

168
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:41,663
Is a way to take away so many of those roadblocks and

169
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,199
Really speed up

170
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:45,503
The process of having

171
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,063
Robots in our everyday lives right

172
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,343
Alright so

173
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,135
Should I fear the robots

174
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,415
In our everyday life

175
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:55,999
I'm not a fear the robot person I'ma love the robot

176
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,303
All the robots that I've

177
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:01,631
Panino's very friendly and helpful

178
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,423
I've learned to do tasks

179
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,703
Clean up

180
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,727
Very polite

181
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:09,311
So I I don't I don't do that well I got it I'll do I have

182
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,847
How to say and everleigh I do a lot of

183
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:11,615
Talks

184
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:18,015
On robotics in our everyday lies and I inevitably get one question and every talk about you know the robots joining forces

185
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:18,783
Taking over

186
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,575
And what I think about that

187
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:21,599
I don't see that

188
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:24,927
So I'm less worried about the robots taking over

189
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:28,767
Some sort of malicious

190
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:31,071
I got a lot of Slack

191
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,863
The Nest is a robot

192
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,727
All these other Robots coming in and

193
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,007
Orchestrating my home

194
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:44,895
And I kind of help people I kind of shrug and I'm like yeah if the nest is a robot this is a robot

195
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,431
Tumi

196
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:47,711
Xiaomi smart home

197
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:54,623
If I'm going to bring a robot in and they're they're showing all these lovely little robots drive around with like a video camera that has facial recognition

198
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:55,903
Can do things

199
00:07:56,671 --> 00:08:02,815
If it doesn't have arms so it can fold laundry or empty the dishwasher do something that like a little bit more functional if it's

200
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,351
Just like turning on lights in

201
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:13,055
I don't need an extra something running around my house tripping over things in life

202
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,871
Videos of walk the dog at the

203
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,663
Okay but other than that

204
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,199
What is your stance on Lake

205
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:24,831
Robots in the home that feel to me like a little superficial and I'm thinking about like Jibo or

206
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:28,671
I feel like they're on Kickstarter all the time I'm just blinking on some of the names

207
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,207
I know you see me

208
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,743
Sure yeah bro

209
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,535
I actually worked on

210
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,607
Very very early stages of Jibo consult

211
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,911
Dr. Cynthia breazeal

212
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:41,471
Up at MIT and

213
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,751
I am all about it

214
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:43,775
I actually

215
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:46,079
But I do think that we have to be

216
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:46,847
Careful

217
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:47,615
Because if

218
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:50,687
You have too many at your jeep has a character

219
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,991
Geebo is

220
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,783
Amazon Echo

221
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:57,599
Coming off of your shelf and expressing it

222
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:58,623
Itself physically

223
00:08:59,135 --> 00:08:59,647
And

224
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,183
Yeah I think that

225
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,719
There's a lot of value in that

226
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:03,999
I think that

227
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,279
You know there is

228
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,583
Value in getting rid of Art

229
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:11,679
Keyboards and mice that are going to be this vestige

230
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:12,959
Of the past

231
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,239
At some point

232
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,263
And

233
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,543
You know that

234
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,079
Jibo does by adding

235
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,639
Physically animated expression

236
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,175
Is is one more

237
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,711
Step into

238
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:24,991
Helping us

239
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:26,527
Be able to just be

240
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:30,367
Humans and not have to learn machine language not have to learn which button sequel

241
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,391
What is the price right

242
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:33,695
So I think it's very exciting but

243
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:35,743
Do you think that

244
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:37,535
Gebos

245
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:40,863
A really good example of an everything machine

246
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:41,887
That

247
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:44,191
It's going to help you

248
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:50,591
Do recipes in the kitchen and you know read stories and you know that's that's one thing that's very

249
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:51,359
Ambitious

250
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:55,967
That will will Grier and I have to see it's very very hard to do it everyday everything

251
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:57,503
Apple has

252
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,551
Master D everything machine

253
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,087
As has

254
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,111
Android

255
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:04,671
But many many many other companies

256
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:05,695
Have Nots

257
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,487
But I think

258
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:08,255
That

259
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,535
We have to be

260
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,839
Careful with all the things in our lives

261
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:12,863
What's being too

262
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:14,655
Too expressive

263
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,191
So you know

264
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:19,007
What's the role of the designer that's why I love this work

265
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:22,335
You know that's why I think it's so exciting is because we have to use that

266
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,615
Almost like it's it

267
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:27,199
It's a color or a material and you don't want to use

268
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,991
Too much you know

269
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,039
Shiny Orange

270
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:34,623
Stuff in your home you want to use that as an accent

271
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,647
You should see my living room

272
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,183
There's a lot of Shanghai Orange

273
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,119
Remind it's true

274
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:52,287
When it does that plus my laundry machine

275
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,311
Does the lake

276
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:03,807
Okay well let's let's get back on track just a little bit because

277
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:04,575
Last week

278
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,647
About a guy from Google named Max brod

279
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,415
Who built

280
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,951
A Google Now mirror

281
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:13,023
Everyone was like oh my God

282
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,327
Since you are designing actually

283
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,863
A smart coat rack

284
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,447
I love Google Now

285
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,215
Huge fan

286
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:21,983
I check it every more

287
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:24,287
I love the idea of putting it on my mirror

288
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:30,687
I love the idea of putting on the windshield of my car like the pattern is driver-side windshield so like what I got in my car it's like

289
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,991
What you got going on today

290
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,015
Don't forget you

291
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:34,783
Eric Ryback

292
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:37,087
So what do you think

293
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:42,719
Shall I think that Max bronze mirror is

294
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:47,839
Watch designer I think it's very beautiful there's something really lovely

295
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:48,607
About

296
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,399
Seeing information

297
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,167
Floating

298
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,727
You know something about the mirror house

299
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,519
Not seem like it

300
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,311
Especially the one that he has

301
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:59,103
Is an edgeless mirror right

302
00:11:59,359 --> 00:11:59,871
Oh yeah

303
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:02,687
It's just this kind of beautiful sheet of Ra

304
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,735
Reflection and mirrors also open up

305
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,527
The space so there's a lot a lot

306
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:07,551
Beautiful

307
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,319
Designery

308
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,343
About it

309
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,879
And I think

310
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,671
You know it in the

311
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,207
Blog post where he

312
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:19,071
About his project he says the other lot of people have tried to do and it's been in the movies so

313
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:21,631
I think it's very cool because I have

314
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:23,679
Envision the mayor for sometime

315
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:27,775
And when I did my New York Times piece are walking talking

316
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:31,103
Objects invited me to do admittedly really

317
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,127
I'm Tongan

318
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:34,943
She can play for slideshow and I have a mirror there

319
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:35,967
It's in the back

320
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:37,247
It's been something that I've been

321
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:40,575
Envisioning for some time and I was inspired by haven't gone to the MI

322
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:41,599
Medialab

323
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:44,159
And they had a mirror that could read my heart rate

324
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:44,927
So

325
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:45,951
For me what's

326
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:46,719
You know

327
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:49,279
The potential of this I think Google Now

328
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,303
It's

329
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:51,583
Rate

330
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:52,863
To have

331
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:55,167
You know whether and your calendar stop at

332
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,703
It's another place where we have

333
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,543
Be careful especially in the bathroom so I teach a course called

334
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:04,639
Smart objects design of contemporary products at the University of Pennsylvania

335
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:07,455
And last year we had a group that was designing

336
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,991
The bathroom we had

337
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:11,039
A lot of conversations about how the bat

338
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,575
Is one of the last

339
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,111
Tranquil spaces

340
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,647
That we have

341
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:16,415
In life

342
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,463
The bathroom and

343
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,743
Used to have

344
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,279
The airplanes

345
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,583
Not so much anymore cuz we have

346
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,375
So now we have

347
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,679
Right

348
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:28,959
So

349
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:31,263
Are you first walk with Max brought that like

350
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,055
I don't like I said is beautiful

351
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,591
I'm so well X

352
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,127
Executed

353
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:36,895
Great

354
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,943
To give you I'm at a glance

355
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:39,711
Information

356
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:43,807
I think the potential for the future is to have

357
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:44,575
Health

358
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,111
I think a lot of the fish

359
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,391
The smart mirror

360
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:50,975
Is that it would be that the bathroom is a place where you

361
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:51,999
Think about your

362
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,863
So I had seen at MIT media lab actually

363
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,143
Has a camera in

364
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:58,911
In Arabic

365
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,959
See the color of your

366
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:01,983
Skin and

367
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,007
Can actually

368
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:07,359
The nuances in color so that it knows when blood is rushing in a rushing out

369
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,639
And can read your heart rate

370
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:11,455
So I couldn't

371
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,271
The video camera in the Microsoft

372
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:18,623
So

373
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,391
I think

374
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:21,951
It can get even more exciting

375
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:23,231
If you think about the

376
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:23,999
Peripheral

377
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,023
That could

378
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:28,863
Plug into your Android phone that could maybe

379
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:29,631
2

380
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,935
You know heart rate or

381
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,471
Your temperature

382
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,239
I

383
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:35,775
Then

384
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:36,799
I think about

385
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:39,615
Health in the bathroom

386
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:41,407
I like the idea of

387
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,687
Weather information

388
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,735
This is a good segue because

389
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,063
Oh yeah

390
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:51,391
I was like that was a terrible song

391
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:55,743
In the hallway

392
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:56,511
Yeah right

393
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:57,791
Yes

394
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:00,607
So I am developing a smart coat rack

395
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,375
And

396
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:03,935
The idea behind that is

397
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:10,079
We don't need all the information everywhere we only need certain pieces of information

398
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:12,383
At the places of times with their most

399
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:18,015
Needed when you're just walking out the door is when you need to know

400
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,295
To grab your coat

401
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,319
So

402
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:24,159
What I'm envisioning is this really intuitive

403
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,183
Split Second

404
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,719
Conversation that you have with

405
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,487
Smart device

406
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,047
What's telling you

407
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,583
But then you're going okay

408
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,607
I'll take that ring

409
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,143
So you're developing

410
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:34,911
A coat rack

411
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:36,959
Somehow

412
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:41,823
Does it lift the coat how did it tell it what is division here that it has an API to the weather

413
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,103
Channels or something

414
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:47,199
Yes yes so it hasn't epi2 AccuWeather and

415
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,223
Can

416
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:50,527
Light up can highlight the code

417
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:54,111
When you take it when you walk past it

418
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,415
I have to have that ring

419
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,183
Code on 140

420
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:04,095
Yeah so it does rely on user experience so that's part of what's in the works with

421
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:06,655
Design aspect of it so that's a good point

422
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,191
It relies on

423
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:12,287
You having I also have had this Vision I'm I'm one of them one of those designers

424
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:14,079
Designers I've always had a vision of Heaven

425
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,103
Days of the week on

426
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,151
On my hangers in

427
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:17,919
In the closet

428
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:25,087
You sent that exist Carla

429
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:26,879
Yes

430
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:34,815
No I'd love to have like the clock that actually the closet that you open it

431
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:35,583
It tells you what

432
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:36,351
How to wear baseball

433
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:39,423
You're a calendar you know

434
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,263
For a while

435
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:48,127
I had my hue light bulbs in my closet light up a different color for

436
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:51,199
Temperatures because I get dressed in the morning

437
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,479
To walk my dog

438
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:55,551
Benefits in the winter if it's below

439
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:03,743
I wanted to know because that's when that's a temperature at which I wanted ad long and

440
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,023
Underneath my pants

441
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,559
So

442
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,327
I was like

443
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,119
I wanted it to light up blue

444
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,143
In the closet

445
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:10,911
So I have

446
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,191
Just one bulb in there

447
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:14,239
And I sat at using Lincoln if this and that

448
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,007
Recipe for you

449
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:17,055
It was great

450
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,103
Yeah I was wondering how it worked out

451
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,175
It was a challenge

452
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:25,759
Because they require

453
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:27,551
Because you couldn't turn out the light

454
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:29,343
Turn out the light then

455
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:31,903
It messed everything up but

456
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:32,927
It was kind of a

457
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:33,951
It was not

458
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:34,719
And ideas

459
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,071
Prototype

460
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,095
For this one

461
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,911
And we'll see how it goes I have a boyfriend

462
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:47,007
In the UK whose name is Brendan Dawes who also prototypes a lot of

463
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:53,407
These types of things and he's he's been doing some experiments in the closet and he's also been doing

464
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,943
Going to some very physical

465
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,479
Weather devices

466
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:57,503
Flip around

467
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,527
Let you know

468
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:01,087
What the weather is going to be so I've been taking inspiration

469
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,623
From that as well

470
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,903
As the ambient

471
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:04,671
Umbrella

472
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,023
The weather so

473
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,559
Can I have the lights up

474
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:11,583
Write the Latino

475
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,631
I just think there's an

476
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:14,399
Dance to that

477
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:16,447
But I'm going to really have to think hard

478
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:23,103
About to cuz I've been relying on myself to put the right code on the right hook actually we will close out the

479
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,127
Episode with this

480
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:27,967
Connected coat racks connected mirrors

481
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,527
Carla thanks for hosting

482
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:31,551

00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:38,719
Sepala who is the CEO of particle

485
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:45,119
We're going to talk about the electron which is awesome because it's bringing cellular connectivity to

486
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:51,263
Your things

487
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,823
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things

488
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,359
Podcast

489
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,639
Stacey Higginbotham

490
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,407
And today's

491
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:59,967
Guest is Zach's about he is the

492
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:02,527
CEO and co-founder of particle

493
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,575
Hey Zack thanks for joining us

494
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:05,599
Thanks for having me

495
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:06,879
So

496
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:09,695
Article is an iot dashboard

497
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:14,559
For the longest time it seems like everybody who I had on the show

498
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:15,327
Had one

499
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,607
I mean there were three

500
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:19,423
And now they're much fewer

501
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:20,959
And you guys have

502
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:22,495
Special news because

503
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:24,031
You've done something that

504
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,615
Mad if you asked me five years ago I would have said this is

505
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:28,639
Impossible

506
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:32,991
You actually let me let you tell it because this is your Triumph

507
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,271
Band

508
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:40,671
New product of the electron the electron is our cellular development board so we have tools for people to build

509
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:42,463
Products that are connected to the internet

510
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:45,023
Through 2G and 3G Towers and with it

511
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,047
We're including

512
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:49,119
The hardware that you need and a SIM card in a data plan

513
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:52,703
And the cloud back in and so is all kind of included one box

514
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:55,007
But the big thing that

515
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:58,847
I think it's really exciting about it is taking hardware and combining it with

516
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,639
This Heart of Hope carrier side

517
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:05,759
So that our customers don't have to figure out where the SIM card comes from the data plan

518
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:08,063
We just hand it to them and they can get going

519
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,879
This is truly like

520
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:12,671
For those of you guys who have not

521
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:14,463
Slog through years of

522
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:16,511
The development of The Internet of Things

523
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:18,303
This is a big freaking deal

524
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:19,583
Because

525
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:24,703
Forever if you wanted to do anything with the carrier you had to go to them

526
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:27,263
As a big name company and they would be like

527
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:29,055
Oh so you want to connect something

528
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,079
How many sentence

529
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:39,551
Yeah

530
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:42,111
Exactly I mean they're they're set up to deal with

531
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:45,183
Customers that have millions of devices designed for smartphone

532
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:47,487
And so if your Samsung or

533
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:48,255
Apple

534
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,791
Or something along those lines

535
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:54,655
So easy to figure out how you engage with carrier cuz they want they want those, those contracts and if your

536
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:57,215
Not Samsung you could still be a big company

537
00:20:57,471 --> 00:21:00,287
But still not but just not shipping millions of devices every year

538
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,359
It can be really hard to engage of the characters cuz there was not set up

539
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:08,223
And that can be really painful and slow and it can stop you from building

540
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:08,991
A product

541
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:11,551
That is actually a good idea

542
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:18,208
With a good business by propositions behind it because you just can't get through those barriers

543
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:21,024
Kindle launched it was difficult for them to get

544
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,072
For Amazon to actually

545
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,352
Build that with

546
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:30,752
Wireless built into it because they couldn't find a carrier partner it took a while for them to get to Sprint

547
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,824
And this was this was actually a known

548
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,104
The jet company

549
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:37,408
So imagine if you're like

550
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,224
Somebody who's who just experimenting with something

551
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:43,296
You know even if you're at like Procter & Gamble

552
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,064
Or

553
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,088
Ghetto Halliburton

554
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:47,392
It's still difficult

555
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,024
Exactly right

556
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:56,352
All right here

557
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:57,888
Pretty neat thank you

558
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:04,288
And yeah I mean it took us a year to get this together at 2 to negotiate that contract with carriers and we had to go through

559
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:06,080
The ups and downs of

560
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:11,456
Who's the right person at this organization I had a lot of phone calls where I'm talking to somebody who

561
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:17,856
Clearly was not the right person I talked to the wrong person at every carrier 20 times before I talk to the right person

562
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:21,184
I got hung up on at least one

563
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,720
You have someone who is

564
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:26,560
Upset that we weren't doing things the way that they said that we were supposed to do them

565
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:31,168
And it was got that figured out how we can pass it off for customers

566
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:36,544
You don't have to do all internet to go through all this pain you're not to do this yourself would just taking care of a cellular plan

567
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:43,200
And now you can go and it works everywhere and it's affordable and you can just ship your product and not worry about it

568
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:45,504
No one has to hang up on you guys

569
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:49,856
So you guys

570
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,904
Started with a crowdfunding

571
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:53,184
For this product

572
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,976
We did did that help

573
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:55,744
Actually

574
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,560
I'm assuming that helps like get you to the right

575
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,584
People initials

576
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:02,656
So

577
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:03,936
We spend

578
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:05,984
About a year

579
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:06,752
Talking

580
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:07,520
2

581
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,568
Carriers in the US

582
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:12,384
Trying to figure out who's the right partner to

583
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,152
To do

584
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:13,920
This product

585
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:14,688
With

586
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,968
Let me talk to Oliver

587
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:16,992
And

588
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:20,832
Again we sometimes talk to the right person we sometimes talk to the wrong person

589
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:22,368
It's hard to figure out

590
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,928
Do you know who had some plan

591
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,976
Work for what we're trying to do

592
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:30,560
And we got to the point where we were ready the hardware was ready

593
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:32,352
And we had a plan from

594
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:33,120
Carrier

595
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:34,144
And it was

596
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:35,168
Good night

597
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:37,728
It's all time of our problems but not other problems

598
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,008
It was a starting point

599
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,544
And we said you know what

600
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,360
We're about to go on Kickstarter and launch this to the world

601
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:45,408
And we know from our previous experience

602
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,200
Doing Kickstarter campaign

603
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:48,480
Did you get a lot of visibility

604
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:49,504
Bed

605
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,272
Corporate

606
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:51,296
People

607
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:57,440
That you want to talk to are watching Kickstarter they're trying to see what's going on out there so we had this idea that maybe

608
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:59,232
Once we launched this campaign

609
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:02,560
Do we get phone calls from the right people at the right carriers

610
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:04,608
They can help us figure out the right

611
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,632
Truss

612
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:07,424
We launched our Kickstarter campaign

613
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:10,240
And within the three days after launch

614
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:12,288
Every major carrier

615
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,568
North American in Europe

616
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:15,360
In European called me

617
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:16,640
And said

618
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:18,176
We like to power this product

619
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:23,808
Until we're in a great position we got to negotiate with multiple carriers got to figure out who's the right partner

620
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,648
And we got to build a platform that gives us Global coverage around the world

621
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:32,000
I'm at an affordable rate because of the visibility that we got with that crowd funny

622
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:33,792
Okay and

623
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:37,632
I'll do this for you so you don't have to feel too hard that you

624
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:38,656
Have to pitch this but

625
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:39,936
Right now you've got

626
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:41,728
Coverage for this product

627
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,264
So if I if I did this

628
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:45,056
I want to build a product with

629
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:45,824
The electron

630
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,128
I've got a virgin over a hundred countries

631
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:53,248
Some of the carriers that you say are involved are telefonica AT&T T-Mobile

632
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:54,784
Most of those are names I've heard of

633
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:56,576
Yep

634
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:59,392
Maybe not

635
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:01,696
And this is a $39

636
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:03,232
Cantar board

637
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,000
Basically

638
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:04,768
Bertucci

639
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:06,560
$59 for 3-g

640
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:09,120
And I will say

641
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:11,424
What do you think the odds are of getting a

642
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,192
T4g

643
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,216
Version

644
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,008
Will get there

645
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,544
So right now

646
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:23,456
It's really interesting three spectrums that people are playing with you at 2G 3G 4G and of course there's the whole CDMA vs.

647
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,224
Gsmst

648
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:32,416
The types of applications that we support this is low bandwidth stuff so we're doing sensors and actuators a lot of a lot of times it's

649
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:34,464
Reading temperature data off of a sensor

650
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,792
Once a day and uploading it to the internet and so

651
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:39,584
I don't really care about band

652
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:41,632
2 G is plenty

653
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:42,912
But

654
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:45,216
2G has issues being sunset in the US

655
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:47,520
I was going to say 2 G is about to leave

656
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:50,080
Right and this is a this is a problem

657
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:52,384
It's very unfortunate for

658
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,408
Internet of Things

659
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:58,784
That teaches going away because most of us just need to cheat now it's not going away yeah in

660
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:01,088
Overseas in places like Europe

661
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,136
But that's a factor

662
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:05,696
SO3 G really only matters from

663
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:06,464
Perspective

664
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,024
Compatibility making sure that it works and will continue to work

665
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:09,792
4

666
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:10,560
Years

667
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:12,864
But of course then the whole world is going to hell

668
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:18,240
How to eat an LTE is the future but I'll see chips are ungodly expensive right

669
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:20,288
Even the ones that are designed for iot

670
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:26,432
I'm at least twice as expensive as the 3-g ones which are more than twice as expensive as the 2G ones

671
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,456
So

672
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:34,112
Right now we're focusing on 2G 3-g we're waiting for the chips to get cheap to do to do LTE and as soon as they're uh

673
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:37,184
Affordable we're going to make that leap and bring our customers with us

674
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,208
Baidu

675
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:39,488
Right now

676
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:41,280
LTE doesn't a lot of value

677
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:45,376
It just creates a lot of costing and so we're waiting to for that to change

678
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:47,424
Well let me ask you because

679
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,216
You know there's LTE

680
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:53,568
The current versions that we have right now that I use on my phone which

681
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:54,592
Maximizing

682
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:55,360
Capacity

683
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:59,456
Now everybody calls it something different so

684
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:02,016
There's lte-advanced

685
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:05,088
There's 5G

686
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:09,184
Version feltie design for the internet of things that would you

687
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:14,560
Skip kind of the current LTE that is in our phones for using those kind of chips

688
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:18,912
It depends it depends on how fast it happens because at the end of the day

689
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,192
We're about enabling

690
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:21,728
People to go build products today

691
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,592
And I'm excited about a lot of the stuff is coming down the pipe and there are really good

692
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:29,152
New Solutions designed for

693
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:30,944
Lowering power consumption

694
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:34,016
For lowering lowering on the ship

695
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,040
Flooring

696
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:36,320
Bandwidth costs

697
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:37,088
But

698
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:41,440
There's multiple options we don't really know which of the variety of

699
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,464
Future

700
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,000
Protocols is going to win

701
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:47,840
LTE so much more complicated Spectrum it looks from the outside

702
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:50,400
And I think as a consumer you look at it and say

703
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:53,728
Before there was GSM and CDMA at least in the US

704
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:59,360
And now thank God we're on the same protocol LTE cuz now it that makes the world a lot simpler

705
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,640
Behind the

706
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:04,224
3 letters LTE that a lot of complexity there's different bands

707
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,760
There's different categories

708
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:09,344
Categories generally are a band with sitting so hot like cat

709
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:11,136
Cat6 cat7

710
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:14,976
That's high-bandwidth cat 0 cat 1 that's that's low bandwidth

711
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:16,000
But so

712
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:18,304
There's pieces of Lte that are built

713
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:19,840
Best expensive

714
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:23,680
And the question is are those pieces that are built in to get cheaper

715
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:25,216
Before

716
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:26,752
The

717
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:29,312
Future protocol is designed for iot

718
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,104
Actually get

719
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,640
Completed and

720
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:34,688
Deployed and are usable

721
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:35,968
And so

722
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:38,272
Right now we're just basically saying

723
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:39,552
We're going to keep our eye on it

724
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,112
If you're doing a project today

725
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,232
It should probably be 3-g if it's in the US and 2G if it's in Europe

726
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,768
And

727
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,560
Just go for that and

728
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:54,912
We'll keep our eye on it and let everybody know when the next Generation stuff is ready for consumption

729
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:57,216
Okay question

730
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:58,496
Animal skit office

731
00:28:58,752 --> 00:28:59,776
Esoteric

732
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:05,664
But I have to ask are you guys looking at any of the low power

733
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,200
Wide area network

734
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:08,480
Standards

735
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:09,248
Like

736
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:12,832
What's a foxes doing like Laura or any of those other things

737
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:15,904
We are and I think it's really interesting

738
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,696
I think that there is really great

739
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:20,512
Applications I'm really skeptical of national rollouts

740
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:24,608
So you know sigfox isn't has as well. In some countries in Europe

741
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:27,168
Laura is being rolled on some countries in Europe

742
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:28,448
And everybody

743
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:29,984
Looks at the US

744
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,008
As this

745
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,336
Giant country with a kind of empty middle

746
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:40,992
And also really exists really expensive to deploy new radios on to cell towers here because of the economic model

747
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:42,272
So

748
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:46,624
Everyone looks and says we're going to do National deployment I will get to us someday

749
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:49,696
And that's a problem has a huge market and

750
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:52,256
That's often where these products into played first so

751
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:53,792
I'm keeping my eye on it

752
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:57,888
For sure and I think that themselves the things like

753
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:02,752
Are really interesting regardless of whether they're deployed on a national networks they don't have to be

754
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:06,080
They can deploy with more of a DIY bring your own

755
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:08,128
Gateway Tower kind of

756
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:13,248
Deployment Racine that start to happen already so I am very interested in that I'm keeping my eye on it

757
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,528
As we think about our roadmap

758
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:17,088
Radios peruanas support in the future

759
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,136
Stephen something we're looking very hard at

760
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:20,672
Informa economics

761
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:21,440
Perspective

762
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:22,976
For your business

763
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:26,048
It doesn't necessarily you don't need to sell

764
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,864
Tens of millions of your product

765
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,168
Like for each radio you support

766
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:31,936
Yes or no

767
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:37,568
No I mean we we can make it work we can make our Economics work for any kind of

768
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:39,616
Any kind of radio is different

769
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:41,664
For sure that the way that we

770
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:44,736
Cellular has this bacon data plan

771
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:47,040
That makes the economics work in a certain way

772
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:49,088
And you have to buy data

773
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:50,880
Another soul

774
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:55,232
Redefines the the the economics of a cellular base product

775
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,768
Wi-Fi

776
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:58,560
Bialy

777
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:00,608
Zigbee thread

778
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:01,376
Laura

779
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:02,656
Sigfox

780
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,472
There's more flexibility that was more wiggle room

781
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:06,496
So you can

782
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:12,896
Decide to make different decisions about how you monetize those products

783
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:14,176
Totally sure how we would charge for

784
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:16,480
But

785
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:17,504
Will figure it out

786
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:19,808
There we go alright

787
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:23,392
Let's move back to the electron which is the name of this product

788
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:24,416
But you're lunching

789
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:25,440
And

790
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:28,512
Let's talk about you got about 200 in the field

791
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:30,560
Expedia customer

792
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:31,584
So

793
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,864
What are people doing with it

794
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:36,192
It's a lot more industrial vet

795
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:37,984
Products we were exposed to previously

796
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:38,752
Sew weave

797
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:40,800
Had for a couple years now

798
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:43,104
Wifi-connected development platform

799
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,896
And that means the people are building

800
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:50,016
Consumer Home Products a lot of smart home pet toys gardening systems

801
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:52,576
Things that are consumer applications we had

802
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:58,208
I think 22 companies have now launched products on Kickstarter or Indiegogo that have been funded

803
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,792
Platform Figueroa yams

804
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:03,584
Mostly under NDA

805
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,376
That do

806
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:08,704
Appliances and security systems and things like that

807
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:09,984
But

808
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:11,776
With cellular

809
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:16,128
The customers are a lot more industrial so the types of things people are building our

810
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:18,688
Monitoring expensive equipment

811
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,480
On manufacturing lines

812
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:21,248
And

813
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:23,040
Oil rigs

814
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:24,320
And

815
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:25,344
Controlling

816
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:29,184
Huge industrial water pumps and motors and

817
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:32,256
Irrigation systems on farms and

818
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:34,304
Distributed sensor Networks

819
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,840
Municipal applications

820
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:38,144
Garbage cans street lights

821
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:41,984
You know it's a huge array of products and very different

822
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,520
From what we saw on the

823
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:44,800
Wifi sign

824
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:49,152
And it's really only have 200 out there so

825
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:52,224
It's still pretty small number of applications were being exposed to

826
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,552
But now we have 10000 that are on their way to customers

827
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:56,576
Today

828
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:57,856
And

829
00:32:58,624 --> 00:33:00,672
They will arrive and will have

830
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:07,072
Orders of magnitude more people building stuff over the next three months is winter really going to learn what are people doing

831
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:08,352
What do they need this for

832
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:09,888
Why are they doing it

833
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:11,424
And how can we help them be successful

834
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:13,984
Have you seen differences in

835
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:17,056
Data patterns over cellular vs wifi

836
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:17,824
Yeah

837
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,384
You're paying for every bite that you sent

838
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,944
And so it really changes the way that the

839
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,992
People think about sending messages

840
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,784
With Wi-Fi

841
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:28,576
If you have a limit

842
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:31,392
And we we we rate limit our devices to send messages 1

843
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:32,672
1 per second on average

844
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:34,720
So a lot of people just go straight up

845
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:39,328
Publishing a message once per second and their graphing that and that's totally fine

846
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,096
End

847
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,376
Good cost for

848
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:45,472
The inbound and outbound data into AWS will be to play our stuff it's

849
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:47,776
Yeah it's really not a big deal it's pretty cheap

850
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:49,568
Siler's expensive

851
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:50,592
And so

852
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,640
Lemons for the customer they have to

853
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:55,712
Think how often do I want this thing to actually send a receive

854
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:56,736
Receive messages

855
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:58,016
It's expensive for

856
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:00,320
Potato plants expensive for power

857
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:01,344
And so

858
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,672
We see a lot more applications where it's sleeping for a long time

859
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:11,072
Maybe waking up sending a message once a day going back to sleep so that it can last for months or with a small

860
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:13,120
Solar panel can last forever

861
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:14,656
And cost

862
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:16,192
Couple box per month

863
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,800
For really low bandwidth plans are the types of things we see people doing with cellular

864
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:25,152
And we've built a lot of stuff into a platform to make it easy to optimize so we've worked

865
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,200
Really hard to

866
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:28,736
Take down

867
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:30,528
The bandwidth

868
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:31,808
For encryption

869
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:35,136
So all of our messages are encryption secured is a huge part of what we do

870
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:41,536
We don't want customers to have to worry about whether something is encrypted or not but you pay for encryption it costs you money in van with v

871
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:42,304
Because

872
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,864
There's a handshake that has to happen there is

873
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,656
Keys that have to be sent

874
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,192
And those cost money

875
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:50,240
So we've done a lot of

876
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:51,520
Tweaks to our

877
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:52,288
Protocol

878
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:57,664
To reduce the overhead of conscription so you can have secure Communications but not pay more

879
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,968
Or not pay much more than you would if it were

880
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:00,736
Unsecured

881
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,016
Got it

882
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:06,112
Okay and then with these beta customers that you've had so far

883
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:10,464
I'm sure coming back and talking to you in a couple months would be really interesting

884
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,768
How to change from

885
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:16,864
Encryption but what else have you changed it

886
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:20,448
One of the other changes another

887
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:21,984
Efficiency trade-off

888
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,312
We changed our protocol from TCP to UDP in this is

889
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:27,360
Kind of esoteric that actually mean something

890
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:28,384
Important

891
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,968
TCP and UDP are two of the most commonly used

892
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:34,272
Basic Protocols of the web TCP is

893
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:38,880
Is it socket connection it means that we're we can confirm there were talking to one another

894
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:40,160
EDP soccer

895
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:43,744
You can come and go as more of a transient communication

896
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:48,864
And Eustis has been with because you don't have to acknowledge every message that sent you can just kind of

897
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:49,888
Type stuff out

898
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:52,704
If you think of web websites or use RC

899
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,984
Through TCP because

900
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,544
You ensure that all the data from the website gets to your

901
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:57,568
Browser

902
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:58,336
Skype

903
00:35:58,592 --> 00:35:59,616
Is done over UDP

904
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:01,920
Because if you miss a couple bits here and there

905
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:02,688
You can

906
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:03,968
Take it on the back end

907
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:05,760
I'd like a stream of video or audio

908
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:07,040
So

909
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:12,928
We switched our protocol to use UDP to save on bandwidth but what that means is we used to tell people

910
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:13,952
Weather device

911
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:15,232
Online or offline

912
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:17,792
And with UDP that idea goes away

913
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:18,560
So

914
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:22,912
Is it online or offline right now is actually a hard question to answer

915
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:25,216
Because all you can really do is

916
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:26,752
Send a message to be like

917
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:32,384
Hey by the way are you still there is someone listening to this but that cost been with so you try not to send this message

918
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:33,920
So

919
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:36,736
We've had to change some of the ways we communicate

920
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:37,760
For customers

921
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:39,552
What's happening with your device

922
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:43,648
Because of this new world that were living and we were trying to save every penny

923
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:44,416
For them

924
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:46,720
Oh that's he that makes me feel like

925
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:48,000
Deeply sad feels

926
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:49,536
It feels so terrible that

927
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,328
It cost so much

928
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:54,912
It feels like you're giving up so much

929
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:55,936
Right

930
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:58,752
So I guess I want to talk to your customers

931
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,288
How do you deal with that

932
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,336
Cuz it feels like such a sacrifice

933
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:04,384
The products that make sense

934
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,176
They're more products that make sense

935
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:08,480
If the technology underneath it is cheaper

936
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:12,832
If it cost twenty bucks to connect a product the internet there's only so many things you can connect

937
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:17,440
If it's $10 to get a lot more interesting products it's $5 more so

938
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:18,464
$1

939
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:20,768
Now we start to get into world where everything

940
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:24,096
Things connected and of course Moore's laws pushing us there on the chip side

941
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:26,400
Matters to

942
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:27,680
And

943
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:31,776
It becomes an important trade-off when people are trying to build cool stuff

944
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:35,104
But they're paying for everything that happens

945
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,712
Applications might be economically infeasible

946
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,016
If they're sending a certain amount of data

947
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:43,040
But

948
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:46,112
Feasible if they can get below that threshold

949
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:50,720
So we work hard to push people below the threshold as low as possible

950
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:52,256
Affordable as we can

951
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:54,048
Do more people access to the tech

952
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:56,096
Archie and to enable more products

953
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:58,656
No I get it I'm just like

954
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,728
Indesit this is one of those classic

955
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:04,288
This is one reason why I feel like

956
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,568
Low power

957
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:07,360
Wide area networks are going to be

958
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:12,992
I'm not a huge believer in them because I fundamentally believe that once you give people connectivity

959
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:15,808
And eventually the cost will go down

960
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:18,880
People are knocking at people to be like why

961
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:22,720
What is the value of a sensor that wakes up once a day and reports its shadow

962
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:25,024
When you could have something that wakes up

963
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,304
Five times a day

964
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,584
What's a test or

965
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:30,400
Report status + you know

966
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:32,960
Grabs this other day that it can

967
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:33,984
Also grab

968
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,264
You know and I'm just like

969
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,056
Or replace it once a second

970
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:38,080
Because I can't

971
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:39,104
So

972
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,408
That's that's just me cuz no one ever says

973
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:43,200
I got an update I think

974
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:47,040
True and I want this to work like

975
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:49,344
In my mind this works like a w a square

976
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,392
You just kind of the prices come down every year

977
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:55,488
And you just get an email from AWS once every 6 months that says hey Kyle cheaper

978
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:01,888
And now at this point anyone has deployed stuff on Amazon for the last couple years is just used to it if you don't get that email you get upset

979
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,680
Why didn't the price come down there

980
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:08,288
So I want this stuff to work that same way I want to be sending my customers emails

981
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:10,592
Are regular basis and saying

982
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:13,152
By the way this is cheaper now so you can do more.

983
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,456
I'm and I'm going to work very hard

984
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:16,224
2

985
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,552
Make sure that we're always offering the most affordable

986
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:20,576
Solution

987
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:22,624
So we can get more products

988
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,904
Connected to the internet

989
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,208
That comes through

990
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,488
Continuing to

991
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:29,792
Negotiate with carriers weather

992
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:32,864
Through further optimizations we make in our Tech stack

993
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:36,704
Through adopting new radio as they become available

994
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,496
Like future of Alta Vista

995
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:40,288
Low-power Wireless area networking

996
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,824
Whatever it might be

997
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,896
What's the sooner we can get to the world where connections are free

998
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:47,712
The more the internet of things really becomes a reality

999
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,552
I think Amazon gets to that because Jeff Bezos built his own

1000
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:53,088
Infrastructure

1001
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,904
Civilian servers scattered around the world

1002
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:58,208
If you want to get to that

1003
00:39:58,464 --> 00:39:59,744
Think

1004
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,768
You need to

1005
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,328
Telco Network or

1006
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:07,168
I need to replace Randall Stephenson over at AT&T with someone else who

1007
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:08,192
Has that same

1008
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:11,264
Single and drive cuz I don't think he wakes up in the morning and

1009
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:15,360
How can I lower the cost all of my customers

1010
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:17,152
Write what you know

1011
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:24,064
What starting to let us do those things is that we have the developers so we now have 60,000 developers in engine

1012
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:27,648
Our community their building stuff on a platform that never gets bigger every day

1013
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:29,696
And in this industry

1014
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:32,512
Internet of things we have the most

1015
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:38,656
People building stuff we've been most people who are on our forums with the most people building projects and sharing them with one another

1016
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:39,936
And

1017
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:41,728
That's becoming really powerful Leverage

1018
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:48,640
In talking with carriers and having those negotiations it's fundamentally what allowed us to do this in the first place that's what made the electron

1019
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:49,920
Work from the kickstarter

1020
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:53,760
And now we have more and more people and we can go to the cares and say

1021
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:57,088
Look at what I've got look at these developers that I can bring to you

1022
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:01,952
Don't you want these people building products on your platform you need to work with me to get these rates down

1023
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:04,000
I really

1024
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:08,352
I really do

1025
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:09,632
I want

1026
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:15,776
More connected devices in more places and I want the coolest things and I know that they're going to build it on stuff like

1027
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:18,080
I know they're going to build it on the electron

1028
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:24,224
It's you know the power of the developer it's any you see it happening everywhere

1029
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,760
Look at the investment that

1030
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:27,808
Intel is making into

1031
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:31,136
They're like 13 of the developer tools

1032
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:32,928
Like the Addison Carey

1033
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:36,000
Semiconductor companies telcos

1034
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:37,792
All of the companies you look at his

1035
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:39,584
Old-fashioned dinosaurs

1036
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:43,680
Are waking up to the power of the developer and

1037
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:47,776
It's just starting to happen but I think over the next couple years going to happen even more

1038
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,312
Hope you're right

1039
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:53,407
Thank you so much for coming on the picat

1040
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:54,687
Today thanks for having me

1041
00:41:57,503 --> 00:42:03,647
Thank you for listening and please join us next week on the Internet of Things podcast
