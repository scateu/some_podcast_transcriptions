1
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:09,984
Hey everyone welcome to the internet

2
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:13,824
I got this is your house Stacey Higginbotham and your co-host

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,920
Kevin tofel and we have a show for you today

4
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:20,736
We're going to be talking about all of the iot news from

5
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:22,016
Microsoft build

6
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:23,552
From Google IO

7
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:24,832
We got lots of updates

8
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:25,856
Google Assistant

9
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:28,416
We actually also have updates on Amazon

10
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:29,696
Because it's a day that in

11
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:30,464
SNY

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,512
We've got ring has a new app for

13
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:33,792
Borrow has a new home

14
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:34,560
Skip button

15
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:38,912
Netgear has a new Wi-Fi update to stop screwing around with your

16
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:40,448
Homekit devices

17
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,472
And

18
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:44,288
We've got some quick other news bits including

19
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,592
The wise version 2 camera view

20
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:48,128
You and me talking about

21
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:51,456
My experience so far with the nest hello in the nest

22
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:52,224
In jail

23
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:57,088
And this week's cast is going to be Microsoft's head of iot Sam George

24
00:00:57,344 --> 00:01:00,928
Because by golly I happened to meet him at the show and we talked

25
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:02,464
Are podcasts this week

26
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,488
Sponsored by machine

27
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:05,024
And

28
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:07,840
This week's podcast is sponsored by twilio

29
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:14,496
Twilio programmable Wireless makes it easy for developers to program cellular connectivity whether you're working with a few devices

30
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:20,896
Is or thousand get connected fast using no Shenanigans no contract and pay-as-you-go pricing

31
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:27,296
Connect devices and over 120 countries around the world programmable Wireless offers you the scale and strength of

32
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:33,696
The twilio network trusted by millions of developers all over the world check out twilio.com

33
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:38,560
Wireless okay let's get our party started with

34
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:40,096
Android

35
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:42,912
All right I should tell you guys first that I am in

36
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:43,680
Seattle

37
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:45,984
Seoul broadcasting here from Seattle so

38
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,520
Apologies for any weirdness

39
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:50,080
That is not my usual weirdness and

40
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:54,176
Kevin is still located in his home base somewhere outside of

41
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:56,480
Android things

42
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,272
Yes

43
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:00,576
So even before Google IO

44
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:06,976
Which is what I was monitoring while you are at the Microsoft build

45
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:09,024
It is now version 1.0

46
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,352
100000 downloads of Android SDK

47
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:15,424
They also announced support for some more

48
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,984
Chips and Boards there's a catalyst for

49
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,752
Supported

50
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:19,520
Ford Atlas

51
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:20,288
Point

52
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:25,152
I kind of thought Google with you

53
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:28,992
Android things to build a home hub that I was dead wrong because

54
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:35,136
It's really a platform for everybody other Hardware Partners to use and manage iot devices and so on

55
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:39,488
Big news which I guess is somewhat controversial is that Google will be

56
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:40,256
Squirting

57
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:46,144
Automatic software updates for Android things devices for up to three years by default

58
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,984
With an option for device makers to extend that support

59
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,056
I say controversial cuz I thought this was good

60
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,384
I thought it was kind of

61
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,432
Lame because one

62
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:02,784
Qualcomm for example in their Snapdragon embedded chips design for iot Stuff

63
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:04,064
Their support

64
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,088
Is going to be

65
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:07,392
7 to 10 years depending on the form

66
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,928
Microsoft

67
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:11,232
With its Azure sphere is supporting it

68
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:12,512
10 years

69
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:14,304
And neither of those were

70
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,328
Required Edition

71
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:19,424
Now qualcomm's a little different cuz they're not supporting the OS there to support him

72
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,192
Hardware under

73
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,216
Twitter updates

74
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:23,776
Patches but Microsoft security stuff

75
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:27,360
Is based on 10 years of support and it only is

76
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:29,152
Buy it when you buy the chip

77
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:31,200
Basically so you're buying into all of

78
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:32,992
So this feels

79
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:36,832
In Kevin I know you talked about like device lifecycle so

80
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:38,880
Things is actually a fairly

81
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,416
Fat operating system

82
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:43,488
It's like a requires like 1 megabytes of memory I believe

83
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,536
That's a fair point the lowest

84
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:51,936
Memory requirement is 512 Meg of RAM and it goes up to one or two on the other boards from NXT

85
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:52,704
Qualcomm

86
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:55,776
So I a yes because a lot of new devices

87
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,312
We talked about Housley

88
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:59,616
A miniscule amount of storage or memory

89
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:03,200
Right into those I guess would end up with Android Wear

90
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,224
Or something else

91
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,088
It's okay so it depends on what the device is because

92
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:11,392
Google has been very specific

93
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,160
Bandits

94
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,976
Terms on what you can use Android things for

95
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:17,536
And here's the quote that I pulled out from their program housing

96
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:21,375
You are prohibited from the commercialization of products built on Android things

97
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:25,471
Who's form factors defined as a device type by the Android TV device

98
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:26,751
Such as handheld

99
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,031
Watches television

100
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,055
Automotive

101
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:32,127
Any other device categories in the future

102
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,663
The reason is they have

103
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:40,063
Android auto for cars they have wear OS 4 watches they have Android for tablets that Andrew TV for

104
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,087
TV

105
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:43,903
This is a totally separate thing you notice relate

106
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:49,279
So I could put Android things in a hub but I might also want to put it in like a thermostat

107
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,303
Smart display

108
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:51,583
You could do that

109
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,351
Okay

110
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:54,655
So but some of those devices

111
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:55,423
Arnott

112
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,471
You notice away devices and

113
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:01,567
That's where I'm getting kind of like you know I've had like my connected Outlets

114
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,847
Which probably are not a good cattle

115
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,919
Thanks but I had those for 6 years now

116
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,455
So I'm not sure

117
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:11,295
Again. I also think on the life cycle Park

118
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:16,415
I really think Android thinks it's more of the consumer device as opposed to an industrial

119
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,439
In which case

120
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:21,791
New Chips new capabilities are coming out quicker and quicker

121
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:24,863
What is computer vision or whatever maybe AI

122
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:27,679
So I think Google can imagine their bets on that life cycle

123
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,775
Okay well I was going to say art June oven runs Android

124
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,567
It doesn't run Android things but it does running

125
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:37,919
That's true because Android things didn't exist

126
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,295
Right

127
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:46,367
No but you're right because Android it has run in

128
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:48,159
What color embedded systems

129
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,183
Stitches the June oven

130
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,463
Such as the wink relay

131
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:55,839
So yeah and those are things but I'd be hacked off if my $1,500 Oven broke after

132
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:56,607
3 years

133
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:57,887
Okay that's

134
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,703
Also from

135
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,983
Google IO

136
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:04,543
Not a pre-launch of exciting iot platform

137
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:07,103
They updated a lot with Google Assistant

138
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:09,151
So it now can handle multiple

139
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:09,919
Command something

140
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:10,943
At The Echo

141
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,479
And it also says

142
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:14,527
Supports customized routine

143
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,879
In the notable thing on customize routines I thought that was interesting

144
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:20,671
Was that it allows for scheduling

145
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:25,023
Which currently madhumeh in the Amazon Echo do not do so

146
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:30,399
Google kind of LeapFrog them a little bit there in that actually does kind of turn your Google home into a home health aide

147
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:33,983
It's like a pseudo help now and came functions like that.

148
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,007
Correct so

149
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,287
Pittsburgh promising

150
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:40,639
They definitely showed off their AI chops with a demo

151
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,711
Showing multiple commands totally unrelated commands

152
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:46,271
Interesting

153
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:49,343
Probably worth a watch if you didn't see the keynote which is available on YouTube

154
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,111
YouTube so

155
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,903
I'm excited

156
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:52,927
Really

157
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,463
Now embedded in the

158
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,487
Google home

159
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:56,511
System

160
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:59,839
I'm going to go pick up buy any more Echo stuff

161
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,375
I like what you're doing

162
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,167
Me too so I'll

163
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,727
Wait till you hear the nest doorbell stuff that I'm going to

164
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:11,359
Okay now I did talk to a couple people about this and they were like with the continued

165
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:14,175
Command or continue conversations they were like

166
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,711
So it's listening all the time

167
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:18,271
And they were like super freaked out by the

168
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,831
So I'm very curious where the normal peep

169
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:21,855
The world

170
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:22,879
Fallenness

171
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:23,647
Line

172
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:25,183
Yes but but but

173
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:31,327
Listen for another 5 Seconds as well now because you can say Ma

174
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,655
She wasn't for that so

175
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:37,215
That's already happened on the echo for at least 5 more seconds

176
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:41,311
True oh you can also tell your Google you can set it up so you have to ask it

177
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:47,199
Is it pretty please or just please teachers called pretty please but you don't have to say pretty please

178
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:53,855
That's good cuz I think the last time I said pretty please I was probably 15 and begging for like

179
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,647
My mom to buy me some clothes

180
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,207
Okay

181
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,231
So

182
00:07:59,487 --> 00:07:59,999
Blissey

183
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:06,399
And then we'll get to what I will call these super cool / creepy / questionable section of the

184
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,679
Google IO demo

185
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,983
Which was assistant making it was

186
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,287
Call Google duplex in a basically let

187
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,055
Assistant

188
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:15,871
Call something on your behalf ask

189
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:18,175
For information and negotiate

190
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:21,759
Which if you haven't heard it you got to listen because

191
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,039
Kind of mind-blowing

192
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:25,343
I really thought they Outsource

193
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:31,487
Humans to make appointments for people when they demoed the appointment when they send you a Google make me a haircut appointment

194
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:33,023
At this time in this day

195
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:36,351
And then you heard a phone call to a salon I thought it was

196
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:40,191
I mean I'm like torrent Asus passes this use case

197
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:46,591
And Google says they're going to use this they could see themselves using this to like automatically update restaurant

198
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:51,455
Flowers and get information from real people that currently they can't do so like things like

199
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:53,247
Is is closed on Superbowl Sunday

200
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,783
The robot. Text

201
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:58,879
You know that doesn't tell you that necessarily so Google Now can just call

202
00:08:59,135 --> 00:08:59,903
People in ask

203
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:02,463
Shifts the burden of

204
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:08,863
You know information the restaurant may not update their website to show hours and so I said what's up how do you find out what you call

205
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:09,631
They have

206
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:10,655
Made it

207
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:14,495
I made it to do that and they gather information and they can update their website

208
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:15,775
So yes

209
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:19,615
Crazy crazy that's my insightful commentary they're crazy crazy

210
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:20,639
So

211
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,687
At Microsoft build which is where I am

212
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:25,759
And you'll hear more about some of the stuff they announce their when

213
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:26,783
Talk with Sam

214
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:27,551
But

215
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:29,087
They also demoed

216
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:30,367
Another digital assistant

217
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:32,415
Several actually they did mode

218
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:34,207
Madame a talking to

219
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,231
Microsoft score

220
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:35,999
Cortana

221
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:39,327
This was something announced a while back but no one knew how it was going to work

222
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:43,167
Really but a couple things I called to say you I bust when I was reading about it

223
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,959
Because the latency was true

224
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:47,007
Tremendous so I started out with this woman asked

225
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,799
Padme open Cortana

226
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,103
Hi this is Cortana Houck

227
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:51,871
Can I help you

228
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:54,175
And she said what's on my calendar for the day

229
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:54,943
And then

230
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:58,783
Cortana after saying what was on her calendar with say

231
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,599
Can I help you with anything else and then she might ask a follow-up

232
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:03,391
Question that was

233
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:05,951
Fine like DUI sounds good but in

234
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:06,719
Action

235
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:09,279
There was a huge like a 2 to 3 second

236
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,303
Latency

237
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,863
Even the demo words were talking over

238
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,143
The assistant

239
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,447
So it was definitely

240
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,215
A little clunky

241
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:22,079
And then Microsoft is talking about Microsoft will be handling your business

242
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,615
And

243
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:24,639
Madame able to your

244
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,407
How many

245
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,967
But in another example they had

246
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:31,295
He was talking to Cortana and he was getting his information

247
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,575
Cortana the news like

248
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:35,391
Cortana ask to open battle

249
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,695
And then he wanted an Uber ride

250
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:41,791
Uber ride to me is not either a business or a personal

251
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:45,887
I think that is just a thing you do in both Realms and how would you remember

252
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:46,911
Offer you

253
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:47,935
And that's

254
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:54,335
The key right there that's the obstacle to me now after associate and assistant name with different tasks

255
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,615
Sorel contact

256
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:57,663
And I just think it's horrible

257
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,431
It's just

258
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:02,783
Satya Nadella in his keynote actually talked about giving

259
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,319
He's like voice apps are big

260
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:09,695
They're going to have to be a branded experience and I don't want branded experiences

261
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:11,487
That I have to remember it

262
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,791
Call aansoo Jee actually has a cook

263
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:15,583
Cooking assistant called Geneva

264
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,399
That you can control the amount of a with

265
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,679
You know if you have

266
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,215
GE Appliances

267
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:23,007
Bosch has one called

268
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,799
Hey it's me K or Mikey

269
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,591
Maggie's baby and

270
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:30,943
See I can't even remember yet I have a Bosch dishwasher and a Bosch microwave

271
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:31,711
So

272
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,735
Holy cow

273
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:39,135
I just this is too much for me from I mean I can barely remember my family members names when I'm shouting out commands to them so

274
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:41,183
Lord help me when I'm trying to remember

275
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,999
Branded voice app names

276
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:46,047
I don't know how they would actually

277
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,071
Make this work

278
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:49,375
So I can get

279
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,167
It just doesn't work

280
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,447
Agreed

281
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:56,543
I wasn't too keen on that you can sign up when click the link in the show notes

282
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,567
And

283
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:59,615
Test this out for yourself sometime

284
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:02,943
After an invite and then hopefully it will be available I think it's

285
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,479
Speed before the end of this year

286
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:05,759
So we'll see

287
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:10,623
Amazon also last week launched the general availability of in skill pay me

288
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,671
And I don't know if

289
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:14,463
We have not been following the concert

290
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:17,023
Vince Gill payments but basically what this is

291
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,071
Any customer can buy something within

292
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:22,143
And outside skill without having to leave that skill

293
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:26,495
So as a merchant you have to register with Amazon pay so I can

294
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:28,287
Can use my details in my Amazon

295
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,311
An account to pay for

296
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,079
For your product

297
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:34,687
So some of the companies that are using this already or TGI Fridays 1-800

298
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:35,455
Flowers

299
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,479
So I can now

300
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:37,759
Order everything

301
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:41,599
I say Madam a open Fridays I start the process

302
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,367
And then

303
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,903
I can order everything I want

304
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:44,671
And please

305
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:45,695
So

306
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:49,023
Yeah I like this I mean I don't do a lot of shopping by voice but

307
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,631
All the cards I would use for online shopping already registered with Amazon anyway so

308
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,399
It's a smart move

309
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:57,471
Ya think of that override you could just have it

310
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:58,495
Charge you back

311
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:04,383
Which means you could actually I know you can send people Ubers finally now but like you could it as the account owner

312
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,943
Call an Uber for like a drunk friend at your house in

313
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,223
Send them on their way

314
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,271
Don't be nice

315
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:13,599
Or drunk friend at the office but then would you ask Cortana

316
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,623
What would you ask me

317
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:17,183
Metal man who knows

318
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:23,583
Depends on the level of employee

319
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,399
Kind of items so ring has a new neighbors

320
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,423
And

321
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,959
Kevin you want to tell us what this is

322
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:32,031
Yeah so bring already had like a neighborhood type

323
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:32,799
Sharing

324
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:36,127
Aspect to it if you want to opt into it so like if I

325
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:36,895
My ring

326
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:42,527
Doorbell sees something sketchy in the neighborhood you know other people in my area

327
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:49,183
Has a ring advenir popped it in information about it but now apparently that information

328
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:50,463
Just be sent directly to the

329
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:56,863
Police are probably some parameters in Hopkins for this as well but it's a nice expansion of the neighborhood

330
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:57,887
Neighborhood watch

331
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:58,655
System

332
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,447
Yes so what happens is

333
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:02,495
Yes it will send it automatically to the police

334
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:04,031
But also if the police

335
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:07,615
I have started casefile on something they can actually start

336
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:08,895
With that case File

337
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:12,479
Requesting data from other ring cameras in the vicinity

338
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:13,759
Now I don't know if

339
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,551
Refuse that request or not

340
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:20,671
But there are some implications here in this is the same applications that played next door which

341
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:23,231
You know I don't know if you're on next door but I am in

342
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,511
Every now and then you get

343
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:29,887
Some people are like there's an African American man walking down the street and you're like oh yeah he lives there

344
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,679
So there's a lot of danger

345
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,215
For things like racial profiling

346
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:38,591
And that I had asked Jamie siminoff about this years ago when we talked about it

347
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,895
Because his goal was to create this quote-unquote ring us

348
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:41,663
Security run

349
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,943
Better Home and neighborhood

350
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:46,783
And he said they were trying to do things to encourage

351
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:52,159
People to kind of think carefully before reporting a situation to avoid some of that racial

352
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,463
I've never actually seen that

353
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:59,071
In the Ring app but I don't use it consistently I use it probably once every

354
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:01,375
Your 18-month says I'm testing out a new to

355
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:07,775
Device so I'm curious what kind of things that they will include in that because Amazon can't be

356
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:08,799
Unaware

357
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,335
This is a

358
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,871
Definite thing that's going to happen

359
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:15,199
The other aspect of this that I think is kind of interesting is

360
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:18,271
Package delivery is a huge problem for Amazon

361
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:20,063
They now own ring

362
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,111
What is kind of Private Eyes

363
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:25,439
The cops to work on behalf of Amazon.

364
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,975
Prevent package theft

365
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:28,255
So that is kind of

366
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,279
That's my crazy

367
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:32,351
Actually I've not Elites that make sense

368
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:33,631
So we'll see

369
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,679
How that is in action and if

370
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:36,959
If you have a ring doorbell

371
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:37,983
Feel free to like

372
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,031
Tell us if it's like

373
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,311
Letting you racially profile

374
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:45,151
Alright others news bits time for the news bits

375
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,687
Kevin I know you were excited

376
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,479
Excited about

377
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:53,599
Excited because you love this little thing this is bethabara button

378
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:56,671
That we saw at CES it is now available

379
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:58,719
And this is the homekit

380
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,023
$60

381
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:03,583
$10 more than the regular button

382
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:04,607
Yes

383
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:08,447
Which seems to be the going rate from tomorrow for any homekit

384
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:10,239
Version of existing device

385
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:16,895
I think it has three actions you can do a one tab to do something to Taps for something else and hold it

386
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:18,175
Down for a third action

387
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:23,039
Turn All the Lights may be adored and how many clicks are tabs

388
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,087
Mine has like five taps

389
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,159
Any homekit does only three I don't know

390
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,695
Yeah mine has way more apps

391
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:31,999
Double the action

392
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,583
So okay so that's out if you're into the fibaro

393
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,631
You like those sensors

394
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,679
Would you recommend that to homekit user

395
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,471
Sbarro sensors

396
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:46,335
Yeah absolutely I think they're among the best out there they just seem to be the most consistently

397
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,871
Swimming

398
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:48,895
But they are expensive

399
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,943
You know what they are expensive

400
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:54,015
All right Indie Wi-Fi is tough

401
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,039
Category

402
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:58,623
The Netgear Orbeez actually did an update a while back B

403
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:00,671
Because I don't know if you guys all remember

404
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,719
If you had a Google home

405
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,511
They were flooded your router

406
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,047
Packets and it was

407
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:07,327
Is causing problems

408
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,887
For people who had Google Home Products in

409
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:11,167
I think some other baby

410
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:11,935
Comcast products

411
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:16,287
In the Netgear orbi World in some other mesh Wi-Fi routers

412
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,055
So

413
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:20,383
Netgear updated that unfortunately when they did that they

414
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:22,431
Apparently broke some homekit

415
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:24,479
Functionality for their home kit use

416
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:25,503
So

417
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:28,831
Now they have launched a workaround for that while they figure out

418
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:29,855
A permanent work around

419
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:30,623
For all issues

420
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:33,183
Associated with Wi-Fi

421
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:34,975
So there you go

422
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:38,303
Intel capital and the NBA are team

423
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:44,703
Bring up to invest in sports this is a i n Sports this is iot in sports is whatever pickup

424
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:45,983
Buzzword blockchain

425
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:46,751
Anythink

426
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:51,871
Basically concept is how to make Sports better because Sports is a wonderful source of

427
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:57,503
And there's really a lot of opportunity here so I'm I'm really kind of curious to see what comes out of

428
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:58,783
If you have a good idea

429
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,319
For this areata

430
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,087
For basketball

431
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,623
Hindi actual Rita

432
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,415
Call Intel capital

433
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:08,511
Trend Micro did a great report on the habits of

434
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:11,327
People who hack into surveillance

435
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:14,143
So this was a really

436
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,679
Fun is probably the wrong word

437
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,447
Word for this

438
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,727
But they took a look at

439
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:19,519
All of the networks that

440
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:21,823
Offer in traffic in exposed

441
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:24,383
Iot cameras weather at surveillance weather

442
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,407
Webcams

443
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,943
In the freakiest thing

444
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,991
I found out what it was

445
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,783
You basically buy these

446
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,879
Or you can buy access to the cameras used by access to the videos

447
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:35,903
In

448
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,439
The pricing for this is

449
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,719
Reticular soyu

450
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:41,023
The prevalent model is called the paper camera

451
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,559
Or paper package model

452
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,351
The price usually ranges from

453
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:49,215
A buck 50 to $5 per item and I could go for less than a dollar

454
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:49,983
For like

455
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,519
Items that are on sale so

456
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:54,847
If you're like a hot lady who's got a webcam that's been hacked

457
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:55,615
You're probably going to be on

458
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:58,175
$5 into the scale otherwise

459
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:01,503
Hacked baby monitors maybe at the dollar end of the scale item

460
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,575
I'd have to pay people to watch me on a camera

461
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:10,719
I don't know I might pay like $0.50 to watch Norm jump up and down on the couch

462
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:12,255
So we'll link to the report

463
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:13,023
Cuz it's

464
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:13,791
I thought it was really

465
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:14,815
And then

466
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:20,447
There's also a new version of the $20 wyze camera we put this on our gift guide last

467
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:23,263
And tried it out and thought it was lovely

468
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:27,103
I will note because we were a little confused at first this is not a

469
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,383
Totally local camera

470
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:29,919
There is an SD card slot

471
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:34,015
But you do actually there's also cloud storage associated with it in

472
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:35,295
And that stuff does go to

473
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,831
The cloud so if you want the remote

474
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,111
It's going to be fun

475
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:39,903
SO3

476
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,951
It is free for like 14 days

477
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,743
Is ridiculously long amount of time

478
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:47,327
So the new Weis 2 camera views has basically

479
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:50,911
It's 20 bucks why not it's actually really good with the exception of

480
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:53,983
One weird thing that people don't like which is that it's hard to

481
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:54,751
To find your

482
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:56,031
Stored videos

483
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:57,567
Recorded video clips

484
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:58,591
Are difficult to find

485
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:05,247
And that is it for immigration purposes it works with the Amazon Echo and also with a person

486
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:06,527
Knots

487
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:10,623
Save you have a SmartThings however in their self

488
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:14,975
I still may drop 20 bucks on one just to try it out don't you know

489
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:17,279
The store everything and alert me and everything in it

490
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,303
Histamine

491
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:21,887
I could buy a wyze cam to every two months for the price of a

492
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:22,655
Nest subscription

493
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,679
Exactly

494
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:26,751
Now there is shipping so your total price for this if

495
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:27,775
If you buy at NYC

496
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:28,543
It's going to be

497
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:29,567
$6

498
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:30,591
I can live with that

499
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:34,687
Okay there you go I'm like they're not offering you free shipping on your $20 camera

500
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,223
Which yeah okay

501
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,015
So yeah

502
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:42,111
For you guys that are looking at a camera in your Leica do I need this do I want this

503
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,135
You could buy this in

504
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:44,159
See

505
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:47,231
And if you don't we have our setup in front of our fish tank and we had like

506
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:48,255
Fish Camp

507
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:51,071
Speaking of

508
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:51,839
Reviews

509
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:53,631
So I finally

510
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:57,471
Between travel in glitches with devices got my nest

511
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:59,519
Hello doorbell in my nest

512
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:00,543
Yale lock

513
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,311
Installed

514
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,335
All together

515
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:05,919
Accuracy purposes these are not on the same door because I

516
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:08,735
I can't the doors where my doorbell is

517
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:09,503
Do not search

518
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:11,039
Support connected locksmith

519
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,063
Because they were weird locking

520
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:13,599
So that's the

521
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:15,391
Crazy details about my house

522
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:17,696
I will tell you I love

523
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,720
The hello nest

524
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:21,536
I have tried many many many many doorbells

525
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,072
Yes this is expensive

526
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:24,352
Yes I wish I did not

527
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,632
Have to pay a subscription

528
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:29,728
I would love to have 24 hours of my video recording without paying a subscription

529
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:31,776
But hot diggity it isn't

530
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:34,080
Awesome low-latency doorbell

531
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:36,128
Great image quality at night

532
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:36,896
Pitch Black

533
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:42,528
With the porch light and the facial recognition feature is awesome because my notifications now say

534
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:44,320
Your camera spotted Andrew

535
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:45,088
At the

536
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:46,368
Fedor and I'm like

537
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:48,160
I don't care about Andrew

538
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,184
He can come and go with you

539
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:49,952
Please just put them

540
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,024
It's like your camera spotted the delivery man in the

541
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,304
Pictures

542
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,096
Pulls out of people's faces

543
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:59,936
Is phenomenal like I don't even know what my FedEx delivery guy looks like

544
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:01,984
But my Nest cam now does because it

545
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,080
Grabs like a split second that he turns towards the door and is like boom

546
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:06,848
I got it

547
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,384
So I like the store

548
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:09,408
A lot

549
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,688
Considering actually

550
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:13,760
So now the Yale lock

551
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:16,832
I had trouble with my first HELOC because I think

552
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:20,928
A hardware problem if this was just a straight-up I don't think the touchpad worked

553
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,256
I'm still waiting for nest to get back to me on the post-mortem on

554
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,536
The device I sent back to them

555
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:26,304
Was it me

556
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:29,632
But they sent me a new lock right away and

557
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:30,912
I installed a tin

558
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:31,936
Like 10 minutes

559
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:32,960
Possible glass

560
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:34,240
Super easy

561
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:36,800
Everything work so I'm thinking the first experience

562
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:37,824
What's a total animal

563
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,360
Although I will say the custom

564
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:40,128
Support Xperia

565
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,920
Was pretty good for what

566
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:46,784
Were they any smarter than I was probably not but I am also

567
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:50,624
And they did the handoff rights

568
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,184
So the

569
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,464
Your luck is

570
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,744
It's a sturdy lock

571
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,560
You can feel it like I replaced a Kwikset lock in

572
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,584
Daniela

573
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,144
Way sturdier the touchpad is nice

574
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,192
We don't actually use the remote

575
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:06,496
Capability for it very much

576
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:10,336
I tested it out with the doorbell like so the doorbell rings and then I'm like open the lock

577
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:12,128
And that happens very quickly

578
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,480
It's not going to work for like the FedEx guy who like just Rings my doorbell and runs down the stairs

579
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:18,016
But it would work for like a

580
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:19,040
A friend whose

581
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,320
Expecting this sort of

582
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,088
Direction to home

583
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,112
So

584
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:24,928
I don't know send me your questions about this because

585
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,208
I am happy

586
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:31,584
Answer them I don't know if I'll keep it long enough to get battery life for you guys over the long term but we'll see

587
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,888
Am I next effort on this is actually two

588
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:35,424
Hook this up to

589
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:41,824
The Chromecast so I can start talking to it via Google home and getting those announcements cuz right now I have it setup to get the announcements

590
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,592
But I'm not getting the

591
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,176
Is it serious when someone comes to your door in the nest

592
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:48,736
Stork Bell news who it is they will say

593
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:50,528
Andrew as it at your door

594
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:52,832
Which is cool

595
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,624
Chromecast integration

596
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,952
In my Android TV so that I can just say

597
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,024
Show me my Nest cam right to the TV input

598
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,304
I can see you it is for sale

599
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:03,328
Excellent

600
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:09,984
All right so that's that so far I should tell you the nest hello is $239 and the

601
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,520
Nest Yale lock is

602
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:13,312
$279

603
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:14,592
That's pricey

604
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:15,616
But it is very pretty

605
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,384
I will say it's

606
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,152
The prettiest lock

607
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:19,200
Okay

608
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:20,992
Moving on to our

609
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:23,808

And in this week's

616
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:42,496
Iot podcast listener hotline

617
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:43,776
We have Robert

618
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:45,312
So let's roll that clip

619
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:47,360
Hi my name is Robert from Phoenix

620
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,896
I have multiple

621
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:50,432
Amazon devices in my house

622
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:52,736
Upstairs and downstairs and

623
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:57,856
Good morning I'm getting ready I'd like to listen to You music and stuff upstairs on a playlist

624
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:59,648
Is there a way to continue

625
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:00,672
Exact

626
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:01,952
Point in the playlist

627
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,256
Thanks let me guess you

628
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:06,048
Oh Robert

629
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:10,400
This is a totally reasonable thing to want to do and unfortunately

630
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:12,192
You can't do it with what you have

631
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,728
I just

632
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:16,032
Yet I could that could change but

633
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,592
So what you can do now

634
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:19,360
Is

635
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:21,152
You can you play your song

636
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:22,176
You can stop it

637
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:23,200
You cannot resume

638
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:23,968
Another room

639
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,760
You can send your songs to

640
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:28,320
Like you can play them in all the rooms at once

641
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:30,368
So maybe you just play it throughout the whole house

642
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:33,952
Annoying everyone who lives there or you can buy a Sonos

643
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:35,232
Which we

644
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,000
Stick

645
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:36,768
Woodworks

646
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:37,792
Like this

647
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:39,328
So Kevin you want to tell him how you think

648
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:43,936
Two of the sunless units that support Madam a

649
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:47,008
Unfortunately I have them in the same room so I

650
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:49,312
I haven't been able to test this however

651
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:51,872
Installing the web for solution

652
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:54,688
Apparently you can ask Matt Ma on the Sonos

653
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:55,456
2

654
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,480
Pause

655
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:57,248
Music

656
00:25:57,504 --> 00:26:00,576
Or resume in another room so that would work

657
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:02,880
In theory again have not tested it

658
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:07,232
But if it doesn't help you because that's not the devices that you have

659
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:10,304
That would stink Amazon could easily add this

660
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:15,424
It doesn't seem too difficult and do as they see matching already support multi-room audio so

661
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:21,056
Hopefully Amazon is listening to our please here and add this feature in the near future

662
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:22,592
Yes

663
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:26,176
Will see surface lately bad news but hey it's a great excuse to

664
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:28,736
To blow the $200 for the Sonos one

665
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:33,088
It is too hard I don't know if they still have the pair for 352 competing

666
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:35,904
I don't believe

667
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:37,952
So there you go

668
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:40,512
So yeah you would have to blow at least 400 if you

669
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:45,120
Stereo One

670
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:51,520
So there you have it Robert sorry for the bad news Amazon get on Roberts problem cuz it's a problem we all have

671
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:54,336
If you have a question for The Internet of Things

672
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,360
Podcast

673
00:26:55,616 --> 00:27:00,480
Listener hotline give us a call at 512-623-7424

674
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:02,784
We would love to answer your questions

675
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,344
By testing it on our own devices

676
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,928
Scouring the web or possibly calling the company and saying

677
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:09,696
Hey

678
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:11,232
You do this or not

679
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:13,024
And now I think we've got

680
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,816
Plenty of news taken care of

681
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:16,352
Stay tuned for

682
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:22,752
My conversation with Microsoft's head of iot Sam George he's going to talk about the stuff that Microsoft announced it

683
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:23,520
To build

684
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,824
+ how businesses

685
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:27,104
Avoid getting stuck in

686
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,384
Can pilot purgatory

687
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,992
So it is a good conversation good insight into your own business transformation

688
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:35,296
And Microsoft strategy for iot

689
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:37,344
But before you can hear Sam

690
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,416
Stay tuned for a message from this week sponsor

691
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:46,816
Everyone weird taking a break from this week's Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor this week sponsor is

692
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:48,864
Machineq which is a Comcast

693
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,632
Service

694
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:50,400
And I have alipay

695
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:52,704
Scrum who is GM of machine

696
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,264
With you Alex glad to have you back

697
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,080
So remind us what is machine key

698
00:27:58,848 --> 00:27:59,616
Machineq

699
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:04,736
Is Comcast enterprise-grade network specifically built for iot we support B2B

700
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:10,624
MP3 PC iot solution is cases and we were growing and robust portfolio Business Solutions

701
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,672
So providing the end-users as well

702
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:18,816
In previous conversations you told me that one of the largest users of these low-power wide area networks is metering

703
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:20,352
Can you talk about why

704
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:24,192
Sure some music classic sort of LP when use case

705
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:25,472
That lorawan

706
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:27,264
Protocol we chosen initially

707
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,544
Sauce for really well

708
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:32,384
The solution is in the lead for the client is power constrained environments

709
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,456
These metering devices are required to be in the field for many years

710
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:41,088
They said roughly did every 15 minutes or so any devices are generally located in short of challenged

711
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,880
Radio frequency environment

712
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:49,280
Basements Etc the reason why is ideal is because it allows Solutions companies to get information from

713
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:50,816
New devices whenever they need

714
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,424
Enemy during space you have a client that you recently announced called Neptune

715
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,728
Why did they choose machineq

716
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:58,752
Over something

717
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:05,152
As solution providers begin to understand what it takes to have their devices out in the seal for many many years

718
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:09,504
If you come to recognize and realize that all networks are not built equal

719
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,040
Being part of Comcast

720
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:14,624
Machineq has the ability to build dense iot Networks

721
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:21,024
Working with a company like Neptune which is the leader in the space at the end they realize that again if I'm able to send

722
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,816
Information for my water meter

723
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:27,424
Closer to a Gateway the Comcast machine Q has in the neighborhood

724
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:31,008
Around 300 feet are 200 ft from that location

725
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:37,408
Pacific traditional wireless bill which might be going to a cell tower it changes the whole calculus for that partner connect

726
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:38,432
Actually enter the market

727
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:44,064
They can now use less power which means I can spend less on building the actual device

728
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:50,464
Which means our form factor changes and ultimately what happens if machine cues building a platform so every IQ solution provider

729
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:55,328
Actually change their form factors reduce their cost to be more competitive

730
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:57,888
To their ultimate end-user in this case being that is analogous

731
00:29:58,144 --> 00:30:02,240
So what can you do once you have these dents iot networks in cities

732
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:04,032
Once we have the base Network

733
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:05,312
In place for cities

734
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:11,712
Cities can easily add additional services like lighting Leak Detection anything you can imagine

735
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:15,808
Smart City applications can be layered on now that the Network's already there

736
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:18,368
Awesome so where can we go to find out more

737
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:24,512
You can start for the website and the Cinque. Com recent great white papers on the site including our latest on dense Network

738
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:30,912
There's Technical and business product information services including device conversion guides for anyone looking to develop

739
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:36,032
Machineq and we also have network coverage details and information about getting connected both

740
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:42,432
In footprint and out of the Comcast from Turkish well

741
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:52,416
Everybody Welcome Back To The Internet of Things podcast and today's guest is

742
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:53,440
Sam George

743
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:55,488
Github Microsoft iot

744
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:56,768
The effort

745
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:58,304
Microsoft

746
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,840
Seattle and

747
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:03,168
Call from Sam

748
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:05,984
Hi Sam how are you thanks

749
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,776
Thanks for coming

750
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:08,544
Come on

751
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,872
A while back

752
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:12,896
And we talked

753
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:13,920
Call X

754
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:16,224
So we're going to start with the news

755
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:18,272
From build

756
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:19,808
So I

757
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:21,856
It felt like Microsoft gave me this

758
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:23,648
Huge magical strategies

759
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:25,184
Your job saying

760
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:27,232
Explain the magical strata

761
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,512
To us

762
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:33,120
X-wind all right let me just say that focus of ours and IRT

763
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:34,400
Is the help customers

764
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:36,192
Benefit very quickly

765
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:39,520
At this point we built out a very sophisticated set of services

766
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:40,288
Lacrosse

767
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,080
Cloud

768
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:43,872
And so we've been focused a lot on

769
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:44,896
Big Mac

770
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:46,176
Easy to deploy

771
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:48,224
Holistically with iot Solutions

772
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,504
Accelerators

773
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:52,576
Generally available this week

774
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:55,392
Bathhouse a Peyote Central and update Focus

775
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:56,672
Has been Edge

776
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:59,488
And so you saw it Edge in our Keynote

777
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:00,768
Where we were demonstrating

778
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:02,048
AI model

779
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:04,608
Fancy Qualcomm cameras

780
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:05,888
We've developed a partnership with them

781
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:07,424
As well as DJI drone

782
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:09,216
So Microsoft has actually been

783
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:10,240
Tearing

784
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,520
Doing a lot with iot

785
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:14,080
Forever maybe the last three

786
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,104
I feel like you guys

787
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,128
Really made an effort

788
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:17,408
This week feels like

789
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,432
The culmination

790
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:21,504
Learned

791
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,528
In those last

792
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:24,320
2 years

793
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:26,624
Some of the big news that we had this week

794
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,928
All around

795
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:29,952
How companies

796
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:30,720
Using

797
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:31,744
Iot devices

798
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,768
Not just

799
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:34,560
Or sensing the world

800
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:36,608
Or phoritto receiving commands

801
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,656
The cloud for running

802
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:40,448
Cloud workloads right on the

803
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,752
One of the insights that we had

804
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:43,776
Add from working with pasta

805
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:44,800
Is that

806
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:45,824
Data has gravity

807
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:47,616
And as

808
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:49,920
Lots of data generated out on the edge

809
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:51,456
Such as video data

810
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:53,248
To take

811
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,016
Yankee

812
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:56,832
You can put it right on the device and operating on it there

813
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:58,368
It's sort of forms this balance be

814
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,392
In the cloud

815
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:00,416
Legend in Iowa

816
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:05,024
Since around the edge as a supporting platform

817
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:10,144
Source address

818
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:10,912
Yes

819
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:12,960
You guys are doing

820
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:14,752
Pillsbury

821
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:15,776
Weird,

822
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:16,544
4 Microsoft

823
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:18,336
Some of the reasons why Roku

824
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:20,384
In addition to

825
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:22,944
Increase transparency in trust that it provides

826
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:23,968
Is that

827
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:25,504
Switch crossplay

828
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,808
Runtime runs on mobile versions of Linux

829
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,600
Windows iot

830
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:31,648
As customers wanted to go to

831
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:32,672
Platforms

832
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:33,952
We want to enable them

833
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:37,024
How to do that and so open-sourcing and then managing those concert

834
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:40,608
King bed

835
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:42,144
You know each customer has a slightly

836
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,168
We different requirements

837
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:45,472
Quite frankly we don't want to be the bottom

838
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,032
The edges of Jerry Hot Topic right now

839
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:49,056
And so we want to

840
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:53,408
20 able them to bring their best work as well be able to contribute

841
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:56,736
Azure sphere

842
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:58,272
Microsoft is still

843
00:33:58,528 --> 00:33:59,296
Scary clown

844
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:00,576
In the sense that

845
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:04,672
You call the stuff not necessarily but

846
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:05,696
It needs to be able to

847
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:08,768
Call back to the cloud to get security updates to maybe

848
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:10,304
Lincoln with AI Trading

849
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:12,096
Etc

850
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:13,376
In your world you

851
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:14,912
A way for things to run

852
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:15,936
Completely Cloud into

853
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,216
Or how do you hand

854
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:17,984
Kill those things with

855
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:20,032
Yes absolutely

856
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:21,824
Just last week

857
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,616
We announced that we are bringing

858
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:25,664
Azure iot Hub to Azure stack

859
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:27,968
Which can run Inspire Leon promises

860
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,248
Disconnect

861
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:30,016
Super Masher

862
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:32,320
You can still work with Azure iot Edge

863
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:33,856
So within a box

864
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:35,648
Adapter stack

865
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:36,672
Connect

866
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:37,440
Did you

867
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,280
Intelligence

868
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:43,328
Security service

869
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,608
Right now is running in

870
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:47,680
And then we'll have to talk about that as well

871
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:51,008
The reason why we're running in an hour

872
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:53,056
All of the in

873
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:54,336
Imports worldwide

874
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:57,152
And so as we see threats emerging in one part of the world

875
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:58,176
We can get ahead of that

876
00:34:58,944 --> 00:34:59,712
And in that kind of a

877
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:01,760
Me and Louis ever be Cloud free

878
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,552
Not that I necessarily want that

879
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:06,112
Let's talk about.

880
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:07,392
Because that you had a couple

881
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:08,416
Cool video demo

882
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:11,232
Where do you see video

883
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:13,024
Enterprise

884
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:13,792
Industrial

885
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:16,096
What are the reasons why we show

886
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:16,864
Video

887
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,656
Particular video + AI

888
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:20,448
Because in a lot of ways

889
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,240
Video and AI

890
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,776
Can produce the ultimate sin

891
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:26,336
Can provide sensors that can sense things

892
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:29,920
So if you think about us traditional sense

893
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:32,224
Temperature humidity and vibration

894
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:34,528
When you're looking at things like

895
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:35,296
Pipes

896
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:36,064
There's no sense

897
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:38,624
But me I running over video

898
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,648
There are

899
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:40,416
Sensors

900
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:41,696
Use today to me

901
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:44,768
Yes and if your

902
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:45,792
Monitoring

903
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:47,328
You know hundreds of thousands

904
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:48,096
Miles

905
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:49,120
It could be impractical

906
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:51,936
Athletes that large versus having

907
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:56,544
I'm bored bright a very powerful sensor

908
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,312
Capability

909
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:58,848
If I change that

910
00:35:59,104 --> 00:35:59,872
I accepted

911
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:02,432
Worldview and it does feel very compelling

912
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:03,712
Where do you think that's cool

913
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:07,808
Because I sat there and I watched like if I'm in a city

914
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:10,624
Las Vegas and I noticed the street lights have

915
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:11,648
Rediff

916
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:12,416
Cameras

917
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:13,440
When was Flex

918
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:16,512
Parking no one was in a different angle

919
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:17,280
Police station

920
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:20,096
Simon Magic

921
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:21,632
Police cameras everywhere

922
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:23,680
And all of that begin with so

923
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:28,544
Go all in on video

924
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:33,920
The misperception that we're going all-in on

925
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:36,224
I do think that it's another tool on the toolbox

926
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,296
But in this example that you bring up because

927
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:41,856
Is your imagine of proliferation of the

928
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:42,880
Cameras

929
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:47,232
String that video to Some central location weather for the cloud

930
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:48,256
Really impractical

931
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:50,304
Instead I'll take the park

932
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:51,840
Example of this

933
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:52,608
The police camera

934
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:53,632
They might be watching

935
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:54,400
Super Speeders

936
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:56,448
Right

937
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,008
Short clip + the license plate

938
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:00,032
As opposed to

939
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:01,568
Stream videos

940
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:02,592
To the cloud

941
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:05,408
So it's another example of processing on the edge

942
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:08,224
You guys actually do

943
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:10,784
Yes brain wave

944
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,064
So okay y'all

945
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,600
They're using fpga switch

946
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:14,624
Programmable chip

947
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:15,904
The best way to think about it

948
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:19,488
And I feel like the edge

949
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:24,864
The Edge is actually still

950
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:25,632
3

951
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:26,656
Powerful

952
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:28,704
Sensor

953
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,752
But you're putting this thing at the Gateway

954
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:34,848
Unless you figure out what kind of workload

955
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:36,128
This device is going

956
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:36,896
Need to do

957
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:38,176
4.

958
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:39,200
Machine learning

959
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:40,480
And

960
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:42,272
Program your chip

961
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:44,064
Is optimize the hardware

962
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,624
Specific

963
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:48,928
A little bit about the problem

964
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:49,696
What's that

965
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:52,000
Especially running on the edge

966
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:54,048
So you think about running

967
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:55,584
High scale in Princeton NJ

968
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:59,168
Recognizing some patterns and complex signal

969
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:00,704
If that's running in software

970
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,472
That's running

971
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:03,520
What's lower than it is

972
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:05,312
Nfpga chapter

973
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:08,128
Interesting because they're basically programmable chips

974
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,920
And so I can program them

975
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:13,760
Optimize

976
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:16,832
And so what you're seeing as 2 is to

977
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:17,856
Secret support

978
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:20,672
Machine learning in the cloud Target

979
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:26,304
These brainwave chips on the edge going to be able to bring down not just the programming for those chips

980
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:29,376
Programming

981
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:31,424
It makes these Edge devices

982
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,192
General

983
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:38,592
And so today I might be recognizing license plates

984
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:39,360
But I can

985
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:42,176
What I think is really

986
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:43,968
Cool is you actually are working

987
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,784
Patni Reg

988
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:49,600
If you guys

989
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:51,904
Not enough

990
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,696
Pga's but optimizing

991
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:56,512
Recognition

992
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:59,328
At the super super powers the power sipping it

993
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:02,400
We call it Big Little Lies

994
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:03,168
Keeping simple

995
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,008
Skinnyish probably doesn't

996
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:09,568
We'll figure this out

997
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:10,592
Send me an email if you have

998
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:11,360
Have a great idea

999
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:12,128
All right

1000
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:17,760
When is a little nerdy but bear with us cuz this is the way the world's going

1001
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:18,528
You're doing iot

1002
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:19,296
Do you really actually

1003
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:24,672
Yes all right

1004
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:26,464
Go into

1005
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,232
Why you guys

1006
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:29,536
Yes

1007
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:31,072
When we were looking at our

1008
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:32,096
Egg strategy

1009
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:32,864
2 years ago

1010
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:34,144
It became clear

1011
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:34,912
That

1012
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:36,448
Why the biggest innovation

1013
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:40,032
Computing was going to be workload portability

1014
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:43,360
And at the same time iot was happy

1015
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:45,408
What's happening

1016
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:48,224
Full swing in the cloud

1017
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,248
And so

1018
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:52,576
And containers are great needs affordability as well and

1019
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:55,136
Cloud

1020
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:57,184
Fuse containers

1021
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,464
Affordability

1022
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,000
Anal containers

1023
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:01,280
I should have defined the term

1024
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:02,048
Are you guys

1025
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:05,632
Little Blobs of it

1026
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:07,680
Infrastructure that you can

1027
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:08,960
Food places that run

1028
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:12,032
Code that you need so I can take all the libraries every

1029
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:13,568
You need an idea is

1030
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:18,688
Basically everything you need in this container that contains the storage the

1031
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:19,712
Compute

1032
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:22,784
Is it

1033
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:24,320
You're basically

1034
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:25,600
Kirby copy

1035
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:27,392
You're spitting up in one place or another

1036
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:28,672
So that's what

1037
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:31,744
We're seeing a lot of things

1038
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:35,840
I'm actually one of the craziest things I'm seeing is a lot of

1039
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:37,376
Container platform

1040
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:38,400
Study Edge

1041
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,192
Which

1042
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:41,728
Okay why not

1043
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:46,336
And talk about what makes you good for this

1044
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:49,664
What is it just portability why does that matter

1045
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:50,944
Is portability

1046
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:51,968
Speed

1047
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:55,808
Conceptually you can think it's not entirely correct conceptually can think

1048
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,624
Container is a very very small

1049
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:00,160
In fact it is

1050
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:03,232
Back at the delta

1051
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:05,536
A very small difference of

1052
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:07,072
A base level operating system

1053
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,656
And so it enables massive portability

1054
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:13,216
Because they're very small quick and copy over networks and

1055
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:13,984
Things like that

1056
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,032
As we were designing our Edge platform

1057
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:17,568
Status portability

1058
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,360
The other reason why

1059
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:23,200
Is because there's already an open ecosystem of things that run

1060
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:27,296
And we wanted to make those available on the edges well Susan example

1061
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:30,112
If I'm a developer and I'm very fond of

1062
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:31,136
Nosql for

1063
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:32,416
Flanders Rd

1064
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:33,952
Container and Docker hub for it

1065
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:37,280
Wait up my device and wagon

1066
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:40,864
And so we love.

1067
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:41,632
She reproached

1068
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:42,400
Is it was very

1069
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:43,168
Open approach

1070
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,984
Because all those things already exist in the open

1071
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,264
Amazing pools people are already

1072
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:49,568
Wheels

1073
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:51,360
So you guys

1074
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:54,687
Goodwin little deeper y'all

1075
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:57,759
Orchestration layer

1076
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:58,527
4

1077
00:41:59,039 --> 00:41:59,551
Containers

1078
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:00,319
So what

1079
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:01,087
The heck

1080
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:02,111
Is a verb

1081
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:02,879
Virtual

1082
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:06,719
So for a little context

1083
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:08,255
We recently announced

1084
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:10,047
Kubernetes support for hire

1085
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:11,327
Which might seem like

1086
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:13,887
A little bit of an announcement

1087
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:14,911
Explanation

1088
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:16,447
Annex devices

1089
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:20,287
Taking your Raspberry Pi

1090
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:23,103
Kubernetes cluster is typically spanning

1091
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:25,919
In the cloud running very powerful work

1092
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:28,223
You know hundred thousand

1093
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:29,247
10 mm

1094
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:31,551
So we done

1095
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:32,831
Is the weight

1096
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:33,855
Kubernetes work

1097
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:34,623
Places that

1098
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:37,439
It's placed with series of what's all kubernetes node

1099
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:39,487
And working with the community

1100
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:41,023
Which uses topic

1101
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:43,071
Concept

1102
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:44,351
Virtual node

1103
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:50,239
And so in my kubernetes cluster I can only have nodes that are bound to Virtual machines that I can

1104
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:51,263
Course placement

1105
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:52,799
But I can also have

1106
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:54,079
This virtual kubelet

1107
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:55,103
And we just introduced

1108
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:56,127
Just one call.

1109
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:57,919
Iot Edge virtual provider

1110
00:42:58,431 --> 00:43:00,991
And the way it works is it runs in the cloud

1111
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:02,783
And then anytime in kubernetes

1112
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:03,807
That

1113
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:06,111
Kubernetes deployment which has a virtual coupon

1114
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:07,391
AT&T provider

1115
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:08,927
If you push a container

1116
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:10,975
Instead of placing it on a VM

1117
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:13,791
We redirect it down to an iot edge device

1118
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:18,655
Sneaky sneaky

1119
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:24,799
Okay

1120
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,591
It's what effect would that does it

1121
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:28,639
You now have a kubernetes

1122
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:29,407
Posture

1123
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:31,199
This pants cloud and Edge

1124
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:33,503
And deploy workloads across both at the same time

1125
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:35,295
Kubernetes

1126
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:36,575
Comes your OS

1127
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:37,599
4

1128
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:40,415
The cloud and orchestrator for the cloud of the edge

1129
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:41,951
She's very excited

1130
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:43,231
Ennis gets into this

1131
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:47,327
I've been evolving with analysts and smart people like yourself here

1132
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,095
Which is weird

1133
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:49,631
Going for the

1134
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:51,167
SeaWorld we're going to have the cloud

1135
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:52,191
You're going to have

1136
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:54,495
Snapchat

1137
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:56,543
BH

1138
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:59,103
Iot devices

1139
00:43:59,359 --> 00:43:59,871
And

1140
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:00,895
What you found with

1141
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:01,663
The virtual

1142
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:02,431
Couplets

1143
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:03,199
Is awaited

1144
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:04,479
How to spend that all

1145
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:06,015
Wrap it all

1146
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:10,111
New York loud

1147
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:11,903
Yep Edgewood can run these

1148
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:13,183
Containers cloud

1149
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:16,767
Devices which really purpose-built connected to sensor

1150
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,047
Things like that so

1151
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:22,143
We see the kubernetes cluster spanning cloud and Edge but then being able to

1152
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:23,935
After being able to work

1153
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:24,703
With iot

1154
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:32,383
Like I said

1155
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:33,919
There are light bulbs now that run docker

1156
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:35,967
There are some of those yet

1157
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:37,247
So okay

1158
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:38,527
You're hoping to hear

1159
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:42,367
You are use cases and I feel like you and I have talked in the past about Rockwell

1160
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:43,903
Hershey's

1161
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:44,671
There is

1162
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:45,951
Continuing issue

1163
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:47,999
In the business space

1164
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:51,071
And then nothing

1165
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:52,351
Amber goes very far

1166
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:53,119
So what are

1167
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:54,143
Are you guys seeing

1168
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:55,935
How are you adapting to

1169
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:56,959
Appliance getting stuck

1170
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:02,079
So I sang isn't iot causes

1171
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:05,407
What were talking about that

1172
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:07,199
The digital part is super easy at the

1173
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:12,319
It's the transformation part and so something that we've been doing recently

1174
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:13,343
With customers

1175
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:14,111
Inwood Park

1176
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:15,647
Is that we have

1177
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:18,207
About how I odoo

1178
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:19,487
How to impact your

1179
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:23,071
For example there are now very clear best practice

1180
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:24,351
Rite-Way tool

1181
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:26,399
What's the best way to

1182
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:27,935
Start and build upon it

1183
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:29,471
What are some of the pitfalls

1184
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:31,775
What are some of the things that have going

1185
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:34,079
I require like as you get into

1186
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:35,615
Business models like service model

1187
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:39,199
Where some of those breasts practice especially if you work organization that's not from

1188
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:40,991
Those are awesome

1189
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:43,295
That will delineate

1190
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:44,319
A company having a

1191
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,087
Pilot

1192
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:46,111
And a production

1193
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:47,647
It's not the technology

1194
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:48,927
It's the people

1195
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:50,975
OKC

1196
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:51,999
He's online so I will

1197
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:52,767
Link to them

1198
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:55,071
I am sure all of you

1199
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:56,095
Would like to eat

1200
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:58,655
Thank you so much

1201
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:05,311
The pleasure's all the station that's it for this week thanks so much for listening and remember if you'd like more IO
