00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:12,288

2
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:13,824
CES Edition

3
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:15,872
We're able to do this podcast

4
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:19,200
Thanks to the sponsorship of the open connectivity Foundation

6
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:23,040
Talk to each other

7
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:24,576
Weather in a standardized way

8
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:27,904
Regardless of their manufacturer the operating system

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:28,672
Or the trades

10
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,488
Call used ocf is developing a

11
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:33,792
Ossification

12
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:35,840
Talk to each other in a secure

13
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:36,864
Standard whey

14
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:37,888
Bus

15
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:39,424
Making them interoperable

16
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:43,264
We're going to hear more from the foundation a few minutes after we get through some news

17
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,288
And other

18
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:49,152
You're going to want to stay tuned because after the news were going to look ahead to see what

19
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:50,688
Company should expect in 20

20
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:53,248
Ross is going to do with business model

21
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:54,272
Consumer trends

22
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:56,064
And even discuss a few ways of

23
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,088
Tackling the problem

24
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,112
Device

25
00:00:58,368 --> 00:00:58,880
Longevity

26
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:00,160
So

27
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:01,696
Let's get started

28
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:02,720
First off

29
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:05,792
There's no Kevin in the show it's all me and different versions

30
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:07,328
Even the CES showroom

31
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:10,144
In floor so there's going to be a little bit of noise in the back

32
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,216
Ground for some of these and some people are going to say

33
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:14,240
The Amazon Echo

34
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:15,520
Echo's name

35
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:17,312
Consider yourself warned

36
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:19,872
But this is a fun show and doing something a little different

37
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:21,408
Wiko

38
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,200
I love all of the gadgets on display

39
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:27,040
Yes but my first job was to try to establish some sort of Baseline

40
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:30,112
Are We There Yet when it comes to mass adoption

41
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,160
Will this year be a year

42
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:33,440
But maybe that was the wrong

43
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:34,208
Question

44
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:36,000
Corey series the vice president of

45
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:36,768
Connect

46
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:40,608
Explains that maybe we won't know if we're there

47
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:42,144
Until we actually get there

48
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:44,448
You know we launched

49
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:46,240
Our first connecting garage opener

50
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:47,520
2011

51
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,312
It's hard to even think back to

52
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,080
The time when

53
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:51,616
Only 35%

54
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:52,384
People have smartphones

55
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:54,432
What really makes it hard for adoption to be mosque

56
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,968
If one of the requirements is

57
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:56,992
Just have a mobile device

58
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,832
Software since then we're at well north of 70%

59
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,624
Most people are

60
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,904
Comfortable

61
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,672
Right

62
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:07,744
We're starting to move into the technology getting easy enough

63
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,024
App for people to bring it in

64
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,048
The homestand

65
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,584
The Experience on your

66
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,608
Your phone is getting

67
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:13,888
The point where I think most people

68
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,192
Getting ready

69
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:16,960
Before

70
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:17,728
Understanding that you

71
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:20,544
I think there's a lot of building blocks happening

72
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:23,360
It's interesting conversations we have

73
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,384
In the industry

74
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:26,176
There's this idea that

75
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,968
This could be like this big bang moment

76
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:28,992
All of a sudden

77
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:31,040
There's going to be a big marketing event

78
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,320
Like a day's going to happen

79
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:37,696
The whole home is going to be available like I was going to retail and it all be merchandising perfectly

80
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,512
It's really big

81
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:42,048
Much less exciting

82
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,096
What I can say is

83
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:45,888
We've done a lot of work

84
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,192
I'll get over the last couple years and

85
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,472
Announce that this week

86
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:51,520
And see that

87
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,288
Ross

88
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,056
And really that's

89
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:54,848
One of a few different emerging

90
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:55,872
Standards

91
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:56,896
That's really

92
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:57,920
Widely available

93
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,200
If you have an iPhone

94
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,248
You already have the home app

95
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:02,272
So do you think

96
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,808
Homekit is going to be

97
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:06,624
The Tipping Point or that one moment

98
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,928
Stacy so I'm not sure there is one

99
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,232
Amazon

100
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,256
Really impressive

101
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:14,304
Samsung are doing a great job

102
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:16,608
Inserting a really widen out with a

103
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,376
SmartThings

104
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,936
Nest has been a fantastic job

105
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,472
Google

106
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:22,752
As part of that

107
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:23,520
Story

108
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:24,800
Is really interesting

109
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:28,640
So is this just a part of the garage door openers I don't have any great

110
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,920
Forecaster

111
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:32,736
I think that there are some really interesting

112
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,784
Building blocks that are happening

113
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,344
Jason Johnson

114
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,624
The CEO of August

115
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,672
Add more real talk to offer

116
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,208
About adoption of

117
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,792
I think there are more products

118
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:46,816
Amor homes

119
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,864
To say that there's more smart home

120
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,400
Strong

121
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:53,984
To use we're seeing these individual Point Solutions appear at home

122
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,032
And then and then people get a second item

123
00:03:56,288 --> 00:04:01,408
Third item less than 6% of homes in North America or what we would

124
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:03,968
Call the smarthome insteon truly connected Can like

125
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:05,504
Your home Stacy in my home

126
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,296
I'm so we have a lot of work to do

127
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,576
To really create smart

128
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,344
Home spit

129
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,952
People are experimenting and they're trying these different devices and they get really satisfied with

130
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:20,607
Aside from the smart home there was smart everything's at the show

131
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,911
Smart hair brushes

132
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:24,191
Too smart

133
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,471
Sun shades

134
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,007
All the way over to

135
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,287
Toys for children

136
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:29,823
It was crazy

137
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:31,359
So

138
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,383
I found it

139
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,919
Head of ezpr

140
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,711
Who is a smart home early adopter

141
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:36,991
In a general skip

142
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,271
To get a perspective

143
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,831
From someone who isn't selling anything smart

144
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:41,599
Water connected

145
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:44,927
I wanted to get his take on the state of gadgets at CES

146
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:47,231
He starts off by telling me what he

147
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,255
He has in his home

148
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:53,631
Am I how am I have two echos I have one.

149
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,167
Downstairs I'm about

150
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:56,447
13

151
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,215
12 mile

152
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,007
WeMo lights

153
00:04:59,263 --> 00:04:59,775
And

154
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,383
And how do you feel about that

155
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,919
Today is a really smart

156
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,735
And if they are lost Mayan

157
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,295
Stop myself

158
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:14,367
Stroppy State like a childish state

159
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:18,719
Turn off the lights and I have

160
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:19,743
SmartThings

161
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,279
Connections

162
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:23,071
Everything downstairs

163
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,351
Alexa

164
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,631
Downstairs lights off

165
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,471
Like a child

166
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,007
Because I have to leave

167
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,823
Things being that

168
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:36,639
Which is a worrying statement

169
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:41,503
Light switches work

170
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,039
It wasn't the worst thing ever

171
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,087
Be about them

172
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:49,439
So now I see us now that we know that you're kind of like an early adopter aficionado

173
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:51,231
What do you think of CVS

174
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:54,047
This one was satisi yesterday

175
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:54,815
Epicene

176
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:56,607
It's like the entirety

177
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,655
Technology when

178
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:00,191
In what two directions

179
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:02,239
They said they going to do a v

180
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,263
Real product

181
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,591
Three I'm going to make a drone for some reason

182
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:09,663
And they all look the same

183
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:15,551
And it doesn't matter it's just I must stick Wi-Fi in is I am waiting to find like a

184
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:16,831
Wifikill Austin

185
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,111
Show me back or something

186
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,391
Ridiculous now

187
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:20,671
To the point

188
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:23,487
Of insanity and there's certain things

189
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:24,767
No I'm sure could be used to

190
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:25,535
With internet in them

191
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,071
Tons of things

192
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,095
Switch on both

193
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:29,631
Snorting person

194
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,679
What is the most ridiculous thing

195
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,239
I really think the smaller

196
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,263
Headrush is the

197
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,031
One thing

198
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:37,823
Because

199
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,359
A friend

200
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:41,407
Come by yesterday we got to use that in French

201
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:44,223
She grabbed it and ran it through a hairbrush they did not like

202
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,015
And she described

203
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,039
And I paraphrase

204
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,319
As a cheap CVS

205
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,367
So it wasn't even a nice happy

206
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:54,719
Two hundred bucks I need to connect to Wi-Fi

207
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,999
Anakin stop you

208
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:59,071
From breaking your hair I guess then you have toothbrushes work

209
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:01,631
They were hoping to do that thing where it

210
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,167
But you're brushing too hard

211
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,703
Like hair is stiff

212
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:08,543
I just think it was just as amazing

213
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,335
Cluster of bad ideas

214
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,103
1

215
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:14,175
Not on the smart shower that cost about 1200

216
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:14,943
Dollars

217
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,735
It doesn't even really thing

218
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,039
Kind of having a conversation about this

219
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:21,087
What would make sense if you could set

220
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,367
Pressure

221
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:24,671
Heat settings on the sheriff sale for like two buttons

222
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,487
You know that saying that

223
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:32,863
Everyone uses forever

224
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:33,631
I love hefei

225
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:36,703
On top of that electricity running

226
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,495
Through very in my pipes

227
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:40,543
It's a great idea and you need to ask

228
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:43,359
Said Brandy came over and talked about the head bro

229
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:46,175
Professional electrician

230
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,711
Coming as well as a plumber

231
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:50,015
This is like an expensive mistake

232
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:54,367
Is referring to the Moen shower we will have one of them own Representatives justify the shower

233
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,135
Later on

234
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:57,951
You told me you had lots of thoughts

235
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:58,975
About fridges

236
00:07:59,231 --> 00:07:59,743
What are they

237
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:02,047
This two things one

238
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,375
1

239
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,655
Jokes

240
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,959
The stupid they try and it shows up

241
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,287
About the internet works but on top of that

242
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,079
What do they keep putting screens on

243
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:14,847
Fridges

244
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:15,871
And what do they keep

245
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:16,639
Print to do list

246
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:21,247
I really don't know anyone who regularly uses it to do list outside of the

247
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,527
IOS reminders

248
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,063
I don't need a 29in

249
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,087
Screening

250
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:25,855
My fridge

251
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:27,647
And somehow these people

252
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,719
I'll let you know what we have the ability

253
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,767
If you to see inside your fridge without opening

254
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:36,095
You can put Pandora on

255
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:40,191
It's just as so many bad that doing these things

256
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,215
For real people

257
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:43,519
And it suck LG and Samsung

258
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:44,287
I believe both

259
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:50,687
Sing this beats true for most people to load washer

260
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:55,295
Pretty cool so these washer dryer

261
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,575
Stop loading

262
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,343
And front-load

263
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:01,183
So you can put inside a bunch of towels and you have some shirts

264
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:03,487
Need to be put on delicate so you can wash the towels

265
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:09,375
Normal jumbo whatever saying you put your towels on and on the talk you can put in your shirts or any other delicate

266
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,143
End

267
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,167
Facial wash

268
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:15,263
I actually probably saves War even if you just doing one small the Lord

269
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,847
Was there anything that you like

270
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,383
I think

271
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,407
Lost

272
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:23,967
3cs is that's the one thing I saw

273
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:26,271
That's actually a big deal

274
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:28,575
Almost feel bad I put washer dryer in Lost

275
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,903
I'm excited about that washing machine

276
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:34,719
But I too found that Moen faucet I

277
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:35,999
Ridiculous

278
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,303
So I found Michael pillow

279
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:40,351
A senior product manager at Moen

280
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:43,679
Ask why they replace the faucet with this weird

281
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,703
Button pad

282
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,775
We looked at a lot of different designs

283
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,335
Controller with all the

284
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,359
Buttons is what

285
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:54,431
Summer Resorts around the size of the button

286
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:56,223
The look of the button to texture

287
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:56,991
The way there

288
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,271
Raise off the controller

289
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:00,063
To make an easy to use without actually looking at

290
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,343
Controller

291
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:06,207
Orientation is over changing temperature change

292
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,535
Is this better than a faucet

293
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,095
Shower system

294
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,887
Precisely control temperature

295
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,471
Digital readout

296
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:19,007
In your shower knowing exactly where it is

297
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,311
You get a personalized shower every single time

298
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:25,151
To my Amazon Echo and tell Echo to Start Me Up

299
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,687
10 degree shower

300
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:34,367
Is that a maybe something I would do something that we were looking at it see if there's any

301
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:37,951
I want to make sure we have the right consumer experience and have a product that works

302
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:38,719
Quality Inn

303
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:41,791
What is the business opportunity here for mowing

304
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:45,375
So this is something that we're looking at as a trend in the marketplace

305
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,167

Hispanic market

307
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,031
Doctor hunting down the Moon

308
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:54,335

Turn on to make it look like you're still there

332
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:34,015
SmartThings integration requires a Lutron bridge and

333
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,295
SmartThings.

334
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,319
Yes.

Within a day

349
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:03,711
Technology used to work with

350
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,735
Apple homekit

351
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:05,503
Siri

352
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,575
Additional brand such as

00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:09,855
Amazon Echo

354
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,391
And Sonos

355
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,439
And how smart

356
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,719
Things are really round out

357
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:15,743
Ecosystem

358
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:20,863
Will we ever see Lutron put their radios in a hub like they did with wink again

359
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:24,959
Flooring in Benton AR technology into other products if it's the right fit for the

360
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:28,287
I also finally got the scoop on the new standard for

361
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,055
Device device

00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,103
Hi

00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:33,663
Everybody

365
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:36,479
Most of us though don't know what that. Is

366
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:37,503
Can you explain that for

367
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:41,087
Are we taking the heritage in the huge implementation is a

368
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:44,159
Products and what we've been able to bring the market and taking that out

369
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:47,487
Location where that part of it that describes what the devices are

370
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:50,047
Or making it available over any IP based network

371
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,351
We're really excited to be partnering with a thread group

372
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,887
Stopping at the market first

373
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:57,215
We're looking forward to seeing all sorts of devices talking..

374
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:58,751
The cross thread based Networks

375
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,543
And I'm in the future other i p Bass neck

376
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:04,639
This means I could eventually have that. Talking over

377
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,663
Wi-Fi

378
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,199
Bluetooth

379
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:13,855
Everything is IP base should be able to talk.. And I see that's the vision and that's what we're we're bringing the market along with hundreds of other

380
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:17,695
Are active in the alliance many others

381
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:24,351
So if I'm a developer and I'm like I don't know what I'm going to do with it can you explain to me what the goal is

382
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,375
At this layer

383
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:29,983
The goal at this layer is really to give intelligence to the different devices that are on the various Networks

384
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:32,799
So I can tell a light bulb how to turn on and off

385
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:35,103
It doesn't matter whether I'm using a zigbee network

386
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:35,871
Thread Network

387
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:36,895
Wi-Fi network

388
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,175
I'll be able to make that

389
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:38,943
That part

390
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,503
Happens a lot more easily with the.

391
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,039
City sounds like it's

392
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,111
Yes

393
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:52,767
I will right now we have a probably a lot more products actually deployed in the markets in those and we hope to actually be working

394
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:57,887
These different groups to align and harmonize a lot of what we have in all the different device object

395
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:58,911
Awesome okay

396
00:13:59,167 --> 00:13:59,935
What should I expect

397
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:00,703
This year

398
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,727
From the alliance

399
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:08,127
From the alliance this year you should really start seeing that the first products are coming out with.. You also see hundreds of products

400
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,711
Other girl already really.. Abel through our zigbee

401
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:18,623
And speaking of Standards this is a good time to pop back in with a message for the open connectivity Foundation

402
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:21,183
Who is the sponsor for this specials

403
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:25,023
CES edition of The Internet of Things podcast

404
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:31,423
Today I have VJ K7 who is chair of the business strategy working group for ocf

405
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:35,519
So let's kick it off why does the Internet of Things need a standard

406
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:40,895
I said I don't want to focus on putting together the basic Plumbing for devices

407
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:46,271
Talk to each other what I want to do is in the afternoon I just want to bring a device out of the box

408
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,295
And I want

409
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:49,087
See that you can talk to other devices

410
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:50,879
I just buy a standard

411
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:54,463
Glad it was based on

412
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,231
Sleepless

413
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,255
When was

414
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,535
The need for a standard

415
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,071
So that all devices

416
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,351
Talk the same language

417
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,399
The second is a certification

418
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,679
A device

419
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:06,495
135i ocse you know that

420
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:10,591
Easton talk to any other OCS 35 device

421
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:12,127
But also a reference

422
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,151
Implementation

423
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:15,967
So that's it to activate the development process

424
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:19,807
Open source implementation of the OCS specification

425
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:23,391
So that developers can take that open source code

426
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:25,183
Do a protocol utility

427
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:27,231
Under control Solutions on top of it

428
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:31,839
So why was the merger with all seen earlier this year important

429
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:32,607
For the Iowa

430
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:38,495
What are the three things to enable internet of things as you want a standard for devices

431
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:39,519
Talk to each other

432
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:41,823
Do you want a lot of consolidation

433
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,871
What is the very detrimental

434
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:49,759
Fragmentation of the standards and tie combination of the industry and also

435
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:50,783
He was trying to

436
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:57,183
Achieve the same goes because very logical for these two organizations to come together and what's going on

437
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,207
Indulge

438
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:03,583
Are utility is an open source project that is sponsored by open connectivity Foundation

439
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,119
Anita's restaurant

440
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:09,215
Implementation of the OSHA standard what's going to happen is

441
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:11,775
Ocf and all things have come together

442
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:18,175
The first step is we want to make sure the device is from these two ecosystems can talk to each other

443
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:24,575
People that we are creating a bridge it just want to make sure that transparently devices that talk OCS or

444
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,111
Taco joint

445
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:29,439
Talk to each other and moving forward you're going to make sure

446
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,719
The beaches

447
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:33,535
Best of the Best of Both Worlds can come together

448
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,071
In one standard

449
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,095
Specification

450
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:38,399
And how can a company get involved

451
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,167
With you

452
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,703
They're minibeast

453
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,983
So you can company can get

454
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,263
Enroll in OTs

455
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,335
Strategy

456
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:49,407
Whether you're Building Products whether you're offering services

457
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:52,223
Opleiding intersection to the iot space

458
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:58,623
I think osseous is starting an organization you should consider joining because by joining the organization you can infer

459
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:03,231
Linda strategy in the direction of the Consortium you can influence the specification

460
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:05,791
The standardization work that is going on

461
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:06,815
You have the ability to

462
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:10,143
234 your products and build products that are OTF

463
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:13,727
We also encourage people to start using our utility

464
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,007
D2 Building Products

465
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:17,567
Introduce features into a utility

466
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:19,359
And where can I go to find out more

467
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:22,943
Information about the open connectivity Foundation

468
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,807
Open tentatively. Org website. To learn more about

469
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:29,855
The open-source implementation

470
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:34,463
Listen to implementation for OTs

471
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:44,703
And we're back with this week special CS edition of The Internet of Things podcast sponsored by the old

472
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:46,239
Open connectivity Foundation

473
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:49,823
We're now moving into some of the deeper conversations I had while I was at

474
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:50,591
CS

475
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:55,967
Search is a fascinating talk with dr. Michael Bjorn who is head of research Ericsson consumerlab

476
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:58,271
He shared predictions with me about

477
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:00,319
Technology Trends facing us in

478
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,343
2017

479
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:05,439
All right Michael you have put out a list of 10

480
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,207
Prediction

481
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:07,487
Sport this year

482
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:09,279
Is this year already

483
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:12,095
And we're not going to go into all of them

484
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:14,399
There were a couple that I thought were really exciting

485
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,679
Society podcast

486
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:17,727
Let's hit the iot predictions

487
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:21,567
So we have a trend about consumer setting the pace

488
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:22,847
The things

489
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,127
There we go

490
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:25,407
Asking

491
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,943
People about what they think about them

492
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:29,247
The things we should say that

493
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,783
People don't really know

494
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,063
What that means right

495
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,623
So instead we asking more complete things

496
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:35,647
Things we talked about

497
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:37,951
It's the fact that about half of

498
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:38,975
The people we surveyed

499
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:40,511
Would like to talk to household

500
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:41,535
Old appliances

501
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:44,607
Stop you walk around at CVS

502
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:45,887
UCLA

503
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:48,191
Nothing right now and it's actually very much related to

504
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:51,007
It's right that we called AI everywhere as well because

505
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,799
Internet of Things is kind of

506
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:53,567
One of the first

507
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:56,383
Applications I would say for AI assistants

508
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:58,943
So I think you should also be looking at

509
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:01,503
The uptake of all these new

510
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:02,783
AI assistant

511
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,087
That could be a litmus test for

512
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,879
How is the speed of internet

513
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:08,671
Developing out there

514
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,719
Okay cuz I seen a i

515
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:11,743
Toothbrushes

516
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:13,023
Which I was kind of like

517
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:18,911
I need a lot of time with my toothbrush but I've also seen some really interesting things

518
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:19,935
Autonomous

519
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,983
And that is also

520
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:22,751
Part of one of

521
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:27,103
Yes true but I think even though there's lots of cars here

522
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:32,479
I think we still tend to think about the driver perspective for cars

523
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:33,503
And of course if you

524
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:36,063
Is there a Thomas

525
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:38,879
So we decided we talked about the patent

526
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:41,183
Respect you before this year with

527
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,207
We decided

528
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:42,975
Other

529
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:44,255
People out there in traffic

530
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,279
Pedestrians

531
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:48,095
A court of the people we talked to

532
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:51,935
They would like to actually have all cars being a

533
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,239
That would make them feel safer when they're crossing the street

534
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:56,543
Those are also the people who would like to have

535
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,943
Which I thought was really interesting as

536
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:06,783
How do you communicate as a pedestrian with an autonomous car

537
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,831
Because normally like if I'm going to do some

538
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:10,367
I'm crazy I'm going to make icon

539
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,647
Contact with the driver first

540
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:12,415
To be like him

541
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:14,975
Are you doing man I'm getting

542
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:16,511
But I can't do that with

543
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,071
How do we start thinking about

544
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,863
Crossing the street in front of line

545
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,143
And or the standoff

546
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:24,191
I got to stop

547
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,751
You're like you're there I'm not going to go

548
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:29,311
What's your address and there's card in person because of cost

549
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:31,359
Once we get into situation with Iraq

550
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:33,407
Ashley Outlet on these cars out there on the streets

551
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,223
It doesn't mean that that's the only thing that's going to change

552
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:40,063
So actually the whole traffic situations going to change fundamentally

553
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,855
One of the things we looked into was

554
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:45,951
The fact that you know you have all the street signs and stuff up in the air

555
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:47,231
But if you're going to be

556
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:51,583
Add more focused on what you're doing with your smartphone maybe or other things

557
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:52,607
You looking down

558
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:55,167
So people would actually have liked to have

559
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:55,935
Things

560
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:57,215
Embedded

561
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:57,983
Example

562
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:00,799
And potentially also course I should be able to look on

563
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:02,591
On what's going on with the cars

564
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:05,663
Not having to look up in the air can expect

565
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,223
So we thought Wally how you know

566
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:10,271
Self-drive is not just for the cars

567
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:13,343
It's Russ we when we're walking we're doing other things we need some

568
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:15,391
Self-drive kind of functionality

569
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:16,672
Aspidistra

570
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,000
Awesome this is like Paul the billboard

571
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,792
It's going to go kaput

572
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:22,816
What I could

573
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:23,840
Add to that that

574
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:28,192
Another Trend we talkin about here we called augmented personal reality

575
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:31,520
And actually that's about how you will be using a r

576
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:34,080
Potentially to customize a personalized

577
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:36,128
What you see around yourself in the world

578
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,456
So maybe do doors are not going to go food per se

579
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:43,808
How about if you can decide what you want to have on those Billboards yourself

580
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:47,392
So I find this trend really disturbing because we're already living in

581
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:49,184
Such a filter bubble as

582
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:51,744
Consumers of information

583
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,512
And even

584
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:54,560
Look at the US elections this year

585
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:56,608
And you're kind of like

586
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:57,888
Filter bubbles are bad

587
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:01,728
So when I think about augmented personal reality I'm like

588
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:02,496
Oh my God

589
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:05,568
I could avoid seeing things I don't want to see

590
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,104
And it's a little scary

591
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:13,504
Yeah actually I tried one of the other there a couple of new Tango Project Tango phones coming out here at csac

592
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,272
Release Spa

593
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:15,552
Yesterday

594
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:17,088
The Asus Zenfone AR

595
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:18,880
I tried it out and actually

596
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:23,744
We had a bit of a hole in the wall

597
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,024
And I decided to put

598
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,816
Some piece of furniture in front of dad

599
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:32,704
I was pretty cool because I could do that on the screen and then what each time I looked at it this morning she was still there so I didn't have to see the hole in the wall

600
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:34,240
That's not such a bad thing

601
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:36,800
Talk about person my session actually we

602
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:39,360
We talked about personalisation as a good thing right

603
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:43,712
Echo chamber social Silas kind of discussion

604
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:47,040
We decided it's just a bad thing I think it's actually human thing

605
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:49,088
This some good and some bad things with this

606
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,624
If you think about your

607
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,392
Neighborhood

608
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:55,744
Where you live maybe your other people like if it like you living in that neighborhood

609
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,768
Is that a bad thing

610
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:58,816
Where's a good thing I think it's part of human life

611
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:01,120
And that's what happening online as well

612
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:04,448
You turning the online world into our digital neighborhood

613
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:07,008
And I think it's only human that we would like to see

614
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,800
People that are big like ourselves

615
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:09,568
Out there

616
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:10,848
And of course there's some

617
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:13,664
Ramifications of that that we need to deal with going for

618
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:17,504
That's true and I can actually now when I'm walking through the neighborhood

619
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,528
My neighbor has a

620
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:20,064
Hideously colored door and

621
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:20,832
Just be like

622
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:21,856
Making something pretty

623
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:23,136
You guys also

624
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:26,976
Because you conducted your focus groups for this or some of them with the VR users

625
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:29,024
You guys discovered something else

626
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,560
Huli resonated with me

627
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:31,584
So

628
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,912
Just go ahead you call it bodies out of sync and I was like oh is that like

629
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:35,936
Drake dance

630
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:37,216
But instead it's actually

631
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:39,776
But it's actually about the fact that

632
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:41,824
Yeah this a lot of technology changed

633
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,616
Sometimes it's hard to keep up right

634
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:46,688
Mentally speaking

635
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:50,528
So when we did VR virtual reality research in

636
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:51,296
Virtual

637
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,320
Reality world

638
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:57,184
We realize that a lot of the people there were already talking about getting their VR legs

639
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:59,232
Your legs

640
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:03,584
What does it's a bit like in semen they used to talk about sea legs so

641
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,144
You need to get used to this sort of this

642
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,728
This is the waves coming and going and not become seasick from that

643
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:16,128
And that's what's happening at actually also with virtual reality if you think about that so one of the vision

644
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:18,944
Mobile

645
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,712
Living room

646
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:22,272
In the car or your mobile workspace or something

647
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,832
You've tried reading in the back of the bus

648
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,880
But some of us can do it I was kind

649
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:27,648
We we need

650
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:28,928
Car sickness pills

651
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:32,000
And telling us that you know this is probably

652
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:32,768
Maybe even more

653
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:36,096
That's all well and good for the big picture

654
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:41,216
But what can CPS tell us about what to expect for 2017 when it comes to the Smart Home

655
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:44,288
For that I turn back to Jason Johnson of August

656
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,312
To get his tag

657
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:49,408
The voice is really becoming a mainstream interface for the home

658
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:54,272
And all the announcements of the companies are integrating voice capabilities into their products

659
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:56,320
Tells us this is really moving to mainstream

660
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:58,624
New Amazon the echo devices

661
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,648
Pave the way

662
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:02,208
For others to integrate that capability

663
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:03,744
And allows two

664
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,328
To do a lot of great things in our home by not having to pull our phone out of her pocket

665
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:08,096
Open app

666
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:12,960
What seems certain is that we're still not getting a single standard to make all of our devices

667
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:13,728
Interoperate

668
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:16,032
Grant Erickson the president of the thread group

669
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:18,592
Says we're probably going to have

670
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:23,968
I think it's going to actually be a while Stacy until we see that convergence there's a lot of

671
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:27,040
Different value propositions that each of the different players bring to the table

672
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:31,904
Isaac vegan has a very very strong history of strong products

673
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:33,440
What their applications

674
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:35,488
Google NASA me bring their own

675
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:41,888
Value to that ecosystem

676
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:42,912
They bring

677
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:49,824
Consolidation anime impact

678
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,592
They all

679
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:55,456
Exists for a long time and there's interoperability and Gateway is another solution to come in the market

680
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,992
Smith's Raleigh sink work well together

681
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:58,272
As a consumer what is

682
00:25:58,528 --> 00:25:59,296
This mean if I'm like

683
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:01,344
Crap

684
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,368
What do I do

685
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,136
Absolutely

686
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:04,160
There's no reason to wait

687
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:08,512
There's great Solutions there's integrators to make all the stuff work together

688
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:11,072
Before we get too mired into the standards debate

689
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:14,400
Consumer should prepare for another challenge hitting the market in

690
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,168
2017

691
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,704
Subscription play

692
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:19,776
Zach supalla the ceo of particle

693
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:21,824
And iot development platform

694
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:26,176
Explains why his customers are rethinking how they charge for

695
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:27,200
Connected products

696
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,760
So we see some customers

697
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:33,600
Who are trying to operate their businesses away.

698
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:34,880
Github always operate

699
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,416
It cost me $40 to make

700
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:37,952
Birthing sl400

701
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:40,768
There's $60 left I split it with the distributor everybody goes

702
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:43,584
That's the old-fashioned way selling Hardware

703
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,400
But without me there's an ongoing cost associated with

704
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:49,472
The product ID your paying a platform company or you're paying

705
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:50,496
Cellular data plan

706
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:51,776
Or you're paying

707
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:54,848
Someone to host your Cloud software something cost

708
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:56,896
And

709
00:26:57,152 --> 00:27:00,224
If you behave in an old-fashioned way you get frustrated because your margin is

710
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:03,296
Other companies are relying on ongoing

711
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,064
Reminisce

712
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:05,088
Like

713
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:06,624
Consumables reordering like

714
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:08,160
Subscription fees

715
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:11,744
To make the economics work for 90 product and those companies are General

716
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:12,768
Successful

717
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:16,608
Now that requires educating customers and often works better and Industrial

718
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:21,216
And Commercial environments where companies are more willing to pay a recurring revenue for ongoing value

719
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:22,752
And consumers are still warming up

720
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:23,776
To that but

721
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:26,848
Those companies are working out and the companies with

722
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,640
A fixed margin and ongoing

723
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:29,408
Costs

724
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:30,688
Are struggling to figure out how to make

725
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:34,272
And is there a way for that to work works if you grow fast

726
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:39,136
It works if you are sales grow faster than your castas and and you have

727
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:40,928
Central growth it works

728
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,232
But if that doesn't happen you end up

729
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:44,768
Holding the bag of a lot of cost

730
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:45,792
Revenue to support

731
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:50,912
And ideally you're doing that why you grow and eventually you're going to pop a subscription plan or something on top of

732
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:52,448
Or some other way to create online

733
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,728
I think that's as good example

734
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:55,520
That is fundamentally a product

735
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:57,056
Taipei fixed cost for

736
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:58,848
But they have other ways engaging with

737
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:00,128
Power companies to do

738
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:01,152
Response

739
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:06,528
There are other sources of revenue that either they do today or they can do in the future that eventually close the gate

740
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:10,624
Hopefully alternative revenue streams give Nest the chance to last

741
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:11,904
Otherwise

742
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,672
Google will

743
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:15,488
But all other connected products out there

744
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:18,560
Should be working hard to add features worth paying for

745
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:21,888
All in the podcast and what feels like an optimistic

746
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,960
Manufacturers are thinking about their business models

747
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:31,360
And how to keep supporting these products through several iterations of new standards or upgraded technology

748
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:38,016
Much has been made of Intel introducing a smart card format that would allow device makers to add more brains to their products.

749
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:43,392
Down the road the products would have to have an Intel processor inside and we need a slot that would fit the card

750
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:46,720
But it's a nice way of thinking ahead for a device that could live for

751
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,512
For 10 to 20 years in your home

752
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:52,096
Best eyelid with Corey series of Chamberlain

753
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:57,472
Who's back to spell out how he thinks this race to fit standards and more features on a product

754
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:59,008
Play out for the time being

755
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:00,544
I'll give you a hint

756
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:03,360
It's going to involve more hubs

757
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:05,920
You know I think it's an interesting challenge

758
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:07,456
When our goal is

759
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:08,736
Chamberlain is the build

760
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:10,272
A quality

761
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:12,064
Highly reliable pocket Alaska

762
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:14,624
And Technology changes every two

763
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,672
And we're trying to accommodate that in our products

764
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:17,440
Kohl's

765
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:21,536
And what we want to do is say your accessories and ways for you to

766
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:23,328
Keep up with technology space

767
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:24,096
Without you

768
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:25,376
Tearing out the entire

769
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:27,680
Price Chopper nobody wants to do that we know that

770
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:29,728
So we launched a product

771
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:31,264
Announced the launch of a product

772
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,336
I'll come out in April called the MyQ home Bridge

773
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:36,896
They'll allow existing MyQ users

774
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:38,176
The ability

775
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:39,456
Top rated homekit

776
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:42,528
As an additional accessory to

777
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:45,856
They're either existing garage opener with MyQ or two

778
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:49,440
Alright y'all get ready for more bridges

779
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:50,208
More

780
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:55,584
We're almost through with this year's special CES edition of The Internet of Things podcast

781
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,936
What do I find a word from our sponsor and then I'm going to tell you my favorite device

782
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:01,216
The whole show

783
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,008
Ceviche

784
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:05,056
What is 2017 look like

785
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:06,080
For the

786
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:06,848
Open connect

787
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:10,944
So we can look at it from different vectors

788
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,016
What sort of product announcement from

789
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:17,088
Member companies of ocf announcing that they have

790
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:20,416
35 products in the market number to one of the key

791
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:22,208
He goes as far as to make sure

792
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:28,608
Did the OTF ecosystem and the all seeing ecosystem completely the devices on these two ecosystems

793
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:30,656
Talk to each other very transparently

794
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:33,728
Is going to be out there in 2017

795
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:35,520
Beyond.

796
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:36,544
Is going to start

797
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:41,152
Putting resources into more verticals and the specification for other vehicles

798
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:42,432
Like healthcare

799
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,712
Industrial

800
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:44,992
Transportation

801
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:48,320
Mexico utility from an open-source perspective

802
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:50,880
You're going to see support or more additional

803
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:51,648
Platform

804
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:52,416
Weather is

805
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:55,232
Hardware operating system that's already and

806
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:59,584
Constraints implementation of iot that is out there for embedded devices

807
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,376
You'll see. Getting in her

808
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:03,168
A new start to see more and more

809

Expand into new areas like enabling be better connectivity options to the cloud

811
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:11,104
Breathing into other ecosystems

812
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,384
Normocephalic

813
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:15,712
Alright y'all

814
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:18,016
It's time for my favorite device

815
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,832
It's been roundly bought in the Press

816
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:24,160
But my favorite device from the entire CES

817
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:25,184
Was

818
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,208
The microbots

819
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:26,976
Push

820
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:29,536
This is a $50 robot

821
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:31,072
That you attached to it

822
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:33,120
Button on a dumb Appliance

823
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:35,936
And you can program it and it pushes the button for you

824
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:36,960
Bus

825
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:40,544
My coffee maker which is not smart but cost a lot of money

826
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,616
I can now make it smart by adding this button presser thing

827
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:46,688
This is not a device for the mainstream

828
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:47,456
But

829
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:48,224
I really liked

830
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:52,832
And that's it for the special CES edition of The Internet of Things podcast

831
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,928
