00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:11,776
Hey everyone welcome to the Internet of Things show I have your house

2
00:00:12,032 --> 00:00:14,336
Stacey Higginbotham and this is my co-host

3
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:15,360
Kevin coval

4
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:16,128
And

5
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:17,664
Let's see we have got a

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,456
Great show for you today but

7
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:23,296
Here's a quick note we are not going to talk about Apple because

8
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:28,160
The timing of Apple's event we consulted with Evan you know what they did

9
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:30,976
Didn't move the event I mean I don't understand

10
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:33,280
No we record on a Tuesday

11
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:37,632
And Wednesday is when Apple's holding their event and Thursday is when we do the podcast

12
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:38,656
So

13
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,704
Instead of us

14
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,288
Speculating and then being proven right or wrong

15
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,824
Probably wrong

16
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:48,640
We are just going to hold it till next week so

17
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:50,432
All your Apple news will be next week

18
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:52,224
And we will open at that time

19
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,784
I do hope that we see a lot of homekit stuff

20
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:58,624
I do too I have been talking to sources in

21
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,160
They also hope that

22
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:02,464
You never know what the last minute Apple

23
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,232
Has been known

24
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:05,792
The poor things so I'm hoping there's an update

25
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:08,608
And we see some realistic awesome cool things

26
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:12,960
We have been told that September and fall was the time frame for that so

27
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:14,496
Fingers crossed everyone

28
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:18,592
Is very intelligent and connected people familiar with the matter

29
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:19,360
Say that

30
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:20,384
They will be home

31
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:22,176
And it will be greatly in

32
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:23,456
Prove so

33
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:24,224
Next week

34
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:25,504
We have talked

35
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:27,296
Nothing but homekit is what we are

36
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:29,088
Nothing but home test

37
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:30,880
So all right

38
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:31,904
Onto the show

39
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,696
So let's get started with

40
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:34,720
Nest

41
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:35,744
Outages

42
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:41,632
It just happened it just happened last night that they before we are recording the show

43
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,448
And I was affected by a square

44
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:48,032
Because around 9 p.m. eastern time

45
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:51,872
On Monday evening the Labor Day holiday here in the US

46
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,272
Nobody could connect to their nest I was in my app and it's like just turned and turning and turning and then finally said

47
00:01:58,784 --> 00:01:59,552
Can't do it

48
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:00,832
It turns out that

49
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:03,648
That's was aware there was a service outage

50
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:06,464
And me work on a fix for about 3 hours and

51
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,256
At midnight everything was bad

52
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:09,536
Which is great

53
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:10,304
And all

54
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,072
But

55
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:17,728
This really irks me Anna and I shouldn't complain he was like hey firstworldproblems you I could get out of bed to go downstairs to turn

56
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:19,008
Turn the air conditioning up over

57
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,800
I know life is tough

58
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:21,824
The point is

59
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,872
Is what I said for a long time

60
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:28,480
I worry about iot devices that rely solely on the cloud

61
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:32,832
I don't like them for this very reason that's why I went with that insteon system

62
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,112
And the Headless server

63
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:36,416
4 years ago 5 years ago now I'm in

64
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:38,208
It didn't matter if the

65
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:40,768
Cloud services went down because all of my rules

66
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:41,536
Everything was

67
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:44,352
Still available locally and things just worked

68
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:46,656
Hold on

69
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:52,544
Your Nest would still work if you got out of bed and touched the dial

70
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,312
Correct

71
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,104
Yes but that

72
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,176
Yes y'all can't do I just I want to make that clear

73
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,712
No you're absolutely right

74
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:03,040
Can the nest itself still work as a will call it a day

75
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:05,856
Old school manual thermostat

76
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:09,184
In the fact that you could still go up to it

77
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,256
Turn the temperature adjusted turn it off to whatever

78
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,536
It was the

79
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:15,584
Ability to access it remotely

80
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:20,192
Weather in new home or out of a home that was lost but the cloud service itself you couldn't

81
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:22,240
You couldn't remotely connect

82
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:25,568
To your nest from a nest app

83
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,104
See your dropped

84
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,640
Nope

85
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,920
So that that is a

86
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:35,040
Probably a bigger problem but I don't have a Dropcam so I was

87
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:37,600
Obviously not affected by that you're absolutely correct

88
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:41,440
Okay so I am and I wonder about the smoke alarms

89
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:44,256
The smoke alarms with still work

90
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,792
As a smoke alarm

91
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,840
Set a fire

92
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:48,864
They would still

93
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,888
Be back

94
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:50,912
But remote

95
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:52,192
Access Lake

96
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,776
Telling you like your batteries out or something like that I'm sure

97
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,056
Compromised

98
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,080
Agree

99
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,872
Again these are not

100
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:02,944
Major problem depressed back in the stone ages

101
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:07,296
It's just you know the promise of the cloud as being the

102
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:09,344
The bridge for all things IRT

103
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,904
It's just not a perfect scenario

104
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,928
And and

105
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,464
Extra dark me for the longest

106
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,071
Time cuz I'm like I kept saying is going to happen someday it's going to happen to be affected and boom it happen

107
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,375
And how were you affected

108
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,447
I had to go

109
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:26,239
All the way down stay I know I don't want to come

110
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,567
Beacon Grand scheme of things it's a small problem

111
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:34,687
I'm great but it speaks to the larger issue of ever so much Reliance on the cloud instead of

112
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:36,735
Having some type of hybrid type

113
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:39,807
Cloud / local systems for iot

114
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:46,207
It's true and actually with SmartThings their latest thing that just came out they actually put some local Intelligence on it for the

115
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,231
That exact reason

116
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:50,047
Because the cloud does fail sometimes

117
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:50,815
Seether

118
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:55,935
Massively like the nest systemwide outage or even just locally it's like

119
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:57,727
Your own personal internet camp

120
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:58,495
They relied on

121
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:00,287
Make sense

122
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:01,567
Witness

123
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:04,639
I'm trying to think they don't really have

124
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:07,199
Because of the way their system is designed

125
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:14,111
I'm not sure where they would put the brains because if you're thinking about having brains for a smart home system

126
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,647
You have to have a hug

127
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:23,071
The hover were server something that can still manage the devices in lieu of a cloud

128
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,887
With Google's new rap

129
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:32,799
And it's new fun weave and Brillo maybe they just pop that into

130
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:38,175
You know you pop Weaver Brillo into any sort of router and that becomes your hub

131
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:38,943
And they could talk

132
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:46,111
Yeah I mean I could see that and I like that idea as a secondary / backup system I don't want to sit here

133
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:49,695
And say I need to run a nest server in my house I don't want that

134
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:51,487
But I do want some

135
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:55,583
Physical device that have those rules that can take over

136
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:58,399
Freenas or whatever that product Maybe

137
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,423
When the cloud

138
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,959
System breaks down

139
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:03,519
Does any of those systems need some sort of

140
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,079
Basically you need like an arm cortex

141
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,103
Kind of chip in that

142
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:07,871
Because you

143
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:14,015
The microcontrollers that are inside like an aster any other kind of connected device probably isn't

144
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:16,063
Powerful enough to run the all

145
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:21,951
I think that's fair and I don't know that I want localized

146
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,487
Wheels and storage in

147
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:25,535
Intelligence in all of my

148
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:31,679
My actual devices I like the idea that you were talking about a hub or put it into a router or something

149
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:32,703
Where again

150
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:36,031
If the devices are peeing in their cloud services

151
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,823
Custom colors outage

152
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:38,847
Okay

153
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:43,455
Reba Harbor whatever the brain's is local branch as well that's a problem

154
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:46,015
I'm going to go to my localized rules now

155
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:50,111
And I'll keep peeing in the cloud when the car comes back we'll switch back over to the cloud service

156
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,391
So do that

157
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,231
The dreaded s word

158
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,279
So I like that

159
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:59,327
And while we're on the topic I should ask you

160
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,119
Speaking of the Google router

161
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:01,887
Did you

162
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:02,655
Perhaps

163
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:05,215
Purchase 100 the onhub yes yes yes

164
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:11,615
So I literally just before the show check to see if it was available in the PlayStore been checking on a pretty much a day

165
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,383
Basis

166
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,919
It has not been in stock

167
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:14,943
However

168
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:21,599
Also just before the show I check bestbuy.com and they do have them in stock at the normal 199

169
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:22,879
99 price

170
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,927
Could go to Amazon to buy an onhub but you

171
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:27,999
Pay 28999 right now because of the markup switches

172
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:28,767
Ridiculous

173
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:30,303
Don't do that people please don't do that

174
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:33,375
So I do have one coming cuz I just ordered it

175
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:39,775
It will be here I did not do expedited shipping soda be on Thursday when it's podcast was live which gives us something

176
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,567
Something to discuss next week

177
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,871
All right so hopefully we'll talk about

178
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,407
Homekit

179
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,455
So I did not because

180
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,735
Kevin is buying the router

181
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,527
I decided I did not

182
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,295
I want to buy the router

183
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,319
Nor did I buy the

184
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:53,599
So4

185
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:58,463
A few people who ask me who sent me emails like did you buy the handbag

186
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:00,511
Did you buy the router if the answer is Ibotta

187
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,607
That's a tough decision I feel you there

188
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:08,191
Handbags are very but it would have

189
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:08,959
Who's going to hold my

190
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,263
Not just any hair

191
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,823
If it was a connected handbag I think you would have had it

192
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,407
Spot someone did send me

193
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,431
Synthetic

194
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,199
Twitter

195
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,991
Perfect leave it behind your phone

196
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:26,111
Rings or something

197
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,903
I just need to bite the bullet and buy them

198
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:28,671
It was because

199
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:31,999
I've been leaving stuff left and right I need to put one of my water bong

200
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,303
You know what that's what I'm going to

201
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,327
That is what I

202
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,095
Tile

203
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:42,495
Those are the Bluetooth tags that remind you when you've left something behind for people who do not know

204
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:48,127
Yes there's a Bluetooth has and they actually recently just got an update so they actually have a louder alarm

205
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,919
And by golly

206
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,199
I need them

207
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:56,319
And best of all they don't rely on cloud services

208
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,367
Speaking of cloud service

209
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,159
Who actually

210
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,183
Posted something

211
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:03,999
On Google Plus which I saw because no one else

212
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:09,375
Like I told my hundred thousand plus followers over there

213
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,143
Miss Augusta

214
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,935
Wow a hundred thousand

215
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,983
Kevin you are the Lord of

216
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:16,287
Google play oh no no no other people

217
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:19,103
The far more important to me that has millions of

218
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,639
A followers of Arabic

219
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,199
You and Larry Page

220
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:25,503
Alright so

221
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,295
You said that

222
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,063
Google

223
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,111
Should buy if this then that

224
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:35,999
And I thought that was a really fun topic that we should we should talk about but first we should tell people what is 2

225
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:36,767
System that is

226
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:37,791
You want to do the honors

227
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:42,399
Oh no you do that because you are the IFTTT Queen

228
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:45,215
So is this and that is a web service

229
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:46,751
The basically connect

230
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,031
Your

231
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,079
It's actually any web service

232
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:53,151
To any other web service or any device

233
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,431
So using the

234
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,223
Programming language

235
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:58,015
If this happens

236
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,295
Then that happens

237
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,343
You can link things like

238
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,879
Your phone to your Dropbox

239
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,415
So if I take a picture

240
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,183
With my

241
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,719
IOS or Android phone

242
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:08,511
Then

243
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:10,303
Send that picture to Dropbox

244
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,863
Or it could be something as fun as

245
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,911
If the Cardinals score a point

246
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,447
Then my Hue Lights

247
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,215
Turn red

248
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:19,775
All of these are actual recipes that I've cream

249
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,311
Created using cannabis pen that

250
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,359
I have created in my time with

251
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:26,175
The service probably dozens of recipes

252
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,711
It's super fun

253
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:28,991
I recommend it to every

254
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:33,087
Because I almost when people ask me what it is I almost tell them

255
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:35,135
I don't know if you know what an API is butt

256
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:37,695
If this then that is almost like apis for dummies

257
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:40,511
Yes I would never use apis because I'm always

258
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,535
Trying to explain it

259
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:42,559
What's the weather like

260
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,583
They don't know what it is

261
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:46,143
Sure

262
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:50,239
Thank you this is why you should have explained

263
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,775
You did fine I just

264
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:52,543
YouTube

265
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,311
Okay

266
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,591
So that's what if

267
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,639
The shorthand for it

268
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,175
So yes

269
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:00,479
So that's the service and they also have something big

270
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,015
Do

271
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,039
Like two buttons

272
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,319
Hindus are

273
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,647
Like a single button that you press that make something happen

274
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:12,511
So on my phone I have one that turns off my bedside table light at connect to Hue

275
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:15,327
My Hue lamp on my bedside table and when I

276
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,607
Push that button

277
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,399
Hue lamp

278
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,167
Turn soft

279
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,751
I used to have one for my gigaohms slack Channel

280
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,799
Where I pressed it it said

281
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:25,823
Stacy is

282
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,359
Away from her desk

283
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:30,175
But I no longer have that because I no longer have

284
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,199
Mike Ditka

285
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:31,967
Slack Channel

286
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:35,039
Because there is no longer a gigaom that I work at

287
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:38,367
The do buttons kind of interesting because

288
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:42,719
It is an easy way to create one touch shortcuts for your recipes

289
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:45,535
Kappa button and whatever you want it to happen

290
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:50,911
And the nice thing is in this is what led me to my comment about Google should buy them is

291
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:54,239
They have brought the two button they being if this then that

292
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,263
Hey Brother Dubai

293
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,311
To Google's Android Wear watches

294
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:00,127
So now you've got Quick One Touch shortcuts

295
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,151
For whatever

296
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:03,455
Recipes and things do you setup

297
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:06,271
And some of the examples that the if this then that team

298
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,551
Provide adjusted

299
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,575
Illustrate this

300
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:10,111
With a three-button you can

301
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:13,183
Free sample set your nest thermostat to the perfect temperature

302
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,463
Assuming a services

303
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:19,583
You can block off an hour or next hours busy in Google Calendar so nobody will

304
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,631
You know bother you a notification to come in

305
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:25,727
Don't download the slack bit you could ask Ali some slack if they want coffee

306
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:27,519
To the pre-programmed buttons

307
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,311
Made by software and

308
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:31,103
And if this then that recipes

309
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:33,919
My neighbor watches perfect for the

310
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:34,943
I just thought it was a

311
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:36,479
Really really smart

312
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:40,319
Place to put the seasoning on the home screen of your smartphone is good to of course but

313
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:42,111
The more I thought about it like you know

314
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:45,439
We're past the point where smartphones are just

315
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,463
You know

316
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:52,095
Functional connected devices where we going to have to go do something and then we're. Never going to another app would do somewhere.

317
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:56,191
We want these things to start reacting to our knees we want these things to just

318
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,471
Do more

319
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:01,567
And yet we don't want the complexity of having to program them to do more

320
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,895
It's really not complexed to do that with the do but I don't like Google

321
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,199
What huge opportunity you have right here too

322
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:11,039
To advance the smartphone by integrating if this then that right

323
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,575
Into Android natively

324
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:17,695
Exactly it actually in talking to Linden Tibbets who is the CEO of Lyft

325
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:19,999
He actually wants to do

326
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,791
Dudududu

327
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:25,119
He wants to integrate the do button into apps

328
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,143
So

329
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,679
It's very easy

330
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:28,959
To like

331
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:29,983
Right now with

332
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:30,751
Android

333
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,543
I think Android and iOS

334
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:35,615
It actually there's a do for photos

335
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,407
Can I do for nose

336
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,711
So when you take a photo

337
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:42,527
You have a dual button that will automatically like

338
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:46,879
When you take a photo it automatically does something with the photo so you

339
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:47,647
You hit the button

340
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:51,743
It automatically like sends it to Dropbox are automatically

341
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:55,071
Posted

342
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:57,887
So that kind of like again what button

343
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:59,935
Support that you can build

344
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,471
Is so

345
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:04,287
Easy and powerful and customizable

346
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,823
If you can imagine that

347
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,359
All over your phone

348
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,663
With anything that you any app

349
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,431
That you use

350
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:11,711
Enough

351
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:12,735
That's awesome

352
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:14,527
I mean it really is and

353
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:16,319
They have over a hundred

354
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,343
60 Channel Park

355
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,903
And they span the web

356
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:22,207
The crossover the physical devices

357
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,255
It is nuts

358
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,023
I love it

359
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,559
Horse of the echo

360
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,863
It works with the echo although

361
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:32,447
The triggers are a little limited there and the triggers are limited on

362
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,471
All of the things

363
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:34,495
But

364
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:37,311
When you think of companies like

365
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,615
Google would be great because they're open

366
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,663
Like apple could also buy it and then just

367
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,199
Shut it down

368
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,735
Only use it with that

369
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:46,271
Ecosystem kind of like Appleton

370
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,295
Testflight right

371
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,623
How do you say

372
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:51,903
So

373
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,439
Facebook would be another good

374
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,463
Fire actually

375
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:56,511
Because Facebook's really trying to

376
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:01,375
Control the mobile lab and build out this amazing walled-garden kind of

377
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:04,191
Really fast Speedy web services

378
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:06,751
So I could see Facebook being a

379
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:07,519
A good buyer for

380
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,847
I don't know but I really think

381
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,127
And of course you know

382
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,151
Is the synapse

383
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:19,039
It's a really undervalued service and maybe it's because there's not a lot of people using it

384
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,599
But I think thinking about it as a

385
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:27,231
As a service with users as opposed to thinking about it is this amazing back end

386
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,279
For the next generation of Lake

387
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,047
I guess like this

388
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:34,911
Underpinning or service that underpins the entire mobile web is like a better way

389
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:35,935
Think about it

390
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:37,471
I completely agree I mean

391
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,263
We talked about if this then that

392
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,799
Many times before but

393
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,591
It still

394
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:46,175
To the mainstream person I think it's still very esoteric I don't think

395
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,967
It's very commonly known

396
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:51,551
And yet it provides tremendous value with such little investment

397
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,855
And that's why I'd like to see is you said that you know

398
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,647
Focused on non-users

399
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:58,207
And I think I'm going to go could really push that

400
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:01,535
You know there's lots of other potential buyers as you said

401
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,327
Where would be a good fit

402
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,887
Right now I think the best it would be Android Google Android

403
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:06,911
Already

404
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:07,935
So

405
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:09,215
There we go

406
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,495
Just sold off if the

407
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,775
This and that

408
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:13,311
And if you haven't tried it

409
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,079
Please

410
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,359
Go try it because

411
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:18,431
I guarantee you like even my even my daughter and I we have

412
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:20,991
It's just addictive

413
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:23,295
Yeah we get commission if I do Byron

414
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,319
Yes

415
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,087
Speakers

416
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:26,623
There's so many things

417
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,903
For sale

418
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,439
I do think they actually have

419
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,023
I'm alright

420
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:37,887
Let's eat before we go we should probably talk a little bit about some Enterprise news

421
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:41,471
Is that is worth talking about which is last week at FIFA

422
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:42,495
Which is like

423
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,543
Who is it like the CES of Europe

424
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:50,687
Yeah it's actually bigger than CES if I'm not mistaken it's like the largest type trait event and that kind in the world

425
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:52,991
Impute

426
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,551
So arm and IBM

427
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:56,319
Announced

428
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,087
A partnership

429
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:59,647
They actually have had a partnership for a while

430
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,695
They just basically took it alot.

431
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:03,999
Deeper and then IBM also announced

432
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,279
Tweaks and addons

433
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,839
You know IBM is very good it like

434
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,119
Basically

435
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,167
Taking news that it's already announced in in

436
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:12,703
Adding a little bit of

437
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:13,983
Some extra tweet

438
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,007
Jason Phillips Twitter

439
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,055
Now I'm going to make it to

440
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,359
And put out another press release

441
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:20,639
So

442
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:22,687
Basically what what they did is

443
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,479
IBM has a

444
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:28,063
Take back in Cloud product foundations

445
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:30,111
And it's part of it

446
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,135
Bluematrix

447
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:31,903
Cloud

448
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:32,927
Product

449
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,719
What this is is

450
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:37,535
You basically send all of your iot connected

451
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:38,559
Device information

452
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:40,351
Up there

453
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,887
Data analytics

454
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,423
Scott device

455
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,447
Management

456
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:47,775
Compliance kind of stuff all the stuff you basically need to like

457
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,567
Have all this device stayed in

458
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,615
And what arm has done

459
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:54,687
Is they taking their mbed OS which is

460
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:57,247
A real time operating system for their

461
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,783
Microcontrollers

462
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:00,831
And any other kind of

463
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,879
Arm-based microcontroller

464
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,927
And the connected the two

465
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:06,719
With a line of code or two

466
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:08,255
You can basically connect

467
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:09,535
Anything running

468
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,071
Mbed OS

469
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:11,839
2

470
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,375
IBM's

471
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,655
Iot Foundation

472
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:19,775
It's basically an easy way to connect any device

473
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,055
Tybee

474
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:22,591
And

475
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,615
That is important

476
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:24,383
Because

477
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,663
Well I'm thinking Analytics

478
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:32,063
Python thinking big data analytics because that's where IBM is really pushing the boundaries these days you know what the

479
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,855
Watson platform for example

480
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:38,463
And I don't know the details of their IRT foundations Cloud product but I'm guessing that

481
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,999
It has to do a lot with

482
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:46,911
Reviewing all the data coming in from these devices

483
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,983
Safe place because you know you don't want all this data going

484
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,775
Any place like just any old cloud

485
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,311
It runs on spark

486
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:54,335
Which is

487
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,127
The real-time processing engine

488
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,407
You guys came up

489
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:58,943
It's not enough

490
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:01,759
I mean you could send it over to Watson if you wanted to

491
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:04,575
But it's a secure place to analyze all this data

492
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:07,647
And basically it's it's kind of like idiot

493
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:10,207
So if you're like the VP

494
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:15,839
Are the CTO of a company that's like making washing machines in here like hey we got a really get a connected

495
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:16,863
Washing machine

496
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:19,679
This is an easy way to say

497
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:23,007
I've got a bunch of arm-based chips and sensors

498
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:25,567
I need to put those in my washing machine

499
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:30,175
I need an easy way to get all of that data from Those sensors

500
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:32,991
Open to a secure cloud

501
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,015
And you know

502
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:35,807
Nobody gets fired for buying IBM

503
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,367
I'm going to send it on IBM's cloud

504
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,903
This is an easy way to do

505
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,439
And that's what this is

506
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:48,095
And it's not a way to like build a connected manufacturing center operation you know this isn't this isn't like

507
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:50,399
I'm sure IBM has products for that

508
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:56,287
But this is just a simple way to get your products connected

509
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:58,335
If you're like a big name company that

510
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:02,175
It doesn't want to spend a lot of time Reinventing the wheel when it

511
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,967
Most of the Internet of Things a building

512
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:04,991
Nectar product

513
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,271
I think

514
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:08,831
IBM among others are obviously

515
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:11,391
IBM is really well positioned here

516
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:12,415
2

517
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,951
You know provide

518
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:15,231
Device intelligence

519
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:18,559
And similar data and analytics to these device makers

520
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:21,119
Which will eventually hopefully make them smarter

521
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,423
I can't say I'm surprised by this

522
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:28,543
I know this is a long time coming now there are startups in the space there's companies like Ayla Networks

523
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:34,175
Venture-backed startup there's also electric it is kind of in the space they provide a

524
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,711
Cloud services well

525
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:37,759
They're older companies like

526
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:38,783
Exata

527
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:39,551
It was

528
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:41,087
Papaya PTC

529
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:42,879
They're a little bit different

530
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:44,671
But the offering sound a bit

531
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:45,439
The same

532
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:49,791
And the other thing to note is that this is using arms mbed OS

533
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,583
Prior to this most

534
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:57,727
Companies that you buy microcontrollers from they usually have their own proprietary operating systems

535
00:20:58,751 --> 00:20:59,263
And

536
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:02,079
Arms mbed OS was introduced last year

537
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,615
Around this time

538
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:04,383
Two kind of

539
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:07,455
Cuz defragment that market would be a way to think about it

540
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:10,271
Are Bandit will become publicly available

541
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:14,879
Arm told me that it would become publicly available at Tech con this year which is in November

542
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:16,928
So we are all waiting for the

543
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:20,768
The public version right now it's in a beta version that you can download and play with

544
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:22,048
So

545
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,120
That is that is kind of this is a little bit more enterprising but it's

546
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:26,144
It's really important

547
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,192
So

548
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:32,800
This is this is kind of like IBM's big play here and it's not exclusive

549
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:34,848
Armor work with other clouds

550
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:37,920
Will work with other artists

551
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:38,688
So

552
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,968
Keep an eye out here

553
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:41,248
Pretty big deal

554
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,016
For both of these

555
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,064
And that

556
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,368
It's kind of the big enterprisenews there

557
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,464
I think we should probably skip ahead to our

558
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,280
Guessed which this week is Michael Wolff

559
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:56,096
He is actually a former colleague of ours

560
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,888
And he is an analyst

561
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,424
She hosts a podcast

562
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:04,544
And he is also hosting a smart Kitchen Summit so I asked him to come talk about

563
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,360
The connected kitchen and specifically

564
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:09,664
Tiny bit of news that we heard

565
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:15,552
When we learn that Amazon was firing a lot of Hardware people which is that it has a secret project called cabinet

566
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,112
Lab126

567
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:19,136
It is a

568
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:20,160
Connected kitchen

569
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:20,928
So

570
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:27,584
Stay tuned to learn more about Amazon smart kitchen goals and actually just a bunch of really

571
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:33,984

Yeah we

589
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:12,640
We used to

590
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:15,712
Supposed to just like randomly meeting under a bridge somewhere

591
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:18,272
Yes we used to work together at giga

592
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:19,296
And before that

593
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:21,600
Man I used to call you like

594
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:24,928
Like a decade ago about like when you were at like ABI research

595
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,464
Like I interviewed you about like

596
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,232
Bluetooth

597
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:28,768
I don't know if you remember that

598
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:32,608
At this point have gray hair and I've been falling asleep way too long

599
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:35,424
So there's a few of us have been fun the stuff forever I'm one of them

600
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:36,448
Yasso

601
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:37,984
We're old but we're not bitter

602
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,520
We're excited we're friendly

603
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:40,800
At that

604
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:44,384
That's why we're so late Jazz to be here and talking about

605
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:45,408
Smart

606
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:46,176
Kitchen

607
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:48,736
I'm just going to warn everybody listening right now

608
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:52,832
About a month ago you guys may remember I had a shift on the show talking

609
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:54,880
About connected ovens and connected

610
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:55,648
Cooking and

611
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:57,696
If you guys aren't into that thing

612
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:00,512
He might not be excited about the show cuz we are going to talk about

613
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:02,304
Same sort of topic again

614
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,096
But this time with the attitudes hook

615
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:05,632
Amazon

616
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:08,192
And its plans for something called

617
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:09,216
Cabinet

618
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:09,984
Mike

619
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:10,752
What do we know

620
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:14,336
Well we know that Amazon like to spell Cameron with a k

621
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:15,616
Like the Kardashians

622
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,384
Yes

623
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,152
Yes

624
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:23,296
And this is something that showed up in an article I Believe In The Wall Street Journal and it was almost an afterthought

625
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,576
It was an article about

626
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:29,952
How Amazon lab126 which is their hard work group for all the things like Amazon Fire

627
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,744
The Fire Phone excetera

628
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:32,768
It was about

629
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:35,840
The main focus of the articles about how they were laying off a big chunk of

630
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:36,608
The people who are

631
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:38,912
Responsible for the fire phone cuz that by and large

632
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:40,960
Interfire funny Crash and Burn

633
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:45,056
But apparently there's there's something else are working on called the cabinet which is

634
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:48,896
Called an article is called a smart kitchen computer or kitchen

635
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:50,688
And what's that

636
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,248
It got me to thinking about what this thing could be

637
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:55,552
So I wrote a post about it for Forbes

638
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,576
As well as my own

639
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:58,112
Am I on block and

640
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:03,744
That's what I would like to talk about me or just speculating about what exactly a kitchen computer from Amazon could be

641
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:05,792
I don't kiss like what I saw that

642
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,840
You actually were the first person I thought of

643
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,912
In Seattle maybe has

644
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:12,704
Snooze other lab 100

645
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:13,728
She's not in

646
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:14,496
Seattle

647
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:15,264
But

648
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:19,360
When I think of Amazon in their kitchen computer I actually think of the Amazon Echo

649
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:20,128
Which

650
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:22,176
It's actually on my kitchen counter

651
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,224
And we used to control

652
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:30,880
To me it's like our our calendar it is our question answer it turns on her lights and does all her stuff downstairs so that

653
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:32,928
Let me Hazard kitchen computer at orders

654
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:35,744
Keep track of my to-do list to my grocery list so I'm like

655
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:37,792
What on Earth would my

656
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:39,328
Kitchen computer actually do

657
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,352
What else

658
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:41,888
Do I need to do and you

659
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:43,936
You have some ideas around kind of

660
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:48,032
Shopping list and even kind of thinking about food prepping recipes

661
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,824
But I thought we're kind of

662
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:50,848
I don't know

663
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:51,872
Crazy

664
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,176
Dare I say crazy

665
00:25:55,712 --> 00:26:01,856
Well yeah I'm the crazy analyst and that's my job could come up with crazy ideas and you know what's interesting in your comparison to that Co is it

666
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:04,416
It actually sounded a lot like an echo

667
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:06,976
You have to kind of just quote that article basically says

668
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:09,792
The cabinet will be designed to serve as a hub

669
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:11,584
Birth internet-connected home

670
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:14,912
And take voice commands for tasik ordering merchandise from Amazon

671
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:15,936
Well guess what

672
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:17,984
Can't you do that with Amazon Echo

673
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:22,336
So I thought well maybe it's a suit of echo or they're going to do something more

674
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:24,640
With all these different efforts that they have

675
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:26,688
I also think that they'll have a screen on

676
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:33,088
I mean one of the things that that go doesn't have it it's largely a headless devices it's kind of almost mint act like a router in a sense

677
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:35,136
Even though it is a kind of voice interface

678
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:36,160
Birthday quotes

679
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,440
Kitchen computer

680
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:39,488
You probably want a touch screen

681
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,328
Inability to bring up recipes in kind of Explorer

682
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,864
The world of food Audible

683
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,192
I think that's one of the aspects of it I think we'll have that differentiates it

684
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:49,728
From the Amazon Echo

685
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:51,776
Okay so is screen I totally agree

686
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:54,080
Cuz I I will say that I kind of wish I could

687
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:57,408
Fling myrecipes onto a screen

688
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,992
Not onto my echo but I wish my echo could actually read recipes

689
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:01,760
Is to me

690
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:04,832
As I'm cooking and kind of slow them down for me

691
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:05,856
Psychedelic

692
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:06,880
Hey

693
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:10,720
I want to say it too loud so people's Echoes don't wake up but

694
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,000
Hey

695
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,792
What's next in my process

696
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:16,096
And she could say you know add to

697
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:17,120
Splenda sugar

698
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:23,008
But the other thing that I thought was really cool that you had had in there was that it would likely use the dash replenishment

699
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:23,776
Service

700
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:27,360
And I'm not a huge fan of Amazon's Dash buttons that you

701
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:29,920
Press the button and it automatically orders

702
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:31,456
One thing for you

703
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:33,760
But I do like this idea of having

704
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:38,112
Replenishment service that automatically detects when you're out of things

705
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,648
In order stuff

706
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:40,672
So

707
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:42,976
Let's talk about how something like that might

708
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,840
Yeah you know I think that I shall be called maybe a dashboard

709
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:48,864
Sorry that's terrible

710
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:52,192
But I can imagine

711
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:53,728
It being a central

712
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:57,056
Clearinghouse for different types of Amazon Dash

713
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:58,848
Replenishment Services I mean I think

714
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,384
MLB step back in what

715
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,224
Maybe look at what Amazon division for the homies with with Dash is

716
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,064
They want to basic automate reordering for all the consumables

717
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,344
Any Kitchen & Beyond

718
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,112
And

719
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,648
You're the problem is with a button

720
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,208
I know you and I probably don't want a lot of these different

721
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:15,232
Glue on button

722
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,024
13B sitting at War

723
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:23,680
And if you start to integrate Dash which is the bigger Vision I think with Amazon Dash replenishment Services integrating Dash into all these different

724
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:24,448
Appliances

725
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:29,312
How do you get a controller if it's if you have one device from Whirlpool you have another from LG

726
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:31,360
And you have something from Samsung

727
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:32,384
How you going to

728
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,432
You all know someone that well you could use a nap

729
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:36,736
I mean that that's probably like the the lower

730
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:41,344
Friction round may be the easy around just have a dash app that kind of symbolizes all this

731
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,648
But you know Amazon probably wants to

732
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:48,512
Go even further than and I think that what the kitchen computer it could be a physical manifestation

733
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:50,816
Become a physical device that manages all that

734
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:52,608
And so it'll incorporate

735
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,400
Trucks and all these different devices

736
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:56,960
Don't have features in the end

737
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:59,776
Dashboards that allows you to kind of monitor everything you've ordered

738
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:01,312
I think it's just one asked

739
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:02,848
Spectra that I think we never seen one

740
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:03,872
Okay

741
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:05,664
Now I wonder if it would be

742
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:08,480
Similar are you familiar with the Haiku device

743
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:09,504
Yes I am

744
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:11,296
The Sea of hikers coming to my event

745
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:12,832
That's excellent

746
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:16,160
You are either my friend will talk about yours

747
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:16,928
So

748
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:19,744
Haikyuu is kind of a meld of like the

749
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:21,024
The shopping list

750
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,048
On the echo

751
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,072
And

752
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:25,376
Maybe the dash replenishment service cuz

753
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:26,912
The shopping list

754
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:27,680
It's just

755
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:29,728
I give it a list right I say

756
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:32,800
Add wrapping paper at milk

757
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:34,848
It does that in the app nothing else happens

758
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,176
Haiku has these kind of fun Partnerships with

759
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:40,736
They're mostly high-end grocery stores in other

760
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:41,760
Countries

761
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:43,808
Even understand they're going to happen here

762
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:45,600
But I'd say add milk

763
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:48,928
To a haiku if I were in France or the UK

764
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:52,256
It would actually add milk to my list and it also

765
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:54,304
Conveys that order to

766
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,328
A grocery store

767
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,680
And then I can either go pick it up later in the week or it will be delivered to

768
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:00,960
Incel

769
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:02,496
If you think about that

770
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:05,568
As a replenishment service is supposed to be like

771
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:11,968
Having a special container that has a sensor on it that automatically lets Amazon know that I'm out of milk

772
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:13,248
This is a perishable

773
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,272
What's a terrible example

774
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:16,320
Changes to dog food

775
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:17,600
That kind of gets

776
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:18,880
Interesting

777
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:20,160
I'm sorry Rob I probably just

778
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:20,928
Killed your business

779
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,512
So I don't know that was another one of your kind

780
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:25,280
Cabinet ideas

781
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:27,840
And then

782
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:29,376
You talk about this idea of

783
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:31,168
Cabinet bingo

784
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:32,960
Physical manifestation of the

785
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:33,984
The kitchen operating

786
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:40,128
Which sounds terrible and he said it sounded like a call to Arms

787
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:41,664
Jang

788
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:43,968
What the heck is

789
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:47,296
Why does my kitchen need an OS what is

790
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:48,832
What is that going to

791
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:50,368
Ten-tails I wanted to

792
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,904
Get some thoughts for me

793
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:58,048
Why I think that there are a number of like startups in this goes beyond Amazon who are creating Point devices

794
00:30:58,304 --> 00:31:00,352
And I think the initial reaction to

795
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:03,680
Some of these devices be these know these connected scales

796
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:05,216
These are the things

797
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:07,776
Maybe can't connect into these different

798
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:08,800
White goods is

799
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:10,592
The white Canary Factor saywell

800
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:12,128
This is great but what's happened

801
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:13,408
Kind of work together

802
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:15,456
Rather something that plugs into I think

803
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:19,808
Be looking with orange Jeff is trying to do I think there may be moving down that path as well

804
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:25,952
I think you know haikus interesting Haiku to me is more like an arms Merchant that can be a competitor to everyone who isn't Amazon

805
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,744
But I just think it

806
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:31,328
Rather than having a bunch of different things that don't work together

807
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:36,192
Amazon what's going to be the central point with all these different things in the kitchen were together and so

808
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:39,776
Dwayne leave the foundation with this kind of the services and they pii

809
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:41,056
With Dash

810
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:42,592
I'm with Amazon Fresh

811
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:46,944
And in some of these other rappers so I can Alexa which is going to be the voice interface for these

812
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,016
If you can bring those are all together into one device

813
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:54,112
And then they'd go out to do Partnerships with all these Wicked manufacturers as well as

814
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:57,184
Are some of the the brand so if you look at the dash button

815
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,768
That's very much a strategic rollout in the chosen some of the biggest

816
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:03,072
Consumable manufacturers in the World rides on YouTube

817
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:05,376
Whoever those are Johnson & Johnson Coca-Cola

818
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:07,424
Those are very strategic partner so

819
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:12,288
I think they're giving a taste of what a dash embedded world can feel like with a dash button

820
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:17,152
To these Brands and I think they're going to reel them in hopefully over time we secure Amazon

821
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:19,968
And say when we have the speaker Vision we're going at this kitchen computer

822
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,808
Do you want the service in this Replacement Service hooked into your you're

823
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,344
Is your brand

824
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:31,744
And I'm sure the water can be rented a two-story I mean that's I'm sure it wake what their vision is to relay these this kind of brand attitude

825
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:32,768
Dbrand

826
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:37,120
Register I think that rather than having all the stuff piecemeal they want to bring it together in one unit

827
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:39,680
So I'm picturing I like

828
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:42,752
So cuz I couldn't break up the kitchen

829
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:45,056
The Kitchen Story into

830
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:46,592
Maybe it's not a story

831
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,384
Maybe it's my task

832
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,176
I break them up into planning

833
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:51,456
Prep

834
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:52,224
Cooking

835
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:53,504
Consumption

836
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:56,576
So on the planning side of got my kind of

837
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:58,368
Recipe apps

838
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:03,232
My Pratt I got things like the drop kitchen scale orange Chef the countertop

839
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:04,000
Kind of stuff

840
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:06,048
Cook at the June

841
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:07,840
I got whatever other kind of

842
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:09,888
Cooking devices there are

843
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,448
And then consumption I got things

844
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:13,984
They even go so far as like

845
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,520
MyFitnessPal in

846
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:17,568
Even things like health kit with my data

847
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:19,872
So on top of all that

848
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:22,944
I'm trying to think of the things that need to run across all of that

849
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:24,992
Photos of ruined storage

850
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:27,040
I'm going to take you to one of things you have is like

851
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:29,856
Obviously refrigerators you have other guys were making

852
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:31,136
Smart containers

853
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:32,928
I'm that I think are interesting

854
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:35,744
I think I want somewhere in there you slide in

855
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,280
Replenishment in in purchasing

856
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:38,304
Which I think is

857
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,352
Maybe I won't go into consumption but

858
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:42,912
I think Amazon sticking all the way from

859
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:46,752
I have this need for consumables I have this

860
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:48,544
Planning process I do for cooking

861
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,592
I have is consumption around

862
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:53,664
Food and I are going to the impacts of Health excetera

863
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,944
I have a storage of it

864
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,016
And if you could tie all those together at thinks that's the big vision

865
00:33:58,784 --> 00:33:59,552
Got it okay

866
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:04,928
And I think what size hose together is data around food right nutrition

867
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,232
Recipes are kind of a way

868
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:10,304
Today the the recipe is almost the OS rate

869
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:13,888
But that's not digitized in a way that's that's friendly

870
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:16,448
Nitrate in food is not digital so

871
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,752
Okay this is fine I'm thinking about this

872
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:25,152
And we'll be able to think about it more because you have this kind of fun show coming up November 5th in Seattle it is the

873
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,944
Smart kitchen

874
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:27,712
Summit

875
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:30,528
That's going to say show but it's the smart Kitchen Summit

876
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,112
It is a see if we can find information about it

877
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:36,928
At

878
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:38,208

You got me I'm coming

890
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:03,296
Let's see who else is probably the most exciting part for me

891
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:07,136
It is just one of those I can't wait to see you and you see Chris

892
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:09,440
Chris Albrecht our friends can be Dempsey

893
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:13,024
There you go but you got actually some grape me follow you got Jardin

894
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:15,072
I'm someone from Jordan who makes

895
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:16,096
The Crock-Pot

896
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:17,888
The connected crock pot

897
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:19,168
The connected crock pot

898
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:24,544
I'm going to ask him about my refrigerator Crock-Pot I've spoken to them before about this they are still not making it

899
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,080
Must not be a good idea

900
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:26,848
I don't know why

901
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:30,432
But why we are on this topic I would love to ask

902
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:32,224
What are some of the kind of

903
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:33,504
Other companies

904
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,296
That we should be excited about

905
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:36,576
In the smart kitchen

906
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:42,720
Where should I be looking for good ideas I know that there is some startups making these Point devices that we kind of talked about that

907
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:44,512
Who else is thinking big about this

908
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,584
Well I would say that you know I made this comparison

909
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:53,216
The people to come and show them what where my thinking is I mean when you look at 10 years ago we're all excited about the reinvention of the television

910
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:57,312
And yeah we're just at the end of the beginning of this revolution that has unfolded

911
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:59,104
Before I sold last decade were

912
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:01,664
10 years goes all through cable box

913
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,504
But we knew if we can get internet to the TV it was a massive potential

914
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,344
Opportunity for disruption yashow market is 50 billion dollars

915
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:12,672
10 years later looking at where where are Netflix is is the largest

916
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:14,208
Pay TV provider in the US

917
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:18,816
You all this conversation about disrupting the television I think we're at that phase right now

918
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:22,144
When we were ten years ago it with TV were right there with food

919
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:22,912
And

920
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:24,960
As I said if people knew everyone needs

921
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:27,520
The food in the grocery in the restaurant business in

922
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:30,848
And then just that total Market is a much bigger Market probably

923
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:32,640
Exponentially bigger than TV

924
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:34,944
I think it's really exciting in

925
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:41,088
You could just go along all these different pockets of innovation I mean there's a lot of interesting stuff that people put up like the scales except for butt

926
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,416
I'll give you one example, that really is exciting is coming hotel for you

927
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:45,184
And

928
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,208
Their copy that

929
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:48,256
Is trying to reinvent something that's been

930
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:50,816
People been doing what are the same way for a thousand years

931
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:52,096
Witches Brew tea

932
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:54,144
You know I love t

933
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,960
But it is the most simple thing you could do

934
00:36:57,216 --> 00:37:03,360
Drop a bag of tea in hot water and how can you change that and that was very skeptical before I talk to him and so

935
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:10,016
Ponytail you say you you have t you love but you can only drink it before 5 cuz otherwise you're going to be up all night

936
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:13,856
What's a for you to say well I want to do a nighttime Brew this tea

937
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:17,184
And I want to reduce the amount of caffeine I can do those turn this knob

938
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:20,256
Oh by the way I really think an antioxidants are healthy

939
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:26,656
I'm getting to that age where I think it's going to be to make me live longer what's turn up the antioxidants and you could do all this with the tip for a bird

940
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:27,680
You can just change

941
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:30,240
It ended kind of make it taste of Indian accent

942
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:32,032
Kind of turnips in accents and notes

943
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,360
And that to me for I have been diving to the world

944
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:41,504
Politely and there is a massive Community there's like T conferences and there's just these team through this and I think you start telling about this

945
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:43,552
Tell me some people are skeptical

946
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:46,112
But I think there was some people be really excited about

947
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,696
I think that's one really kind of interesting example of a

948
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:52,000
A company is trying to reinvent something

949
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:53,280
Done the same way forever

950
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:54,560
No I'm

951
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:56,864
I'm sitting here thinking about that I'm like okay

952
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,912
Yeah change the way I brew tea

953
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:00,704
Some people will argue that that is

954
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,544
Just kind of mechanizing a process that maybe doesn't need to be mechanized

955
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:06,336
I guess

956
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:08,640
This is an area where you see a lot of gimmicks

957
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:09,408
Like

958
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,712
To meet cooking is something that has

959
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:14,272
Is fundamentally unchanged a lot of ways

960
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:17,344
Because you know you heat something over a fire

961
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:19,392
Like thousands of years we

962
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:20,928
Bend Heating

963
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,256
Chopping things up in the various Cuts or bits and

964
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:25,792
Eating them over virus

965
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,328
The way we heat them

966
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,632
Dictates how they end up tasting

967
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,168
So

968
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,960
Fundamentally that hasn't changed

969
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:33,984
And a lot of

970
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:35,520
Cooking

971
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:39,360
In devices and Innovations in cooking have been based around gimmicks like

972
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:41,152
You know a lot of people have like

973
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:43,200
George Foreman grills or

974
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:43,968
Exodus

975
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:46,528
You know we've all seen the

976
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:49,856
What is that thing that makes you look the connecting meat thermometer so it goes like

977
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:53,696
You know adding Wi-Fi Bluetooth on something in and kind of making that a device

978
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:55,232
I agree is a gimmick

979
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:59,072
List that actually a connection thermometer can be really helpful especially if it's a cure

980
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:01,888
But I was thinking like maybe vessel like a

981
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:04,192
Something is something that

982
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:04,960
You don't like

983
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:06,496
$200 glass

984
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:08,544
Spec tells you what you're drinking or how many

985
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:09,824
Glasses of water

986
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:11,872
I would argue in a

987
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:14,432
That is something that has been in a widely pan

988
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:15,968
I'm ask you something

989
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:17,248
Someone that finds that really intrigued

990
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:18,528
AYSO

991
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:25,184
You know sure you can look on the can of Stephen Colbert said and see what's in it but what if you're someone has like a very specific dietary need

992
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:31,584
I'm yet you know you were some of that really needs to closely monitor while you're taking in over the course of a week or or course of the month

993
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:36,192
That is very hard to do just by trying to transcribe what you're drinking

994
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:40,032
As you go Adventure some of the travel so if you had something like this that can

995
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:41,312
Do that I think that's

996
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:42,592
That's usually viable

997
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:43,616
I am

998
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:44,640
Technology

999
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:48,736
Right not against at and I'm actually really excited about passive data collection

1000
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:52,832
I am panicking that idea because they're very opaque about how they do

1001
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:55,904
Writing whether or not it's

1002
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:02,304
It's whether or not they're their molecular sensor Works anyone thinks it's interesting to them about them as they have

1003
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,120
A weight sensor is awesome at Mach or sensor with the big

1004
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:06,912
I guess mystery box

1005
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:09,216
Kind of the unknown is how the moisture sensor work

1006
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:14,848
But I think of it does work whether or not it's not them if someone else can get that I think I Choose You diable

1007
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:18,688
I think that is valuable I don't know if it's necessarily

1008
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:20,480
Consumer technology at the beach

1009
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:22,528
But yes yes I'm not against

1010
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:23,552
That I'm

1011
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:26,624
Market device

1012
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:33,024
Yeah I think most of these Technologies are not consumer technology since beginning their they're like rich people technology for the 1st

1013
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,584
3 years and look at the June of it right I mean

1014
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,656
You're talking about $1,500 for a basically what

1015
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:40,192
Looks like a toaster oven

1016
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:41,728
It's much more complicated

1017
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:44,032
Getting that now but it's something that is a size 1

1018
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:46,848
But that is something that is not going to be Mass Market

1019
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,920
But let's go to the Next Generation to the Next Generation

1020
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:54,784
Another example is the peak of a right to the peekaboo is a 15 or $2,000 device

1021
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:57,344
It's still fairly big in my wife

1022
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,648
Laughs at me when I say I want a peek a brew my house

1023
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,184
A kiss is still big

1024
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,208
What you should tell us what a

1025
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:06,816
What is a peekaboo so picobrew is a home

1026
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:08,096
Beer brewing Appliance

1027
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:10,656
And it's their basic taking

1028
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:14,240
Iot technology in applying and applying to science to beer

1029
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:18,848
What's interesting about what's a step back about you know kind of that the product Evolution forbid

1030
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:20,640
What's interesting about that is

1031
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:27,552
No home brewing is something that is widely variable people have been doing it for a long time they're enthusiastic but one batch of the next

1032
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,088
You can't really make it

1033
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:32,160
You can't really say with any degree of certainty is going to taste the same

1034
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:35,232
And if I give my my buddy my recipe in Austin

1035
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:36,512
I sent it over the internet

1036
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:38,816
Chances are that he can to the same

1037
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:40,352
Unless you replicate it

1038
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:43,936
Using technology like this and there's no there's a technology called beer XML

1039
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:50,592
So you talked to him about this kind of the idea of data which is really interesting there's actually data and kind of Frameworks around getting beer recipes

1040
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:52,384
Shirley Rodriguez KO up to like

1041
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:54,175
Brewery size beer

1042
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:55,455
Brewing down to Lake

1043
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:56,991
Half a gallon

1044
00:41:57,503 --> 00:42:01,855
And you could just scaled up or down so I think applying technology like that is really interesting

1045
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:03,647
And it does something that

1046
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:06,463
I've never really been done before and this other guys like we're about as well

1047
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:08,767
You haven't really been able to brew in the home

1048
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:12,095
Cost effectively using technology in replicating really good recipes

1049
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:13,119
Until now

1050
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:14,143
Okay

1051
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:15,423
It's like a b r o s

1052
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:19,519
Abuse abuse schema

1053
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:21,311
I got your schema there we go

1054
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:23,871
That's awesome

1055
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:27,455
And I can't wait are the picobrew guys going

1056
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:30,783
They're going to be there and I'm trying to get them to bring a lot of beer

1057
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:32,063
Golf Course

1058
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:36,927
Pico in and of itself implies small so not as small as Nano

1059
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:38,975
Or maybe that's smaller

1060
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:41,023
Nano Brewing

1061
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:44,351
I don't know what to do between man on Pico both imply small but

1062
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:45,631
Anything compared to Lake

1063
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:47,679
Sierra Nevada small

1064
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:50,239
But enough probably to Philly give us give us a nice Buzz

1065
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:52,543
I don't know actually I can

1066
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:57,407
I will save my bravado for another

1067
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:58,431
Another beverage

1068
00:42:58,943 --> 00:42:59,455
Okay

1069
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:01,759
I think we're out of time

1070
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:03,551
But I'm really enjoying this

1071
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:04,575
So I cannot

1072
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:05,343
Wait

1073
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:06,367
2

1074
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:09,183
Visit your conference and before we go I want to get you

1075
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:10,463
Really fast

1076
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:12,255
Big trends give me

1077
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:14,815
Listen to big trends that we should be watching for

1078
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:15,583
In the kitchen

1079
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:21,983
I think this is an overused term democratization of technology that was really only used in professional kitchens

1080
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:24,799
Is coming to the consumer Market example that is

1081
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:27,615
Is the others two or three connected to beat makers

1082
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:31,711
Recipe makers in general whether or not they're connected that's something that really didn't exist

1083
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:32,991
3-4 years ago

1084
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:34,015
Brick and Timber prices

1085
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:35,039
I use one

1086
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:38,879
I'm making better steak I've ever met before I can make I made pudding with it

1087
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:41,183
Stacy we haven't tried when you try to destroy fun

1088
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:42,463
Oh you're inviting me to

1089
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:45,791
I'll make funny. My suvee cooker

1090
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:50,399
And I think this year you alluded to that kind of the fusing of

1091
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:51,679
Appdata in cooking

1092
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:54,495
I think you know this idea of taking healthkit

1093
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:55,263
Data

1094
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:59,615
I'm in in August of really understand where you are in Ark

1095
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:01,151
In our day in our hour

1096
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:02,431
And more long-term

1097
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:09,343
Having that feed into what we buy and feed ourselves at I think it's going to be really important I don't think anyone's really crack that

1098
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:15,999
I think Apple's trying to lay some Foundation but I think that'll be a really interesting Trend watch would like to see big Brands actually start to push

1099
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:17,791
Nutritional data

1100
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:18,815
Their data

1101
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:19,839
Actually

1102
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:22,399
To Consumers I would like to see them get on board

1103
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:25,727
Maybe through apis and starting to release some of that a little bit

1104
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:27,775
So I'm not the one laborious Lee

1105
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:30,335
Typing all this into my app

1106
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:31,615
I have my app crashes

1107
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:34,687
Do it again

1108
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:36,223
So that's my hoe

1109
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:41,087
The big Brands will start to realize that there's a lot of value and there's probably even some advertising opportunity

1110
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:42,111
Actually there

1111
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:43,391
So we'll see

1112
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:44,927
Mike

1113
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:48,255
Thank you so much for coming on the show I cannot wait to see you

1114
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:49,279
November 5th

1115
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:50,815
In Seattle at the smart

1116
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:52,095
Kitchen Summit

1117
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:53,119
And

1118
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:55,423
Thanks for coming on the show

1119
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:58,751
We'll see if we ever see the cabinet what are the odds

1120
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:02,079
You know I know that Amazon has

1121
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:02,847
Done

1122
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:04,383
Projects that they kill

1123
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:09,247
And I'll talk to books have been behind some of the projects and then never made the light of day

1124
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:13,599
I have a feeling this year if I were to put odds on a Sprite no over 50% will see something

1125
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:16,671
But who knows it could be something that is playing with and they kill it

1126
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:17,951
All right

1127
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:23,327
Everyone thank you so much for listening and we will see you next week
