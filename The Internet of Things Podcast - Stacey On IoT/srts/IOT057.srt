00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:12,032
Hey everyone welcome to the Internet of Things podcast

00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:13,056
Stacey Higginbotham

00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:15,616
Kevin tofel

4
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:19,200
Tonight's starting goalies

5
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:20,480
Wearables

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,880
Costume

7
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:30,464
The dresses are simple War

8
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:36,608
No

9
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:39,680
Walking walking the iot carpet

10
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:43,008
Guys did you see Claire Danes

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,824
Was wearing an amazing dress it was

12
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,384
It was like every Girls Princess fantasy

13
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,920
Was beautiful is white

14
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:51,712
And then with the lights were out

15
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:52,480
It close

16
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:55,296
I just sent a David

17
00:00:55,552 --> 00:01:01,696
Fiber optics and 30 little battery pack sewn into the thing which I didn't see I mean not that I

18
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:03,488
Saw tons of pictures of this but

19
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:06,304
All the pictures that I saw I don't see any better backs

20
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:09,632
They did say that

21
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:13,472
The dress was so difficult for her to move around in it took her husband

22
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:15,776
And I think Zac Posen I don't know

23
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:17,312
The designer

24
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:18,592
To help her life

25
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:19,616
Maneuver

26
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:22,176
Yeah I think they built this around her

27
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:23,712
Panda

28
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:27,808
So for the most part I was really disappointed because all the celebrities were like

29
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:28,832
Hey

30
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:32,160
Fatima that fashion Gala which is held or the Met fashion

31
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:33,952
Just how old

32
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,768
Every year at the Metropolitan Museum of Art

33
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:38,816
Saturated is at the weather look for hosts

34
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:45,728
Appreciate

35
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:47,520
Really awesome

36
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,848
Why not Kevin

37
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:52,128
Sheepadoodles

38
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:56,736
Which Beatles t-shirt but then again what day am I not wearing

39
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:05,184
So I thought hers was also because it look like clothing

40
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:07,232
But

41
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:10,816
Dress that did have some kind of tech associated with it

42
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:11,840
Who's Carolina

43
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,120
Dakota

44
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:15,936
Wore this dress actually

45
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:16,704
Design

46
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:18,496
VnExpress

47
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:19,520
And

48
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:21,056
It was

49
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:24,896
White looking dress in this house little flowers embroidered on the train

50
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:27,456
And they responded apparent

51
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:32,576
You know it's funny you say that I didn't know about Carolina's dress I was going to say it would have been cool if

52
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:38,976
Claire Danes dress had some type of connectivity in it so the colors change based on maybe where she was in the room

53
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:40,512
Close to or someone

54
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:43,072
But now karolina stress had some kind of

55
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,608
Connectivity Tech in it

56
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:47,424
Yes so her dress was designed by is it March

57
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:48,960
Marchesa marchesa

58
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:53,568
I haven't watch Project Runway in a while but I think

59
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,592
So

60
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:58,944
Marchesa design this and it had a hundred fifty LED connected flowers

61
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:03,808
What they did is the

62
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,880
Sojoy patients excitement encouragement curiosity

63
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:13,536
Colortool

64
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:17,120
That uses color psychology to match emotions

65
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:19,680
So what's and shows colors

66
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:22,240
Also aligned with Marquez

67
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,008
Brandt

68
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:24,800
Of course

69
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,200
Mark s Allen

70
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:32,480
And

71
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:36,320
That actually on address because

72
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,344
A yellow dress

73
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,440
Your LEDs were like lighting up red

74
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:49,376
If you did a tweet tagged Met Gala or

75
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:51,680
That would change

76
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:52,704
Colors on

77
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:58,592
See that's the part I like I mean other people have influence over what happens that's pretty wicked

78
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:00,128
They say even the fabric

79
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:01,152
Which was tool

80
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,176
Was chosen through

81
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:07,296
People think would look good on this dress

82
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:10,368
Why don't we why don't we just say thinking now except cognitive

83
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,696
Those two were my favorite dresses

84
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:16,000
Is there a couple of nice dresses but

85
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:18,559
Overall for the sea

86
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,327
Maps

87
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,351
Immaculate

88
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,143
Man and machine

89
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:25,215
There was

90
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,007
Blade Runner

91
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:27,775
You know

92
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,055
Metal

93
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:31,871
Silver

94
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:38,527
Yeah that's that's that movies from the 80s 90s and so on but now you take a look at some of the more recent movies

95
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,575
There is no physical

96
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,623
Body you think of her

97
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:47,487
At work ex machina which you couldn't even eventually tell it was a

98
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:48,255
Android

99
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:52,607
So if we go with fashion from her all I remember is

100
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,375
Ridiculous pants

101
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,167
Well

102
00:04:56,191 --> 00:05:00,543
That's that wasn't the best view of the future at least I hope not keep my Beatles shirts thank you

103
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:01,823
So right now

104
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,359
When fashion meets

105
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:04,383
Tech

106
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,943
I have to say that fashion is doing a terrible job

107
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:10,015
Yeah those two dresses were

108
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,039
Fine

109
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:16,671
I would love to see actually some people you know Adafruit always that the

110
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:18,207
Company in Brooklyn that sells kind of

111
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:18,975
Connected gadgets

112
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:24,863
They actually have some really cool designs I've run across some cool designs on their blog before

113
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,143
Things like

114
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,935
Clothes that interact with

115
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:33,567
The lights on the skirt with a round in the

116
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,103
Motion of the ISS

117
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,663
Which is kind of a fun way to

118
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,991
Right right

119
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:44,575
Think about it

120
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:48,671
Estimate does a similar theme wish they won't

121
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,207
I expect better

122
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,487
All right

123
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:52,255
So

124
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:54,815
After my foray the fashion there

125
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:55,839
Where everybody at

126
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:00,447
I'm not going to talk about

127
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:04,543
I have been promising you guys a review of this little

128
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:07,359
Pebblebee Stone

129
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:08,639
Which is

130
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:09,919
Two things

131
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,711
It's a Bluetooth tracker

132
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:13,759
Much like tile

133
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:17,855
And it is also a one button pressed

134
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:21,695
Do a couple things associated with your phone and theoretically

135
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:22,463
Also can I

136
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,231
Who is this

137
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:25,791
Send that programmable button

138
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,583
Nice

139
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:30,655
The size of a quarter

140
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,447
It cost about $30

141
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,215
And

142
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,263
It works as a Tracker

143
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,031
And

144
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:39,359
That's pretty easy it has a nice little nap in her face on it that you

145
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:41,919
If you press the map so it's not even making them up all the time

146
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:44,735
Depressant

147
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,087
Much to my chagrin

148
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:51,135
I could not get the if this then that

149
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:51,903
Functionality

150
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,439
So

151
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,231
You get to options

152
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:55,999
What does program

153
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,535
Press

154
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,071
And a long press

155
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,863
So I've done

156
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:05,471
Quick press being call my husband so

157
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:08,799
I don't know if I'm feeling lazy or attacked

158
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:09,823
I'll call my husband

159
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:12,639
Or you can have it ring an alarm on your phone

160
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:15,711
Which is nice if you're looking for your phone and you have the same type

161
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:16,735
Yorkies or something

162
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:19,039
And you can also use it to

163
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:19,807
Take picture

164
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:25,695
Which I was playing with before the show where if I did a long press it would open up the camera on my phone and

165
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:31,071
I was wondering

166
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:31,839
Yes

167
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:32,607
It was great

168
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,911
Glamour Shots

169
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:35,935
Be quiet

170
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:36,959
Busted

171
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:40,031
This is not a wearable device this is something you might

172
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,823
Clip to something or stick to something

173
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,591
Kind of like

174
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,127
It's like a little keychain thing

175
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,663
Yeah I guess

176
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:51,807
Sure these little plastic covers so

177
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,087
My plastic covers came

178
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,111
Blue white

179
00:07:56,415 --> 00:08:01,279
Remind me of the Amazon Dash buttons only you have more control over obviously what

180
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:06,399
It can do if you want to hook it up with this pissed on that and also works as tracker and so on so

181
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:09,215
But the concept is is essential the same

182
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:10,751
Yes it is in

183
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,799
I kind of liked it because there

184
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:17,151
Really small and relatively inexpensive

185
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,175
Your home if you wanted

186
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:18,943
But

187
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:19,711
Here's the butt

188
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,991
I could not get it

189
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:23,551
Connect with my assistant

190
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:28,415
Account I verified it a whole bunch of times and even made recipes and if thinks it's verified but

191
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:32,511
Keystone doesn't so none of my if this and that recipes

192
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,279
It's work yet

193
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,839
So I'm kind of sad cuz I'm

194
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:38,655
I think it'd be kind of fun to have on my keychain

195
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:44,543
So I never lose my keys but then I'm also able to

196
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,823
Close at my house routine

197
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:49,151
Or if you're if you're cold

198
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:52,479
Just a one touch press and boom on your nest thermostat

199
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,575
I have is true it is limited

200
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,599
Information

201
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,695
Picture of a whole bunch of buttons

202
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:04,511
Buttons everywhere

203
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:11,935
It looks like I have some additional sensors in there because I'm seeing you can get notifications not just based on the Bluetooth range but also

204
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,215
Temperature in motion

205
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:21,919
So like like an example they're using you put in your car and maybe you want to know how warm it is in your

206
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:22,687
Your car

207
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:26,015
The baby want to remotely open the windows or something to cool it off I don't know but

208
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:29,855
You can put it somewhere and get notifications based on temperature in motion

209
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,183
There you go

210
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,719
I like this

211
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:38,303
Doing a press and hold to share your GPS location with someone

212
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:39,583
Since it's on your

213
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,935
You could actually have the one in your keyring

214
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,727
You can program the

215
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,775
Button press to be like

216
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,055
This is where I am

217
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,847
And you can only send it to one person

218
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,639
Right now where you at

219
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,015
550

220
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,295
So

221
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,575
You know

222
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,623
Yes no no no

223
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,391
Bakery

224
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,463
So that is

225
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:08,511
Sofar impression

226
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,791
Applebee's

227
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,327
End

228
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,095
Have been

229
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:19,263
I have a man that's because I don't think this happened till after the last

230
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,287
Show son

231
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,567
Disgusted but

232
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:26,687
Google onhub just got if this then that support a few days ago

233
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:30,527
Which is good news so basically anytime you

234
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:33,087
Connect a device to your onhub router

235
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:36,159
You could fire something off through if this then that

236
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,695
I will say this

237
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:43,583
Tried it a couple times once on Sundays over the weekend and then again just before the show

238
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:46,143
And I'm not sure where the issue is but it's

239
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,703
Not working a hundred percent for me and

240
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:53,823
I will keep digging to see what the issue is cuz it could be at any number things could be Beyond hub

241
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,663
Cashing what devices are still connected versus Western what isn't

242
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:01,247
It could be as I've set it up to use the wrong device who knows

243
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:04,063
But I thought hey this would be great when I come home

244
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:06,879
Nighttime can I use this as a proximity to

245
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:09,951
I get home I'm still in the driveway driving into the garage

246
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:12,511
But my phone will connect to the onhub so why not

247
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:16,607
Use if this then that that says hey if my phone connects to the onhub then

248
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,655
Runaway shortcut that turns on a light

249
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:23,519
Interior that sounds good I tried about four or five times and it's really only work one time

250
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,055
And it was

251
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,335
Very delayed

252
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:28,639
Is at least 30 seconds till 8 so I

253
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:30,175
Yeah that's

254
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:30,943
Surprise

255
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,223
Yeah

256
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:37,343
So I keep looking behind here we try to just before the show and I keep expecting the light to turn on 30 minutes later

257
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:40,159
The good news is there's if it's the nest

258
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:42,463
Support and it could be something maybe with

259
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,487
In a wink

260
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:45,023
Could be like I said with the onhub

261
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,047
Table

262
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:51,423
Could be me I don't know but it's not quite working well enough for me yet so I'm going to continue to play with

263
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,727
All right I should also bring up

264
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:56,031
Because this happened after we recorded our last show.

265
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,335
This

266
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,615
Is a big project

267
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:01,919
Did you see the guy who hacked

268
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,455
Tesla with the Amazon

269
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:08,063
I did not exist it would be starting with the echo

270
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,599
Even better

271
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:13,951
Actually connected his Tesla

272
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,743
To the echo

273
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,303
He

274
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,839
Is Tesla

275
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,631
Leave the garage

276
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:23,167
Ice Christian Park itself

277
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,287
So

278
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:32,639
This was actually a really neat video and I had a bunch of people send it to me like

279
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,991
What does

280
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:40,063
She who shall not be named

281
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:43,903
The keyword

282
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,183
What was the name of the car in Knight Rider

283
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,143
What's the resulting event

284
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,959
And

285
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:57,727
2

286
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,775
Connect to his Tesla

287
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:03,103
Echo Dot

288
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,663
10 called an unofficial Tesla API

289
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:06,943
Trigger the car.

290
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:07,711
Take action

291
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,759
So what it is

292
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:10,527
In the car

293
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:12,063
It open the car

294
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:12,831
His homeland

295
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,367
Tesla

296
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:19,999
Automatically open your garage

297
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,535
Summon commands that is on the

298
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:22,559
Trustable

299
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:23,839
Work on the Newark

300
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:25,375
Roku

301
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:31,007
It is a very cool hack

302
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:38,431
Yeah not for the faint-of-heart obviously if you're going to want to be a developer to really take advantage of this but

303
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,479
Also kind of scary

304
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,271
I think it shows a lot of promise

305
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,551
Although if you

306
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,831
If you imagine walking by the

307
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:45,599
Disguise house

308
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,367
You're like

309
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:50,207
Yeah

310
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,999
Chicago come pick you up

311
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,023
You like nice

312
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,303
I like that you remember to open

313
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,071
Garage door

314
00:13:56,351 --> 00:14:00,447
It's all in the flow you know he probably flow chart of the whole thing out

315
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:02,239
Garage door open yes no

316
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:05,055
Which brings up a good point

317
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:08,127
When you were programming things for the connected home

318
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:14,271
More complicated

319
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,295
But let you get

320
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:18,879
Really complicated and even things like wink will let you build these robots

321
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:21,183
Have several actions taken

322
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:24,511
Place it's actually worthwhile to think before you actually

323
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,791
Program

324
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:28,095
Clean the stuff out because

325
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:30,399
Not historically done that and I found myself

326
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,423
Encountering things

327
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,215
Retrospect

328
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,751
I probably should have thought about

329
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:35,775
Yeah

330
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,055
So all right

331
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,335
Back to

332
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,359
Things

333
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,175
About things that don't work well

334
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:44,735
Survivor still on things

335
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,015
Which one would you like to have

336
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:49,087
Oh let's go with SmartThings

337
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:52,671
It's another show another week and where

338
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:53,951
Talking about

339
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:58,303
In fairness anywhere not making it up it's not like we're sitting here

340
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:08,031
We're not making this stuff up I mean this is news that is being reported and and we're sharing it and sharing our opinions on it so

341
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:11,103
I don't want people to think all these guys just bashed

342
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,639
It's not our fault if

343
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:14,175
Things keep happening in this

344
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,967
Most handsome

345
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:17,247
Some proof of concept

346
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,527
Exploit

347
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:20,831
Is letting hackers basically

348
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,623
Packing your house through SmartThings

349
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,159
Yes and

350
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:26,975
Basically the gist of it is

351
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:30,559
That because SmartThings has a developer program

352
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:32,607
And has to approve apps

353
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,655
You could sneak a nap in that

354
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,959
Police malicious code

355
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:42,079
SmartThings is at

356
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:45,151
But this hasn't resulted in any problems for our users

357
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,199
So where we're at

358
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,223
Working on this

359
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:50,783
So

360
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:54,111
In this actually ties into something else

361
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,647
Which was that it has

362
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,695
Hired a director of engineering

363
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:58,975
Amazon

364
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:04,095
So in part of what they were talking about in this with this hiring

365
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,655
Is Robert Parker

366
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:13,055
In an interview that Parker did with the Verge he talked about actually establishing

367
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:15,103
Guard rails is was his term for it

368
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,383
In SmartThings

369
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:18,943
Improve the user experience

370
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,479
What is part of that

371
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:23,295
I think what we'll see is also ways that

372
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:26,623
You wouldn't have quite as much openness around as being able to

373
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:27,647
Deposit

374
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:31,999
Rich in the good news here is at the basis of this

375
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:32,767
Exploit

376
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,095
Really has to do with the Privileges that the smart app

377
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,375
Smartthing apps

378
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:38,655
Are given

379
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:40,191
This is something Samsung

380
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,215
Fix I mean

381
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:44,287
Take a look at the ARs Technica story that

382
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:47,615
55% of the 499 smart apps available during

383
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,383
The research

384
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,175
Call fighting over privileged

385
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:53,759
So you got to violating a core security tenant notice Pekingese

386
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:58,623
Privilege principle developers may not even be aware that their SmartThings apps

387
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:00,415
Have too much privilege

388
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:03,487
You know it's not like the developers are creating this stuff to do

389
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:08,351
Malicious things problem is I guess in the SDK or whatever

390
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,911
To ask just have too much power

391
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:11,679
So to speak

392
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:14,751
It's like when you don't give your teens a curfew

393
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:18,591
And you just let them run amok

394
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,359
Yeah

395
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,639
Over-privileged

396
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:22,943
Going out at 3 a.m. nothing

397
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:23,967
What happened to you

398
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,135
That's basically what this is about

399
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:36,767
Alex Hawkinson on the show to talk about this

400
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:37,535
Because

401
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,583
They had so many issues lately

402
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,119
I know that

403
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:47,263
They're really trying hard what they're trying to do in terms of being super open

404
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,799
To challenge I agree

405
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,359
We hopefully will hear back

406
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:55,711
SmartThings

407
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,503
Met Gala

408
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,039
Onhub

409
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:03,135
We should probably talk really fast because we've got some corporate news

410
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,159
In the acquisition

411
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:10,815
So Microsoft acquired an Italian company called Solaire

412
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:14,143
I'm assuming that's how you call it it's Solair

413
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:17,983
Is it's about 5 years old

414
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:21,055
Which is provided

415
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,871
Device management

416
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:26,943
Device lifecycle management kind of stuff in the cloud

417
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:33,343
It really struck me that Microsoft with its Azure iot platform is going to go up real heavily against

418
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,367
PTC

419
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:37,695
Which I don't know if you guys remember

420
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:38,719
And

421
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:40,255
A rant

422
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:41,535
So

423
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,071
The idea is

424
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:45,375
Manufacturer

425
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:46,655
And

426
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,471
Say hey

427
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:53,567
Handle all the connectivity side of it and then

428
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:54,847
That's kind of

429
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,127
Adoption center

430
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,919
This company I mean they're not

431
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:04,319
I did not hear them prior to but I do see that they've work with the Italian espresso machine manufacturer rent Zillow

432
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,855
That's correct

433
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:08,927
And also a food processing Machine Company Minerva

434
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:10,207
Make a group so

435
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:13,535
I said PTC acquired

436
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:14,559
A ranch

437
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:15,839
Which is wrong

438
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:17,631
Acquired

439
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:21,215
Stacy you're over privileged

440
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:22,495
I'm over privileged

441
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:25,311
As I was saying and I was like wait a second that's not right

442
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:27,359
All right PTC acquired

443
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:30,687
That was back at the end of 2014

444
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:32,479
It provides Cloud platform for

445
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:37,343
So as yours actually going up against these guys

446
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:39,391
Which is kind of cool

447
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,671
Different model

448
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:42,207
Really focusing on both

449
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,231
Truant

450
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:45,023
Industrial

451
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,303
Enterprise

452
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,327
Enterprise

453
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:52,959
So there's that

454
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:53,983
Power

455
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,007
Which

456
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:55,775
Power

457
00:19:56,031 --> 00:20:00,383
Used to provide energy management software for utilities and they kind of have been

458
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:02,431
How to say pivoting

459
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:06,527
Because I haven't done a full pivot but they kind of switch there

460
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:07,807
Way of being

461
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:12,159
They started out with kind of demand response and now they're trying

462
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:12,927
Provide light

463
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:14,975
Data services

464
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:17,279
Boston this week

465
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,583
For 532 million

466
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:20,863
So

467
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,399
Great deal

468
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,679
And

469
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:27,263
You can see this working for the Internet of Things

470
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:30,335
The vertical Focus that a lot of the big companies that

471
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,359
I need to get

472
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:32,127
So

473
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,407
We should look for

474
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,711
Demtech wire specific expert

475
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,735
Batis in like

476
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:39,039
Manufacturing the internet

477
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:40,319
Utilities

478
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:42,623
Maybe medical devices in healthcare

479
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:45,183
So that was kind of my quit take from there

480
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:51,071
Now I will say

481
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:55,679
The oracles offer was half of our powers IPO price in 2014 so

482
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:57,215
This was not like

483
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:58,751
Possibly the best outcome

484
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,287
I think it was

485
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,567
Still at a premium

486
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:03,871
30% of the stock at the time

487
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:05,151
Escalate the deal

488
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:10,271
So

489
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:13,855
If I don't talk about is

490
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:14,879
Google

491
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:16,928
And the return of Rick

492
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,208
Rick osterloh

493
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:19,488
Osterloh yes

494
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:26,144
What a great guy in my standard disclosure being that I can I work for Google I don't know anyting

495
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:27,936
About this other than what's been reported

496
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,472
Just to be clear

497
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:31,520
But I do know Rick osterloh

498
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:32,544
Great guy

499
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,568
Ahi

500
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:37,152
Ran Motorola for quite a while the device is over there

501
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,432
And

502
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:43,040
When Motorola went to from Google to Lenovo he went along for the ride

503
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:49,440
And according to recode and it says it was it's been confirmed by Google spokesperson I don't know who that was

504
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,208
Whatever but

505
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:51,744
He's coming back

506
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,536
And whooping charges like

507
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:54,816
Everything

508
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:57,632
Consumer Hardware e44 Google

509
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:00,960
Yeah so some of the new divisions according to recodar

510
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:02,752
Connexus

511
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:03,520
Tablets

512
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:04,288
Chromecast

513
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:09,152
Consumer Hardware which includes Chromebook laptops and the new pixel C devices

514
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,432
Onhub

515
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:13,248
8 app

516
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:15,552
Which is the advanced technology

517
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,952
Yes and that's what good thing did the I forget what it stands for 2 but they did the modular

518
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:26,304
. they do some really cool stuff

519
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,072
Absolutely

520
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:27,840
And

521
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,120
Actually lost

522
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:29,888
The head of that

523
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:31,936
Facebook

524
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:34,496
Regina Dugan

525
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:37,056
Advanced technology and projects

526
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:46,784
That division was one of the very few that

527
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,320
Google did not sell

528
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:51,904
Telenovela when Motorola was Villanova

529
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:52,928
And there's

530
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:53,696
Class

531
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:54,464
Which

532
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,000
We must all remember from

533
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:57,792
2014

534
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,584
Glass

535
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:04,704
It might have been 13 but the 14-year that sounds about right somewhere in there

536
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:10,080
Was given charge that's the CEO of nest

537
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:14,176
Was given charge of glass but

538
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:18,016
Apparently now it is he staying on his

539
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:21,344
This is not going to be

540
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:26,720
So we can take a lot of things from this

541
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:30,048
Just so Kevin doesn't feel uncomfortable I'll just start

542
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:30,816
Taking things

543
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:33,120
Which is

544
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,192
This is what a slap in the face for

545
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:36,960
Tony fadell

546
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:38,240
Because

547
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:41,056
They were the consumer Hardware

548
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:41,824
Definition

549
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,872
For Google in a lot of ways

550
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:45,152
And it sounds like

551
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,176
Google is

552
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:48,992
Limiting his fiefdom tremendously to

553
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,528
Possibly what they

554
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:51,296
They have

555
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:53,088
Seen elsewhere that like

556
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:54,368
Some of the

557
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:57,184
Reported projects such as Google's

558
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:59,744
Echo like device and

559
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,304
Other stuff that's developing

560
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,864
For the smart home might come under

561
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:06,656
This is well so

562
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:11,776
That's good because Australia was a good guy

563
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:13,312
It's bad for desk

564
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:17,408
Antenna makes me wonder how long that's going to be like what happens with that

565
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,176
Going down the road

566
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:20,736
Yeah well I will say this I mean

567
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:23,296
I guess you could say that Tony fadell was

568
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:26,368
Like the face of consumer Hardware but really

569
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:30,208
He had nothing to do with the Nexus program Chromecast

570
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:31,232
Chromebook

571
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,768
Tablets

572
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,048
And all that so

573
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:37,888
I wouldn't want to overstate what he had he had

574
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,424
The Nest group in

575
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:40,704
Glasses

576
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,984
Apparently so

577
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,032
Well there we go

578
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:44,800
Kevin doesn't

579
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:49,408
Retro

580
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:51,456
I'll be alone

581
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,552
I'm alright well I think that's pretty much it

582
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,320
Podcast

583
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:57,856
I will say that our guest

584
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:58,624
Coming up

585
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,160
Is Pike whites

586
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,976
Who is the head of openhab

587
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:07,072
I'm pretty sure that's an open source

588
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:09,376
Home automation can a software code

589
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:15,776
And we'll talk about what you can do with it why it exists and what happens when

590
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:17,824
Companies don't want to share their API how

591
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,408
Stay tuned

592
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:22,176
It's going to be fun

593
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:28,832

599
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:00,576
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast

600
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:02,624
This is your host Stacey Higginbotham

601
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,208
And today's guest is Kai quite sure who is the founder of

602
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:06,976
Open house

603
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:09,024
Hi how are you doing today

604
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,840
Fine thanks how about you

605
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:15,168
I am super well so it is late at night where you are

606
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,704
Or later at night

607
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:20,544
So I appreciate you doing this show let's first get into

608
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,824
What is openhab

609
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:26,944
Because a lot of the project people might know about it I doubt like the regular users do

610
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:30,784
Open up is an open source software

611
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,552
4

612
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:32,320
Smart Home

613
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,344
Butt smelly

614
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,880
Target Salinas

615
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:38,464
DIY user so text every people

616
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,256
Who want to integrate

617
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,024
A lot of things

618
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:47,680
Alright so I will tell you guys that open have is even a little dirtier than than I am comfortable with

619
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:48,448
Because

620
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:52,544
What is basically is as you can put this on a Raspberry Pi

621
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:53,568
Or

622
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:57,152
We were talking about a couple shows ago on the pine64

623
00:26:57,664 --> 00:27:03,296
And it's cool because in the reason cuz on the show is because this is a completely different model for building

624
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,576
Alta connected home

625
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:05,344
Which is

626
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:06,880
YouTube

627
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,672
In the open have guys

628
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:10,976
Their whole effort is around

629
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:14,560
Truly creating an open kind of home automation platform

630
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:20,960
Walk me through how we got to this place and why you thought the world needed open now

631
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:27,872
All started about six years ago when they started

632
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:31,456
Build a house on my own or for my family

633
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:39,392
I was really interested in automating stuff for already since childhood to answer for me

634
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:42,464
I have to build a house from scratch because I can put

635
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,256
Cables anywhere I like

636
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:45,536
And start really

637
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:47,328
Put in

638
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:51,424
Switchable lights are shutters or Energy Systems

639
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:56,288
A lot of Hardware was in there but I was somehow liking

640
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:57,312
Good software

641
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:58,848
And some

642
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:03,712
The problem for me was that I wanted to try some software where I can

643
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:04,480
Shorts

644
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:06,016
Future proof that I can

645
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:08,576
Extended even in the few decades

646
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:09,344
It's from now

647
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:13,184
And so for me it was pretty clear that's it

648
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:18,560
Must not depend on single vendor and their system at the business strategy

649
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:21,376
But that I'm really free

650
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:24,448
And open to Extended or four

651
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:25,472
Whatever comes up

652
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:27,264
Okay

653
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,080
And so you guys have built this

654
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:32,384
To make this work with any device out there

655
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:35,200
You guys just need access to

656
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:37,504
To an SDK or an API

657
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:38,784
How does that work

658
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:45,952
Yeah so it's pretty open up is running on the home Gateway as he said on a Raspberry Pi or some more

659
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:46,720
Capable of

660
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:47,488
Computer

661
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:54,400
And the integration are to the end devices Astin in whatever radio

662
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:55,936
And devices so quiet

663
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:56,704
Success

664
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,824
So there are f****** in many of the violence protocols like seawave CT

665
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:08,224
An ocean and others so are you having a USB dongle and so are you then integrate that's at school.

666
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,296
This supposed to call other devices have four

667
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,160
Normal ethernet to WiFi connection

668
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:18,208
And so they might have

669
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:20,256
Maybe I'll

670
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:21,536
Barry Austin.

671
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:23,072
Criteria API

672
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:24,096
Truck side steps

673
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:30,752
Answer for the mothers you might also have to go to school reverse engineering is he report call or whatever

674
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:34,592
In order to be able to communicate with these devices

675
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:38,944
Okay see you lost like half the people right now and it's a pretty tech-savvy Adi

676
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,224
But still I think they're like

677
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,272
Reverse engineering

678
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:43,808
The others are like yes

679
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:45,856
But

680
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:47,392
Commercially

681
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:48,160
Is this

682
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:54,560
Reasonable I mean or is what I mean is it going to break down that the smart home is really going to be only open in future

683
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:57,120
Approved for people who are able to you know

684
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:59,936
Reverse-engineer the data flow from their device

685
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,520
I think it's really the best

686
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:05,568
Best option for the Texans

687
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:07,360
People

688
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:12,736
It is so Technical and she or you have to know little bit what about you doing there

689
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:18,112
So it's nothing that you that you buy off the shelf and it's simply DirecTV

690
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:21,952
The good thing there is that this openness and

691
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:24,768
Freedom and Independence Aralia

692
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:25,792
Gives you

693
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:27,328
The chance to

694
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:31,680
App to be open in all the directions so as soon as you

695
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,520
Do a commercial product out of that Co

696
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:37,312
Getting into some

697
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:39,872
Business Direction than where you might

698
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:44,480
Disable okay maybe I only want to partner with that company but not ready

699
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:45,504
Competitor

700
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:47,040
And you're

701
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:53,696
Automatically getting not as open as you would be if you're really completely free of any commercial

702
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:54,464
Pinterest

703
00:30:55,232 --> 00:31:01,376
And so I think that's really one of the year the major strong points of her open her up and

704
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:05,472
Something that I really want to keep like that for the future

705
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:06,496
But what about

706
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:07,520
Usability

707
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:09,824
Because I think I feel like that

708
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,104
Is

709
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,176
Not just about like business practices which it can be

710
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:18,784
There's nothing better than building your own and making your own thing work for you

711
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,344
To avoid somebody clutching her data or

712
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:22,368
Or pers

713
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,416
What about

714
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:26,464
Figuring out how to do something

715
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:29,792
And then keeping it is open as possible like

716
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:32,352
Have you found companies that are doing

717
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:35,424
Dissonant in a good user friendly format or

718
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:40,032
Yeah I wouldn't say that's open app is not user-friendly

719
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:46,432
Looking into that direction as well so there are a lot of new functionality is currently

720
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:47,456
Isn't there

721
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:53,600
That's like something to do or to Discovery so it's automatically scanning your network is checking what

722
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:57,696
Are USB sticks or you might have been there answer really

723
00:31:57,952 --> 00:32:00,768
Discovered the devices that you have in place and

724
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,048
Make it

725
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:03,072
Very easy

726
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:04,864
Uber user interface to

727
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,400
Set up all your stuff

728
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:07,168
All together

729
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,216
So I think we're we're

730
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:10,240
Havoline

731
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,008
Increasing

732
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:12,800
The target audience their butt

733
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:14,848
At the same time

734
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:16,896
This is also the year the tricky part

735
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:18,432
Because as soon as you are

736
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:20,480
Making it more user-friendly

737
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:24,064
You also have four more people who

738
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,136
Can't help themselves if they come across problems

739
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:34,048
And so the more support you actually have to do on your standards or

740
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:35,328
You was a spatula

741
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,400
Not develop a sense, can look into things

742
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:43,520
Some how are you you have to balance or your time on such an open source project

743
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:44,288
How much

744
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:47,360
Sporty want to do for community members that

745
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:48,640
Joy uses

746
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:55,296
And how much time do we actually invest in after other are evolving the project answer pregnant for

747
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,624
And that's definitely something we're

748
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,160
Non-commercial project

749
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:02,976
Has its limits because

750
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:05,024
Then the time is Maria

751
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:07,072
Sky sunset

752
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:08,608
Jump the people

753
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:11,168
Working on it so I usually doing it for

754
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:13,984
The only use Kaiser so down

755
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:16,288
Happy as soon as it works for them

756
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:20,896
Is there any possibility that we could see this project go commercial

757
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:21,920
And have

758
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:25,504
Actual real best support or maybe more robust support

759
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:27,296
As for me

760
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:28,832
One of the strong process

761
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:29,600
That it's

762
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:31,904
Not, to the projects

763
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:32,672
Excel

764
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:33,952
But I'm currently

765
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:39,072
Doing this to create an organization actually a non-for-profit organization

766
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:39,840
Surrounded

767
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:41,632
Where it's at

768
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:46,240
Easier to organize people around that and maybe also then

769
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:48,032
Companies who actually

770
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:50,848
Do open hop installations for living

771
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:52,640
Capital of Turkey

772
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:54,176
Commercial companies out there

773
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:55,456
That's

774
00:33:55,712 --> 00:34:01,856
I like open up so much that they recommended it to their friends and they are the immortalists.

775
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:03,392
Getting into

776
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:07,744
Business All-Star installing that and supporting it says that a job

777
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:12,096
And I think that says definitely a Direction Where We could build a kind of

778
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:13,888
Marketplace odoo network

779
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,704
For Professional Services

780
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:23,616
Person that puts us right back into like the x10 or proprietary kind of system days for the end-user because

781
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:26,176
Cuz you're still going to be at this place for like

782
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:31,296
4 light bulbs in daylight savings time

783
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:33,600
My program mysidia program

784
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,648
Wework Miami

785
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:36,416
My interest

786
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:40,768
I think the big difference is that it is mainly about

787
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:42,816
Consultancy Institute

788
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:44,096
Teach people body

789
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:46,912
As possible what can they do answer to

790
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:50,240
Besides OK what might be the best to devices

791
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:52,032
Stubai how to set them up and

792
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:58,688
If you consider or smart home technology is not only the consumer electronic parts but really also the

793
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:00,224
Classical home automation

794
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:04,576
You have to deal with heating systems and

795
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:06,880
Shutters

796
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:08,160
Docker automated

797
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:12,512
There's actually no way around having your electrician involved in that

798
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:15,328
Usually only for the initial setup

799
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:17,888
All the programming or

800
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:20,960
Let's not call it programming course that's too technical

801
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:27,360
But some lady automation Oklahoma cancer detection customisation

802
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:29,408
That can be done by the end she was herself

803
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,432
Got it

804
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:31,712
With this project

805
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:37,344
What are people doing with it that's neat cuz we got a lot of people who've asked us to talk more about

806
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,648
How to use in cool stuff that

807
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,440
People dance I'd love to hear

808
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:44,256
What's some of the people using open have have used it

809
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:49,376
I see many people doing a lots of energy

810
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:55,520
Efficiencies so they have for example solar panels that the heating systems and they they really optimize

811
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:57,312
This together

812
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:58,336
With

813
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:01,664
You was doing the

814
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,016
That might be interesting for you with the Tesla integration so they have actually

815
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:08,320
Electric vehicle charging stations

816
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:12,160
Directly talking to open Harper and Syrah

817
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:14,208
Holding 2 tesladin also

818
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,488
For the

819
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:17,792
Charging of the battery until alarm

820
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:19,072
Thanks all you can eat

821
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:21,888
Honk the horn if you like her to open up

822
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,936
I can honk the horn to the app

823
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:25,984
So in that situation

824
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,312
Tamir rice

825
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:33,664
You're right I can't I don't have the horn honking like

826
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,712
It would be kind of fun to have the horn honk

827
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:40,576
Extended security system

828
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:42,880
Someone someone breaks into my house

829
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:43,904
The garage that.

830
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:44,672
Tesla hangzhou

831
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:46,976
In that situation

832
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:53,376
Let's break it down for people I would need to hook my Tesla up to my home security system using open

833
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:56,192
Have I would need something running openhab

834
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:57,984
I would also need

835
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:02,080
The Folsom software that lets it talk to my Tesla do I need to have

836
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:04,896
Openhab the software running on my Tesla software

837
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:06,176
No sew

838
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,200
Open up itself

839
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:09,248
Comes with so-called binding

840
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:12,064
Set the bindings out then doing the integration to the

841
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,392
Different systems and testosterall

842
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:22,048
You would need us to install the Tesla binding on the open up so on the plants before for example

843
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,352
And this will

844
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:28,448
In the case of the Tesla or go to the Tesla cloud service

845
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,032
And connect to their so that's no local integration

846
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:34,080
That's about sums integration

847
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:34,848
Got it

848
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:37,664
And how would it work on a local immigration looks so

849
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,224
I'm trying to think of any of the local stuff I have

850
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:42,528
I'm totally failing since

851
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,576
Most things are actually not

852
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:46,112
They're mostly in the cloud

853
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:47,648
But how would that look

854
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,696
If I had an IP camera that was served

855
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:50,464
For my house

856
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:54,304
The local integration is the

857
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,584
Most important

858
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,400
Future open up in that respect because some

859
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:01,216
Only if you're having local integration

860
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:04,288
You can be pretty sure that your other independent

861
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:05,056
Of things

862
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:07,872
Just seen the case with the

863
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:20,672
Exactly the scenario that we want to avoid but open house sober ever possible

864
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:22,464
It should be local integration

865
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,000
Yes that's Farm

866
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:25,536
Most devices actually

867
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:27,072
Available seoul

868
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:28,096
All the stuff

869
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:31,168
It's installed locally you hook it up to your Wi-Fi

870
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:35,776
Stuff like Phillips you would like a Sonos speakers like

871
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:37,312
Lifx bulb

872
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:38,592
Bike

873
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:40,896
Logitech Harmony Harbor and saw

874
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:43,968
All these things are local and they have

875
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:45,248
Some kind of API

876
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:52,928
That was a much nicer because they are turkey discoverable for UPnP you to go to call

877
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:54,208
And

878
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:56,256
Really make sense

879
00:38:56,512 --> 00:39:00,096
Possible to travel very reliable setopati together

880
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:02,656
What about security because

881
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:05,472
I'm trying and I'm thinking like as a user

882
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:06,496
SA

883
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:07,520
Less than

884
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:09,056
Technically Savvy user

885
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:10,848
If I build myself

886
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:12,128
The openhab

887
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,688
I'm going to be like yeah I'm so amazing

888
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:21,088
And I'm going to hook it up today that was awesome and I'm going to leave it alone for the rest of the bike Until It Breaks right

889
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:25,696
So how do you handle things like changing security protocols

890
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:30,560
I'm hacks fit univ older abilities that may get reported afterwards in need

891
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:31,328
Updates

892
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,144
How do you communicate that to users because that's

893
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:36,704
It doesn't feel like that would be part of your core function is

894
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,728
It's kind of a bunch of hobbies

895
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:42,592
Yeah well if they are willing to work with Latisse All Rights

896
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:48,224
Definitely fixed in the in the cold but we don't have an automatic update management

897
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,064
Inform people who have set up an instance

898
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:54,624
But they need to update

899
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:59,744
So that's definitely currently up with the users to make sure that they

900
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,328
Do regular crate so it is possible to just say

901
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:09,728
You have an older installation until you get the latest version without losing all your data and just set up

902
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,544
So that's something to be perfectly possible

903
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:16,128
Got it so where are we in the evolution of the Smart Home

904
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:17,664
Where we come where we going

905
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:19,200
In your your opinion

906
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,528
Smart home Technologies believe

907
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,064
Pretty old soul

908
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:30,464
I know it since at least two tickets I think we are still in a very early face

909
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,744
On the market

910
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:36,864
So I see you the the the marketing people saying since about

911
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,144
5 years at least.

912
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:38,912
Now

913
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:39,936
The big breakthrough

914
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:41,472
But some

915
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:43,520
If I look at

916
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:44,800
Their house

917
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:46,080
Easily breakable

918
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:48,128
Pink Salon Tower

919
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,224
Difficult it is for Relief beginners to learn to get started

920
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:52,992
Stuff

921
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:54,272
I think it will

922
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:55,808
Take a while

923
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:56,832
And some

924
00:40:57,088 --> 00:41:01,440
I'm not saying that's the soccer part of the problem

925
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:02,720
Still

926
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:06,560
On the on the starting point of having really

927
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:09,888
Reliable protocol is Reliable Hardware

928
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:11,680
And saw

929
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:12,704
Thanks for the

930
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,240
Break too easily and

931
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:16,544
Communication is not not stable enough

932
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,568
And stuff like that

933
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,872
So that's pretty as to

934
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:20,640
Become

935
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:22,176
Better over the next year's

936
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:24,480
Software perspectives

937
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:30,880
I also think that there's a lot of hype around artificial intelligence and sore having smart home being

938
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:37,280
Your assistant at home that's a really knows what you want the traffic looks on Blue come out

939
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,072
El mencho favorite music playing

940
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:42,144
I really don't believe in that so becoming

941
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,936
True

942
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:45,472
Anytime soon

943
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,008
Because

944
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:51,872
It's really you need to laugh so much contextual information in order to

945
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:54,943
Levi's decision says an automated system

946
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:55,711
That's

947
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:58,271
All the possible sensors that

948
00:41:58,527 --> 00:42:00,831
We haven't play snow already know.

949
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:02,879
Not enough to have that

950
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:10,047
Get the mood of somebody to get the whole circumstances in which something is happening

951
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:11,327
To troll the right

952
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:12,351
Cancel.

953
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:15,167
And I wasn't completely sure for you really

954
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:20,287
Wants to go the way to Atmore Center Center stop

955
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:21,823
Tool to make that contact

956
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:26,687
Available to the machines because that's then again also privacy issue

957
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:29,247
Assurance people might not feel

958
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:30,271
Compatible

959
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:35,135
So you might snow the analogy about The Uncanny Valley

960
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:40,255
And so I think this very much applies to artificial intelligence in the

961
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:45,887
Smart home as well for the listeners who are not familiar with that

962
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:48,191
20 minutes.

963
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:50,751
Or robots on automatic system

964
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:53,823
Fusible rear sensor

965
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:57,407
People are not compatible with that

966
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:59,455
As long as it's not perfect

967
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:01,503
I was at the actors in The Polar

968
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:03,039
Express they were just sold

969
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:04,575
Freaky Deadeye lookin

970
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:08,159
Dividers

971
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:13,023
3D version of The Polar Express from a couple years back that is The Uncanny Valley

972
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:15,071
Applied to your favorite Christmas book

973
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:16,863
I like this

974
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:17,631
So then what

975
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:19,167
Reasonably should we expect

976
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:19,935
I mean

977
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:24,031
Most people when they automate their homes if they're buying into this they're like

978
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:30,431
I want all this to happen right that's what they're kind of working towards both as an industry and even consumers is

979
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:31,711
What kind of work being sold

980
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:32,991
So

981
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:35,039
What do you think is a more realistic

982
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:36,319
Vision to sell consume

983
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:42,463
I think as long as the artificial intelligence that's just said wherever notes on the

984
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:43,487
Trophic level

985
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:47,839
You really have to go into programming and somebody else the only

986
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:50,911
Signal that I see there is

987
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:52,447
That you you make it

988
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:53,727
Easy to have

989
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:56,287
Complex logic setup for the user

990
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:59,615
So one day we were trying to drive that in

991
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:06,015
Open Office to a sable you have automation who was which is a piece of a logic that's execute

992
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:07,295
Butts

993
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:08,063
The

994
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:11,391
Normal user itself doesn't have to implement its butt

995
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:12,671
Can be a developer

996
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:13,951
Repair phone that

997
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:17,535
And the usertrust to configure SATA and

998
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:20,607
Customizes it's for his own purposes

999
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:25,727
So you can think of that a little bit like the Apes this man that approached

1000
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:29,055
Where you have to use recipes with

1001
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:32,127
So you hate that's a you case you want to use it at your

1002
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:33,663
Creating this recipe

1003
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:36,479
Using an X configuring it to your own

1004
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:38,271
Set up

1005
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:40,063
That's really what what is the

1006
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:42,623
Most realistic way forward for the MoMA

1007
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:47,231
And that's something you guys are implementing so in does that look like

1008
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:51,327
You can do or it's automatically

1009
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:52,095
Populated

1010
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:58,751
The smallest a dream but definitely the interaction we're heading there so we're

1011
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:01,823
Implemented the new rule engine that is

1012
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:06,943
Capable off for having sex and play this week all that stuff all the rules

1013
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:13,599
And strive for a user interface where I can easily instantiate the stuff

1014
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:14,879
For coming on the show today

1015
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:21,535
I cannot wait to try this out and if I if I actually do this

1016
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:24,095
Which I feel it will be very empowering

1017
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:24,863
40

1018
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:25,631
And Kevin will laugh

1019
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:28,959
I wish you much on offense

1020
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:30,751
Thanks for having me on the show

1021
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:31,775
Thank you for coming

1022
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:41,247
Well that's it for this week's show thanks for listening and we'll see you back next week
