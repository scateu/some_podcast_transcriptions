00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:12,032
Hey everyone welcome to the Internet of Things podcast

2
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:13,824
I am your host Stacey Higginbotham

3
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:16,384
Kevin tofel

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,944
And we have an awesome show.

5
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:20,992
Addendums on Google Assistant support

6
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:25,344
Amazon Echo says we're going to talk about tensorflow Lite

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,624
For those AI folks

8
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:28,416
We've got wink

9
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:29,184
Lookout

10
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:29,952
Impression

11
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:33,024
Plus I bought a $20 camera

12
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,560
And we got some news about

13
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:35,328
Blocks

14
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:36,096
SmartThings

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,192
Or we'll have a message from our sponsor sparkcognition.

16
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:42,240
Talking about how people can interact

17
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:43,008
With a i

18
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:44,544
Aunt

19
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,640
We've got our guest this week Michael Sherwood Who is the

20
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:52,480
Technology and Innovation director for the city of Las Vegas

21
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,064
We're talking about something really cool projects

22
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:57,600
So

23
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:58,368
All this

24
00:00:58,624 --> 00:00:59,136
And more

25
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:00,160
After message

26
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:01,952
From our sponsor

27
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:04,256

35
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:44,704
Okay

36
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,544
Kevin let's just get started with some quick news bits because there's lots of

37
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,568
Quick news bits to Happy

38
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,592
To go around

39
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,640
So Google Assistant

40
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:54,432
It finally got support

41
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:55,456
Ecobee

42
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,040
Speaking of Google Assistant

43
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:03,392
I got an email the other day from the desk crew I imagined many of you guys got

44
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:04,928
Jane basically that

45
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,208
Before the end of this month

46
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:07,744
I'm going to have to reconnect

47
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:08,768
My

48
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:10,048
Nest gear

49
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:12,096
To my Google Assistant

50
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:12,864
And

51
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:16,192
The reason for this is a little unclear but we have our suspicions

52
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:23,104
Yeah what message saying is that Google search voice actions and Google Now are essentially part of Google assist

53
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,408
Which therefore also Google home

54
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:31,808
So I guess this is a Google thing that's being changed innocence which is affecting us which is there for fighting all the nests

55
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:32,576
Customers

56
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,112
They're just pulling this

57
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:36,416
Part out of Google Now which

58
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:40,768
Seems very strange to me because you've always been able to tap the microphone icon on Google noun

59
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,304
Essentially like a sister

60
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:44,608
I guess you're kind of going away from that

61
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:47,680
Google Now

62
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:48,704
Cards

63
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,472
Yes

64
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:56,640
So it sounds to me like Google Now is becoming more of just a contextual card-based

65
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:58,432
Information-based system

66
00:02:58,944 --> 00:02:59,456
And

67
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,480
Assistant

68
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:02,016
Will take the place of the

69
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:06,368
Voice searches and controls and things like that

70
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,392
I'm seeing this happen

71
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,464
It's like they want to separate them

72
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:13,536
Make a very specific for different use cases

73
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,072
Also

74
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,376
While we're on this topic we should also mention

75
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,168
And I put this in my newsletter last week

76
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:20,704
And I

77
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:21,728
Kevin

78
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:25,056
Because it's my friend Michael Wolff over at the spoon

79
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:27,872
Notice that Google had applied for a patent

80
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:30,176
Four chimes

81
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:32,480
Unique Chimes that were specific to

82
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:34,528
People locations and events

83
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,856
And this seems right on par with the idea of using

84
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,136
Your home to notify

85
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:42,464
I might have my own purse

86
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,232
Personal chimes

87
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:44,256
Stacy

88
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:46,304
Oh my God get out the door right now

89
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:50,144
And that would sound like something where is my daughter might have a different time that says

90
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:51,424
I don't know

91
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,192
You should get up

92
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:57,056
I thought that was actually really interesting

93
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,080
And

94
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:01,152
Very on-point with actually getting rid of

95
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,200
The smartphone in your home

96
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,224
Which

97
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,016
Designer Carrie mine

98
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:06,784
India

99
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:13,184
No I agree it's actually ironically it's actually taking a feature from smartphones and moving it to the home because you

100
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:13,952
You can customize

101
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:17,536
Notifications and ringtones for different people are different types of alerts

102
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:22,143
But if you don't have your phone with you it doesn't really matter but if those kind of alerts come from a smart home

103
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:24,191
What are your in the home you have to carry the phone

104
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:24,959
That makes sense

105
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:25,983
Yeah

106
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,263
So I think that's

107
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,031
Really

108
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:28,799
Really cool

109
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:32,639
And it's worth talking about in the show because

110
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:34,943
How many of us have two Google assistants

111
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:38,527
Google homes are Google other devices in I like it

112
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:42,367
Yay it's just they filed for the patent they don't have the patent

113
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,183
Pet disclaimers

114
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,487
Check it out if you want

115
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:52,351
My little tiny Google mini it's actually smaller than I thought

116
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:55,423
So that's the first thing it's probably maybe

117
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,215
3 1/2 across

118
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:59,519
If that and it doesn't sound great

119
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:00,287
And

120
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:03,103
I find it very difficult to control using the Taps be

121
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,663
It's hard to orient on the device

122
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,199
My daughter is fascinate

123
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:11,039
The lights George that makes sense

124
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:15,647
So I think a question a lot of people would have I don't know if you can answer or not book

125
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:17,695
Sound quality and microphone

126
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:21,535
Pick up of your voice any better or worse than the echo Dot

127
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:22,559
I think it's

128
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:24,351
Probably the Mikes are better

129
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:26,911
The sound quality

130
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:27,935
Probably on

131
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:30,239
It's really

132
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,007
Quiet

133
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:33,823
I mean

134
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:38,687
That might do it I could I was listening actually the podcast in the kitchen on that thing

135
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:44,319
Write this is just me personally everybody has their own way of approaching us

136
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:50,975
When I think about what devices I want in my house from a voice assistance perspective I think about what do I do

137
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:52,511
I do in that room Dua

138
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:58,911
Need an input device with better Mike's or do I want a consumption device with better speakers and that's why I put the.

139
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:05,055
In places where they don't listen to music like on the nightstand for examples perfect and it's fine for listening to light music when you're

140
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:05,823
Fall asleep

141
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:12,223
But I. Where many would make sense in that use case for me so that's my Approach input sources that puts

142
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:15,295
I agree and I like it we put it down in the kitchen

143
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:18,111
Mostly because it is now our backup

144
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,903
Amazon so when

145
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:22,719
Meta Mages pumps on a question which happen

146
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:25,535
Where are you ever dinner now I can just be like

147
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:27,583
Sorry you guys

148
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,119
Haji

149
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,911
Okay done with Google

150
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,703
Not really we're going to come back to it

151
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:34,239
Other news

152
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,007
This works

153
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:38,079
About the Amazon Echo is now available in Canada

154
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,359
Yay

155
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,895
And India

156
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:44,735
It is exciting

157
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,271
This year in Canada radio

158
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:47,807
Well yes

159
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,599
And it reminds me

160
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:51,135
Report neighbors to the north

161
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:51,903
They get nothing

162
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,951
I feel really bad for them.

163
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:54,719
But they don't get

164
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,559
I hear you they speak English

165
00:06:59,071 --> 00:06:59,583
Something speak

166
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:04,191
Alright let's get back to Google see I lied to

167
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:08,543
I told you the truth cuz I think I said we're going to come back to it

168
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:09,567
Not

169
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,591
Associated with smart

170
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:13,151
They have their tensorflow

171
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,455
Will have chips they have

172
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:21,855
And they now have machine learning for embedded devices

173
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,391
Big trend

174
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,671
For next year so

175
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,439
Oak Avenue

176
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:29,535
Yasso tensorflow Lite is what they announced this week

177
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:35,935
It is a developer preview basically the lightweight version of tensorflow do they use for their Ai and machine learning

178
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:40,287
This is specifically geared as you said Stacy towards embedded devices also mobile devices

179
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,335
So your Android phones in particular

180
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:46,943
I'm more interested in the iot type devices embedded devices because

181
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,015
We think about adding machine learning to these things now instead of

182
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:54,367
Theoretically you automating things based on potential trigger events and so on

183
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,671
Things can happen based on an event

184
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:58,719
That machine has learned

185
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,487
Essentially

186
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:03,839
Perfect example I think is I forget the name of it

187
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:07,167
There's not a platform built on tensorflow that does image

188
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,447
Enhancement for example

189
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:10,751
And it starts to

190
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:14,847
Take an image that's kind of muddied and it will apply the machine learning to a tank

191
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:15,615
Clear it up

192
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:19,199
So basically what looks like a fuzzy picture becomes a crystal clear picture of

193
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,735
Exactly what it should be

194
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:23,295
Sewing machine has learned what something is supposed to look

195
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:26,623
So I'm thinking for image recognition maybe in the Smart Home

196
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,647
This could be

197
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:32,511
A tremendous tremendous value but that's just one of many possible avenues for this

198
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,327
You don't have in your Roomba have

199
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:36,607
Processing

200
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,631
Actually recognized

201
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,399
Furniture

202
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:40,959
I know it's Pat but I can tell you that

203
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:43,519
My cabinets definitely have little Roomba

204
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:44,287
Ruffles

205
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,335
Bam Bam

206
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,407
So that kind of stuff

207
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:55,551
Would be helpful also things like learning who people are in their emotions around the house that's definitely something that you

208
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:57,343
What companies are investing in

209
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,111
All kinds of

210
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,415
So I'm excited about this

211
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:02,719
I would tie it to

212
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,255
A couple things one

213
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,559
Intel bought a company called movidius

214
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:08,351
And status

215
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:11,423
Computer vision on the device which is really in

216
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:16,799
So they have an effort and play here and they actually launched a dongle it's a little

217
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,335
Basically neural network stick

218
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,639
They can train things at the edge

219
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:23,455
And then Qualcomm also has a very

220
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,991
Big effort income

221
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:25,759
Computer vision at

222
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:26,527
The edge

223
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,295
So

224
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,319
What we're seeing

225
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,087
When is

226
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:33,183
Trend in kind of a shift in thinking so we used to think

227
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:36,767
With machine learning there's two elements Thursday

228
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:41,119
Learning part where you're training a computer model and that's done on gpus and in the cloud

229
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,911
And then there's the execution site

230
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,703
Which has been done

231
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:45,983
At the edge

232
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:46,751
Andon

233
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,055
What we're seeing

234
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:52,639
Is this idea that maybe we can do some basic training

235
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:57,759
Even so build models on the device that's where the industry is trying to

236
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,807
I don't know if we're ever go

237
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:00,831
Can I get there but

238
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:04,159
I think if we're going to get there they're going to need this type of

239
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:10,559
Technology where that comes from Google or somebody else is irrelevant that's what's needed for sure and just to set that one second

240
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:14,143
Deep dream that's the computer vision program I was thinking about you look it up

241
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:20,543
But if you take a look online at Deep dream you can see visually what I was talking about Google uses the tensorflow for the smart reply

242
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,847
I seen lot of its messaging applications

243
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:26,943
And that reason context of a message and provide you with your three possible

244
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:30,271
Are multiple possible responses that actually make sense contextually

245
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:37,183
This is true this this is true but think about this

246
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,207
Instead of just getting

247
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:40,767
Smart home notifications for example that are just

248
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:41,791
Pretty cans

249
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,327
And are always the same

250
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,863
How about something with more context

251
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:45,887
Casino such as

252
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:46,655
Well I just

253
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:49,727
I get tired of the door has opened or disclosed kind of things

254
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,287
Maybe it should say so and so just step through the door

255
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:53,823
What is home

256
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,103
I said that's where we're going

257
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,127
I think I agree with you

258
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,431
Superfund super inter

259
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,199
Christine

260
00:10:59,455 --> 00:10:59,967
Supra eKEY

261
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,295
All right

262
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,367
There's some

263
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,391
SmartThings

264
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,951
SmartThings is getting an update later

265
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:10,719
This week

266
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,999
Actually

267
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:12,767
Local

268
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:19,935
Because it has

269
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:25,311
Spell but even if you don't have cellular backup

270
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:31,455
What's going to happen is for your lights and some alarms they're going to be able to run locally on the Hub

271
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:33,247
Which means if your internet goes out

272
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,807
You will still have your lights turn on and off

273
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:37,599
But this will only happen

274
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:38,879
If you have it on a schedule

275
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:42,207
If you're like me and you have a lot of stuff to set to sunrise and sunset

276
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:42,975
It's not going to

277
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:43,743
Is that actually

278
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:44,511
The cloud

279
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:47,839
Sprite well that's kind of a shame because

280
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:50,911
If a device is still on even though it doesn't have a connection is not like the

281
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:54,239
The time has gone down the time just continues on the on the Hub

282
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,263
That's really weird

283
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,311
Well it's because they have to pull out

284
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:00,639
Get the different the different time every day I get that

285
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,687
Awesome

286
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,223
Here's where we should be going

287
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,015
Pull that time down

288
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,551
Store it locally

289
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,343
And then keep it for a day

290
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,135
24 hours

291
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,671
That would be

292
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:13,951
A fun way to go

293
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,743
Maybe someone

294
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,839
And it's kind of complicated

295
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,631
They've got child apps

296
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:23,167
The SmartThings app

297
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,191
This is really

298
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,983
I'm getting back into smart

299
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,031
Set of a hiatus

300
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:30,847
Maybe we'll do a special segment just that

301
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:34,687
It's a good idea so that's actually a hub update

302
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:35,711
Yes

303
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:36,991
Your house

304
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:42,367
That's a later this week there's actually been an app update this week as well

305
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:47,487
Which hopefully people happy about interviews and getting back into smart thing so maybe you can give it a try

306
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,279
They've added scenes

307
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,559
Which is nice to have

308
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:52,863
As well as visitor lock

309
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:55,167
Code-switch I love the idea that

310
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,191
I don't think I have that

311
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:58,751
Today on my system so I would like that

312
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,799
And also a fingerprint authentication for the app

313
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:01,567
Which

314
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,103
Alicia already have that anyway but

315
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:04,383
The scenes in a lock code

316
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,455
The two big he's here so you can go update your SmartThings app

317
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:09,503
Codes are

318
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,527
I can issue lock

319
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:17,695
That's correct you can because in the developer notes of release notes it says create unique lock code for visitors to a

320
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,719
Access your home

321
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:20,511
Very funny

322
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,791
Speaking of locks

323
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,327
I should let anyone know

324
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:26,655
If you're using the Comcast Xfinity home

325
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,423
Set up

326
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,215
And services

327
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:31,263
They actually just added for different

328
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,287
Kwikset locks

329
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,567
To their plot

330
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:34,591
So

331
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,615
Yay

332
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:39,455
Stacey's happy

333
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:41,503
Kwikset locks on my game

334
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:45,855
If you're going that route in the August locks but

335
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:46,879
This way

336
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:48,415
It's all in the same place

337
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:50,975
It's fine we should actually maybe we should

338
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:51,999
You talk a little bit about

339
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,023
Lox B

340
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,095
Because one of the other stories that I saw this week

341
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,375
Was

342
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,399
John Cena

343
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:02,239
Which two thing up coverage there is latches teaming up with

344
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,007
The company called

345
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:03,775
Comelit

346
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,311
4 Apartments

347
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,103
And latches a lock

348
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,919
How late is a intercom

349
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:14,015
Picture and I actually get a lot of questions for people who live in

350
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,551
Apartments about how they

351
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:18,879
Can integrate their smart locks with control of the internet

352
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,671
Any answer right now is

353
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,439
You really can't

354
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:22,975
But

355
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:26,815
What this does is there saying that this intercom

356
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:27,839
Company is going to work

357
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:28,863
With these smart

358
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,399
Lakme curso comelit

359
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,935
It's another intercom

360
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:32,959
Company is nelo

361
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:37,055
They have said in the past that they're going to do something like this but

362
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:37,823
They haven't

363
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:38,847
So

364
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:41,663
I thought this was interesting cuz I get so many questions from

365
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,687
People saying

366
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:43,967
Hey

367
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:49,343
I want to be able to Grant entry to someone and not just into my apartment but all the way up to

368
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:50,623
My door

369
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,647
Wish I could be

370
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:54,975
Kind of it feels like where we're going if you think about

371
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:57,535
Amazon key

372
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,303
August in the

373
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,583
Their access program

374
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:00,863
Image taken

375
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:02,911
Talk about this

376
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:03,679
Dislike

377
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,471
What you need to let people in

378
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,519
You know Amazon needs a camera

379
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:08,543
As somebody point

380
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,823
In and out

381
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:10,847
Fraud detection

382
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:14,175
And for you to know who's coming and going

383
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:16,735
August is the same thing they use their doorbell

384
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,015
They also I think

385
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,295
With Nest on that

386
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,319
Do we really want

387
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:21,599
I mean

388
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:24,671
In general or I mean if I lived in an apartment complex

389
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,463
Sexy I think I would want this

390
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:28,511
You know I'm not home somebody buzzes

391
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:29,535
The intercom

392
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:31,071
Person that the

393
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:31,839
Front desk

394
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:35,423
Says they're not home and sends me an alert and I can decide to let them in my

395
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,191
Apartment or not

396
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:36,959
I kind of like that

397
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:38,495
As for my house

398
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:39,775
I don't know I mean

399
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:42,079
I just mentioned before the show that I'm thinking about getting out

400
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:44,383
Ring doorbell for the front door

401
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:47,967
And I may have to figure out how to make it work to

402
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:53,599
Unlock my door if I want the door unlocked like maybe I want the UPS guy to put something in my house cuz I'm not home

403
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:54,879
I can just unlock the door for me

404
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:55,903
I know it's him

405
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,695
Die, I like it

406
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,975
But I managed case

407
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:00,767
Yeah and I'm still like

408
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:07,167
I think about the number of people who don't want like an Amazon Echo in their home because it's always listening and I'm thinking those people are probably not going to let

409
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,191
UPS guy in

410
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,471
Warehouse

411
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:10,239
No

412
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,031
So we definitely wouldn't I mean it's

413
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:15,871
To me it's if you bought into the whole smart home especially with cameras

414
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,407
Lifestyle so to speak

415
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,431
Then

416
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,711
Yeah you would want this

417
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:20,991
Otherwise probably not

418
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:24,575
Well here we have it yes I'm still puzzling over this

419
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:26,879
I'm still

420
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:28,671
That's okay

421
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:29,951
Let's talk about

422
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:31,743
Your review of

423
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:32,511
The wing

424
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:34,815
Cuz we both got

425
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:35,583
Toys

426
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:39,423
Okay I'm scratching my head a little bit over the wink Lookout

427
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,471
So let me start off by saying that

428
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:46,335
And the reason scratching my head is not because it doesn't do what

429
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,359
It advertises

430
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:49,663
To do because it does basically

431
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:52,735
In the lookout can't you get a Wink 2 hub

432
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:57,087
You get two door window sensors magnetic sensors that are Z-Wave

433
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,903
You get a motion sensor again

434
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:00,927
Aussie wave

435
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:03,487
And you get a siren

436
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:04,255
Also see

437
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:06,047
Pairing everything

438
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:11,679
I did struggle a little bit and I find this a lot with Z-Wave devices I have to be really close to the hub

439
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,727
And I don't know if that's your experience Stacey but

440
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,775
I really loved when the wing

441
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:17,055
Cub went Wi-Fi

442
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,847
Special

443
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:23,455
I liked that about the wink Hub cuz I would just bring it with me to wherever I was trying to

444
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:25,759
Yes

445
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:29,087
And that I did that exactly that when I did my zwave door lock

446
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:29,855
So that's

447
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:30,623
You're right

448
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:31,903
In this case these

449
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:33,439
Little devices are all

450
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:37,279
Small enough for me to just walk up stairs and go next to the wink Hub while I'm in the

451
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,303
Setup program

452
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,583
Once I did that cuz I

453
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,631
I was trying to do it from a couple runs away was not working

454
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,167
Once I got close

455
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,191
Everything paired fine

456
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,983
The motion sensors

457
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,519
Are super

458
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:51,871
Super super good my opinion there are at least five different sensitivity settings so you can

459
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:54,687
You know if you got pets and things you can reduce the settings

460
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:55,455
You can

461
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:59,039
Say don't send me alerts unless there's motion for more than

462
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:02,367
1 2 5 10 minutes whatever you like that I like

463
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:05,695
The door window sensors also work well no problems there

464
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,999
I will say in this is not specific to wink

465
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:14,399
I have like traditional molding around my door so the molding is not flat which makes it very difficult to attach

466
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:16,447
A door window sensor of any kind

467
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,215
To it

468
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,519
So just say that for people who have

469
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,543
Similar molding

470
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:21,567
Have some issues there

471
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:23,103
But again that's industry-wide is not a

472
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,383
Knock on wink at all

473
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,663
The siren

474
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,735
As a chime feature which I like or you can have it now

475
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:31,551
Blaring really loud alert alert you know

476
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:33,343
Three different volume settings on that which is

477
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:36,927
Just good sided forgot my dog is everything connected really well

478
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:41,791
And there is I think everybody should have this now in the Wing Cap there's a new look out Prada

479
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:45,887
But it's not a product per se because it's more of a

480
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:48,703
I'll call a platform or a way to get into the

481
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:49,983
Lookout settings

482
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,007
So

483
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:57,151
When you go in there you can actually see what you can connect and even though they didn't send me this I was able to connect my nest camera

484
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:57,919
2

485
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,711
The lookout settings

486
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:02,527
What Lookout actually does it's an alert system

487
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,831
And that sounds like will shortz a security system

488
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:07,647
What I mean by that is anytime any of these things

489
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,951
Text motion or a like that

490
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,487
You will get an alert

491
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:14,303
When you get the alert on your phone in the app

492
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:16,607
You can choose to sound the siren

493
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,399
You can choose to call 911

494
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:19,679
Choose to

495
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:20,447
Call a friend

496
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,215
So it's

497
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:26,591
Taken all of the security aspects and giving them to you and you decide what you want to happen

498
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:27,871
That works

499
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,407
But it also introduces some

500
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:36,063
Challenges and if you have a traditional security system obviously you got a keypad or way to disarm the system by a

501
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:39,391
Maybe with a new nest for example you can use an RFID tag

502
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:41,439
Swiper NFC tags

503
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,463
Parmer Dessau

504
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:47,327
There's no way to do that here and that I think is going to be a challenge because it's all at base

505
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,887
And one of the particular challenges in

506
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:51,935
I've set this up to automatically

507
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,727
Go on and alert for things

508
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,007
From 11 at night

509
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:57,055
Until 5:30 in the morning so overnight

510
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:59,103
Somebody walks in the house through my front door

511
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,663
Or the door window sensor or motion sensor

512
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,479
Text the siren will go off cuz that's what I want to happen

513
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:06,015
What is my son

514
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:09,087
Works late comes in at 1 in the morning doesn't know

515
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,623
If it systems on or not

516
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:11,647
Doesn't even have the app

517
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:15,231
I got to sign him in as me

518
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:18,303
And he's got it basically turn off the alerts before he walks in

519
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,839
And my family is not going to do that

520
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,631
So that's going to be a challenge

521
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,399
Yeah you're coming

522
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:27,263
You're starting to know that they're actually starting to now and that's

523
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:30,847
Actually why they don't have the Wink app installed because they don't need the app

524
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:31,871
Because I just tell

525
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:33,663
The lights to go on and off as they need you now

526
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,967
So that's crate at Amazon

527
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:40,063
Yeah which is great but now as they're engaging in that which is awesome

528
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:42,367
Now how do I get them to use the security system

529
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:43,647
Oh

530
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:45,439
I would say maybe voice recognition

531
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:48,511
Analog one day and then you could be like it's just me

532
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:50,303
And that would work but that's not going to happen

533
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:52,095
Cuz the false positives

534
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,631
Non-recognition

535
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:54,655
It's still pretty

536
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,191
Yeah

537
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:56,959
Speaking of

538
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:58,495
Amazon still doesn't know

539
00:20:58,751 --> 00:20:59,263
Who I am

540
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:00,287
Really

541
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:02,079
Really it is the saddest

542
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:02,847
Satisfy

543
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05,151
No personalization for Stacy

544
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,479
I haven't tried it in my house because again they just use the

545
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:10,015
Lights on lights off kind of stuff

546
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:12,831
What are the challenges is everyone has to have the

547
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:13,599
Their own

548
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,623
Mattimeo

549
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:17,696
Each of them on their own app

550
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,464
2

551
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,512
You have to log out of you

552
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,048
Re-login is that

553
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,328
For each one

554
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:25,120
It's a little convoluted

555
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:26,144
Identity management

556
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:30,496
This sounds

557
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:33,312
And I was looking for a presence detection.

558
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:34,080
Tobias Forge

559
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:40,736
Disarm

560
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:42,016
You're right

561
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:45,344
I kind of feel like that's the missing piece here

562
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:50,208
And I understand why wink went this way because their feedback they've got

563
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:53,792
What they tell me they want people to be in control of their security systems

564
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:54,560
A total control

565
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:57,120
And you do if there's no question them succeeded in this

566
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:59,680
This is perfect for somebody who lives alone

567
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:01,216
If you have to worry about those

568
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:02,496
Scenarios that I was talking about

569
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:05,056
Not right and you have total control but

570
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:06,336
It just feels like there's a

571
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,360
Piece missing

572
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:08,384
2

573
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,920
Truly arm disarm

574
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:10,688
And

575
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,504
You can do some automation bits and I've done some butt

576
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:19,136
It almost feels like they don't want you to in a sense cuz I don't really tell you how to set up robots

577
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:20,672
Their schedules or anyting

578
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:27,072
With this kit and I mentioned this to that man like I get who this kid is game four because as a hub you're talkin about first-time smart

579
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:27,840
Home buyers

580
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,120
But if you're talking about the buyers

581
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:31,168
You got to tell them how to do the automation bit

582
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:37,568
We've had to figure it out along the way we got good at it but connecting everything is fine but then how do you make it all work together

583
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:40,128
That's kind of missing for a new person I think

584
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,504
And again I just maybe some stuck in a traditional security mindset of this arm / disarm

585
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,296
But I think that's a lot of you think

586
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,064
Stihl.

587
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,624
Well and I would say that in some ways that's

588
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:56,000
Because like when I was a kid growing up my parents had an alarm and they kept it

589
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:56,768
On

590
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:58,304
So they'd hear the beep beep beep

591
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,584
When I open the door

592
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:06,496
Same here that you could hear it beep beep beep with the siren and the chime sure they're also potentially going to get

593
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:09,056
Notification after notification after notification on a smartphone

594
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:12,640
Like every time somebody walks past a motion sensor

595
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,248
200

596
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:20,832
Which is a good price and there's no monthly fee or anything because again

597
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:21,600
It's not

598
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:23,136
Professionally monitored it's

599
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:28,768
Immaturely monitored by you I don't think it's a bad product I just think it's probably for a very specific

600
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:29,792
Type of user

601
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:31,072
That makes sense

602
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:35,936
All right well if you're that kind of user you like hearing your smartphone you like notifications

603
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:39,008
You want to really know what's going on in your house this

604
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,032
Happy for you

605
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,056
All right

606
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:42,592
Before I get to my toy

607
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:44,384
We're actually going to take

608
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:45,408
AR

609
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:46,432
Voicemail

610
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:47,968

611

Alright this week

618
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:09,216
On the iot

619
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:19,200
Iccl Kevin my name is Hugo and my calling from Montreal I sent

620
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:20,480
Tuesday

621
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,528
Asking her what she thought about

622
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:23,296
The wife

623
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:28,672
$20 1080p full HD night vision two-way audio camera

624
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:30,208
$20

625
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:33,792
Reviews from cdnuts last year

626
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:38,144
Call tmw my question is fairly simple is it safe to use

627
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:43,264
Secure where are those image going and more generally what should I look for

628
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,312
Or if I want to get any type of camera

629
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:49,152
The outside can is a little bit less worrisome for me but inside cam

630
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:51,200
Could be something that they don't hold it

631
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:54,016
More something I would think more about to wear

632
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:57,600
Data is going obviously there is an account be saved

633
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:58,368
For 7 days

634
00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,904
The things that are recorded

635
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,696
So it's all good and it's very cheap

636
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:05,024
However I don't know if it's a

637
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:08,864
Thank you so much guys I will be looking out for an answer

638
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,888
However you wished

639
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:11,168
I will about you

640
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:14,240
Okay good news for you Hugo

641
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:15,264
I just

642
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,824
Bought and received my wyze camera

643
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,896
My $20 tiny cute camera oh my gosh

644
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:22,432
It is adorable

645
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:23,712
And it works

646
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:25,504
And for your accused

647
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:28,832
It has a slot for an SD card

648
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:30,624
Which means it doesn't have to

649
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:32,416
So

650
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:38,048
If you are interested in where the stuff goes and I think it's smart of you to ask these questions

651
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:41,376
There are security breaches

652
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:43,680
Time so

653
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:44,704
With this

654
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:49,568
Can set up motion detection I set that up it seems pretty responsive so

655
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,872
And then when I open the app

656
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:53,152
I can see the live stream

657
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:54,688
I can record

658
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:56,992
My voice and talk to people

659
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:57,760
Over the cap

660
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:58,528
Camera so that

661
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:00,320
That's good I can hear stuff

662
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:01,344
My sound off

663
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:03,136
I can hear stuff if I want

664
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:05,440
There is night vision

665
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:07,744
That seems to be pretty good although I haven't

666
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,024
Play with it in the app

667
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:11,072
End

668
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:12,608
If you go under settings

669
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,888
You can send

670
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,192
Vocal recording to a MicroSD card

671
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:19,008
So for twenty bucks

672
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:21,824
Sounds great Scott the SD card slot if you

673
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,664
Don't want to send the data to the storage card

674
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,480
Where can you save it or does it get sent to

675
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:30,272
It seems it on the app

676
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,040
And then it shows

677
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:32,832
Photos on

678
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:35,904
Okay so it's not going to the cloud

679
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:36,672
Does not appear

680
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,512
Okay then there's a reason I ask this

681
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:41,280
That's because

682
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:43,328
I don't think we've yet figured out what the

683
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:49,984
Portico best and safest practices here for webcams because why don't we send the data to the cloud

684
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,008
Well cuz we don't want

685
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:52,800
The companies to

686
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:53,568
Have it

687
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:54,848
Can hack and so on and so forth

688
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,176
So you want an SD card slot okay that makes sense to

689
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:59,712
Which this. Is which is awesome

690
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:02,784
But if I'm breaking through the house and I see this thing

691
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,832
And I noticed there's a little

692
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:06,112
I'm making that card out

693
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,672
Rob my house

694
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:11,744
I mean I know it's an extreme example and I know what most people

695
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,304
Breaking into a house that probably aren't going to notice this but

696
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,632
I just there's like no guarantee you'd have the date at that point

697
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:19,680
This is the same debate I had

698
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:22,496
Like 10 years ago when I started uploading all my CDs

699
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:23,264
Is 2

700
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,032
My

701
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:25,056
Terabyte drive

702
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:29,152
I was like I have converted all my CDs to you know

703
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:30,176
Flac files

704
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:32,224
And it took a long time it was a lot of work

705
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:32,992
Working then

706
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:34,272
I put them on my

707
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:37,344
Local hardware but then I was like what happens if this fails

708
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:39,904
So then I was like okay I'll buy Carbonite backup

709
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:41,440
This is

710
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:43,232
It's the same kind of situation

711
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:49,632
Yeah but it's a dilemma that I think is it's more personal here because now it's pictures inside your house

712
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:52,448
So I think people need to decide

713
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,472
Am I going to trust

714
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:55,008
Any company with this

715
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:58,592
And if so pick that company and get a camera that works with that company

716
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:00,128
Or no I'm not going to

717
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:06,528
Trusted company have an SD card slot and manage it myself and hope that nobody takes the card slot or just walks away with a camera

718
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:10,880
And I'm in if they walk away the camera then they walk away with the SD card

719
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:11,904
Portable

720
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,440
It's exactly

721
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,024
Yes I mean it's it looks like a camera

722
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:24,448
You can tell it would have signs you can tell it's a camera I mean ultimately what I guess what we really want is

723
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:26,496
Hidden camera so to speak to that way

724
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:28,288
You wouldn't have to worry about somebody walk

725
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:30,080
And or the data on it

726
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:32,640
Well then you can turn the indicator light on or off

727
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:34,944
So I could put this in and out of

728
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,064
See I returned that indicator off if I'm going to store to an SD card together

729
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:43,136
I will also tell you guys

730
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:44,672
I rather you go I will tell

731
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,720
Netatmo

732
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:49,536
Welcome camera also stores data to

733
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:51,584
Either an SD card or your own

734
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:52,608
To be server

735
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,656
Which might be an interesting

736
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:55,424
Way to

737
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:57,728
If you set it up to the store to your server

738
00:28:59,008 --> 00:28:59,520
Someone

739
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:00,544
You have to take your server

740
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:04,640
Yep I'm making that again

741
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:05,920
So

742
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:08,992
It's a nice camera I like it alot I like it actually more than the

743
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:10,016
Best camps

744
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:10,784
So

745
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:15,904
Although some people complain about that Atmos customer service and they are not wrong to

746
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,952
Is there a French company and they tend to be

747
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:19,232
Less responsive

748
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:20,768
They are eventually respond

749
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:22,304
They're not

750
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,120
That is

751
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:26,144
Really all the news

752
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,168
To print this week

753
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:32,544
Cabinet

754
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:35,872
You can say hi to us

755
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:36,640
PCS around

756
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:40,480
Too at the end of November November 30th I will be

757
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:43,808
Hosting an event at the Target open house

758
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:46,112
Talk about iot business models with

759
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:47,136
Schlage

760
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:47,904
Canary

761
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:48,672
And

762
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:49,440
Hi

763
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:52,512
So we'll be talking about how to establish trust between

764
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:53,280
Can users

765
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,864
Why companies may need to charge for things and I'll come

766
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,704
So if you are in San Francisco November 30th

767
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,240
You should come to that event

768
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:04,032
Will leave a link in the show notes

769
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:05,312
I think

770
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:06,848
That is it for

771
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:09,664
Are section that stay tuned for a message

772
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:11,456
Our sponsor and

773
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:17,088
An interview with Michael Sherwood who is the director of technology and Innovation for the city of Las Vegas

774
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:19,904
He talks about some really cool stuff

775
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:26,304
And if you're going to say yes you'll be able to see it in person

776
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:31,680
From The Internet of Things podcast from our sponsor

777
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:36,032
Cognition and I've got Stewart killing here to talk to us about

778
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:39,104
Promise is critical infrastructure

779
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:40,128
The powers

780
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:41,152
Just about

781
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,200
Alright Stewart

782
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:48,320
Sparkcognition is using a improve safety and reliability

783
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:51,648
Can you give me some real examples of ways that utilities

784
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,184
Are using

785
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,744
To offer more advanced

786
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:57,024
Capabilities

787
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,584
Absolutely for example we're working with

788
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,864
One of the largest

789
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,424
Producers of wind energy in the country invenergy

790
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,960
And we're working with them

791
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:05,728
To be able to

792
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:06,752
To help.

793
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,032
Specific

794
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:09,824
Donuts on their wind turbines

795
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,872
Very specifically on there

796
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:12,640
Gearbox

797
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:15,968
On turbine and what we're doing is we're taking the same techniques

798
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:17,504
Facial intelligence

799
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,296
Machine learning algorithms

800
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:21,088
Using our Technologies in art

801
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:23,392
Tools and what we're providing them is

802
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,416
Lead time

803
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:26,208
In terms of failure

804
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:26,976
Prediction

805
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:28,000
For the

806
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:28,768
Gearbox

807
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:29,792
Does AKA

808
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:31,072
Opponents of the

809
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:33,120
Turbine are about to sail

810
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:37,472
I love it so how can machine learning improve equipment reliability and

811
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:39,520
Performance

812
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:42,336
We're working with some of the leading utilities

813
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:44,640
We're looking at operations on their gas

814
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:48,480
Part of that what we're able to do is we're able to identify

815
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:49,248
Operation

816
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:50,272
Conditions that

817
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:51,552
Their subject matter expert

818
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:52,576
Want to wear a

819
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:54,624
Before implementing an AI tool

820
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:56,160
What this allows them to

821
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:56,928
To do is run

822
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:58,208
Machinery more efficient

823
00:31:58,464 --> 00:31:59,744
Understand better

824
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,536
When it needs to be taken offline

825
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:02,304
Scheduled

826
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,096
Maintenance and really this helps

827
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:06,144
Improve their bottom line both from

828
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,680
Keeping the machine running

829
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:09,216
As well as reducing maintenance

830
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:11,264
Cost from unexpected breakdown

831
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,032
Failures

832
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:13,824
Okay so you mentioned humans

833
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,128
What is the role of human subject matter

834
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:18,176
Machine learning

835
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:21,504
We still find that there's a tremendous value in the

836
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,528
The subject matter expert

837
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,064
As you mentioned them humans

838
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,344
May I at least in

839
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,160
Some of the industrial world where it can be sort of Celsius

840
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:28,928
Sustaining

841
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:31,488
There's still a lot of information about

842
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:32,512
We might come up with

843
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:33,280
The result

844
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:35,328
And we really need the humans

845
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:36,864
To help us understand

846
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:37,888
What does

847
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:38,912
Results are telling

848
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:40,960
So our goal isn't necessarily.

849
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:41,984
Replace the humor

850
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,288
Can we augment their capability

851
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,848
Instead of them taking a shotgun approach

852
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:47,872
Looking at every

853
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:50,688
Machine all the time because they really don't understand

854
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:52,480
If we can help them with a i

855
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:54,528
Focus their information Focus

856
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:55,296
Is there knowledge

857
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:56,832
Specific use cases

858
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:57,856
Pacific problem

859
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,160
Seen and then allow them to

860
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:01,184
Is there expert

861
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:02,720
They can augment

862
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:03,744
The outcomes

863
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:05,280
Lisa thinking about

864
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,048
Facebook

865
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:08,096
If we can start showing examples

866
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:09,120

Titan Machinery to weather a

870
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:13,984
Results was good

871
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,264
More bad then

872
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,544
The machine can start learning

873
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:20,128
And eventually it can improve its results that the humans are

874
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:22,944
Where can I go to find out

875

Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast

878
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:44,448
Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest is Michael Sherwood who is director of technology and

879
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:47,264
An innovation for the city of Las Vegas

880
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,544
Hi Michael how are you doing today

881
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:50,592
I'm doing well thank you for having me

882
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:52,640
Excited because

883
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:54,944
Cuz I went to Vegas a couple weeks ago

884
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:57,760
And Michael took me on this wonderful tour

885
00:33:58,016 --> 00:34:00,320
Around central or Vegas downtown Las Vegas

886
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:02,624
Downtown is correct

887
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:08,768
And I got to see all kinds of crazy street lights and things that most normal people would not be excited about

888
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,096
The thing that most impressed me though

889
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:13,120
Was

890
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:13,888
Is it you

891
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:17,728
You're the coolest job in the world so you are thinking about how to make cities smarter

892
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:19,008
Not just any

893
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:22,336
Stereotypical hey let's put a lot of sensors and cameras on lamp posts

894
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:23,104
Switch we will talk

895
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:26,432
But you seem to have a broader vision of how to make the city

896
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:27,712
So let's

897
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:30,272
Heart with your overall what's your pervy

898
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:31,040
What is it

899
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:32,320
That you're there to do in

900
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:33,856
Willis

901
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:35,392
To connect the community

902
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:37,952
And provide new avenues of a fish

903
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:42,048
C4 citizens and I like to call people that come to the city consumers

904
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:43,328
Whether you live here

905
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,120
Or you're visiting your

906
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,400
Assuming our product

907
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:48,448
We want to do is really have

908
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:49,728
Your experience

909
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:52,544
In Las Vegas be one-of-a-kind and if we can do that

910
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,824
Through iot

911
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,872
Technology to LP transversal

912
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:59,712
City a little bit more efficiently provide you with locations

913
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:00,480
Parking

914
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:04,320
Make the air around you more enjoyable or healthy

915
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:07,904
I just provide you a level of safety that you have while you're here

916
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:09,696
What is extremely important in

917
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:10,976
We really believe

918
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:14,304
The iot and The Internet of Things in general

919
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,864
Play a major role in that experience

920
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:19,424
All right in a lot of people are really

921
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,192
Stoat

922
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:21,216
About smarts

923
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:23,776
But it's also a huge

924
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:26,592
It's a huge project you can't just wave a magic wand

925
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:29,408
Or if your Google I guess you can buy 800 acres

926
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:31,200
In Toronto and just rebuild

927
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:31,968
But

928
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:35,040
As someone who's working with an existing infrastructure

929
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:37,600
What do you think are the first things a city should

930
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:38,368
Maybe

931
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:40,928
Connect or maybe it's just the first things they should consider

932
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:44,256
I think the first thing to consider is starting something have a plan

933
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:46,560
Understand what your priorities are we have

934
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:47,584
5 priority

935
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:50,144
But I understand what those priorities are

936
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:56,288
Have a plan but I think a lot of my peers the thing is they don't start anything they talk a lot they have a lot of plans

937
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:57,312
He never actually X

938
00:35:57,568 --> 00:36:00,128
Anything I think what we do uniquely here

939
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:02,176
Is we do lots of pilot project

940
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:03,712
And try a lots of

941
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:04,480
For technology

942
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:05,760
Find out

943
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:07,808
Nothing like in a real lab environment

944
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:08,832
Knowing

945
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:11,392
If something works or doesn't you really don't know

946
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:15,488
You put it out into the field the downtown Las Vegas area we really set up as a

947
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:17,792
Technology we caught the Innovation District

948
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:19,840
Are we set up this area we can really

949
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:20,608
Test

950
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:21,888
Improve out things

951
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,936
Before we make large investment

952
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:26,240
In any one particular technology

953
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:29,568
People tracking in The Innovation disc

954
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,360
To count things like hay

955
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:33,664
There are x number of people who walked by this place

956
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,760
In a given time. And that's great for the economic

957
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:39,552
Chotu

958
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:40,320
Like Starbucks

959
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:42,624
Yeah that's that mean we've had really good

960
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,392
Exceso

961
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:47,232
We have now 50 of Those sensors throughout the downtown area

962
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:49,536
And we're counting not just people but

963
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:51,840
The difference between Motor Vehicles

964
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:52,864
Pedestrian

965
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:53,888
And cycle

966
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:55,680
So now we're able to

967
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:57,984
Take that data and show Developers

968
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:00,032
And local business owners

969
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:02,592
Here's the amount of people that foot traffic that comes

970
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:03,360
By weather

971
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:08,992
Vehicle and it's important to know if it's in a vehicle or walking by your location and in the past

972
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:13,344
The city would only send a surveyor out maybe once a year and it was sitting in a lawn chair in

973
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:18,208
Everything manually now we have these sensors that are constantly on 24 hours a day

974
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:19,488
7 days a week

975
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:21,280
And now we'll start we have these traffic

976
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:27,680
Patterns now that we can actually see the number of people and then if they're in a vehicle versus pedestrian versus a cyclist

977
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:30,240
And we really think economic wise

978
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:31,264
That's going to be so

979
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,568
Great data that are Developers

980
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:36,384
And other business people will be excited about as well

981
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:38,944
So let's go back to the Innovation District

982
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,736
Because this is what we toured

983
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:41,504
Part of

984
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,808
And just talk to me a little bit about

985
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:45,344
How that came to be

986
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:46,880
What you're doing

987
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:49,696
Sure so in March of twenty

988
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:51,744
16 to the city council designated

989
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,840
A large area in the downtown Las Vegas area so for those of you that

990
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:56,864
Are familiar with

991
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,656
Las Vegas to Fremont Street

992
00:37:58,912 --> 00:37:59,680
Experienced witches

993
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:00,448
Original

994
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:01,984
Las Vegas and

995
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,032
Incorporates several different

996
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:05,568
Areas around it

997
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:11,968
So when the city council built this Innovation District obviously we've included the Fremont Street which is all the casinos and hotels

998
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:13,248
That everybody knows and loves

999
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,784
About Las Vegas

1000
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:19,136
But it also includes our Medical Center where we have our County Hospital A Private Hospital

1001
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:20,672
Throw in a bunch of medical

1002
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:22,208
Support facilities around it

1003
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:23,744
Which we consider that our Medical

1004
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,536
Subdistrict within the innovation

1005
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:27,328
District we have some

1006
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:29,120
Business districts as well

1007
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:31,424
Business supporting the city as a whole

1008
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,728
We have an area of social economic

1009
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:35,264
Do we want to improve

1010
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,056
We have all these little mini districts

1011
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:39,104
What's in this Innovation District

1012
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:39,872
And

1013
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:42,944
Stay purpose of the Innovation District was to

1014
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:44,736
Use it as a living lab

1015
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:47,552
Truly test technology to test iot based

1016
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:51,648
Tools and services to see how they work in a real environment

1017
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:52,416
And if they would be

1018
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:53,440
Scalable

1019
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:54,976
To be able to move across

1020
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:57,280
Or the pool across the entire city

1021
00:38:57,792 --> 00:39:00,864
Some of the things we are doing in the downtown area as we have

1022
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,144
Cameras at intersection

1023
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:04,448
That are actually analyzing

1024
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:10,336
People will believe a bag behind for security purposes was more of a security functionality we're using

1025
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:11,360
Video Analytics

1026
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:12,896
To look at parking spaces.

1027
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:15,200
Occupied or unoccupied

1028
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:18,016
Hide we're doing air quality to imagine

1029
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:22,368
89 cars at a light and it's red we're looking at sampling the air quality

1030
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,672
And then based on the carbon emissions

1031
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:26,976
Does Vehicles changing the light to Green

1032
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:30,816
So that we don't have carbon buildup in the downtown area

1033
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:33,120
Where people are obviously outside walking

1034
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:34,400
From venue to venue

1035
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:36,448
So we try to manage all these different

1036
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,216
Aspects

1037
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:38,496
We're doing other things with

1038
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:40,288
Radar now and lidar

1039
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,056
Where

1040
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,848
We are scanning intersection

1041
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,408
Looking for people walking into the

1042
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:46,688
The street that they do

1043
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:48,224
Then we can turn the light red

1044
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,272
Lots of Pilots around that

1045
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:51,808
But the data that we collect

1046
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:52,832
We make available to the

1047
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:56,928
The public as well and hoping they find ways one of their businesses or citizens

1048
00:39:57,184 --> 00:40:01,792
Those are all really good in fact I learned several things just talking to you

1049
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:02,816
One was

1050
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:05,120
That you can't have one camera that does it all

1051
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:05,888
You've got

1052
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:09,984
I think I saw three cameras on a light post each one of them had a different job in your very

1053
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,544
Helpful in explaining why that was so

1054
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,848
Let's talk about some of the concrete things that you

1055
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:16,384
Learned so far

1056
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:19,456
Because I feel like when we talked about iot

1057
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:21,248
We tend to get excited about

1058
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:26,368
Really cool things that can happen but we neglect to think about all the Practical learning

1059
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:27,392
Going to place

1060
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:30,720
So things like oh yeah you need three cameras

1061
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:33,280
So I don't know if you want to pick a project that

1062
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:35,584
Changing the light for

1063
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,864
Cars that are idling the

1064
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,400
That might be an interesting thing

1065
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:39,424
Everything she learned

1066
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:41,216
Shirt woot

1067
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:44,032
Probably the most fascinating one and I get the most

1068
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:44,800
Questions on

1069
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:48,384
Stuff the most complex one in the one we probably learned the most

1070
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,944
As we've gone through this journey and continue our journey

1071
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:53,504
But you would think the very simplest sounds

1072
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,528
Sensor reaches

1073
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:55,552
Is a certain level

1074
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:56,576
Sends a signal

1075
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:57,600
That signal turns

1076
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:59,136
It changes a light green

1077
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:00,416
It sounds simple

1078
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:02,464
I penciled it out we worked on it at

1079
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:08,096
It seems very easy but no we started learning quickly was obviously there's lots of little things that we weren't even

1080
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:09,376
Paired for

1081
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:13,984
One just getting the buy-in of everybody around you think it sounds really good and

1082
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:14,752
People would want

1083
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:16,032
Partaken nut

1084
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:18,592
But as soon as you start talking about it there's a lot of

1085
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:20,896
Well do we want to do this why are we doing this

1086
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:22,688
So we had to break through Jess

1087
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:24,480
The internal politics

1088
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:25,248
Around Prague

1089
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:26,016
Just like that

1090
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:26,784
Tacitly

1091
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:27,552
Is

1092
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:29,344
Who's going to be the installer

1093
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,624
Obviously the city hits

1094
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,904
City traffic lights

1095
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,208
We don't want a 3rd party installer doing it so you

1096
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,488
You try to accommodate

1097
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:42,144
That component of who's going to be responsible who's installing who's touching what when and then when you start getting into

1098
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,680
Just more of

1099
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:44,960
The actual interface

1100
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:46,240
So

1101
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:48,032
The air sensor Caesars we have

1102
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:49,568
How to send it to a legacy

1103
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:50,592
Traffic system

1104
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:53,407
That's not current with what we could say current

1105
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:54,687
Software standards

1106
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:56,735
So we have to write an interface

1107
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:59,551
In order to for it to do that and then add fail-safes

1108
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:00,831
Into that interfaces

1109
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:05,439
As well and so before you know it's something that I figured would be a 3245 damp

1110
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:07,999
Implementation is now we're at 5 months

1111
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:09,791
And we're close now to actually

1112
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:10,559
Having it

1113
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:13,119
Fully work the way we intended it

1114
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:14,143
But the

1115
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:15,679
Amount of time in the

1116
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:16,447
Enforce

1117
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:17,471
Seeing things

1118
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:18,495
That came up

1119
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:21,055
Constantly required us to go back

1120
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:23,359
And evolve the project revolve to specify

1121
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:24,127
Applications

1122
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:26,175
To get to the point where we are now or we ask

1123
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:26,943
You have

1124
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:28,479
We consider a functioning

1125
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:30,783
Project same thing very similar with

1126
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:32,831
Hazard light are intersect

1127
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:36,671
Project you can use the lidar radar for two things one seeing a

1128
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:37,695
Pedestrian

1129
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:38,719
Walk across the

1130
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:41,023
Street on a green when they should be waiting

1131
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:43,071
The other thing would be for wrong way driver 210

1132
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:44,351
It's on a one-way Street if

1133
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:45,631
Cars going the wrong way

1134
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:49,471
This radar lidar system would be able to

1135
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:50,751
Have signage

1136
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:51,775
On the street

1137
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:53,311
Saying hey wrong way

1138
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:54,591
Flash of the driver host

1139
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:55,615
Reseda and stop

1140
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:56,895
And realize you're on the wrong Street

1141
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:58,943
Again sounds very simple

1142
00:42:59,199 --> 00:42:59,967
In concept

1143
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:01,503
But it's actually taken

1144
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:02,271
From concept

1145
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:03,039
I'm putting it into the

1146
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:07,391
Street itself and then seeing how it operates in making all the connection

1147
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:08,159
Is a lot of it

1148
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:09,439
Just the ticking this

1149
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:11,743
Newer iot technology and have it work

1150
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:13,023
With more Legacy taipei

1151
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:14,815
Systems that just weren't designed

1152
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:17,631
To accept the input that were trying to give

1153
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:20,959
I'm working through that it's just takes a lot longer than in

1154
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:24,799
What about so that's fair I deal with that whatever

1155
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:26,847
Can imagine

1156
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:28,895
When Public Safety is on the line

1157
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:31,711
How much time do you spend thinking about

1158
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:32,991
The rules of

1159
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:33,759
This kind of

1160
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:36,319
So I thought it was kind of funny

1161
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:38,623
Just thinking about oh my gosh

1162
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:40,159
There's too much traffic building up

1163
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:41,439
The air quality suffering

1164
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:42,719
Turn the light green

1165
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:46,815
Oh my gosh there's a pedestrian in the middle of the intersection don't do that

1166
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:49,887
I just got to start thinking about how complicated that kind of

1167
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:50,655
Rule setting

1168
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:51,935
Might

1169
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:56,799
B-but we discuss internal I mean so and then some of the fun things about the discussion is

1170
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:59,359
Where tacotaco at the light or in the fishing industry

1171
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:00,895
The kid was

1172
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:01,919
It's kind of a troublemaker

1173
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:02,943
Probably still in Canada

1174
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:04,991
Troublemaker you were discussing

1175
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:06,271
We actually had to come

1176
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:07,295
What ifs

1177
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:09,087
Kid on the sidewalk find out about the

1178
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:10,111
What is lidar system

1179
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:12,415
And jumps into the street and then jumps back over

1180
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:14,207
How do we

1181
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:16,511
How to prevent a bunch of people from jumping into this

1182
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:17,279
Rihanna Jump

1183
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:18,303
Back over

1184
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:19,839
And not having all the lights on

1185
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:20,607
The city turn

1186
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:21,631
Red

1187
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:22,911
Could I be a safety

1188
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:23,935
Concern

1189
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:24,959
Some kind of prom suits

1190
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:29,311
We actually do have some deep inside discussion and again we try to go towards

1191
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:33,407
You're the reason we're doing a pedestrian goes back to one of our five principles which is

1192
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:34,431
Public Safety

1193
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:35,455
And so

1194
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:37,759
We design around us but there's a lot of

1195
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:39,807
People who know is there a problem

1196
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:45,951
Accessories getting hit why are you doing this and answer is no we have a pretty low pedestrian fatality rate

1197
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:47,231
But the same time

1198
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:48,767
One fatality is one

1199
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:49,535
Too many

1200
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:51,327
So let's talk about dealing with citizens

1201
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:52,095
Because

1202
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:53,119
That is a

1203
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:54,143
Challenge

1204
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:58,495
To say the least there is concern about their concerns about privacy

1205
00:44:58,751 --> 00:44:59,775
Surveillance

1206
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:00,799
They're also

1207
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:06,431
You know concerns about your taxpayer dollars and where those go so someone once told me in smart cities

1208
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:08,991
If you can't provide a citizen use case

1209
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:10,271
The city council will not

1210
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:11,039
Even listen to

1211
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:12,319
Which is probably true

1212
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:14,623
So how do you think about

1213
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:16,415
Selling this and educated

1214
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:17,695
The citizenry

1215
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:20,767
But you brought up a lot of me a lot of great points so

1216
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:25,375
Obviously privacy is a big deal a lot of people

1217
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:26,399
Have no trouble

1218
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:28,959
Going on to Facebook other social media application

1219
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:31,263
Tell everybody I'm out of town

1220
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:32,543
Having a great dinner

1221
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:34,079
And don't think anything about

1222
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:34,847
Privacy

1223
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:37,151
In that regard yet in the government space

1224
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:37,919
If I

1225
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:39,199
Put out information

1226
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:43,295
Before immediately suspect of that we already have a huge barrier

1227
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:44,319
To overcome

1228
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,367
I think a lot of what we're doing is

1229
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:49,183
Around education right now and letting the

1230
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:51,999
Actual population know what we're doing so

1231
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:54,047
A lot of what we're doing is not

1232
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:54,815
Users

1233
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:57,119
Pacific yet we're working on some identity manager

1234
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:58,143
Programs

1235
00:45:58,399 --> 00:46:00,703
The lot of what we're doing right now in the iot space

1236
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:06,335
Is aligning what we believe our citizens needs with city council priorities

1237
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:09,407
So when we talk about providing the temperature

1238
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:10,687
And weather condition

1239
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:16,063
Google say at a city park it's not just about providing that the citizens will see that part of it and will

1240
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:18,623
Purdue sat on a website and on her mobile app so that people

1241
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:21,183
Can get that data but we're also using that data

1242
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:23,231
To find out when we need the water

1243
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:23,999
The fields

1244
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:24,767
And

1245
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:27,327
What makes sense based on

1246
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:28,095
Actual

1247
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:29,119
Conditions at

1248
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:31,679
The facility rather than just using the sprinkler timer

1249
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:33,215
And timing it daily

1250
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:34,239
So what are you saying

1251
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:35,519
Different sensors

1252
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:37,055
To achieve

1253
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:39,359
What we consider multiple successes

1254
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:43,455
But then the other piece on that is how do we use that data that were collecting

1255
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:44,479
To help better the

1256
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:45,759
The city internally

1257
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:47,295
So how do we take that

1258
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:50,367
Weather information and use it in our maintenance

1259
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:51,903
2

1260
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:55,487
Find better patterns on when the water knowing how many people are coming to

1261
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:56,767
Parking at what time

1262
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:58,303
So we can schedule maintenance

1263
00:46:58,559 --> 00:46:59,583
Mission operations around

1264
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:01,375
When there's the least amount of people

1265
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:02,143
At the

1266
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:05,727
Facility a lot of data at a high level

1267
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:07,775
And then looking at how

1268
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:09,055
We can make it

1269
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:10,079
A better experience

1270
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:11,103
For all that are there

1271
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:13,919
Now we are working on other products

1272
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:16,479
And programs that use your specific

1273
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:18,015
Identity inhabit

1274
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:20,575
To build a better experience

1275
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:21,855
But on those type of

1276
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:22,879
Ideas

1277
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:26,463
One you have to opt-in for it to privacy is a very big

1278
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:29,023
Certain the laws here in our state

1279
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:30,815
Still haven't caught up to the touch

1280
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:31,583
Technology

1281
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:35,679
So that's going to be a major challenge hopefully next legislative session

1282
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:37,727
Will be able to have some additional protect

1283
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:42,335
For the consumer as far as how we can use their data or not release it

1284
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:43,359
So that there is

1285
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:44,127
Privacy

1286
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:47,199
For the individual at the same time that they have privacy

1287
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:48,479
They get the benefits

1288
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:49,503
What does technology

1289
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:50,527
You can do for them

1290
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:53,599
Let's go to your vision of the city of

1291
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:56,159
The future cuz you're putting together some crazy stuff there

1292
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:58,207
Let's visit Las Vegas in 10 years

1293
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:03,583
There's a lot I mean so we'll pick some of the bigger things off I think that I'm going to say that

1294
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:09,471
Do we really want that Amazon experience and what I mean by that I would say Amazon experience with a little touch of

1295
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:11,263
Nordstrom's in there

1296
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:13,055
Look at delivering City service

1297
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:14,335
In that same way

1298
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:15,871
Meaning when you login

1299
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:18,175
My mobile app lets you use

1300
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:23,295
Parking lot 12 downtown every week and we know that we're going to resurface that lot

1301
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:29,695
So now that we know that you use that lot we're going to now send you a push notification automatically this is hip the next two weeks you

1302
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:32,255
Use lot 13 because 12 is going to be research

1303
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:35,071
Another idea would be we noticed that you

1304
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:38,399
Sign up your son for daughter for baseball or softball

1305
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:39,423
Every year

1306
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:40,703
And bring it to you

1307
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:41,471
Additional

1308
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:42,239
Sports programs

1309
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:43,775
During the off-season

1310
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:44,799
Automatic

1311
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:47,359
If you have any go research and find out we would send you

1312
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:49,151
Apus notification saying hey

1313
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:50,431
This is for you

1314
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:51,455
This will help you

1315
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:53,247
Get additional classes at maybe

1316
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:54,271
You weren't aware of

1317
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:56,575
I'm look at that is helping Drive our Revenue

1318
00:48:57,087 --> 00:48:58,623
As well as providing the end

1319
00:48:58,879 --> 00:49:01,695
Consumer additional information that they wouldn't have had

1320
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:03,487
How many goes on from

1321
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:07,071
Using your phone to pay for your parking to pay your sewer bill

1322
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:07,839
Weave

1323
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:12,447
Used and started to build applications for the Amazon Echo platform

1324
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:13,727
As well as

1325
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:15,007
For Google home

1326
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:17,055
And now the Amazon show

1327
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:19,103
Which is an upgraded Amazon

1328
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:20,383
Product with a screen built

1329
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:21,151
Intuit

1330
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:22,431
So now you can ask

1331
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:23,455
AC

1332
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:24,479
As well as here

1333
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:26,527
And so really is making

1334
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:29,855
Government as transparent as possible but very

1335
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:30,623
Hi touch

1336
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:32,671
High service oriented

1337
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:34,975
Where you really feel connected

1338
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:36,255
And if you're able to get the

1339
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:38,815
Information that you need in the most timely manner

1340
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:39,839
Vanessa from everything

1341
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:42,143
From a safer environment your street light goes out on your

1342
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:42,911
Street

1343
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:44,191
As soon as it goes out

1344
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:45,727
It's not about you having

1345
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:48,543
You call us we already know what's out and hopefully

1346
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:53,663
We replace it before you even know that the lights burnt out of those a type of things that were looking at

1347
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:54,687
Do you really

1348
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:55,967
Going Beyond

1349
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:56,991
What

1350
00:49:57,247 --> 00:50:00,575
Traditional government that I call up and I never get a response to

1351
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:02,111
Hey I didn't even have

1352
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:05,183
Call they called me and help me or they message

1353
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:06,719
Instant messenger

1354
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:07,487
Give me your day

1355
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:10,815
Send me an email or automatically alerted me on the app

1356
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:12,351
So it's really about that service

1357
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:14,143
Level

1358
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:16,447
I mean we're looking at doing fiber optics

1359
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:17,215
Downtown

1360
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:20,031
Where we would look at providing internet Based Services

1361
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:21,567
Everybody not just

1362
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:24,383
Two selected area stole a lot

1363
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:25,151
2

1364
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:29,503
Really give our city a competitive advantage through either education

1365
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:30,527
And Technology

1366
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:33,599
I don't see any limit the sky's kind of the limit

1367
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:35,647
As far as what we're looking at implementing and

1368
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:37,439
The technology just we will

1369
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:38,463
Yo testing

1370
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:39,487
Actually

1371
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:41,023
Deploy at one point in the future

1372
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:43,839
Alright I kind of look forward to that

1373
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:49,215
Nature vision and let me ask you one final question where does the money for all of this

1374
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:50,751
So right now

1375
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:54,335
Majority of it comes from companies that want to be here and obviously

1376
00:50:54,591 --> 00:51:00,735
We have a huge technology show called CES every year so we kind of have that as an advantage more companies will put their technology and down

1377
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:02,015
Downtown at no cost

1378
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:04,831
Sublime we can test it to they can show customers

1379
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:06,111
That come to

1380
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:07,391
CES in January

1381
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:08,159
This one

1382
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:10,975
Obviously we do have a budget set aside for innovation

1383
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:13,279
This past year was $1000000

1384
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:14,559
And we've been

1385
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:16,863
Leveraging that as we do these Pilots

1386
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:17,631
And

1387
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:18,911
Additional testing

1388
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:21,471
But really down the road we kind of see

1389
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:22,751
The ability of

1390
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:23,519
Proving

1391
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:25,823
If we're able to put a technology out there

1392
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:31,455
That actually saves money so we're looking at trash can sensors right now people we have

1393
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:33,759
Physical laborers that go up and down the street

1394
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:36,319
And look at all the trash can if they're empty or full

1395
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:39,391
And no matter what right now they drive up and down and they checked

1396
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:43,487
Well if we were able to put a sensor in the trash can to say if it was empty or full

1397
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:45,791
And we didn't have to go to Every trash can ever

1398
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:46,559
Everyday

1399
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:47,839
That would be a savings

1400
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:50,399
We're looking at that those savings mechanism

1401
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:52,959
2 then be funded redirected

1402
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:58,335
Back into the Innovation fund and it would be a fun that would eventually pay for itself

1403
00:51:58,591 --> 00:51:59,103
Through efficient

1404
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:01,151
And we think that is one

1405
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:03,455
Great way of long-term

1406
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:04,479
Sustainability

1407
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:06,783
A lot of what we work on with all the technology

1408
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:07,551
We're talking about

1409
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:09,855
Is sustainability how do you keep these

1410
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:10,623
It's going to just

1411
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:12,671
Can't put in 10000 sensors

1412
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:13,695
And then

1413
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:17,535
How do you keep from going after 3 years when the batteries die or you need to replace

1414
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:19,583
And what are you get the money to do that

1415
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:21,119
Exactly all right

1416
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:22,143
Michael

1417
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:23,423
You have been a Funt

1418
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:24,447

Thank you but I'd love to come back again it's been a real pleasure in

1423
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:35,711
Obviously Vegas is open to everybody so can we hope to get everybody out here and

1424
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:36,479
Enjoy it and see

1425
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:37,503
The technology we have

1426
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:39,039
Yeah if you're a CES

1427
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:39,807
This year guys

1428
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:40,831
You should actually go

1429
