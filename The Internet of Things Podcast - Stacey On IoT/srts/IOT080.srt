00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:11,264
Hey everyone is welcome to the Internet of Things podcast

2
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:15,104
Kevin tofel

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,640
This week

4
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:18,176
Awesome stuff for you

5
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:24,576
We've got Amazon's new streaming music program we've got something about what the heck

6
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:30,976
It's happening with cameras coming out

7
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:33,536
I was just building an Internet of Things net worth

8
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:39,936
And this week's guest is Eric has cilia of AGCO the company is transforming

9
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,984
Intuit services

10
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:44,032
All because of the internet

11
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,312
All right

12
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:46,080
Kevin

13
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:49,408
Let's get started with Amazon streaming music service

14
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:50,176
Wechat

15
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:52,224
Roughly $8 a month for

16
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,784
Anybody if you're an Amazon Prime member

17
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:57,344
And $4 a month if you happen to have him

18
00:00:58,368 --> 00:00:59,136
What do you think

19
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:04,256
Well it's it's interesting and we knew it was coming well we'd heard it was, I guess I should say

20
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:06,816
The interesting aspect is the 399 a month

21
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:09,888
Just have Amazon music catalog

22
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,008
Available on your Amazon Echo devices I still don't know if a lot of people are going to

23
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:16,800
Take Amazon up on that

24
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:19,104
Prime Membership

25
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,456
Store subscription fee for this is as you said 799 a month

26
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:26,784
Interesting way you can pay $79 for the year

27
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:30,880
And have the unlimited music if you're a Prime member on all of your devices

28
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:32,672
And then for all you non-prime folks

29
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:34,720
10 bucks a month just like everybody else

30
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:37,280
I think you'll get a lot of prime people here

31
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:40,096
I think $8 a month is going to be a peeling

32
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:45,728
There is a family plan coming soon that I was interested in cuz that's what I have with apple music

33
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:48,288
It's going to be 1499 a month

34
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,568
No matter what I say

35
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:50,848
Even if your Prime so

36
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:52,640
I'm a little less interested now so

37
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:59,296
I'm not going to do the echo only thing that just doesn't make sense to me because I use so many mobile devices but that's again

38
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,088
So what do you think

39
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:04,416
Well do in comparison I'm paying

40
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:07,744
1499 a month for the Spotify family plan

41
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:10,048
And is it 999

42
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,840
I meant or 599 a month

43
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:12,608
Score

44
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:19,008
Normal people Spotify

45
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,800
So I thought it was the same for Spotify

46
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:21,568
Yes

47
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:22,336
Yes it is

48
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:25,152
That my brain was getting confused cuz I

49
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:27,200
When I upgraded I was like

50
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:27,968
$5

51
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:28,992
$5 a month

52
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:34,880
Where on the music

53
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:35,648
Okay

54
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:36,416
So

55
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:37,696
I think

56
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:44,096
I guess I could cut back on in just have one Spotify account and then one Amazon Echo

57
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,888
Accountant that would be a Buckler

58
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:47,424
And my daughter could listen

59
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:48,960
Are the echo

60
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:50,752
You know to her music

61
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,288
Which is kind of where she lives

62
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:55,104
But now that I have Spotify on my mobile devices

63
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:55,872
But

64
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:58,688
Right now I have my echo set to have

65
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:04,064
Spotify as the default in If I Stay

66
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,600
Play this on Spotify

67
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:08,416
And that is not worth a dollar extra month

68
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:14,048
So I think I would stick with Spotify for the time being I will try this out because

69
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,072
Cuz what if there

70
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,352
Selectionism

71
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:22,752
And that's what it always comes down to I think my side from price for these types of services what's the catalog you how much music

72
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:23,520
Is there

73
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:28,896
I believe Amazon has three of the four major labels in their catalog so they may not have

74
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:31,200
Why does many songs or albums

75
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,272
Artist as the others but it's got to be darn close

76
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,808
The Beatles

77
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:42,208
I know it's important for you

78
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,744
Streaming everywhere song

79
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,048
Everybody's Got The Beatles at this point I think

80
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,984
Did you also have if you're interested in this kind of thing did you also have this new side-by-side feature

81
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,008
Which takes

82
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:56,288
Artist commentary

83
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:59,360
I'm sorry commentary from the tracks in the catalog and

84
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:03,968
View insights as to the music I don't know that's going to be a huge

85
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:05,760
Draw either

86
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:06,784
I don't know

87
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,808
It's kind of like

88
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:09,600
Emitra service right

89
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,648
And then let's make it

90
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,184
A little more affordable

91
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,464
And also have

92
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,280
Way to get it just on our devices for a few bucks extra

93
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,327
It's a smart play by then but

94
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,607
I don't know I just

95
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:24,447
Maybe it's me I don't know I don't know how much girls are going to get out of there

96
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:25,983
Fair enough

97
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:28,031
Cuddle with you

98
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:30,079
But

99
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:32,895
People who act like the ideas

100
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:35,455
People who are normal buying these services

101
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:39,551
It's possible that instead of a service like Spotify they're really going after a service like Apple

102
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,111
Their music service

103
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,391
Which

104
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:45,183
Feels like a little bit more

105
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:45,951
Porthole

106
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:49,791
And maybe this is a good way to augment that collection for people who are like

107
00:04:56,191 --> 00:05:01,567
Colossians say you're right there. Maybe it is a different target audience because I'm sure there's overlap yes but

108
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:03,103
You think about

109
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:07,967
How many millions of echo devices are out there and how many cortical normals

110
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:08,991
Handsome

111
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:11,295
Yeah maybe these people aren't current music

112
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,319
Scribers at all

113
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,855
Yeah but

114
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:16,159
One taught the other thing I would say

115
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:17,695
I really

116
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,463
Excited

117
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,487
No I hope

118
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:21,535
Because baby there

119
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:24,351
But I really hope it is a Time

120
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,631
Keeps offering

121
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:26,911
The Computing Services

122
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,703
Cuz I think that's going to be really

123
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:30,495
Agreed important

124
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:37,407
Especially if you think about what happened with like Amazon not selling Chromecast

125
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:41,247
And given that they're going to be in an all-out war with all these other

126
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,271
Services

127
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:44,575
Like the new Google home comes with

128
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,623
Six months of access to like

129
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,391
YouTube

130
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,159
Red

131
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:52,255
If you're doing something like that and you know

132
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,535
Music from

133
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:54,559
Scott service

134
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:55,839
Sorry that it right

135
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,399
This is crazy

136
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:00,703
It's good people of music

137
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:01,727
All right

138
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,519
Movie Ride Along

139
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,055
Let's talk about

140
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,359
Ramah in the standard

141
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,943
We never have drama there

142
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,735
No

143
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:15,039
Only thing standard upstanders is drama

144
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:20,671
Okay so what happened with this the open connectivity Foundation or OCS

145
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:21,695
Has

146
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,231
That is merging

147
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:25,279
With the Ultimate Alliance

148
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,071
Actually it's not merging with you

149
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:29,119
Emerging the standards

150
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,679
Iotivity and alljoyn

151
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,983
Alliance actually voted

152
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:36,543
Just Dance

153
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:38,335
People yelled at me saying it wasn't

154
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:39,615
It was

155
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,407
This is not a merger of equals

156
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:44,991
You guys this is a merger of all joined into iota

157
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,295
Did it actually reason

158
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:50,879
The first one being

159
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:53,951
What happened to it's already in devices

160
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,255
The answer is

161
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,047
Ic3 will be back

162
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:58,815
What's compatible

163
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:04,191
Townsite is right now Ayo to be isn't much it's a little bit of hoses backwards

164
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:04,959
Compatible

165
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:07,263
Like their work out the backwards compatibility

166
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:10,847
There isn't a lot of like production value code out there to make

167
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,151
So

168
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,455
Forgot

169
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:17,503
We should stay with you standard to

170
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,807
Yeah that's a good question

171
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:26,975
That is too surprising for me. I need a lot more coffee for that

172
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:28,511
Got it

173
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:31,071
Okay so these standards are device

174
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:33,375
Discovery and interoperability standards

175
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,911
So what they're going to do

176
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:35,679
Is

177
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:36,447
Like

178
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,727
If your light bulb

179
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,055
H&M

180
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:41,823
I can do that

181
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:46,175
For televisions it might be here the messages I can display

182
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,967
Here's what you can do to me

183
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:49,503
That's kind of idea

184
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,087
Is this protocol let statements in the home talk to you

185
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,623
Each other and figure out

186
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,647
How to say

187
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:06,655
Puns aside in and that's probably why we don't hear too much about them like you don't hear about

188
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:09,983
Join product or this is Aniya tivity supported products

189
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,519
It's really big glue

190
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:14,079
That kind of makes these products work together

191
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,359
Which Southern on

192
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,407
Product specific

193
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,175
Feature

194
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:21,247
Seventies are like behind-the-scenes kind of protocols I think

195
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,039
Yes you were behind

196
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:29,439
Well I'm sure each of these people would be like like love to be the Wi-Fi if they're era

197
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:33,791
Call ideas just to make everything

198
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,863
Competitors to them is Ashley Google

199
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:37,887
Weave

200
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,935
What we're seeing here is

201
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:46,079
Or the merger of those standards is

202
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:49,151
We have existing alljoyn products

203
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:51,711
In the market they might be they will be backwards

204
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:52,479
Compatible

205
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:53,759
With

206
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,807
Coming of age.

207
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,087
Right now

208
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:59,135
It looks like I'll be stuff

209
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:00,927
It's really far off

210
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:03,743
Some people are telling me it's as far out as 2018

211
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:06,559
I have too many guys are like those here today

212
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:09,375
But that's kind of equivalent out where the code bases

213
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,423
And right now the code base is not

214
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:12,703
Production

215
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,471
It's already

216
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:16,287
Anaya tivity I think is newer

217
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:18,335
And then they all join

218
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:22,175
Framework because just last year with the announcement

219
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:28,319
They started musically if you want to

220
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:30,367
Mistreated by Poco

221
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:33,695
And then back in 2013 Qualcomm design

222
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:39,327
It in like a couple other companies are like we are going to

223
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,351
Christian standard

224
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:41,375
And then

225
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,935
There's licensing issues

226
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:46,751
2015 Impalas

227
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:50,335
Hey let's creator

228
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:54,175
Because that's what standards do

229
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:57,759
Then

230
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:00,831
They came out and enjoy

231
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:01,855
Push pins

232
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:04,415
And like Microsoft when she joined all terrain

233
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,463
This looks good

234
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:08,511
So all these companies kind of

235
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,535
1 /

236
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:13,375
And they decided that everything was going to work together a couple months ago

237
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,679
Honestly the death of Saul

238
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,215
Alliance was really

239
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:20,799
Written that when they all decided that everything should work together

240
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:23,103
Cuz you just don't need that kind of

241
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,383
You don't need to stand this

242
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,175
The same Tuesday

243
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,759
That's where we are

244
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,295
Is a sad day

245
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:34,367
Because right now I feel like we had a working standard but

246
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,487
Better marketing

247
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:40,255
Standard

248
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,023
While

249
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,559
Google superhero

250
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,351
I got weed

251
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:51,263
The funny thing is from new and users consumers I don't know

252
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,543
Even know what

253
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:57,919
Standards are used for the devices to talk to each other

254
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:00,479
That's the you know as all this churn

255
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:02,783
We're all sitting here going just make it work

256
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:06,111
Yeah cuz I mean how long has it been since we

257
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:09,439
Talking about this Markovich

258
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:13,535
Okay

259
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,071
That's the standard Smith

260
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,095
Let's talk about

261
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,631
Cameras

262
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:23,263
Kevin you want to tell us about the Netgear Arlo Pro

263
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:28,127
Oh yes I do so I didn't know this was coming you may have

264
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,151
But

265
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:33,247
Netgear has the Arlo Pro Wireless home security cameras

266
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,783
This is a camera that

267
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:39,135
You don't need to worry about connecting to existing power lines are in like that

268
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,951
You just stick it and go

269
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:44,255
Believe it is to

270
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:47,071
4999 does that sound right

271
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,863
$250

272
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,423
Base station and one camera

273
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:55,775
190

274
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,055
420

275
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:00,127
You can go hog-wild and spend a lot of money here

276
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,919
So this is

277
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:04,735
Did the station as well

278
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:11,647
It does have a base station in what I'm actually currently trying to look up on me really slow internet is whether or not the new or

279
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:15,487
Orbi mesh routers from Netgear

280
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,791
And so if you have the Arlo

281
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,583
The old lady

282
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,887
Yeah

283
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:23,679
The answer is

284
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:30,079
Orbi will not replace your Arlo base station

285
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:30,847
Bay station

286
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,919
Yes this is a new base station

287
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:36,991
All right well that's it that's it

288
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:41,087
Plug in my router

289
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:47,487
But I will save my Arlo cameras

290
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:50,559
I'm using the the older version that has

291
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,839
Irreplaceable

292
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,119
Batteries disc

293
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:53,887
When is

294
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:54,911
USPS

295
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,287
So you're spending Less on batteries

296
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,847
Complaint for the original

297
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,895
Singer sew fun

298
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,431
Good cameras you like

299
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,455
I mean honestly

300
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:09,247
Super magnet on the back

301
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:11,295
It's so great for like attaching it to things

302
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,855
Toss it in the air

303
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:17,951
I have this ability here

304
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,487
It's great

305
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:20,767
Even though there's a

306
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,047
So just

307
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,839
This looks like a more powerful

308
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:26,143
Uso

309
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,959
Yeah I mean

310
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:31,263
Quick Charge rechargeable battery so less time

311
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,847
Last downtime of not monitoring something when you had to recharge the batteries

312
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:37,919
Miniature two-way audio which is nice and the

313
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:42,271
Night vision and ultra-wide 130° field of view and

314
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:44,575
Like you said you can stick this thing anywhere

315
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,855
Start on something more

316
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,135
It's magnetic and boom

317
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:54,047
Yeah currently actually right now because I have glass doors at my home in my August doorbell or not

318
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:56,351
I replaced them trying to get a better

319
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:59,423
Version of its I have replaced it with newer Hardware in

320
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,191
So far

321
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:04,543
Are you guys

322
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,567
Yeah you have to

323
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,335
Please.

324
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:08,895
I'm using the voice before

325
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:09,919
We're back in town

326
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,479
Recording that before we left town

327
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,015
We were like oh

328
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:18,623
Where can you have a package so we just stuck in Arlo like

329
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,647
Right there

330
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,439
Magnetically

331
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:24,255
I have facing the door in

332
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:26,303
You know we got the motion sensor when

333
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:28,095
Someone came to the door and we're good to go

334
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:31,935
And for those of you guys who are like

335
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,983
Still there batteries in the sting

336
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,007
Talk about

337
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:37,055
Wireless charging which is

338
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:40,127
Not what we hoped it would be but is apparently getting better

339
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:42,687
Do you know why it's not where we had hoped it be

340
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,015
Standard you know

341
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:50,879
Don't want to seem but yeah it's standard different standards between

342
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:53,951
Reasons

343
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:54,975
Powermat

344
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:59,583
Consolidation over the past few years which is good

345
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:05,983
This point again people don't care what standard is used so long as they can use whatever it is they want to use

346
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,775
Seems like

347
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:10,335
A lot more devices now are adopting

348
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:13,407
The chi standard which has been around for quite a while

349
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:18,783
And or devices that support multiple standards again people don't care

350
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:22,879
They're just like I can use a wireless charging pad with this okay that's good for me

351
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:26,207
So that's really what's been happening over the past couple years so

352
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,999
While wireless charging has

353
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:30,815
Grown in terms of adoption and in fact

354
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:33,119
It was up 40% in

355
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:39,519
2016 according to IHS it could have been more as what I just said and I agree it could have been me

356
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,847
Figured out the standards earlier

357
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,175
Yeah it is important for people for like what she

358
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:50,527
Actually spelled with a q i many of you guys made

359
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,599
I did not

360
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:56,415
It is a bummer in

361
00:15:56,671 --> 00:16:00,511
Haven't you tried a couple of these wireless charging things out

362
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,863
I don't charge it

363
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:05,887
Quickly

364
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:09,983
What do you think it's like

365
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:10,751
So

366
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:17,151
I would say just a year or two ago I would say that would be an accurate statement the difference between

367
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:19,711
Wireless charging times War

368
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:21,247
Very noticeable

369
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:24,831
These days we got fast wireless charging and again

370
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:27,903
Special chips needed for that special

371
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:34,303
Charging pads and so on but perfect example is my Galaxy S7 that I got back in May

372
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:39,423
I was able to find a Samsung fast charge wireless charging pad

373
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:43,775
Which will charge devices wirelessly at they standard

374
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:44,799
Slower rate

375
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:49,919
But the Galaxy S7 presidential causes Sports fast wireless charging

376
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,455
And it's darn near

377
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:52,735
Close

378
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,527
To a regular wire charge

379
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,831
Let me just add a car

380
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:59,647
I didn't want to go to there but know this phone has not

381
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:02,207
If it doesn't show it was nice knowing you off

382
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:06,815
But I I want to add a caveat there because don't forget in the wireless charging

383
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:07,839
Marketplace

384
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:08,863
We've also had

385
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,935
Quick charging Qualcomm quick charge

386
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:14,495
1 2 and 3. Oh now where you can

387
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:18,079
You don't plug in a fast charge wire

388
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:22,175
Plug and you can get like half of your battery back in as little as

389
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:24,223
15 20 30 minutes

390
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:26,783
Wiregrass wireless charging is not that fast

391
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,623
But it's as fast as standard wired charging if that makes sense

392
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,927
Got it

393
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,463
It is

394
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:37,023
But it does need to be touching the pad

395
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,863
It's good for like your mobile devices

396
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:44,191
I'm still waiting for a great wireless charging options

397
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:44,959
Fuller Lake

398
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:49,311
Sensors are things I mean like if you're going to invest in the Smart Home

399
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,335
You're going to invest in

400
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:51,871
1

401
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:53,407
Is double-sided tape

402
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,199
Justice everywhere

403
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:55,967
2

404
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,247
Is batteries

405
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:59,551
And you're going to be going through batteries like

406
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:04,159
Toddler is what

407
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,439
So

408
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,975
And you're going to also have

409
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:10,559
My recommendation is a screwdriver that can open all of your sensor back

410
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:12,863
So you're not running up and down

411
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:20,543
Yes

412
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,823
We should we should Market

413
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:23,871
Speak it for the show

414
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,687
Myiot breaking cases

415
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:27,455
Watch bands

416
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:31,295
Before you give up move on one thing that has not happened in this market

417
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:35,391
It would answer your or address your concerns and questions and that is

418
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:39,999
Having wireless charging pads built into furniture and other objects

419
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,023
Where is

420
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,815
Like I have a lot of

421
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:45,631
Devices that sit on a little table we know or whatever

422
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:47,935
They can't recharge their butt

423
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:50,239
If the wireless charging pads are there

424
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:53,567
All the time

425
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:58,175
And that's been a talk of me for several years now and I'm yet I really haven't seen much

426
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:04,319
Much play in that except for I give credit to Starbucks which put in a corset with the Powermat standard but

427
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:06,879
Starbucks wireless charging

428
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,183
Pads built into their

429
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,463
Little

430
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:12,511
Tables where you sit and have your coffee

431
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:16,095
I'm so you can have your phone recharge me just put it down there in your drink their coffee

432
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:19,679
That's about the only place I've actually seen that out in the wild

433
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:21,727
Wireless charging built into furniture

434
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:25,311
I believe one of the major hotel chains

435
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,335
Is investigating

436
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:29,151
Using wireless charging in table

437
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:33,247
The lack of Standards is released I need them because furniture

438
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:34,783
I mean think about

439
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:40,671
They remember how you used to go into every hotel room and there was a.

440
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:42,719
For your iPhone that is now lick

441
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:46,303
Or iterations at 8

442
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:48,863
30 pin connector

443
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:51,167
I mean Furniture should laugh

444
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,727
I mean I think having a little ballet

445
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:56,031
You know that you can get a charging that that you

446
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:57,567
That probably makes more sense

447
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,359
In all on

448
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:08,063
Because you'll know that wireless charging furniture sets a big time when it comes in

449
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:10,367
Ikea offers pizza and we're not there

450
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:11,391
There you go

451
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:12,671
Okay

452
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:19,071
Ml12 big news which is Comcast is doing its own low-power wide area network

453
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,119
Basically Comcast Building

454
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,911
An Internet of Things Network

455
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:27,007
Sometime last week I took a nap

456
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:29,311
Which is the maker of

457
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,591
Laura

458
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:34,431
Pandora is a radio standard for these low-power wide area Networks

459
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:37,503
And it Comcast said it would

460
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:39,807
Goldish Network out across 30 markets

461
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:41,599
Nextlink

462
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:45,951
80 months which is crazy because

463
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:47,487
Comcast has such a

464
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:48,511
Bigfoot prints

465
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:54,911
It's it's almost like how could they not do this right this isn't going to take a ton of bandwidth mean

466
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:58,495
Because Lora data rates are

467
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,055
50 kbps or glass of Minnesota

468
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:01,823
4

469
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:03,615
Iot MTM

470
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:06,687
Kind of communication so when you can

471
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:09,759
Leverage your big footprint with us why wouldn't you

472
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:11,807
Exactly

473
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:14,111
And either relatively cheap chips

474
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:16,416
They can work over a large

475
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:19,744
They are really interesting for like sensors

476
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:24,352
So you can see Comcast taking its Xfinity home which this is not part of the exit

477
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,704
He experienced it has medicine goes Network

478
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:29,984
You can see it

479
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,848
Why that took small business and Enterprise customers they're actually really hurting for these kind of

480
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:37,152
DIY or cheaper solution

481
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,688
4

482
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:39,968
Security in that sort of thing

483
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:42,016
To make sad

484
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:47,392
Inessence wireless network

485
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:52,768
Feel like we can talk about Comcast wireless network or like the last decade

486
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:58,656
There's a couple questions

487
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:00,704
Competes with standards like sigfox

488
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,728
Which is building

489
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,776
It says it's building a hundred

490
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:06,336
Cities in the US

491
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:08,896
Which is a lot in so far

492
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:10,432
It hasn't quite done that

493
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:18,112
Stop near me

494
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:19,136
Standard form

495
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:20,160
Will power wins

496
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,184
And

497
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:24,256
Nobody knows where that is proprietary

498
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,328
To pray time with you then

499
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:29,376
Comcast is really

500
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:31,424
You know pushing the envelope here

501
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:33,216
Especially in the US

502
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:34,496
Because in

503
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:35,520
Europe

504
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:39,104
In Singapore a lot of the major carriers

505
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:43,712
But here in the US with AT&T and Verizon

506
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:44,992
Laura Webb

507
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,784
They're looking at doing

508
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:51,392
Low-power wide area network based on the GSM standard so there

509
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:55,232
Cat 1M I can never even remember this

510
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:58,304
Basically cellular-based

511
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:00,096
Openstack

512
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:06,752
So I don't know exciting news we'll see Comcast does it feel like it's all it's going to it's

513
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:08,544
Could have asked

514
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,592
Hazit Market rollout nodejs

515
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:11,872
Contingent Upon a Child

516
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:12,640
Successful

517
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:16,992
But it's kind of nice to see come here

518
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:18,784
Yeah yeah

519
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,552
I agree

520
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:22,624
All right so I think that

521
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:28,768
Good for the show if you want to date you were going to have a little advertisement and then we're going to have

522
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,304
Church hymns

523
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:33,888
Who is with an agriculture company called AGCO

524
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:38,752
And he's going to talk a little bit about the interview is actually about how to trance

525
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:39,776
On your business

526
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:40,800
Selling products

527
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:42,080
Selling services

528
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,616
So it's worth a listen

529
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:51,296
Taking a break for the podcast for a few moments for a word from our sponsor this week sponsors arm and I have

530
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:54,368
Tom Williamson the GM of the wireless business at arm

531
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:55,904
I'm here to talk to us today

532
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,672
Soap

533
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:57,440
Paul

534
00:23:57,696 --> 00:24:03,840
You're telling me that 18 months ago I'm launched a wireless IP radio division can you tell me a

535
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:05,120
A little bit more about this

536
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,400
Show that's right

537
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:08,960
18 months ago

538
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:13,568
Launched a new product offering cocodia which is

539
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:15,872
Radio IP rather than Price is Right

540
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:18,688
Which one now offering to arcilla campanas

541
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:22,016
And that allows them to add the connectivity that I need

542
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:26,624
Be able to address the rapid growth that was sitting in iot devices

543
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:28,416
What is your first radio.

544
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:33,024
The first product we launched with Bluetooth low energy

545
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,328
Beyond the initial version was the

546
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:41,728
4.2 standard but upcoming soon as the new version of Bluetooth Bluetooth 5 which introduces

547
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,032
New features that are really going to be important

548
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,312
For The Internet of Things

549
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,128
Key features that we going to see

550
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:50,176
Increase title right so

551
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:53,760
That's going to make the transfers between devices like

552
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:55,552
Your Fitbit 21

553
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:58,624
PetSmart Timothy wanted to getting that data to and from the phone

554
00:24:59,136 --> 00:24:59,648
Fosta

555
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,696
And still win sorry live energy

556
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:03,232
I don't say things that I

557
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:09,632
Perhaps more mundane but really important for us to get secure connected endpoints into iot like firmware

558
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:11,424
Will happen very quickly

559
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,192
Clean swell

560
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:12,960
The other Kingdom

561
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:14,496
Featureless coming is where

562
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:16,544
Adding a longer range feature

563
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:19,616
The technology which means that devices will be able to cover

564
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:23,712
At the entire home rather than just those personal devices around you

565
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:27,552
I thought something that will be a supporting in the near future

566
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:28,576
Why would I want to

567
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:29,344
ARM version

568
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,624
Of a radio

569
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,392
As opposed to someone

570
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,720
VIP that we develop for radio is

571
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:38,304
Reddit really pushing the boundaries of low power consumption say

572
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,864
All radios operate at below 1 volt

573
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:47,264
Allows them to run off a pretty broad range of pass Plies and drive down the energy consumption flat devices

574
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:53,408
Korean consumer that means longer battery life by up 40% in products that use our radio technology

575
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:59,040
In addition to the low-power the other feature that were able to bring it along with the prices

576
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:04,416
Completely secure endpoint solution so you can securely about data from these

577
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,696
Embedded devices into

578
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:11,072
McLeod this guy to be more news about not coming up at the arm techcon conference at the end of this month

579
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:12,864
Awesome and as a consumer

580
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:15,168
I am excited about Bluetooth 5

581
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:16,192
What should I expect

582
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:21,568
24-hour toys mystery when these new features come out as to how people are going to use them I think

583
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:27,968
What you probably start C is a little more around the small time 6 please

584
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,552
Smart financing tablet apps

585
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:36,160
Devices that the need for these Bridges and gateways and I think I could bring

586
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,952
Even more Lifehouse NC

587
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:44,352
Into the home environment tell me how can I find out more about the products

588
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:45,632
Radio IP products

589
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:52,032
You just got to Omnicom Foods Kodiak

590
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:58,432
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacy Higginbotham

591
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,504
Am I guess today is Eric Henson

592
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,064
Who is SVP of global cross cycle

593
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,904
And Advanced Technology Solutions for a company called egg

594
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:09,696
Hi Eric

595
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:11,744
Great thanks for having me on the show

596
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,072
Man I am so excited to have you here because I can

597
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:15,840
About Farm

598
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:17,632
It is actually

599
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:18,912
I don't I don't know what is

600
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,728
So let's get started Adco

601
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:25,056
You should probably tell us what it does because it is not a household

602
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:30,688
Yeah Edco is the largest pure-play farm equipment company in the world

603
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:36,064
So let's get people excited about bringing we've had guests on the show talk about Precision Acura

604
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,880
Culture talk to me about the future of

605
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:39,648
Farming

606
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:40,416
And

607
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:41,952
Why you guys are

608
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:42,976
Are doing this

609
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,792
Yeah it's actually an exciting time

610
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:48,352
When you look forward at the future of farming

611
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:52,960
The world only needs the farmers all around the world to double their productivity

612
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:54,496
There's no more land

613
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:56,800
And yet there's going to be more miles

614
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:57,568
The feed

615
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,360
You combine that with the fact that

616
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:01,152
Diets are maturing around the world

617
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:02,432
More and more people are

618
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,712
Adding more meat

619
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:06,016
To their diet at the multiplier and amount of

620
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:07,040
Food that needs to be done

621
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:10,368
Is just more bile energy

622
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:11,392
Demand sources

623
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:16,256
So that could be biofuel internship ethanol or soy diesel

624
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:19,584
And somehow the world's Farmers need to grow twice as much food

625
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,352
Nginx

626
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:22,400
20 years or so as they do today

627
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:23,424
With no more land

628
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:27,264
And and also managing the resources like water and fertilizer

629
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,288
Pesticide

630
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,312
Things like that

631
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:33,408
The farmers have to farm differently in the future than they are today

632
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,200
Farmers needing to be more

633
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:37,760
Proficient both because we've got more people

634
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:41,600
Because we want to use our resources more effectively and also because farmers

635
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:45,440
At certain points in time are kind of living on the edge in terms of profit

636
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,256
How much more efficient

637
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,536
Can we actually make

638
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:54,144
Yeah there's a few ways to look at that if we simplify it down

639
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,424
Kernel is

640
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,752
Seed has the inherent lipstick corn as an example

641
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,544
Eternal love

642
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,568
Corn if you

643
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:03,104
You take a look at them

644
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,152
Traits that are inherited it today

645
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:06,944
Any places that ideal condition

646
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:07,968
It can grow to

647
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:09,760
600 bushel yield

648
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:10,784
Africa

649
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:14,112
Whereas the average yield across the United

650
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:16,416
States is only about a hundred and seventy-five bush

651
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:17,184
Icebreaker

652
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:22,560
So not every single seeing every single Farm is going to be grown in the app to Absolute optimal condition

653
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:26,144
But there's still a tremendous amount of upside potential

654
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:29,472
On the farms to be able to farm more effectively

655
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:30,752
To raise the real

656
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,568
Certainly 20 25 30

657
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:34,592
Percent is

658
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:35,616
Within reason

659
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:36,384
In the short-term

660
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:43,040
And you guys started out with adding connectivity over the last decade to tractors and

661
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:44,832
Other farming equipment

662
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,904
And also I believe some sensors

663
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:53,024
So what makes today different like what brings connectivity to the next level

664
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:53,792
Precision

665
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:59,168
Guess you using a great turn Precision agriculture if you think about

666
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,448
What we talked about

667
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:01,728
There's no more land

668
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:03,776
And yet we need to somehow grow twice

669
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:04,800
As much as we do today

670
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:06,592
So we have to farm different

671
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:10,176
And in the phrasing around that is called Precision agriculture

672
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:12,224
It's intended to mean that

673
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:15,552
We need to be more precise with the way we use input

674
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:16,576
Seeds

675
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:19,392
Water fertilizer pesticide herbicide

676
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:20,928
And machinery

677
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,208
To be able to get

678
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:24,768
It's a different outcome a higher yield

679
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:25,536
And

680
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:26,816
The more efficient cost structure

681
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:28,608
A key element of that

682
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:30,400
More recently is

683
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:31,424
Connectivity

684
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,984
The Advent of

685
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:37,056
Telematics which allows us to be able to

686
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:39,616
Send the information from the machine

687
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:40,896
Boston machine

688
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:45,504
And remotely monitor how a machine like a tractor or combine or

689
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,552
Sprayer is operating or

690
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:48,832
Performing or how it

691
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:49,600
Set

692
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:50,624
Or Howard drivers

693
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:56,512
By remotely monitoring that machine we can then help the farmer with insights to say

694
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:58,816
Hey change how you're using that machine

695
00:30:59,072 --> 00:30:59,840
Change how your settings

696
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:02,656
Change how you using one machine with another

697
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:05,472
Maybe a sprayers waiting for the water truck to show up to it

698
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:06,240
To refill it

699
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:07,520
Those are all

700
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:08,544
Solutions that we

701
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,312
We can provide

702
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:12,640
Now that this remote monitoring is available

703
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,944
And then you're adding

704
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,712
Sensors

705
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:19,040
So once you have the capability to know where you are

706
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:20,320
And the ability to

707
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:23,136
Transmit that information off board

708
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:28,256
Then two things happen one is you want to be able to learn more and more about what's going on

709
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:30,048
In the machine and around the machine

710
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:31,840
So that's where sensors come in

711
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:35,936
And second thing that you want to do is to be able to

712
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:36,960
Convert

713
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:38,752
All of that raw data

714
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:40,288
Into an insight

715
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:42,848
Okay so we're moving from notification

716
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:43,616
Action

717
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:49,248
That's right and it's just the kind of level set for those that aren't

718
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:51,552
Treme with the Baseline of where we are today

719
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:53,600
A lot of talk about driverless cars

720
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:54,880
In fact

721
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:58,208
Most of large equipment has the capability to be

722
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,256
Operated without steering it

723
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:02,816
So auto-steer within the field

724
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:05,376
So the farmer will typically come into the field

725
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,656
And let's say they're planting

726
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:08,960
They come into the field

727
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:11,008
They would set up there

728
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:15,104
GPS line their guidance line of the line that they want to start on

729
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:18,944
And then they took the steering wheel up out of the way in the machine operator

730
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:19,968
Allen Stone

731
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:22,016
Driving to the field on that line

732
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,344
You turn the machine around and then it will plant

733
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:28,160
And exactly parallel line to the first one

734
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:30,208
Offset by the width of the planter

735
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:35,328
Not only the steering itself on a on a perfectly straight line or or curved line depending on what you

736
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:38,912
But it's also having the ability to change the last

737
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:40,960
Change the speed at which it's running

738
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:43,264
And change what's happening on the planter

739
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,800
Change the rate at which it

740
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,616
The Planters planting season

741
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:49,920
Planting more in the high fertility areas

742
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:50,944
Lesson love

743
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,016
Those are just some examples of

744
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:57,344
Functions that are already highly automated on the machine

745
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,880
After your Stills in the cab

746
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:00,416
These things are happening

747
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:01,440
In an automated way

748
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:05,536
Soac is a seven and a half billion dollar

749
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,096
And you guys have been working on

750
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:11,168
Bringing the internet of things to your business for

751
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,704
Sounds like over a decade

752
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:15,008
Why did you guys get started

753
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,032
Addington

754
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:19,360
We felt this is one of the

755
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:21,408
The best ways to help farmers

756
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:23,968
Become more productive when you look at the

757
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,784
Technology that has recently become available on GPS

758
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,576
And then on telematics device

759
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:30,368
And then managing data

760
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,648
We thought

761
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:35,232
It would be a great opportunity to harness those capabilities

762
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:37,024
To be able about the world

763
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,304
Far more effectively

764
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:41,376
As part of the seven and a half billion dollars in Revenue

765
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:44,448
What percentage of it is

766
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,496
Based on connected services

767
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:48,544
Vs may be connected

768
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:52,384
Revenue generated from Services Estill

769
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:54,176
It's in the early stages

770
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,200
We're just transitioning

771
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:55,968
From

772
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:57,760
Selling the technology

773
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:59,808
To accompany this now poker

774
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:01,344
Gaston delivering services

775
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,880
Around that technology

776
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:04,928
Advising Farmers on how to change

777
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:05,952
Practices

778
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,512
But the

779
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:10,304
Scope it covers is

780
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,840
Most of what act

781
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:12,608
Cassell's

782
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:13,888
So do you sell

783
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:15,424
The connectivity itself

784
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:17,472
Or do you sell the inside

785
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,264
How do you guys sell

786
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:21,056
Precision AG

787
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:22,848
Yeah we're transitioning

788
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,640
To a company that sells

789
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:26,688
Subscription Service package

790
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:28,736
So what's the machine

791
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:30,272
And many

792
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:32,320
A customer can just buy the machine if they like to

793
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:36,416
But we're moving to a company then that will sell the machine Plus

794
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:38,464
Service packages around those machine

795
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:40,512
That can be based on

796
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:43,328
For example focusing on up time let's say

797
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,352
To be

798
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:45,376
Looking at

799
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:50,240
Indicators off the machine to be predicting when components will fail before they will fail

800
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:52,032
Or more precisely

801
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:53,056
Schedule maintenance

802
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:55,360
Around exactly when the machine needs

803
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:56,128
To maintain

804
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,664
Flex one category

805
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,712
Second categories machine optimization

806
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:01,760
Helping helping cell service pack

807
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:04,320
Optimizing how machine is used

808
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:07,392
Any category is helping with Farm up

809
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:08,160
Sensation

810
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:09,952
But we're going to be selling

811
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:11,488
Service packages to

812
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,048
Give insights to the farmer on

813
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:15,072
Different elements

814
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:15,840
Father Fermin

815
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:16,608
Today

816
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:17,632
Versus

817
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:18,400
How they could be

818
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:20,704
It could be and how

819
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,008
When is free application to

820
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,544
To attack weeds

821
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,568
Recommending

822
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:26,592
The timing of that

823
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:29,152
There's a number of different farming recommendation

824
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:30,432
I can also come out of

825
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:32,480
Inside the farm

826
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:33,248
Are using Wireless

827
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:37,344
Probably a decade ago we had this huge

828
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,368
Shift tonight

829
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,952
We're instead of companies buying their own servers they bought come

830
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:43,744
And it shifted

831
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,328
They're compute cost basically from a capex to an object

832
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:49,120
Situation financing

833
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:50,912
And if I look at

834
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:52,192
What's happening

835
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:53,216
In farming

836
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:56,288
And this kind of idea of providing Solutions inside

837
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:59,616
Do you see that same sort of shift

838
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:04,480
Possibly happening for agriculture or will there still always be massive

839
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:05,760
Expenditures that

840
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:12,416
Yeah I think there's going to be quite a Continuum there's going to be a certain segment of the market that I think over the course of

841
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:14,720
Time will evolve to the point where

842
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:17,536
Ultimately they will pay for

843
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:19,328
The outcome so it could be

844
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,864
Grain harvesting

845
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:24,704
Or seeds planted or Acres planted or something like that

846
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,728
And that

847
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:26,496
Someone else

848
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:28,544
Potentially AGCO would be

849
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:29,824
Managing

850
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:30,848
Not only the

851
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:32,384
Equipment within how they quit

852
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,176
Let's maintain our equipment operated

853
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:38,016
And I'm guaranteeing a certain outcome to the farmer

854
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:41,856
You see this happening in mining operations there more Bass

855
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:42,624
Navel

856
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,648
Charge the cusp

857
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:46,720
Play the quantity of War removed

858
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:48,512
Is the closest thing the machine

859
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,304
Get there

860
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:51,328
Much like

861
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:53,120
The technology Journey that

862
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:54,144
Technology doesn't show up

863
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,680
All at once it comes in steps

864
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:57,984
So we've been building the technology Journey

865
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,544
Now we're building the services Journey

866
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,568
MCU

867
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:07,968
Fill out these pieces one step at a time you get the customer comfortable and digesting the value that makes sense for their far

868
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:08,992
Piece by piece

869
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:10,528
Each one has their own

870
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:11,808
Coyote and wolf

871
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:13,344
Pieces are most valuable to them

872
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,392
And then over the course of time

873
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:16,672
You fill in the puzzle piece

874
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:17,440
Until

875
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:21,280
You know these leave users ultimately say you know what I'd rather

876
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:24,096
Focus on the other elements of my operation and

877
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:25,632
And let you manage

878
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:28,704
The machine and optimizing how that machine works I'm going to

879
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:30,240
Optimize The Other Woman

880
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:32,544
So a lot of the

881
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,824
Adoption of

882
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:35,360
The cloud computing model

883
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:39,200
Is Opex vs capex was taken

884
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:44,064
In the tech World by startups in kind of Greenfield operations because

885
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:45,344
Either there

886
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,672
Venture capitalist Preston to do that just made more sense based on their

887
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:49,696
Models

888
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:50,720
Or

889
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:53,536
They had no existing infrastructure even Creek

890
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:54,560
Oceans

891
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:57,120
So farming does not feel like

892
00:37:57,888 --> 00:37:59,424
It has a similar level of

893
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,472
Churn and startups I could be wrong

894
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:07,104
It feels like a much more old-school industry so I'm curious how

895
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,152
You guys will push this sort of shift

896
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:09,920
In the farm

897
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:10,688
Industry

898
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:16,320
Persol one Farmers not the same as the next Dairy Farmers a little bit different than what they need and their appetite for

899
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:18,624
Change in their comfort with technology

900
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,672
We're trying to end up with a few different

901
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:21,952
Solutions for different groups

902
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:22,720
Customers

903
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:24,000
But

904
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:26,560
In general if you got to take a step back and

905
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:27,328
Simplify

906
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,632
What we would say is that

907
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:30,912
We're going to need to

908
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:33,472
Look at those customers that are most

909
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,264
What's a business-minded

910
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:38,848
And most comfortable with technology and end

911
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:42,176
Payoffs of value think of it in terms of an Roi

912
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:44,736
And work with them first to generate

913
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:46,528
A success story

914
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:50,368
Now not only do we need to work with our customers we also have to work with our dealers

915
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:53,696
Because most of our equipment comes to our customers through it

916
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:55,232
Channel of independent dealers

917
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,512
Hello and they hate

918
00:38:57,792 --> 00:39:02,400
Well if there's a mixture there's well isn't there there's a mixture of those early adopters who

919
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:03,424
Embrace

920
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:05,472
This conversation about

921
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:06,752
I working

922
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:08,800
Not only with technology but with

923
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:15,200
Changing a relationship with a customer instead of selling them a machine and then waiting a while until the phone

924
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:16,224
Calls music

925
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:18,016
I need to know

926
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:19,552
24 hours

927
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:22,368
Remotely monitoring that customer and that machine

928
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:23,392
To be able to help the cusp

929
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:24,416
Make the most of it

930
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:26,464
Does a shift in the relationship

931
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:32,352
Doesn't that imply like if you have it you if you're delivering a service I feel like a middleman is a terrible thing to have

932
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:33,888
So when it makes sense

933
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,448
Look into providing that monitoring

934
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:38,752
Bring yourself as the company providing this Hardware

935
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:41,056
This is a tough transition

936
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:45,152
Yeah if there's going to be a mixture

937
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:47,712
Where we're going to do some of these

938
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:48,736
Services

939
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:50,784
Especially the data analytics

940
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:53,344
Some of them will be done Central look like they're done

941
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,112
Sexually

942
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:56,672
Interact with the customers directly from a

943
00:39:57,184 --> 00:40:00,000
Some of them will be done centrally just because there's an economy is

944
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:00,768
Scale

945
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:06,400
Of analyzing large amounts of data storing large amounts of data and song we don't want every dealer trying to figure that out themselves

946
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:09,472
But we will deploy back to the customers through the dealer

947
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:12,288
So because the customer relationship is there and

948
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:15,616
Especially if it's around machine repair or machine maintenance

949
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:17,152
That's going to be done by the dealer

950
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,968
So the dealer will Lemay and the

951
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:25,600
Inside back to the dealer and say there's a repair opportunity coming up or maintenance opportunity coming up

952
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:27,392
But then the dealer will call the cops

953
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:29,184
Marceau look to the customer

954
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:30,208
From the dealer

955
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:32,256
In a third kind are going to be some

956
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:33,536
More local

957
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:34,560
Dealer generators

958
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:35,328
Solutions

959
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,376
Where the deal is going to be looking at

960
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:40,960
Specific issues with their customer base in their local geography

961
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:42,752
And coming up with some of their own optimist

962
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,544
And that will be directed

963
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,568
Between the dealer in Augusta

964
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:48,128
It'll show up in all three forms

965
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,944
I depending on the kind of work that's needed in

966
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:54,528
And this is a hard thing to do as a business

967
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:57,344
This is to transition from selling a physical product

968
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:58,624
2

969
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,928
Selling a service especially because

970
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,488
Your service is going to be wrapped around a physical

971
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:04,256
Co-product

972
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:09,120
So how do you guys think about managing your costs in your supply chain

973
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:10,656
Kind of

974
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:13,216
Adjust for the the way the income is

975
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:17,568
Yeah one of the things I say here is that

976
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:19,872
Diffuse strategy as a

977
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:20,640
Feud

978
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:24,480
We're not the only ones going after this idea trying to help farmers become more productive

979
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:30,368
One of the tenants of the few strategy that makes a difference is that

980
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,392
We have a

981
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:35,488
We're intending to be the most open architecture approach of anybody in the industry

982
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:37,024
Car that is

983
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:40,096
What the customer sees but then the other half that is the

984
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:41,376
The back-office side

985
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:43,680
We're not going to do all this ourselves

986
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:47,008
In order to deliver the competency and create the company

987
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:49,824
We're partnering up with a few different

988
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:51,104
Companies

989
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:52,640
To be able to

990
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:54,431
Leverage their strong EX

991
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:56,991
And given area and come to the market

992
00:41:57,503 --> 00:42:01,087
With a package that looks like it's one package but was actually

993
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:02,623
Created by

994
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:04,159
A few different groups working

995
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:08,255
That helped spread some of this cost burden over a broader base

996
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:09,535
And it reduces

997
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:11,583
The inefficiency of trying to

998
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:13,119
Invent all of this on our own

999
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:16,703
Got it so can you give me an example of what that is

1000
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:17,727
What that looks like

1001
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:21,567
Will one of the examples would be our guidance

1002
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:25,919
The guidance is the GPS receiver is made up of a GPS receiver

1003
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:27,967
The signal from the satellite

1004
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:31,039
And then a navigation controller in the middle and then

1005
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:33,599
It actually makes action on

1006
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:34,879
The steering signal

1007
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:35,903
2

1008
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:36,927
Steer the machine

1009
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:41,023
Well historically you needed to buy all of that from one provider

1010
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:42,815
And so the customer would be

1011
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:43,839
Lockton

1012
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:46,143
Two provider AR provider beer providers

1013
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:49,215
But we've done is we've come up

1014
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:53,055
With a system that we've launched in the market this past year

1015
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:54,335
That is

1016
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:55,359
Agnostic

1017
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:57,151
Guidance and what we mean by that is

1018
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:58,175
The customer can choose

1019
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:00,479
It's an open guidance platform

1020
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:02,783
We've partnered up with a few different guidance

1021
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:03,551
Companies

1022
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:05,087
And we buy

1023
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:06,367
Their receiver

1024
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:09,695
And so we we've got multiple choice

1025
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:13,279
For the customer to make based on what their farming situation is on the

1026
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:16,095
Coverage in their geography what are the machines they have on the farm

1027
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:17,631
What makes more sense for them

1028
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:21,215
And we write the software code in the middle of navigation

1029
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:22,239
Control software

1030
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:24,287
And and make it look like

1031
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:27,359
1 Echo System regardless of what the input was

1032
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:29,919
And how do you guys from a

1033
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:31,967
Just purely from a business perspective

1034
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:35,039
How are you guys measuring success

1035
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:36,319
As you guys switch from

1036
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:37,855
Hardware

1037
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:38,879
Services

1038
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:40,927
Old school to New School

1039
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:43,231
You know there's a few different measures

1040
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:46,815
But we need this to be a profitable business with an echo

1041
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:48,863
Insofar shareholders we've got

1042
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:52,191
Goals on revenue and and margin and growth rate

1043
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:54,239
So I'm on one handed

1044
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:55,519
It's like any other business

1045
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:57,311
Degenerated song

1046
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:58,335
Prophet Andrew

1047
00:43:58,847 --> 00:43:59,615
On the other hand it's

1048
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:00,639
It's a significant

1049
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:02,943
Transition

1050
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:05,247
Phase within the industry and with an egg called

1051
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:07,551
So we're measuring other things in addition to that

1052
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:10,879
Like percent of machines sold with service contracts

1053
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:12,927
Adoption rates on different

1054
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:14,463
Regions of the world

1055
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:15,999
Different machine forms

1056
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:17,791
Different levels of the

1057
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:20,351
And then

1058
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:23,167
Activation rates of how many of those service package

1059
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:23,935
Jahzare

1060
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:25,727
Are activated and renewed

1061
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:28,287
And then satisfaction on the back end so

1062
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:31,871
When you're in a transition phase you have to

1063
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,407
Focused on additional

1064
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:35,711
Factors beyond just the financial

1065
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:36,479
Performance

1066
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:38,015
Because you need to cause the

1067
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:38,783
Phase transition

1068
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:40,831
And that's why we're looking

1069
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:41,855
Some of those other measures

1070
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:42,879
To make sure that work

1071
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:46,207
Treating activity change the behavior change

1072
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:49,023
And I own the company as well as with our dealers

1073
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:54,399
Such that the customers make we make sure that the customer seen the value out of the service package

1074
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:57,215
Yeah I guess you guys have to worry about chernow

1075
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:58,239
That's right

1076
00:44:58,751 --> 00:44:59,263
Exactly

1077
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:00,031
All right

1078
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:01,823
