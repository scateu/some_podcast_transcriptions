00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:19,616
Is Carlos Herrera the CEO of petnet which you guys may remember because it is a service that went down and everybody was worried

26
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:20,384
About dead

27
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:23,200
But Carlos tells us

28
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:25,504
Everything that happened and what he learned from it

29
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,528
It's a good interview

30
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:27,296
So

31
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:28,832
Stay tuned for a moment from

32
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,368
A message from our sponsor

33
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:37,024
This week sponsor is armed nothing highlights iot security more than a hacked car driven in

34
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:43,424
Into a ditch Charlie Miller part of the team that have two cheap in 2015 will keynote arms techcon in 2016

At their October 25th through 27th event Miller was described how he and his partner infiltrated a movie

36
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:56,224
Moving vehicle and how we can tighten security across the network so join arm this month in Santa Clara for arm techcon and

37
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:02,624
Register today at arm techcon. Com I will be there so I will see you

38
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:09,024
Okay hopefully you're not going to be in a jeep so good

39
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:09,792
Let's talk

40
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:10,560
About

41
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:13,376
Nuthatch keeps other will get to hacked cameras

42
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:16,960
I don't think there's where that a Jeep is involved in the

43
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:17,984
In the DDOS attack

44
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:20,288
Verso

45
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:22,080
All right

46
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:22,848
The new wing

47
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:23,616
Hub

48
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:26,176
We had heard that this was coming from a leech

49
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,712
Amazon screenshot

50
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:28,480
In semi

51
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:29,248
Pink stuff at the home

52
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,296
Lo behold

53
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:32,832
In October

54
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:33,856
Wink will be

55
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,648
You providing us with a brand new hub

56
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,440
And it has

57
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:39,232
An internet port which

58
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:42,048
Kevin you are not excited by but some people might find it

59
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:45,888
I'm not really moved by that but I do think it's a good addition

60
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,936
And it's going to have Bluetooth

61
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:52,288
The reason Bluetooth is so exciting as it can act as a link for

62
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,056
Your

63
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,336
Bluetooth enabled

64
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:56,640
Things like a doorbell and it translates it over

65
00:02:56,896 --> 00:03:00,992
Wi-Fi network is only have remote access to all of the stuff in your house without all these little

66
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:03,040
Like Bluetooth bridges that you have to

67
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:05,600
And so that's cool

68
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:06,624
Other reason

69
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,440
The Bluetooth is exciting is a new thing that we did

70
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,208
It's going to make

71
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:12,512
Actually setting up iot devices

72
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:15,072
Easier in this only happens during the

73
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:15,840
Initial setup

74
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:18,144
But during the initial setup your instead of

75
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,728
Relying on the soft AP creation which is what we call it when

76
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,264
How to connect a device

77
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:24,288
Plugging in

78
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:26,080
Creates its own wifi hotspot

79
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,104
Has to find it in the

80
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,760
Everything happens right on my Android

81
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:37,088
Because my phone is like trying so hard

82
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:37,856
2

83
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:38,880
You keep me online

84
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,696
I have to turn off the cellular data on my phone

85
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,256
Actually hook things up to my device

86
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,024
My phone otherwise is

87
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:45,792
Like it never works

88
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,704
So yeah the phone the phone is trying to get that redundant connection because it thinks you want to be connected all the time obviously and

89
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,472
Make sense

90
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:57,312
It hates when I like adding a device using my Android is always

91
00:03:59,104 --> 00:03:59,616
What's up

92
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:02,176
The Bluetooth connection no allows

93
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:02,944
The

94
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,504
Data about why something's messing up

95
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,272
2

96
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:10,880
It tells the devices Echo stop doing this so now they've built software that makes it a lot easier to

97
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,208
And this will be nice for people who are like

98
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:16,000
A little bit more normal who are like

99
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,024
Not listeners

100
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,047
Perhaps of the show and

101
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:20,351
I did not know I could turn off my cellular data on my

102
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:21,887
And

103
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:22,911
That is going to be

104
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:27,263
Wonderful the other thing they added as part of the setup process is if you have an old hub

105
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:29,823
You can actually transfer everything over

106
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:33,151
The Staples connect Hub actually did this but

107
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,431
And it's no longer on the

108
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:39,551
Useful so if you have an old week though you might be saying

109
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,575
Gosh

110
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:41,599
Do I upgrade

111
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:42,879
Kevin are you saying that

112
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:49,791
Yeah I'm kind of I'm kind of on the fence on this and I'm a big fan / user

113
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:56,191
Of the wink Hub that I bought maybe a year-and-a-half ago or fantastic for me my entire smart home is built around it

114
00:04:56,703 --> 00:05:02,847
The fact that this one is 25% Slimmer it's nice that's okay it's not a compelling reason to me

115
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:03,615
Ethernet

116
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:07,967
Personally not compelling to me however I can definitely see why people might want that

117
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:14,367
I actually preferred of wireless connection with the wink Hub because I can put it anywhere that it does not. Hang off a router

118
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:20,255
That was one of the actual selling points to me what again this is a bonus for for a lot of people I'm sure

119
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:26,655
Turn the radios they've also added a thread capable radio and really there's not much that takes advantage of

120
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:29,983
Not yet a compelling reason to upgrade

121
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:32,031
So I will tell you

122
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,823
Tell me you're not home Kik

123
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:34,591
Compatible

124
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,127
At this moment

125
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,663
There is a place for a home

126
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,431
Kit radio

127
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,199
But

128
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:43,295
Place for it you can't go until you're

129
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,087
You're actually part of the home

130
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,135
Correct

131
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:47,903
So

132
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,183
That is

133
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,999
TVD so if homekit is important to you

134
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,535
This may not be the Hub

135
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:56,095
Yet yet

136
00:05:59,167 --> 00:05:59,679
But again

137
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:06,847
I do like an again not enough for me to upgrade you like the fact that they've I think

138
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:11,711
Up the memory inside from 64 mag to 512 mag

139
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:18,111
My Hub run stable so I had to run into that issue one thing I do like and I'm considering this in my

140
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,391
Decision making

141
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:25,791
Process here they have beefed up the security and I believe I think they've done it through

142
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:30,143
Hardware in that the wink Hub when it boots up will make sure

143
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,423
It has

144
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,447
The same

145
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:38,847
Secure verified firmware that it had the last time it booted up and if it doesn't

146
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:42,943
It will be able to revert back to the safe secure

147
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,247
Meaning it's a lot less

148
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:49,087
Susceptible to being hacked or reprogrammed without your knowledge

149
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,623
So that's something

150
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,159
That has me thinking about it

151
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,695
The security efforts they went

152
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,463
Through here

153
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:57,023
Given the beginning

154
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,047
Horribly inside

155
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:58,815
Secure hub

156
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,607
It just was it was hacked mode

157
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,399
Multiple times they fixed it

158
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:04,959
But that really shows that they are working

159
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:05,983
Hard on getting

160
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:06,751
Ignis Wraith

161
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:09,823
And I will say that the new Hub is $99

162
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,591
And

163
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:13,919
They're adding a new retail partner so it will be available

164
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,199
On their site

165
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:16,479
In Home Depot

166
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,247
And at

167
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,015
Walmart

168
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:19,807
Yeah I saw that

169
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,855
Song that's that's good

170
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:26,975
Yeah I thought it was I thought it was really kind of worthwhile because Walmart is definitely

171
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,767
Now I also kind of wonder if it's

172
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:30,047
Because they burn Target

173
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,863
They had their big giant security

174
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:33,631
Blind

175
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,655
Recall kind of thing

176
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:35,679
And that I think

177
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,471
Turn them off

178
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:43,871
Yeah I could be I could well be it's hard to decide what I mean so long as there were they mainstream retailer I think I vote

179
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:50,271
Was very very well for forty Winks one other one other aspect that again is on Meatheads

180
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,807
Me thinking maybe I upgrade

181
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,343
That new Wi-Fi radio

182
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:57,439
Is no longer just 2.4 gigahertz actually supports 5 gigahertz haswell

183
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:59,487
Yeah that's that's pretty big

184
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:04,095
It's $99 I mean this is not like a $500 outlay of cash so

185
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,375
I say that I

186
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:10,239
Probably not going to upgrade but I have a feeling at some point I'm just going to pull the trigger and do it anyway

187
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,543
Sew-in and I asked I asked WinCo's like

188
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:16,639
What do you tell people who have this is something they should upgrade to and he's like you don't

189
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:19,455
You can if you want we're still supporting the old version

190
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,551
This is really a product to get new people in the

191
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:30,719
Amen in that respect I think it's a very compelling product at that price point for what it supports the radio

192
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,767
Upgrade the security

193
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:36,351
Yeah I mean again I bought my wink very happy with it

194
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,631
If I didn't have one

195
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:43,263
Without a doubt I probably go out and get this one so you can also wait for Christmas

196
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,799
And you know give someone you love

197
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:47,103
Be smart home package cuz I bet there's going to be somebody

198
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,639
That's my Hutch

199
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:50,175
Cuz you got Walmart

200
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,199
You got Black Friday

201
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,735
You got Home Depot

202
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:54,527
Good point

203
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,831
So if you're not in any Rush

204
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:00,159
VII Council people to Russian

205
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:00,927
Into the Smart Home

206
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:08,095
Don't you want me to

207
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,655
So yeah

208
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:15,775
That's that's the Wink News I'm excited in for all of us who were like

209
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:19,359
Quirky went bankrupt what happens to WinCo o-flex potwin

210
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:21,663
What happened to wink now we can be a little bit by

211
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:22,943
I think

212
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,735
It feels like ants

213
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:26,527
Company in a product that we're like

214
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:27,807
They're behind it

215
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:31,391
So let's talk about how your wink might be delivered to you

216
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:39,839
Yes so some people may really like it is whereas other people may really hate this but Amazon is

217
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:42,399
Reportedly working on in home package deliveries

218
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:48,799
Not at home in home your package will be in your house I will they do that well the information says

219
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,359
Listen attack princess report this as well

220
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:57,759
That Amazon is working with some of its iottie retailers or the products

221
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,807
It sells it products with

222
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,855
Such as August and garageio

223
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:08,255
Working with them to give temporary access to get in your home to leave a package

224
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:13,375
That's kind of scary and cool at the same time so August make smart locks

225
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:16,447
Garageio makes

226
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:22,847
Siri you'd order something from Amazon and give the okay to have the package delivered in your house provided you

227
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:26,431
You have an August lock or garageio garage door opener

228
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:31,551
I don't know I mean it's his great Stacy for people who

229
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:36,927
Aren't there to receive packages don't want them sitting out all the time maybe they've had packages stolen

230
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:41,023
But are you going to give access to your house

231
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,863
So August has this quote they had actually the access

232
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,143
August access

233
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,167
4

234
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,447
Almost a year now

235
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:49,727
Amanda

236
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,519
They will that be

237
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,799
People into

238
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:55,871
Like people are actually using this for

239
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:56,895
Both

240
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,967
Normal people like your Maids your dog walkers those

241
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,527
Things but also for like delivery of services

242
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:07,647
So it's a formal service that August offers and they have Partnerships with

243
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,439
Postmates in

244
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,487
I want to say

245
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:12,511
Sears appliance

246
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:13,791
That could be a

247
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:18,143
And with that I mean the ideas you know if you have Smart cameras in your house

248
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,167
You can actually watch this house

249
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:22,495
Which if the person went into your house in like

250
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:23,263
Mike stole your dog

251
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,823
Like oh well that's who did it

252
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,151
I'm not sure if that's that's comforting or not

253
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:31,199
So this makes sense

254
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:33,759
And I love that Amazon might give is

255
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:34,527
Imprimatur

256
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:35,295
To this

257
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,575
And say hey guys

258
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,367
Why don't you have that like

259
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:41,183
I actually today today on Wednesday while we

260
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,975
We're recording this I'm getting a makeup delivery

261
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:45,023
At home and I'm really sad about it

262
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,559
Really hot and

263
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,167
So I would love the ability

264
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,959
We're like my Blue Apron tool

265
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:54,751
When those real

266
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:55,519
Inside

267
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:56,799
I just feel slightly better

268
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,127
Sophia

269
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:06,527
I definitely see the value I just wonder what happens the first time something doesn't go

270
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:12,927
Alright like somebody is delivering something in your house and something missing or they're sitting on your couch watching TV for an hour

271
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,975
Can you find out what is

272
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:20,863
Amazon going to Deming they're putting potentially their name and brand behind this that's the surprising bit to me

273
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,655
In a situation like this

274
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:23,935
I imagine you have a cat

275
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:27,007
If Amazon actually does create its own

276
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,287
Own network of delivery

277
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,311
People with

278
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:31,359
Its own airplanes all that good stuff

279
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,383
True true

280
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,407
Treated like

281
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,175
Budget Inn

282
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,199
Employees I mean

283
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:37,503
We let people into our homes all the time

284
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,295
Not everybody but some people do

285
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,575
And you don't have to do

286
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,367
That's the other thing

287
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,647
I mean

288
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,695
Laundry for people who feel like

289
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:50,815
You know and I think having a camera will help

290
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,351
I'm not sure I would do it

291
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:54,655
But I also work from home so I'm not sure I really

292
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:59,519
I just want as many options as possible to have the

293
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,567
Storage lockers

294
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,335
They have

295
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:08,223
Am I have drones delivering stuff to you one day they have them

296
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,247
Putting stuff in the

297
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,527
People's cars

298
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:16,927
Anything I can do to remove barriers between you and a product they're doing or trying to do so I guess

299
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,463
Again I think it'll be

300
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:20,767
Polarizing

301
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,559
But the end of the day you're right it's

302
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:25,375
It's up to you if they do decide to offer this

303
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:27,423
Each individual makes a decision so

304
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,727
And by golly if they're going to offer me Disco

305
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,007
Super excited

306
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,847
Oh you have to go around

307
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:36,639
That this locked

308
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,919
Because none of my front doors have

309
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:42,271
But it's free delivery if you let us put an ad on your door lock

310
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:48,927
Man I bought so many I have the ad version of the Kindle

311
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:50,463
Oh my gosh

312
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,999
I have bought so many

313
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,279
$3 books

314
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,047
Because of that thing

315
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,327
There you go

316
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,863
I'm like

317
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:57,631
You're very good

318
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,911
Okay so

319
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,703
That's cool stuff coming

320
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:01,983
In-services friend

321
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:08,383
Let's talk about the Apple Watch 2 as a fitness tracker since

322
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,687
Last week because we were so busy talking about I don't even know

323
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:17,087
Well that's okay because I literally just got it the night before the last show so it's probably best that we waited a week because

324
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:22,207
I've now had an extra seven days to determine if it's a good Fitness tracker

325
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:28,607
And I have to say in just to put some perspective around this I run everyday I think today is day 111 of my daily

326
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:34,495
Running Street I do track my steps I'm not so keen on tracking my sleep which the Apple watch really does not do

327
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:39,871
Effectively partially because of battery life partially because there's no native function to do so

328
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:46,271
What is a fitness tracker having previously warned the fitbits and Darius Android Wear watches

329
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:52,927
I'm pretty impressed I have to say no granted I bought the series to watch which has GPS

330
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:56,511
And that is that that was a key

331
00:14:56,767 --> 00:15:02,655
Negative for me on the first Apple watch I had to run with my phone if I want to use the Apple activity

332
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,447
Cracker witch

333
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,983
Just didn't like running is my phone

334
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:09,567
So the GPS is working fantastic I've compared to the

335
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:14,943
Various seven or eight runs that I've had this with prior runs GPS looks spot-on

336
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,271
The heart rate monitor is kind of disappointing to me though

337
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:23,391
I do run with the heart rate monitor on and it seems like no matter what every time I start a run

338
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:28,255
The Apple watch has my heart rate pegged around 160 to 170

339
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:34,655
Yeah that's like what my eight and a half minute mile pace is when I've actually been running for a bit like

340
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,215
What's going on

341
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:43,615
The strange thing is usually about halfway through the first mile it seems to settle down back into the

342
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,919
140s Maybe 150s

343
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:52,319
What is throwing off my average heart rate for sure so that's very strange to me I don't know why that's doing that don't know if that's

344
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:55,391
Just me and my Apple watch with others are having that same issue whatever

345
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:58,975
How does the heart rate monitor work is it is it the lights is it a galvanic

346
00:15:59,487 --> 00:15:59,999
Carrabba's

347
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:06,399
Yeah I know it's it's the same as the original Apple watches are totally unchanged it's the same for Led You Know

348
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:10,751
Node sensors under the under the the base of the Apple watch so

349
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:12,543
No difference there and I

350
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:16,383
I don't recall this being an issue with my earlier version but then again

351
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,455
I was so kind of turned off McNab GPS I really wouldn't

352
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:23,039
Spend a lot of time using it as a fitness tracker so

353
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:29,183
Regular heart rate monitor is fine I mean if I check my heart rate now I'm sure it's you know probably 165 70 beats a minute

354
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,463
Uggs

355
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:32,255
No I'm old

356
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:37,631
So that's that's 1 1/4 I will also say this

357
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:44,287
If you want to take your Fitness data out of the Apple iOS ecosystem it is still nearly Impala

358
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:49,151
Possible there are some third-party apps that try and do this for you they don't get all the data

359
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:53,503
Apple has not made it easy to get at share the data and that's disappointing to me I have

360
00:16:54,015 --> 00:17:00,159
I don't know 7 years now of data and RunKeeper so I like to put my my

361
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:05,279
I did in there I have to do it manually with the Apple watch and that's that's frustrating disappointing

362
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:07,583
It's it's just disappointing

363
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,631
One last bit on the GPS

364
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,935
There's no indicator to tell you

365
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:12,703
If

366
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,751
The watch has a GPS signal and I

367
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:16,543
Down that frustrating at first

368
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:23,199
But they do a really good job at using Wi-Fi assisted GPS and other methods to

369
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:23,967
You actually

370
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:26,527
Get your signal pretty quick you don't know it

371
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:28,831
When it has a signal yet

372
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:29,599
It's

373
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,879
Pinspot on

374
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:34,463
So kudos to the man that I do is that an indicator there so

375
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,487
Okay and then

376
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:37,023
How does it affect the battery life

377
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:42,143
Yeah good question because the original Apple watch was definitely just a one-day

378
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,423
Device on a charge

379
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,031
It pretty much still is I'm getting marginally better battery life and that's including

380
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:54,431
The GPS tracking as well as listening to music on my Bluetooth headset headphones and heart rate monitor

381
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:59,551
Typically if I go out and run anywhere from music 35 miles in a day

382
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:01,343
I still have

383
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:03,647
Battery life left at the end of the day

384
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:09,279
So the GPS isn't hitting it that much and warm apple has boosted the battery capacity which I believe they have

385
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,815
This watch is a little thicker

386
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:14,399
I think it did a good job managing that I quit on

387
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:20,799
I can probably answer that question better next show because I'm running a half marathon on Sunday with it which will be

388
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,591
Roughly two hours of running

389
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:25,151
I'm sure to get through it all because Apple says

390
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,687
5 hours with GPS

391
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:27,455
So

392
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,479
Okay well

393
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:29,503
I'm back in next week

394
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,295
Alright in kind of

395
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,575
Smaller news Atwood

396
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:33,855
Definitely thought we should cover

397
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:36,159
We have to talk about the DDOS attack

398
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,951
Brian Krebs

399
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:39,743
And the reason we have to talk about it

400
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:40,767
Is

401
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:42,303
Apparently this was a

402
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,863
Between a 600 and 700 gigabit

403
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,911
Per second DDOS attack which is freaky

404
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,215
And

405
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:53,567
Part of the devices that were in this attack or actually

406
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:56,127
Security cameras IP security cameras

407
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,151
And

408
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,943
Some smart TVs

409
00:18:59,199 --> 00:18:59,711
So

410
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:00,735
That's insane

411
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:03,551
That's another reason to like lockdown your

412
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:05,599
Because my God

413
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,415
That's actually at this event that I'm in

414
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,951
We'll talk about it next week

415
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:11,743
Cuz I got a bunch more iot stuff happening

416
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:12,511
Today

417
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,047
But one of the big seems is peep

418
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:15,327
People keep bringing up his attack

419
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,095
Can their legs look

420
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:18,911
Having connected devices everywhere

421
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:20,959
And just bringing him into your home

422
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:21,983
And your business

423
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:26,335
Increase your attack surface but it also increases the tools that hackers

424
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,103
Could use to it

425
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:27,871
Attack people

426
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:28,895
And

427
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,687
Because he's are devices

428
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:31,967
The people you know

429
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,247
You can tell when your

430
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,015
Computers at fact

431
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,063
For the most part

432
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:36,831
Put

433
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:38,879
Because you don't check in on your iPad

434
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:39,903
Very often

435
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:42,463
Because hackers are very Savvy about how to

436
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,231
I use it

437
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:43,999
Decency

438
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:44,767
Can be infected in

439
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:45,535
Depart of like

440
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,559
A botnet army

441
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:55,519
I was just going to say you never know as long as you're getting you know your camera feed on command or on demand

442
00:19:55,775 --> 00:20:00,383
You don't know what else that processor inside that device is doing with the connection that has

443
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:01,151
So

444
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:02,431
You just wouldn't know

445
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:05,759
Exactly so there's a lot of talk out there about this being a

446
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:06,527
Threat against

447
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:07,295
Free speech be

448
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,831
Because Brian Krebs was actually take

449
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:09,599
Down by

450
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:11,647
Was actually

451
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:12,671
Attacked

452
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:13,695
And his

453
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:14,975
Security provider prolex

454
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:16,511
Akamai

455
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:18,047
They said hey you know what

456
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,327
We're doing this for you

457
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,887
For free we had to absorb you know almost 700

458
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:22,655
Gigabits per second

459
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,423
Traffic

460
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:26,239
Do this so now he's actually under

461
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,007
Google

462
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:27,775
Has there

463
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:28,799
Shield Project

464
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:29,567
Journalist

465
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,359
So kudos to Google

466
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:32,639
Golfer for having that

467
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:34,175
Cuz they they aren't there now hosting

468
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:35,455
But

469
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:38,015
All in all this is just a this is just kind of

470
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:39,551
Scary

471
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:41,343
And not just for the

472
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:43,647
Consumer report for the World At Large

473
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:46,207
This is going to be out there in that that's going to be a big

474
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:53,631
Nothing here is with the proliferation of so many connected devices

475
00:20:53,887 --> 00:21:00,031
I suspect this is not the first time we're not the last time rather that we're going to see this I mean

476
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:05,407
So many of them really are insecure and people don't realize that and we've harped on this before

477
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:08,991
Security of a device should be part of your decision making process

478
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:09,759
And

479
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:13,087
So I'll try this there was a there was a story about

480
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:15,647
I think it was a Texas mom I can't remember who.

481
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:16,416
Houston

482
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:18,208
And their baby camera

483
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:18,976
Was hacked

484
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:21,536
And what was interesting here is they were like

485
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,840
Look we actually change the password

486
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:24,864
My camera

487
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:26,656
From you know password rap

488
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,728
We change that

489
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:32,288
And what happened was they hadn't changed their password on

490
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,056
Their router

491
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:38,432
I'm bringing this up because we hear a lot today about this is how you saw this you changed

492
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:39,456
The password on your device

493
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:41,248
I feel like most sophisticated

494
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:43,808
But

495
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:46,112
Now you got to go back and be like oh

496
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:46,880
My router

497
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:47,648
Password

498
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:48,416
Change that

499
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:52,512
If it's a whole chain of devices that's the thing and then

500
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:58,912
I think people will miss out on that and I just will do what you would just Jezebel change the password on a particular device sale

501
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:00,192
Okay now the problem is fixed

502
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:03,264
And yet the weak Link in the chain is not fixed so

503
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:08,640
It's actually getting kind of crazy man you almost have to be an IT Network admin to start

504
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:10,944
Really making sure that you're 100% secure

505
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:12,224
Yes and that's

506
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:12,992
Not tenable

507
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:17,344
It's not why we think about that maybe next week I'll have a brand new security model

508
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,648
Why haven't you come back with a solution

509
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:20,928
Probably not guys

510
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:22,464
Talk about it

511
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:27,328
Cool news sap has decided they're going to spend up to

512
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:30,656
2 to billion dollars in int Investments they started out by buying a

513
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:31,424
Company called

514
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,192
Platte1

515
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:34,752
That is kind of a Jasper like service that offers

516
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:36,800
Tizen 2

517
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:38,336
Rihanna platform

518
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:40,640
Coyote

519
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:41,664
And I also bought it

520
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,432
Company in

521
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:44,224
When was Norway

522
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:47,040
Adam and that does kind of

523
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:48,064
Vision stuff

524
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:49,344
Patience.

525
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:52,928
They see the future it sees things

526
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:58,560
Computer vision in also is part of creating a digital twin

527
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:01,376
And this is a concept that super popular in the industrial leader

528
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:03,168
It is a cool concept

529
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:04,704
Comes from NASA

530
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,472
And

531
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:07,008
The idea is that

532
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,568
In the real world you have a device or app

533
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:10,336
Piece of machinery

534
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:14,176
And it is so outfitted with sensors that you can create a digital version of it that

535
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:15,200
Do all kinds

536
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:16,224
Crazy cool testing

537
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:17,248
NC housing

538
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:18,016
Affected

539
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,552
I think it's going to be

540
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,344
If you imagine like a r

541
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:24,416
The face

542
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:25,184
Woo

543
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:27,744
Scary

544
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,512
That's Tuff

545
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:30,048
But they did

546
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:31,328
Which has the digital

547
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:33,120
Capabilities

548
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:34,656
That's that's good news for them

549
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:35,936
Keep and keep

550
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:36,960
In the investment going

551
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:37,728
This is

552
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:39,520
A good thing for you Kevin

553
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:40,544
Because

554
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,824
It involves Google

555
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,592
Also we should give

556
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:47,712
Oh yes I consult for Google but not in their Smart Home

557
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:48,992
. also

558
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,528
My opinions are my own

559
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,344
So particle a developer board

560
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:56,160
They have teamed up with Google Cloud

561
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:59,232
To send data from physical devices directly into the

562
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:00,256
Google Cloud platform

563
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:01,280
Infer analyze

564
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:02,816
And

565
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:05,376
I forgot this was kind of cool because

566
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:07,424
It particle has its own cloud

567
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,192
So there

568
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:08,960
Tainan

569
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:09,984
The Google stuff

570
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:11,776
And because Google has it's like

571
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:13,056
Like crazy information

572
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:14,848
World I can see

573
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:15,616
Google like

574
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:22,784
Overtime but they've actually been experimenting with particle boards

575
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:25,856
Time data from their G bikes

576
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:28,160
With the purple acid trackers

577
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:30,464
They're showing basically how they

578
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:32,768
Track these things see what he

579
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:34,048
KFC usage patterns

580
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:36,096
Data visualization

581
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:42,240
That sounds like a very googly thing to do and I do love the bikes by the way I ride them every time I go out there

582
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:48,640
Interesting Lee this ties into a theme that we heard a Google IO has continued in some of the newer products

583
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:49,664
The Google hasn't asked

584
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:53,504
Let's machine learning Google is really making a machine learning push

585
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,808
So this is a really nice tie and I think

586
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,088
Yeah because

587
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,648
Machine learning is great about looking

588
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:00,928
Camphor like clusters

589
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:01,952
Patterns

590
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:03,744
Once has been trained

591
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,512
On what to look

592
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:06,048
4 and what to optimize for

593
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,864
There's going to be so much data from

594
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,936
Putting sensors in the world we're going to have to rely on computers to start

595
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:13,216
Like helping us filter

596
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:16,032
I just think it'll be fascinating

597
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:16,800
To see

598
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:18,080
Like you can imagine

599
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,384
Bikes and where they're Park

600
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:21,408
Are they are

601
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,944
You'll you'll be able to see like

602
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:24,992
Usage patterns like where

603
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:26,016
Kind of cluster.

604
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:28,832
I don't know

605
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:31,648
Now it's 5 completely agree

606
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:32,928
Maybe not about the bike so much

607
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,744
But you know that I like to buy

608
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:37,024
And then

609
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:37,792
Finally

610
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:40,096
Snapchat glasses

611
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:44,448
Yeah from a new company will not new cover a newly named company snap

612
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:47,008
No more chat

613
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:49,056
We're just taking pictures

614
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:51,872
Yes

615
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:57,504
Yet this is kind of interesting only because I'm not to tie into a whole Google theme here but

616
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:03,648
Google Glass which I think was 2013 was available really got pans

617
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:05,184
Mainly because

618
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:10,560
The creepy factor of having a camera that could take pictures and record video and sell it

619
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:13,888
And yet this is exactly what the Snapchat glasses

620
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,216
Do but then again this is Snapchats

621
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:19,520
This is not all right it's all about

622
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:22,080
Sharing snaps videos

623
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:28,736
What's wrong with your social friend so so these are sunglasses that will I think they cost 129

624
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:30,784
$1 when they become available

625
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,856
And they have a camera built-in obviously and they will

626
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:35,392
Literally record

627
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:38,208
Short snaps of a videos

628
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:44,608
And there I believe there's a light to tell you to let others around you know yeah okay to let others know that that's a

629
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:45,888
That's actually recording

630
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:52,288
And it will automatically send these circular videos and if you notice that that's Heather differential

631
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:54,592
Getting these to your friends on Snapchat

632
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:55,360
So

633
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:56,128
Important

634
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:57,408
Are Samurai

635
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,712
They disappear it's after 24 hours I think

636
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:06,880
Oh yeah used to be a lot less than that but I think it is up to 24 hours now they have a couple different ways I am not on

637
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:10,208
Snapchat these days I couldn't tell you not with the kids you're not hip

638
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,560
I'm cool I'm not well that's that's why I actually joined it not to be hip and cool.

639
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:19,680
See what my kids are doing and when I saw that they were doing like not need to see this anymore so I got off

640
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:22,496
Snapchat I hope it was all innocent fun Kevin

641
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:30,176
It was fun I don't know about Innocent but yeah whatever the kids some discussions were had

642
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:31,968
So

643
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:33,504
Yes I think

644
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,552
I will be curious about their reception

645
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:38,112
Because it might be a wonderful example of

646
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,648
Just it being the right time

647
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:41,440
So the generational shift

648
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:42,720
Google glasses

649
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:44,000
Yes

650
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:46,048
Might be enough to be like

651
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:47,328
Yeah we don't care about 5

652
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:49,376
We can walk into bars with

653
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:50,656
Crazy teal

654
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:52,448
Coral or Black sunglasses

655
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,216
I'm just be like

656
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:54,240
Yeah

657
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:55,008
Record this

658
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:57,056
I don't like it

659
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:04,224
I8 yeah I think it's interesting I think you're spot on I think the demographic is very different and it will be more

660
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:04,992
Italy

661
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:09,344
Accepted by the younger demographic, and that's fine I mean times are changing

662
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:13,184
Yeah I mean you got your phone with that say just use your phone

663
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,256
I will I will say that using your phone

664
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:17,536
Is a pain

665
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:19,584
Because you have to pull it out take the camera

666
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:20,864
Wait for

667
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:22,400
I mean it's not okay

668
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:23,680
Pain is really at the wrong

669
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:25,984
Satchel Paige

670
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:29,568
Picture with my butt

671
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:30,592
Where is fu

672
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:32,384
The fact that their sun glasses

673
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,152
Is kind of nice Beach

674
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:33,920
Because it's not like you're

675
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:34,944
Going to be walking around in

676
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:35,712
Inside with

677
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:39,552
Do you know this it just feels Connecticut outdoor fun

678
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:41,600
People might already be in public places

679
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:45,184
Maybe that was Google Glasses overstep is they

680
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:45,952
They made it

681
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:46,976
Too much

682
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:48,512
Always uncut

683
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:50,560
In your face scary where is apparel

684
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:52,608
Look at someone's walking around outside and

685
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:53,888
Has a pair of sunglasses on it

686
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:56,448
If I'm outside

687
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:58,240
No I'm probably

688
00:28:59,264 --> 00:28:59,776
Other people

689
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:01,056
Can see me I feel like I'm in a more

690
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,848
So that's

691
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,640
A small difference

692
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:11,040
I will see how they look different I mean Google glass look like to some degree of a small computer

693
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:11,808
Strapped to your

694
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:14,368
Glasses frame

695
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,136
It was

696
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,160
Yeah

697
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:18,720
It was scary I did I I still have pictures

698
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:20,768
Stop myself wearing those things yes

699
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:22,048
There you go

700
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:27,168
Hopefully Snapchat will not have their Robert scoble in the shower moment and maybe that's all they need

701
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,448
Maybe that's all

702
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:35,616
I hope not I'm sorry to break that up some things cannot be unseen

703
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:36,384
Sad

704
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,224
Okay so real fast we're just going to stay at the sweet home

705
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:42,272
Which is a wonderful site

706
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,808
Part of The Wirecutter site

707
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,344
Actually The Wire

708
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,392
I like the sweet home

709
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:48,928
About sheets FaceTime

710
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:53,792
So they have decided that the best Wi-Fi home security camera

711
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:54,560
What is

712
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:55,584
Now

713
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,144
No longer The Nest it is now the

714
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:01,472
I'm going to say I always thought I was feeling nervous saying this

715
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:03,008
The Logitech

716
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,288
Litchi Circle

717
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,360
Which is about $170 on Amazon

718
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:09,920
They like it because it has a lot of really awesome

719
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:10,944
Some features and

720
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:11,968
And it doesn't have the

721
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:12,992
Subscription plan

722
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,272
So

723
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,904
I'm so anti subscription to although

724
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,952
So our last week's guests talked about

725
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:24,768
It was Canary CEO and they actually have a

726
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:26,816
Membership

727
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:27,584
Where in

728
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,352
And his whole point

729
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:29,632
It's not just about

730
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:32,960
Cloud storage you have to offer real service so there is is

731
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:34,496
If your home is burglarized

732
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:35,776
They will help you

733
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:36,544
You call them up

734
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:37,824
They tell you like what you

735
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:39,104
With your insurance

736
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:40,384
Please stay home

737
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:41,920
Which feels

738
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:42,944
Nice

739
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:43,712
I can't hold

740
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:46,016
But

741
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:48,320
The Wirecutter second choice is the

742
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:50,112
Netgear Arlo Q

743
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:51,392
Which is expensive

744
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:52,672
But apparently

745
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:53,440
Very nice

746
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:55,232
And their budget pick is the blink

747
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:56,000
Twitch

748
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:57,792
I have one suggest

749
00:30:58,304 --> 00:30:58,816
People that they should stick

750
00:30:59,328 --> 00:30:59,840
A fridge so they

751
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:01,376
A visual of

752
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:04,192
Because it's like $100.

753
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:07,776
Stick on the wall

754
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:10,848
And then the nest cam is like a

755
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:11,616
Yeah yeah yeah

756
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:12,384
Have you really likes my

757
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:15,200
So

758
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:17,248
That I thought was worth mentioning it

759
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:18,784
Because people really love their

760
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:20,576
Home Security

761
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:21,600
Cameras to spy

762
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:25,184
Set tax

763
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:31,840
Well yeah but if they're going to get the Amazon in home package delivery service then they may want this

764
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:34,400
Stay tuned for a message from our sponsor

765
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:35,424
Hpe

766
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,448
And

767
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:42,848
Our Guest Carlos Herrera who is the CEO of petnet you are really going to like this one

768
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,040
Everyone we are going to take a break for a moment for a message from our sponsor

769
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:52,832
This week sponsor is HP

770
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:56,160
And we have Nigel Upton who is the director

771
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:58,976
4 hpe universal iot

772
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:01,792
Hi Nigel you told me

773
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:03,584
About this concept of

774
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,376
Any device any network

775
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:07,168
What do you mean by

776
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:14,336
There are so many different types of things in the internet of things as you know there are literally millions

777
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:17,664
All things are not created equal

778
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:23,040
Do I seem like a connect to doorbell or a smart refrigerator

779
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:26,624
It's already difference to a complex piece of machinery

780
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:33,024
Fences all over it and say an aircraft engine or in the middle of a manufacturing plant and

781
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,048
Premises

782
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,864
The whole thing's not connected equally

783
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:42,496
There is a different sense of priority and different type of network

784
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:45,568
Appropriate for the right type of device

785
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,128
Signature what kind of networks are you thinking

786
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:51,968
You should when you think of things like connected cause

787
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:58,624
Then you think about cellular connectivity and that's a really good fit for the type of conductivity for the connected car

788
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,416
If you think about

789
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:02,208
Saya doorbell

790
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:04,768
Then why fight would be much more appropriate

791
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:08,608
Because it would normally connecting to your hair with Wi-Fi but we have

792
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:10,912
Too many use cases

793
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:13,216
Where you think about

794
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:19,616
Something you ate merging Technologies like the long range low-power wide area Networks

795
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:26,016
Galatians like the Lora Alliance oh companies like sigfox making tremendous strides

796
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:30,880
People looking at how to

797
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:32,928
Types of palm trees

798
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:36,256
The process they wanted to use was to be able to

799
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:41,888
Digitally manage how these trees are grown and so they put sensors in the ground

800
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:48,288
Sunday use a lure that's worth to be able to connect the senses together they didn't gather dates and put it through again

801
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:51,872
Gateway diesel

802
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:58,528
Because of this particular case it's one of the largest plantations in Malaysia

803
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:04,416
And the only connectivity choice they have a satellite there is no other choice what is hpe

804
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:05,184
Come into all of this

805
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,000
The platform

806
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:11,328
Which is absolutely agnostic

807
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,912
On any type of device over any type of network

808
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:21,312
To ensure that they choose the appropriate

809
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:25,664
Work whether it's based on latency or whether it's based on cost

810
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,480
What's the type of deployment of devices or things

811
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:30,016
Does are actually doing

812
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:32,832
And I would encourage any purchaser

813
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:35,136
Eleni iot platform

814
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:41,792
Kissing kiss about making sure that you have a platform that is open to allow you to be able to make

815
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:43,328
The choice of network

816
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:45,632
Like type of device

817
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:46,656
Where can I find out my

818
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:53,056
You can find out more about website to hp.com forward slash Fire TV

819
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:59,456
Hey everyone welcome back

820
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:03,296
The Internet of Things podcast this is Stacey Higginbotham and this week's guests

821
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:04,576
Is Carlos Herrera

822
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:05,600
Who is this

823
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:06,880
CEO of PETA

824
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:08,928
Hi Carlos how are you doing

825
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:12,512
Thanks for having me thanks for coming on the show

826
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:14,304
I am really excited to talk to you

827
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,584
Because I have a dog

828
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:17,120
Needs food

829
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:18,656
+ 2

830
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:21,216
Because you guys had a well-publicized

831
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:21,984
Outage

832
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,520
Earlier this summer

833
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:27,360
You're willing to talk about what happened what you learned

834
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:30,688
Think about going

835
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:31,456
For it is

836
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,736
Let's first talk about

837
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:33,504
Petnet

838
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,272
And

839
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:35,808
What you guys are built

840
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:38,112
Glitter or mission is

841
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:39,136
Very simple

842
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:40,672
It's to help

843
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:41,696
Pet owners

844
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:44,768
The right tools so that they could feed their pets

845
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:46,304
The right amount of food

846
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:49,632
Pacifically for their pet and also to help guide them

847
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:50,912
The right type of

848
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:54,240
Meaning matching the right ingredients to their pets

849
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:59,104
Endemic qualities are pets nutritional needs

850
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:00,384
Self dispensing

851
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:02,944
Pet feeder and then you have a $49

852
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:04,480
Bold

853
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:05,760
Basically

854
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:07,040
Tell you when to stop

855
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,440
That's exactly right they're both have a

856
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:14,208
Companion app

857
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:18,560
When you on board to the device we ask you some really key questions about your pet

858
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:19,840
We have some about your

859
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:22,400
Are there age weight level of activity

860
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:24,192
Lost asking about their breed

861
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:26,496
And eventually bought some of allergies

862
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:29,824
The reason we ask these questions is so that then we can

863
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:30,848
Figure out

864
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:34,688
How many calories should be eating per day people are overfeeding their pet

865
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:35,968
Almost Hospital

866
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:36,736
The world

867
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:40,064
And if there's almost a billion to MediCare at the dogs around the world

868
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:45,952
Almost half of them were obese or overweight there's ways to to prevent this and it's just about having the right tools

869
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,768
So this brings us to

870
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:50,816
You guys have had this out on the mark

871
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:57,728
Yeah we launched the smart feeder the first product in August of 2015 so it's our one year anniversary

872
00:36:58,752 --> 00:36:59,776
The product Market

873
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:01,312
So about that time

874
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:02,080
You guys

875
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:03,360
Went down for about 12 hours

876
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:04,640
Is it a server issue

877
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,432
People

878
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:07,456
Up

879
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:08,480
Sat

880
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:11,040
There is a lot of like

881
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:14,880
Oh my God about holiday what if my dog died

882
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:15,904
In

883
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,184
Much has been made of

884
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:19,744
What I thought was really

885
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,768
Pricing was when I asked

886
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:21,536
About this

887
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:22,560
You said that you guys were

888
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:23,840
We're actually from the Aerospace

889
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:25,120
Industry which I think of

890
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:27,168
Because having so many redundant

891
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:29,216
So careful

892
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:29,984
So I left

893
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:31,776
Understand how you guys

894
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:37,152
In a week we come from a very core team cuz they're very strict

895
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:38,944
Engineering background

896
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:41,760
When we notice this particular failure which

897
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:44,064
Made it so that our haircuts

898
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:47,904
Are trusting us when we went down we were

899
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,184
We were serious

900
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,232
They were at we actually went down at

901
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:53,536
About 8 p.m. Pacific time and we were up

902
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:55,584
Until 8 a.m.

903
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,144
The next day but looking for a fix

904
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:00,192
You know when you're at when you're designing

905
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:01,472
He's very large scale

906
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,520
Engineering Systems

907
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:08,128
You can choose your path so you can make a closed system you can make it an open

908
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:10,688
The world we live in now

909
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:15,040
Everyone's more inclined to build an open system because you end up in a greeting with

910
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:20,928
Pieces of the system that other companies are just better at you know they're there better at building

911
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:24,000
Distributed real-time data distribution

912
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:25,792
What we wanted to do is

913
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:31,424
Ensure that we were leaning on those capabilities leaving on those companies who are experts at 6

914
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,728
We end up with a system that is

915
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:37,312
Integrative third-party services in a lot of iot companies

916
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:40,896
Are built this way because if you really wanted to close a system

917
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:45,504
Mensaje we'll build everything you'll never finish you never bring your product to Market

918
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,296
With the amount of money that you have

919
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:49,600
To the system that we built

920
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:51,136
How's redundancies employees

921
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:52,160
But a lot of the

922
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:54,720
Received a lot of failures that are small.

923
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:56,512
Our customers don't even notice

924
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:59,840
We both redundancies for them immediately but a lot of them

925
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:01,120
We see them

926
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:02,912
As we encounter them right

927
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:05,728
And one spring counter them then were building their redundancy

928
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,520
That's different than

929
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:10,848
The Aerospace world where you know you're building aircraft

930
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:13,664
Chinese aircraft have to stay in the air forever all the time

931
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:15,456
You can't have any failures

932
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:18,016
And uses the aircraft systems are

933
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:20,576
Designed and developed on a 20-year cycle

934
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,416
Are we in the iot world we build things in them

935
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:26,720
Through your cycle right so you end up

936
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:28,768
Sacrificing

937
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:29,792
A lot of tests

938
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:30,560
Time

939
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:32,608
In order to get your product to Market

940
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:33,888
And at the same time

941
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:34,912
A lot of

942
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:36,448
Test time cost

943
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,984
As much as development time

944
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,776
She really just don't have the budget

945
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:40,544
Detestable

946
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,080
Do you really have to do

947
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:44,896
Just be on your toes and ensure that you can react quickly

948
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:46,432
And in a plane

949
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:47,456
Cost

950
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:50,784
Dollars vs

951
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:52,320
800

952
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:54,368
Pet feeder

953
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,392
So

954
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,184
How many third parties

955
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:58,464
We're in your sis

956
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,512
How do you think that

957
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:01,792
Compares to other IO

958
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:06,912
For us we have a 7 third-party integration

959
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:12,288
Aldi's third-party Integrations we've got them right there. They're not small companies.

960
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:14,080
I won't mention any of them but there

961
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:14,848
Large

962
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:17,920
Publicly traded companies there

963
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:19,456
They build their systems with

964
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:20,992
Redundancies in place

965
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:23,040
And you know of any one of these can

966
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:23,808
Fell

967
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:26,112
The killer dolls to build a system that

968
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:29,952
Can quickly react and switch over to a redundant system

969
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:34,048
Redundant systems are usually a little less capable right so you end up with

970
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,656
For processing less bandwidth but it keeps the system up and going so

971
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:41,472
The key to it all is to try to predict

972
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:43,776
All the potential failures

973
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:48,128
Android software to detect and fill over as quickly as possible

974
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,176
A lot of people saw this

975
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:51,456
Outage

976
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:52,480
Hazard

977
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:54,016
Good example of a resume

978
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:55,808
Why do why companies should put

979
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:56,832
Intelligence

980
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:58,880
So in the case

981
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:01,440
The internet going out

982
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:02,720
Servers failing

983
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:03,744
Or else

984
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:04,512
Everything

985
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:05,536
Default back

986
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:07,328
Physical devices

987
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:16,800
In the in the Aerospace world we call that a no comms scenario no communication

988
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:23,456
The interesting thing is an iot world you're very dependent on Communications but you have to design it so that if you lose

989
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:24,736
Communications for

990
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:29,088
Any amount of time whether it's one second one minute 12 hours in our case

991
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,136
Your system can still do

992
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:33,696
The basic functionality so with every

993
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:40,352
Every scenario where you lose a particular capability in this case we lost Communications to from our servers to our devices

994
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:41,888
The devices still have to

995
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:42,912
Work and

996
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:49,568
We will end up losing a little capability like you lose the real time on activity where you get the updates break-resistant

997
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:50,336
Wait for the update

998
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:51,360
Come out of your home

999
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:53,663
All the way to our servers and then down to your phone

1000
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:56,223
Oh what Still Remains was ability to

1001
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:57,247
Feed your pet

1002
00:41:57,503 --> 00:42:01,343
And what's interesting is that we built that in that was actually

1003
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:07,999
The capability that is in the system was in the system prior to the failure so everyone's pets were fed

1004
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:09,535
What happened was

1005
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:11,839
People weren't getting the updates to their phone

1006
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:14,143
Prince can you guys did a great job

1007
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:15,935
I mean sending out of

1008
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:16,703
Proactive email

1009
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:18,239
Hey by the way this is

1010
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:19,007
What's happening

1011
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:20,543
I think it did get lost.

1012
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:21,311
The pets were actually

1013
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:22,079
Fed

1014
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:23,359
That maybe the media is false

1015
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:24,639
I'm real sorry about that

1016
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:27,711
Certainly we didn't react

1017
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:31,551
On the media friends I called his kind of like startups

1018
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:34,111
Learning exercise right week

1019
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:37,183
We didn't know how to react to a crisis we're so busy

1020
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:41,279
Just building. Morales is awesome let's build his capability

1021
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:45,375
That we we we weren't prepared for the media

1022
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:46,399
Getting ahold of the

1023
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:48,191
Story at 8 p.m. where

1024
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:51,263
You know in the other side of the world it's 8 a.m.

1025
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:54,079
And this the story is going

1026
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:58,943
Live and it's spreading the end it's all the s*** it's a very important issue people are trusting

1027
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:01,247
That we are feeding their pets in

1028
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:06,111
Here we are with pet owners are not receiving confirmation that their pets are being fat

1029
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:12,511
And that turns into panic and spin a sort of way or you know that's a startup we we are attempting to

1030
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:15,327
Abdul exclamations infrastructure

1031
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:16,607
DIYs I can

1032
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:19,679
React quickly do that now we know we learned our lesson but

1033
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:23,007
Rest assured on the engineering side your pets

1034
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:25,055
We're said at the time that was scheduled

1035
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:26,335
What else

1036
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:27,359
Would you

1037
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:28,639
I can see

1038
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:30,175
Wiehle Ave

1039
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:32,735
Like so you've integrated lots of

1040
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:33,503
Partners

1041
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:34,783
Are there steps

1042
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:35,551
Is part of that energy

1043
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:36,319
Operation that you

1044
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:38,111
As an entrepreneur

1045
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:39,647
To help

1046
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,183
Maybe increase your

1047
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:42,975
Liability or maybe

1048
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:43,999
Just

1049
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:45,023
I'm like

1050
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:47,327
The importance of dashboarding what would we take away is

1051
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:51,423
We need to build out more tools

1052
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:52,703
That can help

1053
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:53,471
Detect

1054
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:55,007
Sellers more quickly

1055
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:57,055
You know and not just tools so that

1056
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:59,871
We wake up the engineering team and they start

1057
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:02,175
Taqueria fix it also alerts

1058
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:06,271
Rpr partners and our marketing to answer prepare for

1059
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:11,391
For the backlash because people are paying attention they're trusting these devices.

1060
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:13,695
Smart home that's the value proposition

1061
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:16,767
You know the smart home is taking care of this for me when it doesn't

1062
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:18,303
People get upset Justin

1063
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:21,375
If I had someone helping you out in the home you know

1064
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:27,007
If they didn't do their job I'd be upset at them cuz that's what that's the value proposition that you're paying for

1065
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:29,823
We need to understand as a company

1066
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:32,383
I think all iot companies to understand that

1067
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:34,431
The value proposition

1068
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:36,735
Needs to be real and he still always work

1069
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:39,551
And when it doesn't work you need to prepare for

1070
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:40,575
For those scenarios

1071
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:42,623
In the software

1072
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:43,391
World

1073
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:44,415
There's this concert

1074
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:45,439
Set that move fast

1075
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:50,047
Curious because

1076
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:51,583
A lot of people think that

1077
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:52,863
That's a very Silicon Valley eat

1078
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:54,911
It also kind of feels like

1079
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:56,191
Maybe not the right

1080
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:57,983
Hardware company

1081
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:00,031
What do you think about

1082
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:00,799
That is like

1083
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:01,823
Amantra

1084
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:03,103
Just in general

1085
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:08,991
I think I think it's it's to be honest you have to move fast what happened Hardware however

1086
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:11,295
You can only move as fast

1087
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:15,391
As you can test an iterate through things in software

1088
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:16,671
You can iterate

1089
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:18,207
Through version

1090
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:24,607
Quickly I mean you can walk over to someone's desk say hey can you try this get another build out in your test servers and your

1091
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:25,375
You're up and running

1092
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:28,703
With Hardware it's a little different you you do get the

1093
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:29,727
Soccer park

1094
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:31,519
Every all Hardware has software

1095
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:34,591
However if there's an issue with your Hardware

1096
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:35,871
Florida shooting

1097
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:38,943
We had back in August of last year

1098
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:42,015
Summit a few hundred customers were affected

1099
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:44,575
In order to fix that piece of hardware

1100
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:45,855
It took us three months

1101
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:48,671
We have to re-engineer Reed School

1102
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:50,463
Get the new tool.

1103
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:51,487
Production

1104
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:54,047
Make sure that will was come out of the fact

1105
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:56,095
Was what we wanted

1106
00:45:56,351 --> 00:46:00,191
Finally finally we have to Ocean Freight which takes another month

1107
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:04,031
And after that we have to track the product

1108
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:06,335
The stores and they finally the new customers

1109
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:11,199
We moved fast and we broke things the whitcomb's

1110
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:12,223
Hardware

1111
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:14,015
You're governed by

1112
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:15,807
Hardware Manufacturing

1113
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:17,343
Do you have to

1114
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:19,391
Follow that process to a T

1115
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:20,159
In

1116
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:21,183
Do you think

1117
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:24,255
Some of this is a functionality of you guys being a startup

1118
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:25,535
And

1119
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:26,559
Figure company

1120
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:28,095
Wouldn't have these

1121
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:29,119
Kind of challenges

1122
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:30,143
Is possibly cuz there

1123
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:30,911
Building

1124
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:34,495
You know we have a lot of advisors

1125
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:36,031
A lot of them

1126
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:37,567
How many of them are

1127
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:38,591
Big corporations

1128
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:41,407
Not have dual consumer electronics for decades

1129
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:43,455
And you'd be surprised

1130
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:46,783
They have the same issues with the with the luxury they have

1131
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:48,575
Is the house larger budget

1132
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:50,111
They have more time so

1133
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:55,231
With a start-up you know that the fundraising cycle Avicii fundraising cycle

1134
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:56,255
Bushes

1135
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:58,303
On the schedule that you need to have

1136
00:46:58,559 --> 00:46:59,839
Minimum viable product

1137
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:04,447
Then you need to be in the Market within the second year then you need to be able to scale

1138
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:06,495
Within the 30 are you here all these

1139
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:08,287
Early man

1140
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:10,847
A company that has been due to

1141
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:11,871
Decatur

1142
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:14,431
They have a 8-year product development cycle

1143
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:18,527
Windows 8 years and not just developing one version their developing five

1144
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:21,599
And they're doing marketing research and they're calling in

1145
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:24,415
Groups of people to test and provide feedback

1146
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:26,463
And by the time to get to eat

1147
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:30,815
To the eat there like we are 99% confident this probably is going to work

1148
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:34,143
We are 9% confident that people are going to buy this

1149
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:36,959
And that was 8 years later

1150
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:39,263
And there's benefits to that there's also

1151
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:42,847
The big challenge is to that because it's your designing something 8 years ago

1152
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:46,943
I know you could arguably say that it's it's already obsolete by the time

1153
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:48,479
You get to Market so

1154
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:51,295
I think with was larger with a larger company

1155
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:52,575
Did you get it

1156
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:56,159
More robust reliable iot product however

1157
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:59,487
It don't get the Innovation The Cutting Edge technology because

1158
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:05,119
A lot of these systems are just designed you know 5 to 8 years ago imagine 5/8 years ago

1159
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:09,727
What what did we have

1160
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:11,519
It was only a year after.

1161
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:17,407
Nothing displays in my decision

1162
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:19,711
There's a balance that I think a lot of

1163
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:24,063
The Innovation that comes out of startups has to be balanced with

1164
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:25,599
Agility and just

1165
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:27,135
Awesome people

1166
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:30,975
In the company that can react quickly that can build

1167
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:33,279
Solutions to account for

1168
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:34,303
The flaws

1169
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:35,327
Fastest

1170
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:37,887
Call Carlos thank you so much

1171
