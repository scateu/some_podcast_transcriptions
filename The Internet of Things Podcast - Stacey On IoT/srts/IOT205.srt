00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:12,800
Hey everyone welcome to the 205th episode

2
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:17,664
The Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham

3
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:19,200
Kevin tofel

4
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:22,016
We have a stellar show for you today

5
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:25,600
Live Industrial in Enterprise news

6
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:27,136
Is a big deal this week

7
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:29,440
On its PSA security platform

8
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:30,720
And programs at work

9
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:31,744
Talk about

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,816
Kevin has a story for the smart home all about gestures

11
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:37,632
It actually ties into Microsoft newconnect

12
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:38,400
Camera

13
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:39,168
For business

14
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,448
Free to talk about

15
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:44,800
Using a matinee in the Amazon Echo in hospitals

16
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:46,848
We got some new chips out

17
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:49,152
Matter of a capabilities

18
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:50,176
Discuss

19
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:50,944
And

20
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:53,760
We asked the question who should enforce

21
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:55,040
Federal Privacy Law

22
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:56,576
If we get one

23
00:00:57,088 --> 00:01:03,232
Then we're going to run down some industrial iot news from both embedded world and Mobile World Congress that have

24
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:04,256
This week

25
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:05,024
Plus

26
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:10,144
Our Guest this week is Beth Carlin who is the CEO and founder of this sea change

27
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:10,912
Institute

28
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:14,240
We're going to be talking about how utilities are

29
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:15,520
Looking at the Smart Home

30
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:16,288
I'm going to

31
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:17,056
Control

32
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:18,336
Energy consumption

33
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:21,920
And we'll hear from our sponsor urbanex in

34
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:24,992
And what are their startups in the construction space so

35
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:26,272
All of this is

36
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:28,320
Coming at you in just a moment

37
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:31,392
Let's hear from another one of our sponsors

38
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:37,792
Western Digital Western Digital builds Data Solutions that enable the world to solve is bigger

39
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:44,192
Is challenges introducing their most advanced flash storage solution

40
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:44,960
511

41
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:48,800
It is built it power 5G mobile devices

42
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:52,640
You can play more games save more memories and binge

43
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:59,040
More videos so get ready for your 5G future at Western Digital.

44
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:04,160
Onan Kevin we are going to be talking about 5T later on the show

45
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,184
Woohoo

46
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,720
Jennifer topic

47
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:08,512
So get your jargon hat

48
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,072
The first

49
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,096
Let's talk about arm

50
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,632
Teechip licensing

51
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:15,680
Capri that is basically the heart of a

52
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,216
Every smartphone out there

53
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:19,008
Has a really big vision

54
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:20,544
OT

55
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,824
The chairman of SoftBank

56
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,688
Has his vision of a trillion connected devices by

57
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,968
2025

58
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:30,528
And I don't know if we're going to get there

59
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:34,368
If we do we're going to have to improve security

60
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,648
Holier than

61
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:37,696
Catholic Church

62
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:38,720
Church

63
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:40,256
What arm is doing

64
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,024
Is

65
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,048
Usher at

66
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,584
Attack on the announcing they called the

67
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,352
The PSA

68
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:46,144
And that is their security platform

69
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:49,472
What the channel is created a certification program

70
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:55,872
For it and apis make it easy for non semiconductor Engineers to enable the security

71
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:56,640
Elements

72
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,408
So

73
00:02:57,664 --> 00:03:00,224
If you want something that security at the device level

74
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:01,504
You have to have

75
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,528
Some sort of

76
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:03,808
Hardware isolation

77
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,600
Hardware-based root of trust

78
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:06,624
And

79
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,648
A place for life

80
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,696
Cryptography and Key Management

81
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,256
And if all those words meant nothing to you

82
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:14,048
Basically imaginative

83
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,864
A little separate room on a chip

84
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,912
It allows you to put all your secrets in there

85
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,192
And you

86
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:22,240
Can understand if someone's actually tried

87
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,008
Guided access

88
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:24,544
It's also

89
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,080
A place that can generate

90
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,104
Typography

91
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,128
So generate

92
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:30,432
Code for more secrets

93
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:36,064
It will boot up on its own without talking to anything else in the chips with the rest of the chip is infected

94
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:36,832
This area

95
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:40,672
There's more to what they've done I are going to

96
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,696
Talk about it

97
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:43,232
Remind me

98
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:45,536
Is partially out of something I said

99
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:46,816
Couple months ago

100
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:51,680
Everyone has a trusted platform module

101
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:52,960
And that

102
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:57,824
Chip basically verifies that the firmware on the device in this case a Chromebook

103
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,104
Has not been tampered with

104
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:01,408
This does more than that

105
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:04,224
But it is very similar

106
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,760
Yes so

107
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,296
This is design

108
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,064
Anythink

109
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:08,832
And

110
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:13,440
Tiny tiny MCE use big smartphone platforms

111
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,464
All of the above

112
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:15,744
This sort of

113
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,280
Little secret room on a chip

114
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:21,887
Has been around for awhile to calm trusted execution environments or trusted

115
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:26,751
Execution modules tm30 he's chipmakers have been putting them on their silicon

116
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:27,775
While

117
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,311
The challenge has been

118
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,871
If you don't know how to engineer

119
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,151
Silicon

120
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:39,807
If you're just like this normal person who's but you don't have the budget to hire like a hundred really smart people

121
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:40,831
2

122
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,111
Develop your bored

123
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:44,927
What happens as you don't actually usually enable

124
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,999
Secure element so it's their butt

125
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:48,767
You don't actually have

126
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,839
It really doesn't have any security if you don't use it

127
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:52,607
Yes

128
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:55,679
I got this awesome room in my house if we never go into it

129
00:04:56,191 --> 00:05:00,543
So what they've done is they've added apis that make it really easy for you to like

130
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,591
Open up the door to that room and start playing

131
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,383
With those tools in a way that is familiar

132
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:10,271
And now it's actually leverage some of the stuff I can learning in my Java class

133
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:13,599
So there's encapsulated all of this functionality

134
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,879
And the data

135
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:18,207
Accessible

136
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:22,047
Harbin manufacturer arrest actually add software to the product to make it work

137
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:26,911
Can mess around with us they have access to it to use it and beef up security

138
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:27,679
But in a

139
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,983
Controlled way

140
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,263
So this is good

141
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,567
And even better is

142
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:36,895
They basically set different levels

143
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:37,663
A certification

144
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:42,271
At level 1 you can most basic security

145
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,551
Level two

146
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:47,135
Little fancy rat takes about a month to get your level 2 certification

147
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,999
We don't even know what it is yet it's super super fancy and

148
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:54,815
It's going to take a while nobody has that yet but

149
00:05:55,327 --> 00:06:00,191
Cypress microchip Nordic nxp

150
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:02,495
St micro silicon labs

151
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:06,591
Taiwanese company called new vote on all of those guys are implemented

152
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:07,871
Best so

153
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:11,711
Most of them will have level 1 certified chips out on the market

154
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,527
They're going to beat that up as time goes on

155
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,623
It also this whole platform that arm is introduced with

156
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,391
PSA

157
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,671
Is also

158
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:25,279
Ties into other security efforts likes UL has their own security

159
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,815
This fits in with

160
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:27,583
So

161
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:29,375
What we're seeing is both

162
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:33,727
The ability to standardize some basic good security practices for

163
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,751
Hardware level

164
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:38,847
Cross a bunch of different standards organizations which should help

165
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,127
Pool industry

166
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,223
And they're making it easier for application developer

167
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,503
Actually

168
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,551
So this is a big deal

169
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,087
Really promise

170
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:50,367
I'm very excited

171
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:56,767
It is it's very good we heart on security for iot devices all the time for good reason

172
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,047
There is a downside

173
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,327
And that is

174
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,351
Tell me the towns

175
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:03,423
None of the devices you have or capable of this today

176
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:08,287
So you're going to have to buy a new devices it

177
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:10,079
You want this type of security

178
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:13,151
And you do you want this type of security

179
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,711
Alright well

180
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,759
After Kevin has Rain on My Parade with

181
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,343
To let him get you all excited about something

182
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,879
Fresh poke and

183
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:27,743
At Mobile World Congress lots of news about gesture

184
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,279
Based phones

185
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:31,071
And Automotive

186
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:32,863
Even

187
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,143
Camera for Enterprise

188
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:35,679
Rochester

189
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:42,335
I do talk about gestures and yes this is listen to that funky loopy space that I often find myself in as unforward

190
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:44,895
You would mention some of the announcements it

191
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:50,271
Mwc the sweet BMW for example with showing off their natural interaction

192
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:53,343
Platform which is expected in 2021

193
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:57,183
It uses voice capabilities as most new cars do today either

194
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:00,255
Natively or through a f****** cuz I see you can answer the car

195
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:04,351
They're going to add gesture controls as well and I love that because

196
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:08,447
I'm driving I-90 to say change the radio

197
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,983
Station of do something

198
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,519
Take me to look away

199
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:12,287
That's bad

200
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,335
So which gestures you can

201
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:18,431
Potentially at your radio and maybe flip your finger up and we go to the next

202
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,735
Channel for example so that is cool

203
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:24,063
It also adding smarts to it will see if they deliver on this but

204
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,343
You'll be able to actually

205
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,647
Point at things that you're driving past

206
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,719
System recognize your gestures

207
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:31,487
Winter

208
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:34,815
To that thing the cars have cameras and other sensors

209
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,095
GPS as well

210
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:40,447
Anyconnect tell you about the place

211
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:44,543
Additionally

212
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,591
Images phones and LG

213
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:48,127
Announce their G8

214
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,151
Thank you

215
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,455
That's their new flagship phone

216
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:56,063
And they have a time of flight sensor in there and they're not the first to do this but

217
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:59,135
They are the latest to do this and what that allows them to do is

218
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,463
Touchless gestures to the phone interface

219
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,999
It can even skam

220
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:06,303
Home of user a few inches away

221
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,095
Unlock the phone so

222
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:12,703
Wishing all these new applications for these type of sensor

223
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:15,007
Camera Caesar more of

224
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,287
The Jetsons

225
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:17,823
Exactly

226
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:18,847
Exactly

227
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,383
It's basically like

228
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:21,663
Radar

229
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,431
Plus math

230
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:25,759
So get a time of flight sensory there they're sending out

231
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:26,527
The signal

232
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,807
It bounces back

233
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:30,879
They do math to see how it fits within the map Thief

234
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:31,647
Created of the road

235
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:36,255
It's a very cool things the same technology that was actually the lighthouse cameras

236
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,791
We talked about a while back

237
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,071
Heather CEO

238
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:41,119
Podcast talking about the sensors

239
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,655
Unfortunately lighthouses now

240
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:48,799
Business but the fact that these are going to be in smartphones and possibly in cars

241
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,335
These are things that sell

242
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:56,735
A lot of devices which means the cost of this technology in the number of people who can develop against it will expand

243
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,783
Which makes it more accessible

244
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,599
When other use cases so that's

245
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,367
Harry Potter

246
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:06,719
And that's where it would be interesting to see in the home because today

247
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:11,071
Is home control is done through voice and make sure there's apps as well that

248
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,351
Why are we buying all these

249
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,887
Smart speakers oleana

250
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,167
Control things with our voice

251
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:18,239
Once you start having lower-cost sensors

252
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,359
Do other things such as determine or read gestures and interpret them

253
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,407
That was a whole new level of

254
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,431
Interaction

255
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,223
Pizza possibilities

256
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:31,039
For it so with a lower cost of these sensors

257
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:34,623
Wouldn't be surprised if we start seeing

258
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,903
Quieter Smart Home

259
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:36,927
Where you could

260
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:41,279
Maybe somebody sleeping next to you is your

261
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,303
Reading a book

262
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:44,095
You want to turn the heat up

263
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,375
Thermostat

264
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:48,959
And then maybe a gesture to raise the Heat or lower it whatever

265
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:55,615
If there's a world of possibilities here so it's kind of interesting and an early precursor to all this with the Xbox

266
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,383
Connect

267
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:00,735
Which had a duct sensor is an IR sensor in an RGB camera

268
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,271
You actually work it just

269
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:05,599
The application for with gaming obviously but

270
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:07,647
To do my Disco

271
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:10,207
And I could not figure out

272
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,487
Easy way to like

273
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,023
Establish that gesture

274
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,303
Connect it to my

275
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:16,095
Smart home stuff so

276
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,655
PartyLite the Hue Lights would go on for Disco Night

277
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:25,311
Yeah

278
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,335
Make the connection

279
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:30,431
Into there is not and never will be a disco night at my house

280
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:38,367
But Microsoft is bringing the Kinect back

281
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:41,183
This ties back to something I saw last year

282
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,583
If they were seated

283
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:51,167
Start a ticket was crazy so I'm

284
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:51,935
I'm curious

285
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:52,703
Like how that's going to be

286
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:58,591
I'd like to follow that and see how successful it is because that condemned translate into what we might see in the home

287
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,871
And I'll just leave

288
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,687
Everybody hanging with one last thought because it

289
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,735
It's not just about jesters

290
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:05,759
And control

291
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:09,343
It's also about adding more smarts and context through the home

292
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,879
Yes cuz otherwise you're going to get

293
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,159
Crazy false positive

294
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:15,231
Like I can't believe it something

295
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:16,255
Assume

296
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:18,047
My dog

297
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,327
I know I'm weird

298
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,655
I wave to people in my house I wave to people on Skype

299
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:25,983
I can vouch for that

300
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,775
There's going to be some development

301
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:28,543
It needs to take

302
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:30,847
Never Say Never

303
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,151
Right

304
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,687
Let's see what are we

305
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,223
We have

306
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,247
Madam

307
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:44,927
This is a really interesting article I read over at Gizmodo there's about a hundred patient rooms

308
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:47,487
At Cedars-Sinai Hospital

309
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:51,071
They're equipped with Madame a echo devices

310
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:54,399
There's a Madam a Power Platform of the hospital called Ava

311
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,703
And this allows

312
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,775
Patience to say matinee change the channel

313
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,871
Matinee tell the nurse I need

314
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,663
To use the bathroom

315
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,431
So

316
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:11,551
It's an easier way for patients to communicate either with the nurses or directly with

317
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,599
Items in their room

318
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:16,415
And I just never thought of it that way

319
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:20,255
Matinee in hospital room

320
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,047
Concerns that

321
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:26,911
What are the questions is how do you bring voice

322
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:27,935
Everywhere

323
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:29,727
And still follow the rules of particular

324
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:35,103
In hospitals you can have to pick about HIPAA I have to think about a device that is

325
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,151
Either protected from germs

326
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,687
Weird stuff that happens

327
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,711
Hospitals

328
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:41,503
In an Enterprise you're going to have to take

329
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,527
Victaulic Edmonton

330
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:43,551
Information rights

331
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,831
Access

332
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:52,511
If that's all figured out and I don't know that it is or isn't my scene like terms of service or anything here

333
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:57,119
It really opens up additional possibilities in fact there are already using some of them

334
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,399
Sofa

335
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,679
Patient says I need

336
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:00,959
Painkillers example

337
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,239
Said that to their Echo

338
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:04,543
A nurse would actually get that request

339
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,335
If

340
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:10,943
It's some other requests perhaps especially

341
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:11,967
Coming to a checkup

342
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:15,039
Southern

343
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,575
That also provides

344
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,623
The cloud with some

345
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,391
Personal

346
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,415
Patient information

347
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:26,815
Well speaking of which this is how we refer to

348
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,607
Amazon's digital assistant

349
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:29,887
So it's not to set off

350
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:32,447
Yours there are two chip announcement

351
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,471
It's worth mentioning

352
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:34,751
1

353
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:37,823
Nxp is come out with a microcontroller that has

354
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,103
ABS which is

355
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,639
Is madam a voice services

356
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,943
And this is really

357
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:43,711
Meet

358
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:44,991
This is

359
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,015
Basically

360
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:48,063
I didn't see you as fairy

361
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,599
Low-power very dumb

362
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:52,159
Kind of devices inside a list sensors

363
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:54,207
For a while

364
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,743
Microwave

365
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:58,047
Washing machines have MCU

366
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,839
Hardcore embedded chips

367
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:00,863
What's interesting here

368
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:07,007
Capabilities

369
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,055
Makeup on

370
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,335
MCU

371
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,103
Which

372
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,383
Well that means

373
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,943
How to make glitter everywhere

374
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,479
It's a little disconcerting

375
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:24,159
So a little obviously a little chip microcontroller

376
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:24,927
Centimeter Square

377
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:25,951
Yeah

378
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:26,719
Impressive

379
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:28,255
The internet

380
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,023
The connection back to the

381
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:29,791
Giant brain

382
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:32,863
The other

383
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,399
Haven't found this in Sin City

384
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:35,935
Tyson

385
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:37,727
We talked about

386
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:40,031
Qualcomm is doing a reference design

387
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,055
Amazon

388
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,127
Chip with

389
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,151
CVS

390
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,687
Voice services

391
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,783
Isn't that funny because I think somebody wrote an article about

392
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:52,319
Disa

393
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:55,647
Smart speakers really should be integrated use as mesh

394
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,183
Points

395
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:02,559
Qualcomm has it smart audio development kit for Amazon AVS

396
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:03,327
It's

397
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:07,423
Far more than that microcontroller we just talked about this is an actual

398
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:11,519
CPU that might be used inside Halo and smartphone insulin

399
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:14,847
Seems to be the Snapdragon 410 series

400
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:18,943
Based on the information at Qualcomm has provided in what ways, to do so

401
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:23,295
It's got everything I can drive up to 720p on display

402
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:27,391
It has obviously has Wi-Fi 8 or 2:11 AC

403
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:30,463
It has Bluetooth it has

404
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,487
The kitchen sink

405
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:36,351
It's all in there

406
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:40,447
Can playback high definition audio music do you have a GPU

407
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,287
Quick Charge support which is interesting enough that will ever be used

408
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:46,079
Terminado de Wi-Fi

409
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:55,295
Exactly exactly but I mean this could lead to what I was thinking a natural all in one

410
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,343
Smart speaker /

411
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:03,999
Access points we can start reducing the number of things that we have to plug in and connect to her house

412
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,279
Could be something like a

413
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,863
But it wouldn't be that because this is

414
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,679
Echo Show

415
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:14,495
720 which is in

416
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:16,287
Awesome but you know a small

417
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,567
Echo spot

418
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,871
So something like that

419
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,407
Teal screen

420
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:23,967
Wi-Fi access point

421
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:25,247
Judicial assistant

422
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:29,087
Lots of news out of

423
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:32,671
Congress will talk a little bit more about some other bits

424
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,487
But ask

425
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:36,255
A question

426
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:45,727
He asked question which is who should enforce a federal Privacy Law

427
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:46,751
Us

428
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:51,103
And the idea here is if the US gets a gdpr

429
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:51,871
Privacy

430
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:53,407
What agency

431
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:55,455
Wood and

432
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:57,503
I had assumed it would be the f

433
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,527
HTC button

434
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:04,671
Much like the FTC doesn't actually have

435
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,951
Penalties against

436
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:08,511
And that's kind of something

437
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:09,791
Make it hurt

438
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,863
GPR charges up to 4%

439
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,143
That's crazy

440
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:17,983
So the FCC does want this job they have done some privacy

441
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,263
Cases usually

442
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,311
Not as effectively there's some

443
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,335
Weird Regular Show

444
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,383
Blocks in place for

445
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,407
But

446
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,687
They do have some experience

447
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:29,247
The other option would be State Attorneys General

448
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:34,367
And we see that a lot the downside to something like that is if you don't get

449
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:36,927
California or New York basic

450
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,207
2

451
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:41,023
Estate attorneys

452
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:43,839
So

453
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:45,119
You'll have to have

454
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,655
Stateline

455
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:49,983
If North Dakota does this I can see someone being like you

456
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:53,823
Need to sell in North Dakota

457
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:55,871
Sorry

458
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:59,967
That's something to think about

459
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:04,319
I tend to hate the idea of creating a whole new agency

460
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,855
We have so many agencies already

461
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,903
The Privacy folks are actually

462
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:09,183
Kind of excited about that

463
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:11,231
I think new agencies maybe have

464
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:13,535
Few years of Effectiveness before there

465
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:17,631
They're suffering from regulatory capture something

466
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,423
Impro FTC

467
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,471
Yeah but

468
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:24,031
They have to change the ftc's

469
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:27,871
Scope of power nuts could lead to other issues

470
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,919
I hate to say it but a new agency

471
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:33,759
For this and related things may be a good thing because

472
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:36,063
All these agencies are created well before

473
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:39,135
Internet little on the edge of IRT

474
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,927
I hate to say it but

475
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:42,975
Maybe the best thing

476
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:45,023
Agencies

477
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,327
That is a fight that

478
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,863
What happened in Washington

479
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,399
If we ever get Federal

480
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:52,447
Cell

481
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,727
In the meantime

482
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,007
Let's go to California in

483
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,287
And their law that should go to

484
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:58,335
All right

485
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:02,687
Let's talk

486
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,991
We'll start with new world

487
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:10,623
Yeah we've talked before.

488
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:12,159
Google Cloud iot

489
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:14,975
Which is Google's platform to

490
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:17,791
Manage devices they now have

491
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:20,351
A cloud iot device SDK

492
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,911
And that will allow

493
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:25,727
Product makers and developers to connect

494
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:30,591
Embedded iot devices to the Google Cloud iot Core so that

495
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:32,127
Makes things easier

496
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,663
If you want

497
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:34,687
Yes

498
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:38,015
If you want to use Google platform

499
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:40,063
They don't mention a specific

500
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:42,879
MC use they're saying a wide array

501
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:47,231
Will be able to use them across various real-time operating systems such as

502
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:50,815
Arm mbed OS free are pots and mortar

503
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:51,839
So

504
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:56,447
They're looking at ways to make it easier for the really small chips to get connected to their

505
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:57,727
Iot platform

506
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:00,543
That's good I mean Microsoft

507
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,871
Catching up again

508
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,199
Alright Wind River

509
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:10,527
Which they've been in the bed of software forever

510
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:14,623
Until

511
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:17,440
Didn't I was like nevermind

512
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,720
Wood River has done

513
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:21,280
SMU software for embedded iot systems

514
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:22,560
All the helix

515
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:23,328
Platform

516
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:26,400
Basically this is designed to give you a call

517
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,728
Systems that need to be high-risk are high lyrics

518
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,520
Avionics

519
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:32,288
Industrial

520
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,312
Utilities

521
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:34,848
We're seeing a lot of stuff

522
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:35,872
About

523
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:36,640
This

524
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:38,688
Is going to use when rivers are toss real time

525
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:42,016
The song

526
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:44,064
Another

527
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:45,088
4

528
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,880
Industrial iot

529
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:49,696
A company that has been in space

530
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:53,792
Sap

531
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:55,328
Has announced that

532
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,352
They are

533
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:58,144
Boosting their Leonardo

534
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,472
Toolcat Leonardo was something they announced

535
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:03,008
Probably 2 years ago

536
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:06,848
Everytime I hear Leonardo I think of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle stuff

537
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:09,408
Different people

538
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:15,808
Basically the sap Leonardo iot Suite is going to let you

539
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:17,344
Use sap

540
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,368
On your iot

541
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,672
So you going to be able to pull your iot data

542
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:22,720
Old school staff into essay

543
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:24,512
Easy

544
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:26,560
As if he also did a deal with Microsoft

545
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:27,584
They're going to

546
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,632
Net use azure iot

547
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:31,168
Hub azure

548
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:32,960
Connectivity and device management

549
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:34,496
Beer iot data

550
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:37,056
Settings down at the edge going to be able to do this

551
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:37,824
I'm assuming

552
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,360
Bastille also makes it

553
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:40,896
Easier cuz right now it's not

554
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:44,480
It's very easy to use Microsoft Azure iot hub

555
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:46,016
At the age

556
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:48,832
I know that Microsoft says it's super easy but they haven't

557
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:50,112
Mtt super robust

558
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:52,160
Are people so adding this sap

559
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,184
Leonardo

560
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:53,952
Might make that

561
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:54,976
Easier

562
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:57,024
Set sap

563
00:22:57,536 --> 00:23:01,120
Leonardo news Microsoft has announced the release of Windows server iot

564
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,656
2019

565
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,192
Yay

566
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,728
So this is

567
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:09,568
What Microsoft calls the binary equivalent to Windows server

568
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,456
What's notable here is support

569
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:19,040
Insiders extended support giving you a whole whopping 10 years

570
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:19,808
I support

571
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:20,576
Figure iot

572
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:22,112
Devices

573
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:23,136
Deal

574
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:30,048
Most companies don't want to support things that long but in my

575
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:31,584
20 years

576
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,352
But so far they

577
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:37,984
Things change so much in 10c the 20

578
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,824
Makes temperature

579
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,848
Industrial

580
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:48,736
It makes sense because there a fee if it isn't broke

581
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:49,760
Don't fix it

582
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:55,648
Set because they

583
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:57,952
Because he got to get that certified

584
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:59,744
FAA analysis

585
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:02,816
And basically this is a big

586
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:03,584
Shiftboard

587
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:06,144
And we don't really talk about that a lot

588
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,168
But it's worth

589
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:10,240
And then at Mobile World Congress

590
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:12,800
Bausch and Qualcomm teamed up for

591
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:15,616
Industrial iot for

592
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,896
5G NR

593
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:18,432
Henry

594
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:20,224
Heather like what

595
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,528
Is the next generation

596
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:23,296
Release

597
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:25,088
The standard for 5G on

598
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:28,416
Mobile networks is set by a group called The 3gpp

599
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:33,024
And those guys are looking at how we can use 5G in industrial Empire

600
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:35,584
Couple things you're going to need

601
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:37,888
Are doing that in industrial environments

602
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,936
One of them is the ability to

603
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:42,752
Have deterministic networking so basically

604
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:45,312
Let certain packets go through if they have to

605
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:47,872
We talked about this a little bit in the newsletter

606
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:49,408
This is things like

607
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:52,224
Hey if you're streaming a Netflix video

608
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:53,248
And

609
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:54,784
You got to control system

610
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,808
Industrial

611
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:56,832
Cement mixer

612
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:58,368
Those systems

613
00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,136
Chapelle

614
00:24:59,392 --> 00:24:59,904
Before your

615
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:01,952
Make sense

616
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:02,720
Yeah

617
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:03,488
They call it

618
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:09,888
Communications or urllc

619
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,472
Yeah exactly so we're not going to say that

620
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:15,008
We're just going to say hey

621
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:17,312
You got to prioritize your safety stuff

622
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,080
In

623
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:19,360
Control system stuff

624
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:20,640
Head of your Netflix

625
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:22,944
Which I don't know why you're watching it

626
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,480
Puts on the factory floor anyway

627
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:26,016
I do not know

628
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:30,368
They also are going to be looking at factories which is really crappy

629
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,648
Happy Radio environment

630
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,696
There's a lot of metal machinery

631
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:34,720
It's moving around

632
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:39,072
There's liquids slurries and things like that that will attenuate Wireless signals

633
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:41,632
So they're actually looking at how to

634
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:42,656
Create

635
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:44,448
A wireless signal that works in that have iron

636
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:46,752
Liability

637
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:52,896
So if you're curious just cuz you like acronyms if you're wondering what the NRA is

638
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:54,176
It is 5G

639
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:55,456
New radio

640
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:58,528
Yep which is really odd

641
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:00,320
Corset new radio

642
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,344
The new technology

643
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:02,880
So that

644
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:07,488
Lots of other World Congress

645
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:11,840
Embedded world but we thought we were excited

646
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:13,632
Or maybe just

647
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,960
Can I get excited about industrialized

648
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:17,984
I sure can

649
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,008
Kevin's light

650
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,056
You talk about that

651
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,848
Yes exactly

652
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:25,664
Okay

653
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:27,712
Now it is time to

654
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:30,272
Podcast

655
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:31,808
Yay

656
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:35,648
The iot podcast hotline is sponsored by a pharaoh

Sky's is the

665
00:26:56,896 --> 00:27:03,040
Last day actually Thursday is the last day for you to be entered to win a WeMo dimmer switch if you call us and leave us a

666
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,832
Question on the hotline

667
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:06,368
So get those in

668
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,160
Before midnight Eastern on

669
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:09,440
February 28th

670
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,464
Next month

671
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:12,768
I don't know what we're giving away yet but I'll figure it out

672
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:13,792
Let's hear

673
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:15,584
From this week's color about his

674
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:17,120
Best Buy

675
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:20,704
Hi Kevin Spacey I have a quick question for you

676
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,752
I used to use a ring

677
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:23,520
Doorbell

678
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:26,848
For some reason it just wasn't working out for me so I switched over

679
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,896
Too late that's hello video doorbell

680
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:32,224
One thing I liked about the ring doorbell was I could put remote

681
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:34,528
Is various areas of the house

682
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:37,600
I don't see the nest

683
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:39,904
Hello alternate capability

684
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:43,488
Do you know of any work around or is there any kind of a remote chime

685
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:45,280
For the best hello doorbell

686
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:46,560
Appreciate it thanks bye

687
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:50,656
I actually had the system setup in my house so this is easy

688
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:52,192
Basically in

689
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:53,728
Nest does not have an extra

690
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:55,520
Turn off chime but what you can do

691
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:58,592
Is go out and buy a $39 Google mini or

692
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:00,128
Spotify subscription

693
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:01,152
OK Google

694
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,176
I don't know

695
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:04,224
Buy lots of things and get a Google mini

696
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,576
So upstairs

697
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:10,112
In the settings section

698
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:12,928
Where he will enable voice announcements is what it's

699
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:14,208
Then

700
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,792
Magically when your doorbell rings not what emotion

701
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:18,560
It's triggered

702
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:20,352
Just when someone pushes the button

703
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:22,912
It will do an announcement that says summer

704
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:23,936
Mine is at the door

705
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:27,008
You have face recognition enabled

706
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:30,336
In the person is recognizable actually tell you

707
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:32,384
Sophia is at the door

708
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:39,296
It is kind of cool but there's a catch as we found out this morning before the show when I double checked

709
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:42,368
The setup in my home as well

710
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:45,184
I got a couple minis around the house and I have several

711
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,232
Smart displays as well

712
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:50,304
And when I went to the setup steps

713
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:52,608
It was not working for me

714
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:54,656
However

715
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:57,984
We researched and it appears that you need to have

716
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:01,056
Personal results on in your Google

717
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:03,104
Home / assistant settings

718
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:09,248
So that's it it's not working for you when you go through the setup steps you'll want to enable that once

719
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:11,296
I had that set up everything

720
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:13,088
Chimed in my house and

721
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,928
Video showed up on my Smart displays when I tested the doorbell ringing

722
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:21,280
Just be aware that you may need to turn personal results on

723
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:22,048
Yes

724
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:25,632
And for those of you have a question I realized I did not tell you

725
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:27,936
The secret number you should call it is 512

726
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:30,752
62374

727
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:32,032
As what you're going to call

728
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:33,824
To leave us a voicemail

729
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,104
Asking your question

730
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,640
Enter to win that WeMo

731
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:37,408
Dimmer switch

732
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:39,968
Now if y'all will stay tuned

733
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:44,320
We're going to have fun who is the CEO and founder of the sea change Institute

734
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:46,880
Talk about how utilities are

735
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:48,672
Trying to control

736
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:50,464
Energy usage in the Smart Home

737
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:53,792
And how Amazon Google and whatnot

738
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:57,888
So

739
00:29:58,144 --> 00:30:04,288
Hey everyone we are taking a break from this week's Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor this week

740
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:05,568
Alter is urban X

741
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:11,712
It is an accelerator for startups reimagining the city light and we have one of the participants in the program

742
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:12,992
Ralph Lauren

743
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:15,552
Who is the co-founder and CEO of

744
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:17,088
Versatile natures

745
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:21,952
Let's get started with just a quick understanding of what versatile Natures does

746
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:28,352
Transform construction sites into a smart data collection field

747
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:31,424
Allowing for detailed analysis

748
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,960
Phone the project status

749
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:36,288
Well actually dramatically improving on-site safety

750
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:38,080
We installed a box

751
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,896
Ohio T sensors on the hook

752
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:42,688
Of the crane on the job site

753
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:44,992
Giving a view of the entire fight

754
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:46,272
The collected data

755
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,552
Is actually an alive

756
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:49,344
To provide real-time insights

757
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,624
Helping to improve

758
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,928
Not only productivity buzz on my side

759
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,208
Safety as well

760
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:58,560
Our proprietary crane view system is the most non invasive

761
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:00,352
The system in the market today

762
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,376
Annie's very much

763
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:02,912
Roi positive

764
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:04,448
Excellent

765
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:05,984
With the Internet of Things

766
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,032
How do you think the world of construction

767
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:10,592
From our perspective

768
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:12,128
Utilizing what is

769
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:15,968
Technically industrial iot we're doing that from the heart

770
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:16,992
Of the job site

771
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:22,368
Controlling a data stream understanding 24/7 of

772
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:25,184
Pretty much everything going on on the job site

773
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,024
Enable learning and understanding I look at

774
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,304
Any other

775
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,632
Manufacturing industry and if you think about it this is

776
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:35,424
It's just not

777
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,960
Connected today

778
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:37,984
Is fragmented

779
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,592
And no structured but if you still look at it from a factory perspective

780
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:45,408
It will run closer to

781
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:46,432
What's a did

782
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:50,272
BMW 5 series or Intel where most of my team comes from

783
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:54,880
I believe that's where construction should and is heading

784
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:57,952
And why did you decide to join the urban Expo

785
00:31:59,232 --> 00:31:59,744
Openx

786
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:02,816
Was actually one of the best decisions

787
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:07,424
We graduated about a year ago on what Drew us into the program was

788
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:13,824
Incredible value proposition what comes to entrepreneurs and residents helping with design

789
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:18,176
Hardware and even though some of the software effect

790
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:22,784
BMW Mini and old enough or extremely synergetic and that proves

791
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,576
To be extremely valuable

792
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,160
I would gently recommend it to anyone

793
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:29,952
What he's thinking about applying

794
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:30,976
Excellent

795
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:35,072
All right and where can we go to learn more about versatile natures

796
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:38,912
And how to apply for urban axes program

797
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:43,520
Oh you could definitely live with us but versatile. AI

798
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:47,104
For Almanac you should check out Orban -

00:32:56,576 --> 00:33:02,208
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest

801
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:03,488
Is Beth Carlin

802
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:05,792
Who is the founder and CEO of

803
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:07,584
Of the sea change Institute

804
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:09,120
Hi how are you

805
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:11,680
I'm doing great how are you Stacy

806
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:14,496
I am excellent so let's get it started

807
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:16,032
Quick question on what is

808
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:17,312
The sea change

809
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:18,080
Institute

810
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:20,384
Teachings is a research institute

811
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,200
I'm a research psychologist by training and work

812
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:23,968
Comprised of

813
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:25,504
Various primarily

814
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:31,904
A scientist that have decided that we wanted to leave the Ivory Tower and conduct science on

815
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:33,952
Change program for

816
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:35,232
Social and environment

817
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:38,304
Okay and if I met Beth

818
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,888
A couple years ago when she was working with a large utility

819
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,960
Trying to figure out does the smart home actually help

820
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:48,800
The answer to that was it depends

821
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:55,200
A little bit about that and a little bit about the utilities think about the smart home and then probably something while

822
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:56,736
Crazy just a surprise assault

823
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:58,528
Last time we talked

824
00:33:58,784 --> 00:33:59,552
We talked about

825
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:00,576
How to Smart Home

826
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:02,368
May help reduce energy

827
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:05,184
After years of looking at that do you think it does

828
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:07,488
I think as you said

829
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,768
I think it's a pain

830
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:10,560
It started getting into this work

831
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:13,888
Before we even had a smart home as smart as we

832
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:15,936
Did you now I was starting my doctor

833
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:16,960
About

834
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:18,240
12 years ago

835
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:19,008
And

836
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:20,032
At that time

837
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:20,800
Google

838
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:21,824
Had just put out

839
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:25,664
Way before we had any smart thermostat they just put out something called the power meter

840
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:30,528
If people had information

841
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:31,296
About

842
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:34,624
The energy used in their home they could use it to change their behavior

843
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:41,024
Right now if you think about when you get a monthly bill you get one number that tells you how much energy

844
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,048
Higher home use

845
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:44,352
Entire month is not broken down by day

846
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:45,888
The hour or by the sea

847
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:47,680
Can your house not broken down by television

848
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:49,472
Computer versus refrigerator

849
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:51,776
It's like if you went to the grocery store and you can

850
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:55,360
Fujitsu take food and you got a bill from Trader Joe's

851
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:56,384
In the context

852
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,712
You give people information they can change their behavior

853
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:01,248
And the answer the truth is

854
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:04,064
Yes they can't that doesn't mean they will

855
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,856
Graeter's nutritional information

856
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:07,648
On the back of all of our food

857
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:09,440
People still eat Oreo cookies

858
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:12,000
Even though they're too saturated grams of fat

859
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:13,536
The Smart Home

860
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:14,304
Combine

861
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,584
Information

862
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:16,864
Ecosystem

863
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:20,960
With a second affordance which is control

864
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:22,240
Information about energy

865
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,264
You being used in our home

866
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,032
MC

867
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,056
When are you

868
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,384
Which might help us

869
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,152
Make better decisions

870
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:30,432
If we want

871
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:35,808
A smartphone

872
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:40,672
Should I turn off the lights when I left

873
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:43,744
Can chat and turn them off so there's all of this

874
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:47,072
Does not save

875
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,608
So the answer is

876
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:49,632
Yeah if

877
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:50,400
People shoes

878
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:52,448
I will say

879
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:54,240
That I have tried a lot of

880
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:57,056
Connected devices that are supposed to help me with my energy

881
00:35:57,312 --> 00:36:03,456
She is starting with smart thermostats which was kind of nice but ultimately because I work from home and I don't want to work in an hour

882
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:06,784
Office that's 80 degrees during the summer it didn't save me that much

883
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:09,088
And then the next level was

884
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:10,880
Putting this device

885
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:14,464
On my circuit breaker box and having it tell me like hey

886
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:18,048
Your TV is used as much energy and your ovens use this much energy

887
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:21,632
But again after a certain point it's not like I could swap out my oven

888
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,424
To get something more energy efficient

889
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:28,032
And so is there a way for me to really start changing how I use energy

890
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:29,056
Based on the

891
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:29,824
Information again

892
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:31,616
I think you're getting at the right

893
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:32,896
It's about the incent

894
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:36,224
It is possible to use the current product

895
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:36,992
Ecosystem

896
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:40,832
To save energy in for people who are

897
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:42,368
Even your cooking it

898
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:43,136
Example

899
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:43,904
Could

900
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:45,440
Really wanted

901
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:46,464
Optimized for cookie

902
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:47,744
You could cook

903
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,536
A small thing like a chicken or a

904
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:50,560
Morning waffles

905
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:52,096
Inure

906
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:54,144
And then in a smaller convection oven

907
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,424
And if you have that data

908
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,704
Wow

909
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:03,104
If something doesn't need use a large oven when I cook it in a smaller convection oven it does use a lot less energy and I care so much

910
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,408
About that small amount of savings a Time

911
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:08,992
Start cooking in that small convection oven

912
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:10,272
Need to go to that amount

913
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:12,576
Oh dear I already know that

914
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:22,304
It's not worth it

915
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,096
Energy is largely inelastic

916
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:29,216
Because our energy bills not huge were not always as motivated as we might be

917
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:30,752
If it was something like

918
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:37,152
Calories and weight as an analogy a lot like

919
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:39,968
Behavioral changes in the way we eat based on the data about

920
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:40,992
Nutritional information

921
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:43,040
When we care about either

922
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:43,808
Losing weight

923
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:44,832
Getting fat

924
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:46,112
Running a mile in under sea

925
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:47,648
6 Minute whatever it is

926
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:49,696
Because energy is largely in

927
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:50,976
Inexpensive a lot of

928
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:54,560
Changes to a very little money and so it doesn't

929
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:55,584
Seem like it's worth it

930
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,632
And it also depends on

931
00:37:57,888 --> 00:37:58,656
There are

932
00:37:58,912 --> 00:37:59,424
People for

933
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,960
I'm getting a smart thermostat

934
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:02,240
Because they used to just

935
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:03,776
Leave the heater on

936
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:06,848
Used to leave their heat on all the time they had a programmable thermostat

937
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:08,128
Never programmed it

938
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:09,920
So they just had it set to

939
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:12,224
72 the entire winter

940
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,784
And now they've learned because they put in a smart thermostat

941
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,064
When they go to bed at night

942
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:20,160
It can actually go down a little bit when they wake up in the morning it's okay when they leave the house

943
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:20,928
It's fine

944
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:21,952
If it gets much

945
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:23,232
Cooler until they get home

946
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:25,280
For someone who is already program in their throat

947
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,072
Very little

948
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:28,608
Name for someone who wasn't

949
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:29,632
They might be more

950
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:31,680
So it depends on

951
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:32,960
Motivation

952
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:34,240
And the replaced

953
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:36,288
What were you doing before

954
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:38,336
If you were already eating really healthy

955
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:40,128
And you cut out

956
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:41,408
One additional item

957
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:43,456
Pretty healthy

958
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:45,760
Can you just cut out that one afternoon cookie

959
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:47,296
You might not lose weight

960
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:49,600
If you were eating a lot of fast food

961
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:51,136
Completely

962
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:53,440
Please tired or something else

963
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:54,720
You might see more weight

964
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:56,256
And it's the same thing with energy

965
00:38:57,024 --> 00:39:01,120
Got it in that makes sense so it feels like maybe the incentives are not on the

966
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:03,680
Consumer side so I can't do much

967
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:05,728
If I do want to do something it's pretty hard

968
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:08,032
I probably not going to rip out all my old appliances

969
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:11,360
It might be less energy-efficient although I don't feel like

970
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:12,128
Dick Hannah Subaru

971
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,152
Efficient

972
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:18,016
So then maybe we should be talking about what utilities

973
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:18,784
Because

974
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,320
How did they look at this

975
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:21,856
Space and idea concert

976
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,928
Yeah it's a really interesting question be

977
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:28,256
Because Bratayley is not a single household Write Your Average

978
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:30,560
Utility has thousands tens of thousands

979
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:35,680
A lot of people don't realize this but most energy

980
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:36,448
Utilities

981
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,984
Want their customers

982
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,008
Use less electricity

983
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:42,848
It's hard to imagine a company that wants to sell you less of what they're selling

984
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:44,384
Super energy utilities

985
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,664
Almost all

986
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:48,224
1

987
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,248
They're large

988
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:50,784
Publicly reggae

989
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:52,320
So our energy

990
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:53,600
Utilities there are

991
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:56,928
Municipal so they're either provided by the government or their regular

992
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:57,952
By the government

993
00:39:58,208 --> 00:39:59,744
Because energy electricity

994
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,768
At this point

995
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:02,048
In our modern era

996
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:02,816
Considered

997
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,376
Something that should be offered

998
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:14,080
Because we have a lot of if not at the national level and most of our state and cities

999
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:15,616
Climate regulations

1000
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:19,200
In place to reduce emissions that is often

1001
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:22,016
From the city or state level passed along

1002
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:24,064
Judy's Beauty utilities

1003
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,856
Aggressive Target every year

1004
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:27,392
That are given to utilities

1005
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:30,208
And their authorized

1006
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,232
Spend

1007
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:32,768
Some of our rape hair

1008
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:33,792
Money

1009
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:34,560
Wepay on her

1010
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:36,608
Tiffany Bell

1011
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:38,144
Message back to us

1012
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,168
And provide things like

1013
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:44,032
Rebates and incentives for energy-efficient products of Smart Home Products

1014
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:45,824
They will be talk using lesson

1015
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:51,712
The one reason is another is that our utilities are trying to stabilize the

1016
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:53,760
Seeking grid stabilization

1017
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:55,040
If you think the route

1018
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:55,808
Good day

1019
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,088
And throughout the year

1020
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:58,368
The amount of energy

1021
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,160
Suffused on average

1022
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,952
Changes based on the weather

1023
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:06,048
And if you think that most utilities have their own sources of either

1024
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:09,888
Cool nuclear power plants solar Farms that they provide

1025
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,424
If you think that when energy

1026
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:14,240
On that really really hot day in July

1027
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:15,520
You want to open up a new

1028
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:19,360
200 million-dollar nuclear plant for 4 to 12 hours a year

1029
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:21,152
Do they have to end up paying

1030
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:22,432
Hydrate

1031
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:23,200
Third party

1032
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:29,600
When I have a more stable grid table during the day and stable during the year

1033
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:30,368
Rosemead

1034
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:31,136
Internally

1035
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:32,416
For those reasons

1036
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:34,208
Utilities are strongly encouraged

1037
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:34,976
Incentivize

1038
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:36,512
Both financially and

1039
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:38,560
MR2

1040
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:39,328
Try and get

1041
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:40,096
People to use

1042
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:42,144
Less energy at all times

1043
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:43,424
And use more

1044
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:44,448
Austin Energy

1045
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:46,752
Mapreduce

1046
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,032
Energy

1047
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,616
What are the ways they've been doing this is demand response

1048
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:54,687
And I've been part of a demand response program for

1049
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:58,015
Why isn't a decade I don't know a really long time

1050
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:59,551
And my utility

1051
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:00,575
Peak demand

1052
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:06,975
Hey we're going to stop your air conditioner for a while if I don't want

1053
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:07,743
Sr utility

1054
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:09,791
That's where we've been for a while

1055
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:12,095
I talked to people and they're like

1056
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:13,631
Hey maybe

1057
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:15,167
It'll be involuntary

1058
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:19,263
Or maybe it'll be like will just automatically throttle everything back

1059
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:23,615
That we can like hot water heaters are can hbac those kind of things

1060
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:25,407
And then you can opt back in

1061
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:28,479
Some people talk about like instead of Isaac based on pricing

1062
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:33,087
If I want to do my dryer dry my clothes during that time it's going to cost a lot more

1063
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:34,111
How do you think

1064
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:37,951
Those sorts of programs will evolve as more and more things become

1065
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:39,743
Connected to the internet

1066
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:41,791
And have you know a lot of work

1067
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:43,071
Computing capabilities

1068
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:45,119
They are.

1069
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:45,887
Something about right now

1070
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:48,959
You were just talking about this time of you

1071
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:51,263
Becoming more and more prevalent

1072
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:54,847
So like I said I'm in California and California were switching right now

1073
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:58,687
Daily demand response

1074
00:42:58,943 --> 00:42:59,455
As opposed

1075
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:01,503
The programs you're talking about

1076
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:02,527
Dorothy

1077
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:05,343
Have not been daily so that I can return your

1078
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,391
Down

1079
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:09,183
Now we're moving

1080
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:11,231
Let's try and stem it almost every

1081
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:13,279
3 day and a lot of this is from a good thing

1082
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:17,887
Because we're moving some more renewable sources so as we rely more and more

1083
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:19,167
On solar

1084
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:21,471
We see that solar has provided the most

1085
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:22,751
During the day

1086
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:25,055
And then if electricity is used the least

1087
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:27,615
Higher average household at night

1088
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:28,895
Sleeping so there's this

1089
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:31,967
I'm stopping her for to the doctor but you look better

1090
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:32,991
The daily load

1091
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:38,111
In the utility looks a lot like

1092
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:40,671
Depending on the region

1093
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:42,463
And that's also when we're getting

1094
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:43,999
Amount of solar

1095
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:45,279
Rate solar starting

1096
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:47,071
Houston starting to increase

1097
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:50,655
And so what utilities want is for you to use less optional energy

1098
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:53,471
Doesn't mean don't do anything it means like you said

1099
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:55,007
Maybe dry your clothes after

1100
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:56,799
Baby Charger car

1101
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:58,591
What we're seeing as

1102
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:03,199
Is introduces like car charging right if we really can Electrify and we get off coffee

1103
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:06,015
Stop going to increase our electric to me

1104
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:07,551
And we don't want every

1105
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:08,319
Ricard America

1106
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:09,087
Start charging

1107
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:13,183
People that charge maybe at 10

1108
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:18,047
When you get home is when you want to plug it in so utilities are looking for ways to allow you

1109
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:19,839
To put the clothing in the dryer

1110
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:20,607
You think about it

1111
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:22,399
Plug in the car when you think about it

1112
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:23,935
But have the energy start

1113
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:25,215
You win

1114
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:28,031
The most beneficial to the grid and then

1115
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:31,871
Either rewarding you depending on how you look at it for doing that or

1116
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:32,895
Punishing you

1117
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:34,687
You don't

1118
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:37,247
I feel like my utility has had

1119
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:38,783
Time of day but it's been

1120
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:40,063
Very blunt

1121
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:40,831
As an instrument

1122
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:42,879
Till like after 9 at night

1123
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:44,159
Till 6 in the morning

1124
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:48,255
Between 10 in the morning

1125
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:49,535
It's cheaper

1126
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:50,815
Kilowatt per hour

1127
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:51,583
Our bases

1128
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:53,887
What I am hearing from people is

1129
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:58,495
It may start making sense during a demand response event or

1130
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:01,567
Maybe just to modulate certain devices to certain

1131
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:04,127
Times of day there's a lot of talk about

1132
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:06,431
Doing something like that or even having

1133
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:10,783
If it's connected product even when I turn on my washing machine or my dryer

1134
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:13,343
It'll say if you wait 2 hours

1135
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:14,879
It'll cost you this much to run

1136
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:16,671
Yeah

1137
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:17,951
The few ways

1138
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:18,719
We think about

1139
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:19,999
The control

1140
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:21,023
Capabilities

1141
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:22,303
Smart Home Products

1142
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:24,351
You can think of it in a few kind of bucket

1143
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:25,887
The one is

1144
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:26,655
User base

1145
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:28,703
Control right through that mean

1146
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:32,287
I'm going to give you information about whether your lights are on

1147
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:33,055
Hair dryers running

1148
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:34,335
And allow you

1149
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:35,871
To manually turn it on or not

1150
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:38,175
I'm just going to either give you the data

1151
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:40,223
Worth available on a grass Bird app

1152
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:41,247
And you can

1153
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:42,527
Control your phone

1154
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:43,551
A second

1155
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:44,575
Is Ruby

1156
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:45,599
Or schedule

1157
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:48,927
Older programmable

1158
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:50,463
Stop so you can say

1159
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:51,999
You know what don't run my dishwasher

1160
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:56,863
Press the button that says turn on my dryer

1161
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:58,399
But don't turn it on until 10

1162
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:00,959
Is third party

1163
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:03,263
And that's like this demand response

1164
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:04,031
Smart

1165
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:05,823
Programs like you were talking about

1166
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:06,847
Free utility says

1167
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:08,127
Will you allow us

1168
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:09,407
When we really need

1169
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:10,175
Stabilized

1170
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:12,479
The grid will you let us kind of go in

1171
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:15,551
And turn your thermostat up or down a degree or two

1172
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:17,087
If you don't like what we're doing

1173
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:18,623
You can override it but you're allowing

1174
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:19,391
Third party

1175
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:21,439
And then the force is algorithm

1176
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:23,231
I'm not what we're seeing in

1177
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:24,767
Things like nest

1178
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:26,303
Swear it just starts

1179
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:27,071
The word

1180
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:29,119
Machine learning algorithm

1181
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:29,887
Your habit

1182
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:31,423
You don't have to put in rules

1183
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:33,215
Stay at 10

1184
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:34,495
Turn the thermostat from

1185
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:35,775
71

1186
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:36,799
266

1187
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:37,823
Because I'm going to bed

1188
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:40,127
I just started learning that when you go to bed you go

1189
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:40,895
Turn it down

1190
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:42,943
And it starts figuring out when you go to work and when you

1191
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:44,479
You come home and buy this algorithm

1192
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:46,015
Start becoming more

1193
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:50,879
And do the utilities want to get into this or do you think they'll

1194
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:52,927
Outsource some of this to maybe

1195
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:56,511
Google are the Amazon or maybe a completely different provider

1196
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:58,815
The answer to both of those Quest

1197
00:46:59,327 --> 00:46:59,839
Yes

1198
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:00,607
The energy in

1199
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:04,191
Do you want to get into this and the way they are getting in

1200
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:07,775
Is typically through 3rd party vendor LED program

1201
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:09,055
Most

1202
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:10,335
Utility offering

1203
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:12,383
They're provided by Sia

1204
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:13,663
Utility staff

1205
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:15,199
Through a third party

1206
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:16,479
Operator

1207
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:18,527
Common

1208
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:21,343
So historically for example you know for

1209
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:23,391
Years they've been incentivizing

1210
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:24,671
Energy efficient

1211
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:25,439
Light bulb

1212
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:26,975
And dishwashers and washing

1213
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:28,255
Machines and fridges

1214
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:30,815
But utilities weren't getting in the business of selling

1215
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:33,887
They were just providing a pricing

1216
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:36,447
The pricing signal

1217
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:40,031
As well as if they're also mailing

1218
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:42,591
You might consider

1219
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:44,895
I'm more energy efficient fridge if you buy one

1220
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:47,967
It will give you $50 off if you buy one of the one

1221
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:52,063
As they're moving into this new world

1222
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:53,343
Not just

1223
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:54,111
Let me look at

1224
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:55,903
Going from an energy efficient

1225
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:57,951
Dryer which is just one where

1226
00:47:58,207 --> 00:47:59,487
When you dry it

1227
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:00,511
The dryer itself

1228
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:03,071
Uses less energy regardless of anything

1229
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:04,095
You do or don't do

1230
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:05,375
It's just a more efficient

1231
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:06,911
Model

1232
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:10,239
The only thing they need to get you to do is buy the dryer and then they're done

1233
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:11,775
I can pop and stuff on the back

1234
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:12,799
Good job

1235
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:15,615
Time for lunch but if you buy a smart dryer

1236
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:17,151
It doesn't necessarily

1237
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:17,919
I mean that

1238
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:19,711
You have to wash out

1239
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:20,479
After 10 p.m.

1240
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:22,015
You have the option

1241
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:23,807
To set those settings right

1242
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:24,575
You can buy

1243
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:27,391
A smart thermostat and keep your house

1244
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:28,415
It's not going to stop

1245
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:32,255
It's just going to give you the tools with which to make more energy efficient

1246
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:35,327
He's so cute and so now you

1247
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:36,863
The new world

1248
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:39,423
We can't just offer the rebate and then

1249
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:40,447
Go to lunch

1250
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:43,775
Once they get the thermostat or the smart washer

1251
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:46,591
We have to figure out how to

1252
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:47,871
Motivate

1253
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:48,895
An able

1254
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:50,431
Encourage engaged

1255
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:51,455
Customers

1256
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:52,735
To use those products

1257
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:53,503
Efficiently

1258
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:55,295
Because in and of themselves they are

1259
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:58,623
And I'll tell you right now we're also trying

1260
00:48:58,879 --> 00:48:59,391
Figure it out

1261
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:00,415
That part

1262
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:02,719
Because we do not live in a country

1263
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:03,743
Foremost

1264
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:04,511
People want

1265
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:05,535
Their utility

1266
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:07,583
To be telling them how to use that

1267
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:09,631
Right I pay for it I can

1268
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:10,911
Can use it however I want

1269
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:11,679
I'm paying

1270
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:13,471
Don't tell me how hot or cold

1271
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:15,263
Yeah we love our

1272
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:22,175
I wanted to have Sidetrack you just a little bit and ask about this idea of as we put more

1273
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:26,271
More connected things in our homes and I actually got a question about this on Earth

1274
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:28,063
Which was

1275
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:32,927
Hey I've been stalling my SmartThings today but their Wi-Fi connections

1276
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:34,463
Require more energy

1277
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:36,511
And I was just curious if

1278
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:39,327
If you guys have done research on that or thought about things like

1279
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:41,119
I've got connected light bulbs that got to come

1280
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:44,703
Connect washer dryer increase my energy

1281
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:47,519
Yeah it's a great question and the answer is

1282
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:52,127
Yes of course I mean anything that uses plug load is going to be using

1283
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:53,407
Thumb Electric

1284
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:54,687
It's a small amount

1285
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:57,503
So adding a hob and that's also why they're just

1286
00:49:58,015 --> 00:49:59,295
Connective protocols

1287
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:03,391
You bought that smart lights to minimize that they have a hub

1288
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:05,183
Connecting the light by us

1289
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:06,719
Bluetooth low energy

1290
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:07,999
Enter WiFi zone

1291
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:10,303
So we are looking

1292
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:11,583
More and less

1293
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:12,351
Efficient

1294
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:15,423
Communication protocol for Bluetooth low energy

1295
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:17,215
Bluetooth which is going to be slightly more

1296
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:21,311
It does use a small amount of things

1297
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:22,591
You have plugged in

1298
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:23,615
To your home

1299
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:24,639
Drawing electricity

1300
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:26,431
The more electricity you will be

1301
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:27,967
They do not use

1302
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:28,735
Largemouth

1303
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:29,759
Official

1304
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:31,039
Cincy is Jane

1305
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:32,319
Baia

1306
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:35,135
Changes in Behavior those changes in Behavior

1307
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:36,671
You should more than make up

1308
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:37,951
For the increase efficiency

1309
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:39,743
Also it depends on what your replaced

1310
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:41,023
If you replace

1311
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:45,119
An old-school incandescent light bulb or a CFL light bulb

1312
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:46,655
With the smart light

1313
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:48,191
Smart light bulbs

1314
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:52,031
I'm pretty sure 100% of the time I've never seen a smart light bulb it's not

1315
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:53,823
A very high efficient LED

1316
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:57,663
So just the Energy Efficiency of that light bulb

1317
00:50:57,919 --> 00:50:59,199
It's going to use Life Energy

1318
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:00,223
Then if you connect

1319
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:01,503
For five of those

1320
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:03,551
That one Hub disconnecting them

1321
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:06,367
Is going to take off a small amount of energy

1322
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:08,671
But the light bulbs are more efficient and if you

1323
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:09,695
You use that

1324
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:10,719
2 then

1325
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:17,119
Keep the lights in the house on for the first hour you leave the home and then turn them off or something where you would have left them on all night or

1326
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:17,887
All day

1327
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:18,655
Then you're going to see

1328
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:20,191
Increase in efficiency

1329
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:21,471
If you use the light

1330
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:23,775
Exactly as you use your old life

1331
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:24,799
Then you only

1332
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:28,895
Decrease in energy use is going to be just by the efficiency of the bulb itself

1333
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:31,711
That's kind of along the lines of what I thought

1334
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:33,503
I'm like oh man

1335
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:34,783
I'm kind of sad now that I

1336
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:35,551
Think about all the

1337
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:41,183
Things I plugged into my house okay we are a bunch of Gadget heads over here so I have to ask

1338
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:43,743
If my focus is energy conservation

1339
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:45,535
Saving money or just saving energy

1340
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:48,095
What is probably the best item

1341
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:49,119
Nectar Gadget

1342
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:49,887
I could buy

1343
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:51,423
Mosto

1344
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:52,191
Home

1345
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:53,727
The largest use of energy

1346
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:54,495
DNR home

1347
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:55,519
Is related to Heating

1348
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:57,055
Super Bowl

1349
00:51:57,311 --> 00:51:59,103
Anything related to

1350
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:00,639
Your thermostat

1351
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:02,175
Home Heating and Cooling

1352
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:04,223
Is going to be the most important thing

1353
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:04,991
To replace

1354
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:05,759
Really

1355
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:06,527
I think

1356
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:07,551
Another way of thinking

1357
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:09,343
Think about it is to look at your

1358
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:10,879
Dial M for

1359
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:11,903
Household thermite

1360
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:13,695
Did you travel a lot

1361
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:14,719
It's so

1362
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:15,487
Think about your

1363
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:16,255
Travel bag

1364
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:19,583
You can go when I go out

1365
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:20,863
How am I

1366
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:22,655
Burning off as many things of ice

1367
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:25,215
And that's where the smart home really helps

1368
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:28,031
If we have a family where we all leave during the day

1369
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:31,103
Is are we really getting our base load of lowest cost

1370
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:34,431
I'm so when you look at whatever you're setting up

1371
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:36,223
Really look at your lifestyle and dope

1372
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:38,783
When do I think I'm using things that I don't

1373
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:40,575
Meet or don't even know I'm using

1374
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:41,855
And how can this Markle

1375
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:43,903
Ecosystem help me see that better

1376
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:44,671
And get rid

1377
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:46,207
The weather at

1378
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:49,023
A dollar or $100 a month

1379
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:52,095
Those little things like we said when you think about everyone in the

1380
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:53,887
Country can really add up

1381
00:52:54,655 --> 00:53:00,799
