00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:11,264
Hey everyone welcome to the Internet of Things podcast

2
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,288
This is your house

3
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:14,592
Stacey Higginbotham

4
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:15,616
Kevin tofel

5
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:18,176
Excited

6
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:19,968
About

7
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:23,808
I think Intel's actually excited about the earnings

8
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,488
Announcing its shift away from the

9
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:32,256
PPC Market

10
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:33,536
Place which we all knew it had to

11
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:36,352
They said they would lay off 12

12
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:38,400
Is a lot

13
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:39,424
Not good

14
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:41,984
Good luck for those people

15
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:45,056
And let's talk about their Internet of Things

16
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:46,336
Because that's

17
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:47,616
What are the places nearby

18
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:51,712
Yeah it is some infectious their highest growth area out of the other lines

19
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:53,760
The business of misery said they're kind of

20
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:57,344
I wasn't getting the PC market

21
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,112
Putting

22
00:00:58,368 --> 00:01:01,184
Less emphasis on it with other areas of opportunity

23
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:07,072
Out of style 13.7 billion dollars in Revenue they still took in 7.5 billion in there

24
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:08,352
Current Computing group

25
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:09,120
It's down

26
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:10,400
But that's okay

27
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:14,240
Is Internet of Things the Internet of Things group Revenue has

28
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:19,872
651 million which is up 4% sequentially and up 22%

29
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:21,152
Which is good and

30
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:26,272
Until Ashlyn calls it out saying this is their big growth area and where they are investing for the future

31
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:31,392
Is it actually earlier this week I met with rose schooler who's ahead of

32
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:37,024
She's in charge of data center

33
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,560
Enterprise pit of horizant

34
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:39,840
Platform for iot

35
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,936
Everything to do with the Enterprise and big business

36
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:51,616
Road maps

37
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:53,152
Corporate

38
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:53,920
Pikachu meaning

39
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,272
And bring out is

40
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:00,064
The recognized

41
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,928
Technology especially on the back end with regards to cloud data processing and security

42
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:08,256
Bring that too

43
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:13,120
Now Rose is a really honest person so she basically told me she's like

44
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,656
We are trying to get to

45
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,192
50%

46
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:18,240
When we going to incorporate

47
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:20,032
Corporate client

48
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:21,824
And we're just not there yet

49
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,848
And she's right

50
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:25,152
Right now if you're doing an enterprise-level

51
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,456
Deployment where you're trying to

52
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,320
I don't know you can do all kinds of

53
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:37,696
Are still highly custom jobs that require systems integrators

54
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:40,000
That's just not going to be

55
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,024
A business

56
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,096
I mean it'll be any type of business but it's not the kind of business

57
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,888
Pregnancy huge

58
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:46,656
From so

59
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:51,008
Rose and I talked about getting to that kind of scalable reusable

60
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:53,312
Enterprise internet

61
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,872
Until school is

62
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,152
Platforms

63
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:58,944
Sanders groups

64
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,224
And their technology

65
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:02,016
Sew-in getting Developers

66
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,320
So that's that

67
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,600
I don't know if that really helps

68
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:07,648
It's not a bad message it's actually

69
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:10,976
Quite good for Penthouse point of view there if they're banking on more than they're still at

70
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,536
Yeah well they have for now I'm in

71
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,216
Recognizing the big trends in the industry so it's just a question of

72
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:26,848
Christopher companies

73
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:27,616
Or

74
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,896
Yeah you can go to Honeywell

75
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,176
If your

76
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:33,504
That's probably the real question

77
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,272
Twitch

78
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:36,832
Interesting in the next 10 years

79
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:40,416
It's almost funny to look back at some of the big

80
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:42,720
Computer / platform companies

81
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,512
From 30 years ago how

82
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,560
You know the PC really helped make them

83
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:48,864
And now they're struggling innocence

84
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,680
But they are pivoting and Reinventing themselves

85
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,728
Shifting assets and Investments

86
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:59,616
It's just kind of having grown up in that era

87
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,688
When they were all up and coming in big

88
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,224
You're watching it happen

89
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,784
Which is another way of saying getting

90
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,464
In other news

91
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:22,655
Which is not necessarily A

92
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,423
Household

93
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:25,215
But they make amplifiers

94
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:27,519
And RF components for a bride

95
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:32,127
There's actually some silicon a bears in the

96
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,175
Echoing other things

97
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,455
So

98
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:38,783
But

99
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:39,807
What does it mean

100
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,879
It basically means that we're going to start seeing

101
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,671
Consolidation

102
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:45,951
Around Radio

103
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:46,719
Technologies

104
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,487
And

105
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:48,255
Zippy is

106
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:53,887
Good that because it's all so it's on the same protocol radio layer as thread

107
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:54,911
So

108
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,191
My guess is

109
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:58,495
Is corvo seize an opportunity here

110
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:02,335
There are in the space specially at the component level in

111
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:06,431
Brinkley for the internet of things a lot of the radio stuff is probably going to be kind of

112
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,223
Martha component-level

113
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:09,247
Overtime

114
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:12,319
So this is a good move for the zip because

115
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:14,623
Well I read

116
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,159
Cordless betting on it being

117
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,487
Will it be I don't know but

118
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:22,303
It's interesting. Just letting it run numbers green pee cuz

119
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,839
Shipped over 100 million

120
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:27,423
Zigbee chips in the smartphone market which is why I mean just

121
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:30,751
That's a lot inside the Comcast

122
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:33,567
RF remote so instead of using infrared

123
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:36,895
Set the Comcast Xfinity remote

124
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:42,015
Okay so it's a wireless not an infrared

125
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:50,719
You install a home audio system in there like I put a screen in here

126
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:54,047
Yeah we can extenders

127
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:57,375
Can I have a little sensor out there for your IR remote cix

128
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,167
Those days are over I think

129
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,191
So yes

130
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:03,263
Green tea can I guess corvo is betting on that

131
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:07,359
And in some ways I might be bad for the market like if you're big

132
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,895
Radio company in your leg

133
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:12,223
Silicon labs

134
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:15,039
What do I have to offer other than just this

135
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:16,063
Space component

136
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,879
Cuz that's that's a different world of chips than you know

137
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,671
Being high up in the staff

138
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:25,791
Yeah can we talk about chips a little bit more just real quick

139
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:26,559
Always

140
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:33,727
Just before the show you shared some interesting information with me about a chip in your smart

141
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:42,175
Citizen Beach it won't even better Segway what the heck happened to your light bulb

142
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,527
Just just read your Tweet

143
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:47,295
All right

144
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:53,439
I haven't

145
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,999
UShip

146
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,559
Espino People Get Ready

147
00:06:59,071 --> 00:06:59,839
Get ready

148
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,631
Alright so here's between

149
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:05,471
The 20-year lifespan on my smartphone at the two-year lifespan

150
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,495
The radio inside

151
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:09,567
80 more years

152
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,871
What

153
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,431
Well

154
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:19,551
Essentially this the lights which means

155
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,343
When I talk to my lights

156
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,135
Spell for example using

157
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:23,903
The echo

158
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:26,207
I will say turn on kitchen

159
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,023
Well actually I'll say turn off kitchen

160
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,583
Everything but one life

161
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,351
Turns off

162
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:35,167
You sure it's not just

163
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:41,311
Something set up in the with the Hub or anything it's definitely the ball but you switch sockets or actually reset

164
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,335
All the light bulbs

165
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,615
And it didn't

166
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:45,151
Reset

167
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,271
So that's got to be paid like 40 or 50 bucks for a

168
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:56,415
A basic this is the original $15 GE link bulb

169
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:57,695
Too bad

170
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:01,791
Dollar so7

171
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,583
When I realize I realized

172
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:06,143
So basically I got about

173
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:08,447
18 months

174
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,543
This actually happened

175
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,079
Tutu lights that I got

176
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,359
Originally and I returned

177
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:19,455
Elderly on the process

178
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,735
Martin super smooth

179
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:21,759
Last year or so

180
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:25,343
And I don't have the packaging anymore because

181
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,135
Do you know after a year York

182
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:29,183
It's just clutter at that

183
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,255
I'm going to have to pick up

184
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,047
I'm probably going to put in an oz

185
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,119
Yay yay

186
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,423
No no I haven't

187
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,055
Idaho

188
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,103
You could I could send you mine

189
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,431
So yes in this gets to

190
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:52,479
A bigger problem for the internet

191
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:53,503
Once we talked about it

192
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:54,527
But it's

193
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,575
A lot of these things are in your house

194
00:08:57,343 --> 00:09:01,183
They're designed to last a really long time but the components inside of them

195
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:02,719
You know there

196
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:04,255
Their Hardware

197
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,047
It's probably not going to last that long

198
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:06,815
So

199
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:07,839
How do we

200
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,399
Yeah I mean I've got

201
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:15,263
A closet full of dead devices which everything to go with bring to the electronics recycling

202
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:17,055
If they have it

203
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,335
Something

204
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,359
Computers

205
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:21,919
Tablas whatever it may be

206
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:22,687
5 6

207
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:25,247
7 years before

208
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:28,063
Some chipset went bad or some

209
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,111
Something happened

210
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:35,743
Yeah when you're talking about things you put in your house that you expect to last a long long time ago

211
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,791
Switchable doorbell

212
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,071
Stats problem

213
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:42,143
So that the next problem that I'm about to do

214
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:44,959
Is it's also a pain to

215
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:49,055
Unhook these from a system so when I'm going to take that bulge out

216
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,335
I'm going to have

217
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,103
2

218
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:53,407
It's not as simple as just replacing a bulb and everything

219
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:02,367
Discovery

220
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:07,743
This is probably really first real world pop problems but they're real problem

221
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:11,583
First world

222
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:17,471
And so that's one thing I will say that I did it I talk to a company named eco

223
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:18,751
Which

224
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,543
I did profile in my newsletter

225
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,079
If you decide that

226
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:24,383
That's okay because this company is selling

227
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:26,943
Hot swappable light switches

228
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,759
Little boxes

229
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:36,159
Modular switches that fit into boxes the boxes are wired to your

230
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:38,975
Electric electoral system but the switch itself

231
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:40,511
Pop out

232
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:44,095
Exactly and there's

233
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,167
New homes will have

234
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,703
Basically smart bulbs

235
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:52,543
And the cool thing is that the founder of this company

236
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:56,639
And I were talking and he's he explained that it's hot swappable and he went with the

237
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,943
Grey modular system because

238
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:01,503
He knew that a lot of the technologies that we have to

239
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,271
Today

240
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,807
Are not going to be the technology

241
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:04,831
5 or 10

242
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:07,903
Different Technologies

243
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:08,927
Protocols

244
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:09,695
Wireless

245
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:10,975
Whatever yeah absolutely

246
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:19,167
It's a pain to wire those

247
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:21,983
Well that's funny you say that because

248
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,543
For my 2010 installation of the insteon

249
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,335
Stuff I still have

250
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:29,919
Three insteon switches hardwired in my house

251
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:34,015
Even though I'm not running an insteon system at all I'm just using his radio switches obviously

252
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,319
If they're still little LED on their tail

253
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,087
What's the latest

254
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:39,135
Honor office should be on or off

255
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:42,975
I just didn't want to be bothered on wiring a butt with Chico's doing is

256
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:44,767
Okay.

257
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,815
Popping a different module

258
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,607
If you decide like

259
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,399
But no longer Z-Wave caliper

260
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,447
Is a loser

261
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:56,799
People

262
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:02,175
Selling a strictly to contractors at this point

263
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:04,223
Strictly to builders it's actually a

264
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:04,991
Prototype

265
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:05,759
Right now

266
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,855
It's a switch box

267
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,135
An electrical box

268
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,415
The shell

269
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:14,207
The frame that sits inside the wall

270
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:21,631
Electrical wiring

271
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,423
Bright

272
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,215
You could that mean if you're doing like a

273
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,751
Reset a retrofit of

274
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,287
Your house

275
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:29,567
Remodel

276
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:31,103
Just the remote

277
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,127
Expensive

278
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:35,455
Alice nightmare if you're doing that you could probably

279
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:38,783
Try for this but I'd wait a little longer because right now they're still testing

280
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:47,743
Macy's I would be interested in as an end-user consumer because I would like to swap out different things in but not well

281
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:54,143
This looks interesting because they're switch the hot swappable switch has a capacitor glass touchscreen

282
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:58,239
And that they have three different kinds right now one is like a basic dimmer

283
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,007
When is

284
00:12:59,263 --> 00:12:59,775
I think

285
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:02,591
A couple different options in the one is a 4

286
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,407
Program for things in it

287
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,943
Four options like

288
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:09,503
The switch that you went to the room that you're

289
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,551
The light switches in but also like a button

290
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:12,831
Controlling the whole house

291
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:13,599
I'm turning it off

292
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,135
And

293
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:19,999
Again I think it's a smart way to go about it it's not as fancy as a lot of the light switches that we

294
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,279
Today

295
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:28,703
I'm thinking about like the most mainstream consumer is

296
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,263
Future-proof in terms of the technology

297
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:35,615
Tunic set like they're not interested in time is light switch is to

298
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,407
HBC system

299
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,711
That's not something

300
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:43,551
Other builders are really big they're looking for ways to offer

301
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,599
Customers services

302
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,879
Make a charge for the

303
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:50,719
So you could see your Builder

304
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:52,255
Echo Plus something else

305
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,047
Creating a software for

306
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:54,815
For your home

307
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:58,143
You passed $10

308
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:00,447
No

309
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,239
I know you want to

310
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:04,543
It's something to think

311
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,591
I already thought about it and

312
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:12,479
Sorry I'm not subscribing to my house

313
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:13,759
Well you know

314
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,807
My friend is so I'll give you

315
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,111
Sister-in-law

316
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:21,439
Pest Control built into the wall so it's kind of like those

317
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:23,743
You remember those old school indoor vacuum

318
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:27,327
Full House

319
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,631
I don't know what those things are called

320
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:34,495
Pest control company comes in and

321
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:35,519
Basically

322
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,055
Pest Control

323
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:40,127
Delivery thing to like this to becomes

324
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:42,687
And it runs throughout their whole body

325
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:45,503
Deception is the home

326
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,039
Daughter got a cut of

327
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:47,807
Whatever

328
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:50,367
Company is delivering at service today

329
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:58,047
So it may not be as simple as a subscription to your home it may be like a 2-year dusita installer

330
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,583
I don't know

331
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,375
I know you still don't like it

332
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,959
I'm also.

333
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:06,239
Poison Spa

334
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:08,799
Yeah

335
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,335
Andre Rieu should be

336
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,871
Leary

337
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,431
Why were

338
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,967
Random everywhere subject

339
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:17,759
Cuz we are at their nose

340
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:21,599
I found another use for the Amazon tap

341
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:22,879
So

342
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:23,903
Tapped is

343
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:28,255
But I ran into a person

344
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,047
I was going to say that's really good that you found

345
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,071
And if you don't have

346
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,631
I'm still not sure I buy one

347
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:34,655
Here it goes

348
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,191
Because I thought this was worthwhile

349
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:40,287
The top which is the portable Amazon Echo like

350
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,311
Device that you have

351
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:45,663
Talk to you as opposed to just talk to you it's not always listening

352
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,943
This guy

353
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:49,759
Cuz there's a little rubber sling that

354
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:56,671
Kids it is can't actually run around the house carrying it with him and basically they

355
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:58,975
They bring their music with them and

356
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:00,255
Bring it for like

357
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:02,559
Whatever else they were

358
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:03,327
I want to do with you

359
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,935
Oh no I haven't imaginative

360
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,639
Echo actually broke

361
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,919
He was one of the early

362
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,199
People who on an echo

363
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:21,759
When it died in

364
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,039
His whole family was bereft

365
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,575
Surprise kids with their tabs

366
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:29,951
Okay

367
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,231
We see that it's not on

368
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:34,047
Let's send you to they send them to a link

369
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:37,887
And the link basically had to reorder a power supply it came for

370
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:38,655
Like the next day

371
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:42,495
They were going to send

372
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:44,287
That's impressive

373
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:46,335
So there's your Echo if it breaks

374
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:49,151
Cuz apparently they've got

375
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,967
The kids are getting a lot of really good data from this

376
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:52,991
Or they

377
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,319
After discovery

378
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:57,343
The tapster

379
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:59,647
Let's go onto things you discovered

380
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:06,303
Oh yeah

381
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:08,095
Yes yes yes so

382
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:14,495
Avery Dennison now there's a name that I wouldn't normally equate with technology nothing against them just

383
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:22,175
Office supply typing labels you going to Staples Office Depot

384
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:27,295
Will do really is for everything out because Avery Dennison and everything

385
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,575
Are going to put

386
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:33,695
10 billion pieces of apparel into the world of iot with

387
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:34,975
Smartlabel Spacek

388
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:38,559
This is kind of interesting and not something I saw it coming at all

389
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:45,471
No I thought if we were going to get smart clothing it was going to be through like weird Fabrics like project Jacquard or there was a new antenna

390
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,751
It was announced earlier this week

391
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:50,079
It's obviously research that could also like

392
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,103
Communicate

393
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:51,871
Wirelessly

394
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,943
This is it this is now

395
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:56,479
And

396
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:59,807
And I should also mention that everything is

397
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,087
It's a you prefer minute

398
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:02,623
Everything within

399
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,903
But no other house

400
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:07,487
Starts with an E and Annabelle

401
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:09,279
So

402
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,607
It's it's primarily I think it

403
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,655
Right now it's primarily about

404
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,423
Authenticity

405
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,703
Counterfeiting

406
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:19,519
Yeah and I seen labels attached

407
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:25,919
Certain things I got bought by Liverpool Jersey or anyone Arizona Cardinals Jersey and it comes a little

408
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,967
Navigation hologram with a number

409
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:32,063
If you want to check on SimCity you can go online and punch the number and all that

410
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,623
Gets rid of all of the number punching and then so on

411
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:37,439
Yes and you know there's actually

412
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,463
Another company

413
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:40,767
That is working with them

414
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:45,375
Jack Daniels and other liquor manufacturers to prevent like counterfeit

415
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,935
So they're actually putting labels

416
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,727
Alcohol bottles of alcohol

417
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,263
To prevent

418
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,823
So that's a similar thing

419
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:56,383
So

420
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:03,807
Sears hardware

421
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:06,111
Please read the label and they're hoping to

422
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,647
For third-party applications

423
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:12,255
Reorder something

424
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,303
Favorite white shirt with

425
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,607
Smart label get stained

426
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,423
Checking inventory we got one

427
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:26,079
I think it is kind of cold because it's again not from a

428
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:28,895
Company that I would traditionally have even thought about

429
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:29,919
Getting to the space

430
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:31,967
It's not actually that

431
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:34,527
Crazy they didn't have to invest in like crazy

432
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:36,063
Stop they're doing it

433
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,391
Do it with inventory tracking now

434
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:44,767
From the manufacturing standpoint but now it's coming out to the consumers

435
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:51,423
This is kind of fun I don't know how worried if we're going to just see it like as a counterfeit prevention method or if it's

436
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:54,751
Which actually is a

437
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,031
Yeah

438
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:03,199
I mean for me at you know there's only five Arizona Cardinals fans on the East Coast so we like it

439
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:07,551
Somebody has their Jersey on and I my jersey on maybe there's an applicant

440
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:08,319
Tell me the

441
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:10,111
The right around the corner go have a beer with him

442
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,647
Weight when they just like

443
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,439
On the same day the Cardinals were

444
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,207
Airplane window

445
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,279
I don't just wear it then

446
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:20,351
I'm a fan

447
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,375
All right

448
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:26,495
Cardinals fans

449
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:27,263
Who's out there

450
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,287
Give me a shout out

451
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:32,383
And if you do

452
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:36,991
I got you a but if you do I will show you the little device I have in my hand right now

453
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:40,319
Please tell me a joke

454
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:41,343
Child friendly

455
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:44,927
I mean you can like

456
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,719
I suppose

457
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:47,743
Okay yeah

458
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:54,143
I know is child friendly and if it's one of their kickstarter's that I back that actually came through cuz it's so awesome

459
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,167
Nothing against

460
00:20:57,471 --> 00:21:02,591
This is the pine64 missile attack a Raspberry Pi

461
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:08,479
Is $15 the base price is $15 with a small board

462
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:09,503
Thumbs up

463
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:12,063
Quad core arm processor

464
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,599
Half a gram

465
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,928
Ethernet port HDMI couple USB ports whatnot

466
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:17,952
I actually

467
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,488
Moved up to the

468
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:21,792
Highest paid model which was only $29

469
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:23,072
That got me

470
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:24,608
Oh yeah

471
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:26,912
What's your secret for 29 bucks

472
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:29,472
Mehandi all aboard with

473
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:33,824
The same chipset in all that

474
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,128
All of these have 4K video output with

475
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,176
Pretty impressive switch low power

476
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:39,200
Obviously

477
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:40,224
More line with

478
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:41,760
Computing projects

479
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:44,320
Like the Raspberry Pi

480
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:47,904
And less so with say chayote in Arduino

481
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:52,512
You could I'm still thinking about that once I get the

482
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:54,816
Linux install a nest

483
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:57,120
Of using the openhab apis and

484
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:58,912
Playing around with openhab

485
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:03,520
Interface for Smart Homes to see what I can do and just run everything off this little guy here

486
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:06,848
Remind me

487
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:08,384
We should have talked about

488
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:11,200
Until recently started shipping

489
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:14,272
That is a $15 board

490
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:15,808
Futures oh my gosh are you ready

491
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:17,344
The quark

492
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,136
32

493
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:25,024
Yeah I think it looks just like a little bored I have on my closet shelf height are they came to

494
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,328
Get around to it yet

495
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,120
You got one of these

496
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:30,656
I did I got the little devil

497
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:32,192
Just a little bit kid

498
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:34,496
This is like super behind the times

499
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:35,776
Because like I can buy

500
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:39,872
I think it's actually a $25 Raspberry Pi that has a 64-bit capable

501
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:45,248
It's like 1.2 gigahertz I think

502
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,016
This isn't a computer

503
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:49,600
This is what this is

504
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:52,928
Yeah this is bridging physical and digital

505
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,976
And I have Arduino set somewhere

506
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:59,072
And then I got this and unfortunately I just been busy and haven't taken out of the box yet but

507
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:01,120
Maybe in a week

508
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:03,936
I was excited

509
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:05,984
I'm looking for

510
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:07,776
Quark

511
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:09,056
Containing

512
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:09,824
Siri which is the

513
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,384
Sprint

514
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,688
As a friend

515
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:18,016
I don't have the other until board in my hand but

516
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:21,088
It's a frame of reference that Intel board is about

517
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,136
Third the size of this

518
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:29,792
Computer boards I have in my hand right now and this is pretty Smogon I think most people probably of an idea of how big a Raspberry Pi as this until

519
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:31,584
The board is less than half a size

520
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,352
Source Mall

521
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,632
Incidence

522
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:35,168
$15

523
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:37,728
If you don't you're feeling like you want to play with Intel's efforts

524
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,008
Just to see what it's

525
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:40,544
Got offer after Edison

526
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:41,568
This would be what

527
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,360
Okay let's

528
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:44,384
Talk really fast

529
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,432
Because there's a couple things that happened with Hue Lights

530
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,736
Fair is coming up next week

531
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,856
Light bulb

532
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:55,904
So we won't be complaining about lights

533
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:56,928
New radios hope

534
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,208
Hopefully CrossFit

535
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,488
But

536
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:03,072
What's happening is Philips Hue is actually they updated

537
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,352
Their app

538
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,888
And they did a couple things with it

539
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:06,912
1

540
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:07,680
They changed

541
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:08,448
Color

542
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,728
I will tell you why in a minute

543
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:12,800
2 they upgraded their security protocols

544
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:17,152
They basically did a token

545
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:19,200
Program with their third party

546
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:20,992
Partners partners

547
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:23,296
And most almost everybody

548
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,576
Has opted in

549
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:25,600
So

550
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:32,000
They've been working on this for a while so now what you got is basically a much more secure way for your Hue Lights to talk to any part

551
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:33,536
Cars that also use you like

552
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:35,328
Hue Disco

553
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:37,120
There's a real big popular one that

554
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:38,656
Next Syracuse to the

555
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:39,680
Apple

556
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:40,704
ITunes

557
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:41,984
Right now

558
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:45,056
So all of that

559
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,128
And the reason why it's happening is Hughes

560
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:50,432
About to launch a second-generation app

561
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:56,064
So that is why it changed the color this one now is going to be gray so your existing Hue app

562
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:59,136
And then your next gen Hue app

563
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:00,672
It's going to be

564
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:02,464
It's going to be

565
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,744
Knock knock

566
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:05,280
Not great

567
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:07,584
And you have either of those two

568
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:11,424
And I'm hoping this is coming soon and will find out more about it

569
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:13,984
But you know that's something to look forward to or

570
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:15,776
Deceiver I'm not sure

571
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:16,800
If you are a

572
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:17,568
Q

573
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,592
Aficionado

574
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:24,480
This is not the result of any attack exploit her insecurities it's just them being proactive right

575
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:25,504
Right I asked

576
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:29,600
Nope we're just

577
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:30,624
Just trying to get things

578
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:32,928
Good on that

579
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:34,720
So yeah it is good

580
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:36,768
Because the last thing you need is to have

581
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,560
Lions at these things out

582
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,888
The good news is that your kitchen

583
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:42,656
Secure

584
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:45,728
Yes yes my kitchen is the most secure

585
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:49,312
I shouldn't say if I will through the Brightside

586
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,944
All right

587
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:57,248
I think we should probably in the show

588
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:59,296
I have some great gadgets for you next week

589
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,576
Wildlight Fair news

590
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:04,672
Started playing with openhab but there's no pressure just yet

591
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:14,144
John Butler

592
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:17,728
Who's in charge of all of Ford's connected car platform

593
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,008
So

594
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:23,104
We basically talked about how to build a business for The Internet of Things

595
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,896
Specifically how far is building it

596
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:27,200
How their thinking about the car

597
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:29,760
It's a phone interview

Did vehicle and services

608
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:16,096
Ford Motor Company

609
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:17,376
You guys may have heard of

I am super excited about this

613
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:24,032
I will confess

614
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:25,056
I don't drive

615
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:28,896
I am really excited about all the programs

616
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:32,224
So you guys have time from the integration with the Amazon Echo 2

617
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,064
T-shirt leasing program in Austin

618
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:37,856
So

619
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:40,672
Let's talk about what do you do on a day-to-day basis

620
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:47,584
What's the leader for connected vehicles within the company I charged with overseeing

621
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:50,144
All aspects of that within our business

622
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,192
And so that involves

623
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:52,960
The

624
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:54,496
Consumer and understanding

625
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:58,336
You know where they looking for what kind of experiences can we deliver

626
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:04,736
I'm a vehicle side what kind of Hardware is necessary inside the vehicle to make sure that that takes plays Harley designs

627
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:05,760
Software

628
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:07,552
Communication systems

629
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:08,832
To take advantage of that

630
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:12,416
Then working with network providers in terms of

631
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:18,304
The data transport mechanisms for the cellular or Wi-Fi and then

632
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,376
Integrating app with our backyard it system

633
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:24,448
To both deliver services as well as

634
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,008
To receive data from Vehicles as well

635
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:28,032
Facilitating

636
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:29,824
Remote control vehicle

637
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:33,664
It keeps me busy throughout my day

638
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,432
For sure

639
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:36,480
Okay so

640
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:38,016
What's

641
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:39,040
Idea that

642
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:39,808
Ford

643
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,856
Has really kind of changed

644
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:44,928
Maybe for years

645
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:49,024
You guys have really moving from

646
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:50,560
You know thinking about

647
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:53,120
You know attaching a phone or something

648
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:55,424
It's not working with my phone in the car

649
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,216
Telematics

650
00:28:57,472 --> 00:29:00,032
To this concept of Transportation as a service

651
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:04,640
How is your thinking evolved when did you guys

652
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:06,432
Yeah I die Che

653
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:11,296
If you had to 10 point in origin it might go back to

654
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:12,832
Want to talk

655
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:15,392
That built Ford gain at Mobile World Congress

656
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,416
2 years back

657
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:18,976
In Barcelona where he

658
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:20,512
Really in a sentence

659
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:21,280
Took

660
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:23,328
His great-grandfather's vision of

661
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,936
I'm open highways For All Mankind and so to the Model T was the

662
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:33,056
Single-point solution for that affordable transportation that was available and accessible to

663
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:35,104
You to everyone

664
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:41,760
And just kind of thinking and projecting forward and looking at some of the trends that are happening in terms of globalization and terms

665
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:45,088
Job organization along with that globalization in a few

666
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:46,624
Project forward hour

667
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,392
Kakarot

668
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:50,720
Vehicles are operating in a week There's roughly a billion vehicles

669
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:54,048
Better on the global roads today and he Protec forward

670
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,864
Even the growth rates of where we are and would be

671
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:03,264
You another billion Vehicles added by 2030 and they're just just isn't the infrastructure for that

672
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:05,312
We're also looking at

673
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:08,128
Changing Dynamics in terms of consumer

674
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:15,552
Looks at Albertson's coming together and thinking about our own business and the fact

675
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:16,320
We

676
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:20,928
Defense counsel the hardware and we're beginning to shift from

677
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:26,560
Kind of just that Hardware Focus to thinking about not just the vehicle of a single-point solution not Jeff

678
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:31,424
You know the only way that you can benefit from afford is to owner or lease it but

679
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,704
Really doing

680
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,984
The business ads

681
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,544
Not just providing Mobility

682
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:38,080
From that perspective

683
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:40,384
Let's talk about the hardware size

684
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,688
Because this is

685
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,992
Ford 500

686
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:46,016
49

687
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:48,832
Point five billion dollars

688
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:50,112
Right

689
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:51,136
Right

690
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:51,904
That is

691
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,744
It's a lot of

692
00:30:58,048 --> 00:31:00,608
Switching from that kind of hardware

693
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:01,632
Investment

694
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:04,960
Because they're fat

695
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:07,520
At least in the near-term going to stop making cars

696
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,640
Very excited

697
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:14,944
How do you switch

698
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,528
From making Hardware in all the investment

699
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:21,600
This other

700
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:22,624
Investment in

701
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:24,672
Software and services

702
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:26,208
It's still managed to

703
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:28,000
You don't make your investors happy

704
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:31,328
Absolutely we need to make our investors happy in that

705
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:34,912
Yellow hundred forty-nine billion dollars of Revenue

706
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:37,984
It's certainly very important to us in end as

707
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:38,752
We

708
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:42,336
I'll look at these emerging businesses one thing that

709
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:46,176
That Mark has been very clear to us about Mark Barfield or CEO

710
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:47,712
Is that we cannot

711
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:48,480
Forget

712
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:50,272
Aqua business

713
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:53,344
That we see in this inflection point that were talking about

714
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:55,904
It will play itself out over time

715
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,976
It's so it's not as if two years from now

716
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:02,048
You know there aren't going to be any Automotive Sales

717
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:04,608
Did the projections that will continue to have

718
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,400
You're fairly consistent

719
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:07,936
5 to 6%

720
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:12,032
Grills and we go forward but none the less we do recognize that

721
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:13,568
Go forward

722
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:16,128
The landscape in that Matrix

723
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:18,944
Revenue and earnings opportunities

724
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,224
It will need to shift

725
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,040
One perspective that we have is if you look at the

726
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:24,576
China decor

727
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:26,880
How would you say the hardware

728
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:29,440
Automotive

729
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:30,720
2.3

730
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:33,792
A trillion dollars of a combined Global Revenue

731
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:35,840
And our share of that is roughly about 6

732
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:37,120
Sr global

733
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:43,264
Market share what we call transportation services

734
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,824
Any way of getting around short of

735
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:46,592
Jet travel

736
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:48,384
You know that's another

737
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,152
Five Point

738
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:49,920
4

739
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:50,944
Australian dollars

740
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:51,968
Of Revenue

741
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:54,272
In our share of that is 0

742
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:56,576
And so if you think about it

743
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:57,600
Dis

744
00:32:58,112 --> 00:33:02,720
Core Business that we have continuing to be great at that continue 8 to deliver

745
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:06,816
Cheaper products that people love their funded dry great to look at

746
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:12,192
But also looking at the transportation services Landscaping understanding what role

747
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:14,496
You know could we possibly play there

748
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:18,336
Okay in a lot of companies are trying to do this right now so

749
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:19,104
You

750
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,640
Luckily Are Not Alone

751
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:24,736
How do you align your company and how do you think about

752
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:26,784
Management structures

753
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:27,552
Settings

754
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:30,880
Investing in these new areas Casino

755
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:34,208
Ford is a huge company but it doesn't have infinite resources

756
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:41,120
Yeah and it is a challenging and I don't want to minimize it by saying yeah we'll just grab Tommy's emerging opportunity

757
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:46,240
Put up what we call Ford smart Mobility as an umbrella

758
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:50,080
Or each of those activities but then we got a step further and said

759
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:51,360
Because

760
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:54,944
Some of these things are going to be so different

761
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,224
Then the core business

762
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:56,992
Right

763
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:58,528
Those processes

764
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:01,344
That I talked about earlier in terms of what it takes

765
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:07,744
To each your 30000 equal parts come together in a well-integrated high-quality way with a

766
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,024
Absolute safety

767
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,864
In with absolute Integrity right those processes

768
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:15,424
Don't necessarily s***

769
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:20,544
Me and some of these new emerging spaces because you do need to move a much more frequent

770
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,848
Or much more rapid Pace because

771
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,640
The ability to

772
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:27,456
Experiment in to learn into engine case

773
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:29,248
Alright it's okay

774
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:35,648
It's not okay to feel when you are putting an airbag inside a vehicle and you got to make sure that it operates right it's not

775
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:38,208
Okay to feel they're right until you got to have a rigorous process

776
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:41,792
It is okay to stay all potentially even in in the experiment

777
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:45,888
Instrument in Austin in learning about shared Leasing and learning about how do you

778
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:47,680
You know how do you slice up

779
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:54,080
I'll at least amongst different people how do you allocate who gets to use the vehicle how do you make sure that that process works

780
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:55,104
Right Where I Need to learn

781
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,664
Until what we decided to do is set up

782
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,968
Separate limited liability Corporation

783
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:01,760
I called Ford smart Mobility

784
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:05,344
Jim Hackett has been named as the chairman of that entity

785
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:09,696
He going to be putting together his own team beginning with the CEO and then others

786
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:15,584
Come inside our core business today that will move over underneath into that entity in lb

787
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:22,240
Actually probably a lot more that will come in from the outside and bringing in new ideas bringing in new ways of thinking

788
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:28,640
And the way that that organization moves and the way that it will be constructed will be much more nimble

789
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:32,480
How much more oriented toward Innovation experimentation

790
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:34,784
Learning moving quickly

791
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:39,392
And it's obviously going to have some investment associated with it and we kind of gone through

792
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:44,512
No one exercise to understand what's going to be critically important for us as we go forward in our business

793
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:49,888
Fortunately in terms of some of the things that we've been able to do in terms of cost control and efficiency

794
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:51,168
And being very

795
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:52,960
Intentional without corn dust

796
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:54,240
I'm looking at things

797
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:55,776
On a global basis

798
00:35:56,032 --> 00:36:01,408
And you know reducing redundancies and driving those things that help us to be Capital efficient

799
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,944
You know we're able to allocate

800
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:07,552
Your money to this new element to be the emerging opportunities in, set up

801
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:09,088
Separate entity

802
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:12,416
Separate but still connected to the core business because

803
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:15,232
We want to benefit from the learning that happen there and their

804
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:18,048
Maybe something that happened in that emerging business.

805
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:24,448
Ultimately become part of our Core Business there may be something that happened in a merging business

806
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:25,472
She's as well but

807
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:27,520
But related

808
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:30,080
And want to set it up in a way that

809
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:31,104
We can

810
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,128
Forbidden city

811
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:34,176
From let's just say the

812
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:38,784
Stability of the mothership without being encumbered by the gravity of the Mothership

813
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:41,344
So on this

814
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:45,696
Spin out this new company for your Innovation what do you need

815
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:48,512
What kind of Technologies are you guys looking

816
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:49,280
4

817
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:53,632
So, technology standpoint in terms of the things that we think we need

818
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:54,656
CertainTeed

819
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:56,960
Continuity and all the aspects related

820
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:58,496
The conductivity in

821
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:00,032
Wireless communication

822
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:03,872
But you know the latest versions of Bluetooth and looking at

823
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:10,528
Things like dedicated short-range communication so now 5.9 gigahertz and

824
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:12,576
Things like vehicle-to-vehicle communication

825
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:18,976
Increase computer capability on board vehicle so more powerful microprocessors definitely

826
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:24,096
In terms of broad categorization and some of the things are happening in the tectonic technology front voice

827
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:26,144
Invoice based interaction

828
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,704
Increasingly important for us as you can imagine

829
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,240
When in a vehicle first

830
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:34,080
Safe and secure as your operating the vehicle

831
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:38,432
Continue to operate the vehicle today and then till we get to the day of fully autonomous but

832
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:42,784
Voice enables you didn't you know control and interact in a way that keeps your

833
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,600
Your eyes on the road and your hands on the wheel and then

834
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:52,000
In addition to those technologies that are doing things that make sense

835
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:57,120
Coming out on the standpoint things like lidar and sensors cameras in

836
00:37:57,376 --> 00:38:00,192
Being able to characterize on Burnet and react to it

837
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:03,776
You know you're in an appropriate way

838
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:10,432
All right and let's talk about some of the things you've already implemented so for example you guys did this integration

839
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:11,456
With the Amazon Echo

840
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:14,784
We named her on the show

841
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:18,112
We don't want to set up your Echo

842
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:19,136
You guys have done this

843
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:20,416
This was

844
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:24,000
Rate this was at CES everyone was excited

845
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,560
Can you talk about

846
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:31,936
How you think

847
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:33,216
Best way to do that

848
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:37,824
Sure it's so what we demonstrated at CES

849
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:42,176
When Amazon was around the Echo and

850
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:45,248
We out to actually be launching

851
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:46,016
Service

852
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:48,832
Where Amazon Echo later this year

853
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:52,416
In the whole idea is to just understand

854
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:54,464
How are people interacting with

855
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,768
The world around them in with their home

856
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:59,072
Book a music and with their services

857
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:02,144
Attracted up

858
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,936
Amazon Echo

859
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:06,240
What's the network that was being built up

860
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:08,800
Around Echo & the difference

861
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:10,336
Skills at work

862
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:14,688
That we would have access to just by connecting with Amazon in this network

863
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,248
Is a way for us to a build

864
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:19,552
Accessibility inside the vehicle

865
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:24,416
Without necessarily needing to Plum each of those individual kind of lines right itself

866
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:30,816
Certainly will do some things with Wayne can and will do things with others but if there's already

867
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:33,632
Then why not take advantage of that

868
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:37,728
So let's let's have some fun here let's talk about the future of the

869
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:38,752
The car because

870
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:39,520
I drive it

871
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:41,824
It is

872
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:43,616
Superfund because it

873
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:45,152
It's constantly changing

874
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,784
A huge learning curve for me because it is constantly changing

875
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:54,880
For some reason the temperature

876
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:56,672
Temperature moves around

877
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,208
Display

878
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,744
Now it's over here

879
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:04,096
I don't mind that but it is a little

880
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:06,912
It's a weird to get used to having a car that

881
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:13,056
That that like the car of the future

882
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,640
I should I should probably mention that

883
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:17,664
First

884
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:19,712
No I get it I get it

885
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:20,480
Fisher

886
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,576
Very futuristic today but I do

887
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:25,856
In a self-driving

888
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:27,904
Cars a lot of the automatic braking

889
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:28,928
Technology

890
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:32,000
You're going to feel really commonplace

891
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:33,280
Artuso

892
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:34,560
Where do you think

893
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:36,096
The future of the car is

894
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:37,120
Is it

895
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:41,728
You know right now I've got two in my garage I really love to only have one

896
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:46,592
You know I can't imagine giving up a dedicated car but I'm oldest so

897
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,432
I don't know

898
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:51,456
Where does where does

899
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:58,624
I think there are a number of different scenarios that that will play out and I think it will depend on

900
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:00,416
You know what your lifestyle is

901
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:01,696
And then where you live

902
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:03,488
So I can proceed

903
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,536
In urban environments for instance

904
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:08,864
And you know highly congested situations that

905
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:12,960
Or number of different reasons it it will make sense for people

906
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:16,288
Did not necessarily own a vehicle right they will

907
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:18,848
Potentially the biggest

908
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:20,384
Consumers of

909
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,920
Transportation as a service

910
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:23,200
Ansell

911
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:24,480
One of the things that

912
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:28,576
That we're working on within that within that context is how do we

913
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:30,880
Continue to deliver a Ford

914
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:31,648
Experience

915
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:38,048
When someone doesn't necessarily own a Ford vehicle when they may be a user or a passenger within a Ford V-8

916
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:41,120
And that's one of the reasons that we introduce fortaz

917
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:41,888
Which

918
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:43,680
Onyx face looks like just

919
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:47,008
Another mobile app but it's really a platform for us

920
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,592
To deliver Mobility Services and so whether that's

921
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:56,479
Using sync connect them in remotely connecting with a vehicle that you happen to all and and or

922
00:41:56,735 --> 00:42:02,111
You know you're traveling but we got your profile information and so we understand what your commute is and we can

923
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:04,671
I'll help you with the best way to get

924
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:09,023
To you know for instance you are at your office on that day and so whether it's

925
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:11,327
You know taking a train and then a box

926
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:15,935
And they're doing a shared ride or today hey the shared-ride would be the best route for you

927
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:21,823
If you are you know that you're someone that lives in Suburbia and you got a family then

928
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:27,199
At least for the next few years I imagine it will be somewhat difficult to

929
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:32,319
Think about swapping car seats in and out of a number of different Vehicles riding so I think through it

930
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:36,927
The traditional ownership or leasing model wolf will still be prevalent there

931
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:39,743
In all of those situations what you'll have it in

932
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:46,399
Vehicles that will absolutely improve and get better over time I think there's actually a lot that we can learn from Tesla and turn to look

933
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:47,167
They're doing

934
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:48,703
Auburn soccer updates

935
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:52,031
In our case you know we want those updates to be at seamless

936
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:54,335
If possible and Adnan

937
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:56,895
Life interrupting that possible

938
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:58,431
And we had Josh

939
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:00,479
Gorman from the cavalry

940
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:04,319
On the show

941
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:06,367
It was 2014

942
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:08,927
It was all about

943
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:09,951
Protecting

944
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:11,999
Car is kind of a digital asset

945
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:15,071
And iiii will be curious

946
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:17,631
Has Ford

947
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:21,727
Are you guys looking at that and say hey we're going to take this

948
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:23,263
We've had a focus on

949
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:25,567
Security for quite some time

950
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:27,103
It's not something that will just

951
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:30,687
Waking up to you at this moment even even going back

952
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:37,087
To you know the early days of up to you at Century right we had rolling codes to protect Security even with

953
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:41,183
In 2007 write a firewall between

954
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:44,255
War of the information and

955
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:47,839
Entertainment area of a vehicle in the communication Boston

956
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:48,607
Separated

957
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:50,655
Typical firewall from the

958
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:52,191
More important

959
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:55,519
Vehicle control sidelight powertrain like the chassis

960
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:56,287
Control

961
00:43:56,543 --> 00:44:00,383
And even as we move into this environment we're certainly

962
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:01,151
Surface

963
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:07,039
Is it worth growing in terms of increasing Connections in the vehicle both within the vehicle wirelessly and

964
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:09,855
Outside the vehicle on a cellular basis

965
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:16,511
We are very very conscious of putting mechanisms in place to protect the vehicle as a digital asset

966
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:20,351
The data as a as an asset that must be

967
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:21,631
Secured as well

968
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:24,447
And we are constantly evolving

969
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:28,799
And improving our systems were constantly looking at ways of with lyrics

970
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:31,103
Code signing encryption to

971
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:34,175
Firewall to understanding you know the various

972
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:37,247
Attacks that have been promulgated on others and

973
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:43,647
Not just saying Old Tube after that but looking at it and understanding exactly what happened and then going back and looking at our own system

974
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:46,719
I was just something that we would have been vulnerable to

975
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:51,071
Is there something that would be similar to this that would have presented a vulnerability to us

976
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:54,143
Bright plus after they hacked

977
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:58,751
Why are you were you were all over that

978
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:01,823
To understand exactly what they did and how they did it

979
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:02,591
And

980
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:04,127
Yeah we weren't again

981
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:06,943
Acceptable to that particular attack but

982
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:13,343
All they did cause us to look at some things that were doing and in the way that we'd engineered some of our Solutions and just

983
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:19,743
Add that extra bit of rigor in terms of of controls and end up some things that we could look at to say

984
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:22,559
And what vulnerable to this one but you know what

985
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:26,143
Here's something that we could look at it something that we could change

986
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:27,935
Security by obscurity for you guys

987
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:29,983
With your your billion cars on the road

988
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:32,799
Price of success

989
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:33,567
Okay yeah

990
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:34,335
True

991
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:38,175
So as connected era and you guys are

992
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:43,039
What is Fords

993
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:49,183
Adidas Advantage how does that shift from Manufacturing

994
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:51,487
2

995
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,279
How do you say

996
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:55,839
Biggest

997
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:57,119
Actually is our brand

998
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:58,143
And it's the truck

999
00:45:58,399 --> 00:46:01,471
That we have with the Ford brand and

1000
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:02,495
With

1001
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:03,263
The

1002
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:06,591
Relationship actually that consumers have formal enough

1003
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:08,895
Going back more than a hundred years

1004
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:11,711
The Challenge and the opportunity that we have is to

1005
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:12,735
Turn those

1006
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:18,879
Sort of infrequent get kind of explicit references in Gulfport at the time that

1007
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:20,927
Potentially I buy my vehicle or

1008
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:23,487
Time that I service my vehicle for instance 2

1009
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:25,791
A couple different bats number one

1010
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:31,935
The more than $900 a year that people spend inside their vehicle and the opportunity that we have to

1011
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:36,031
Improve that experience to make it a more delightful experience in also

1012
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:41,919
To learn and gather data from those experiences again with the informed consent of our customers

1013
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:48,575
To help us not only prove the vehicle but again improve the things that they do in the vehicle right helping you interact with your home

1014
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:49,599
Voltmeter Amazon

1015
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:52,415
As well looking at

1016
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:53,695
How can we

1017
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:55,231
Become part of

1018
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:58,303
A person's life if they don't necessarily own afford

1019
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:05,471
Look for cash as a Mobility application understanding how we can facilitate Transportation even if you don't

1020
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:06,751
Because we think

1021
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:07,519
Again

1022
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:12,639
That is actually our brand it's the truck that we have in our brand and that's what we've been able to deliver

1023
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:16,223
And really kind of you relate to Consumers on that basis

1024
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:17,503
Awesome

1025
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:22,367
So much for coming on the show today I have learned a lot

1026
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:24,415
Stacy it's been terrific to be with you

1027
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:26,975
That's it for this week's show

1028
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:29,279
Thanks for listening and we hope to see you next week

1029
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:30,303
