Smart sensor Kickstarter project

13
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:32,512
Maybe worth a look

14
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:37,376
We've got updates on Microsoft they have got this great smart building software they've been

15
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:38,656
And

16
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:43,008
Kevin and I have been purchasing gadgets and applications that

17
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:43,776
You may find you

18
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:45,824
So I guess this week

00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:47,104
We're taking things too

20
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,640
A little artistic level

00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:05,280
18

27
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:06,304
We got all of this

28
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:07,840
From our sponsor

29
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:08,608
Praetorian

30
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:10,144
More

31
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,680
So let's kick it off

32
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:13,984
With a message from another one of our spa

33
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:21,152
This week sponsor is Bosch interested in all things iot the Bosch connected World blog

34
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:27,552
Covers a wide range of iot topics from around the world such as industry 4.0 Mobility Smart Home

35
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:33,952
Black and a jack check out blog. Bosch - s i.com for

36
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:40,352
Articles case studies interviews and more I read this blog on the regular and

37
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:43,168
I will tell you guys I love it it has some

38
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:49,568
Very useful case studies in thought processes on iot this is not a typical corporate

39
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:51,360
Blog at all highly good

40
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:52,640
Okay

41
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:53,408
Kevin

42
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,944
You

43
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,272
You watched

44
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,296
All of WWE

45
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:00,832
Yeah I kind of

46
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,368
I had it going on in the background

47
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:03,904
Work cell

48
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,696
We're going to rely on your take

49
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:06,720
Most of this

50
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:09,024
So let's talk about the biggest news

51
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,304
From this I was just

52
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:14,144
Frankly I was too not just cuz I invested about

53
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,984
2 hours and 15 minutes waiting for something really exciting but

54
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:22,848
When they finally got to talk about Siri at home kits a little bit of a letdown

55
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:23,616
Granted

56
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:26,176
This is their developer event they being Apple

57
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:30,272
So they focused on software this time around no new hardware whatsoever talk about

58
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,040
IOS

59
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,832
Os10

60
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:33,856
TV OS

61
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:34,880
Aaron's

62
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:38,976
Hof I forgot I forgot about that

63
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:42,304
I wear that every waking moment yes I forgot about that

64
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,680
But homepod was only mentioned one time and passing first of all so there's nothing to say there

65
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:48,448
Hands

66
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,520
Siri yes they did talk about Siri

67
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:53,568
And I wrote up my thoughts

68
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:56,896
The blog and I said she got smarter

69
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:58,688
But not in the way you might have

70
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:00,736
Or maybe you had hoped

71
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:02,016
They're still a knowledge.

72
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:06,624
Between Siri and the offerings from Amazon and Google I don't see much

73
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:09,696
List. Forward there maybe half a step forward

74
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:10,976
It was more about

75
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:15,328
The usefulness of Siri in your everyday life which is good

76
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:17,632
They introduced this was the big feature

77
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:18,912
What is shortcut

78
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,192
And

79
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:21,728
If you're familiar with

80
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,056
If this then that it's very similar to

81
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,080
Shortcuts

82
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,360
What you can do is you can

83
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,384
Record a

84
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,664
Trigger phrase

85
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,688
Or Siri

86
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:31,456
And

87
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,784
When you say that phrase you can actually configure

88
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,344
Siri to do any number of things

89
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,160
Using various apps and services on your phone

90
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:43,488
Which is kind of cool the demo was kind of neat with a woman on stage said

91
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:46,304
Heading home and she had pre-configured that phrase to

92
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,328
Fire up

93
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,704
Apple Maps and find the quickest way home and to send a message to everybody home saying I'm on my way home then

94
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,032
Fire up the radio station so she can listen to NPR on her phone

95
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,056
In her car

96
00:03:57,312 --> 00:04:00,128
Do one or two other things that she oh she said her own thermostat

97
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:01,920
The 7D young and so on

98
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,200
Kind of cool

99
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:06,016
And again reminds me of if this and that and also how

100
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:09,856
Homekit sets up the automation very much

101
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,392
Drag-and-drop kind of experience

102
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:18,047
This actually reminds me a lot of this is actually something I've built using both stringify and yonomi plus goo

103
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:19,839
Yes

104
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:20,863
So yes

105
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:22,911
Extra

106
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:28,287
Software platform player I guess you could actually do this

107
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,055
Yourself

108
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,359
Using any number of other

109
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:37,247
Yeah it's funny you mention that because you want to know what the first thought I had was when I saw this

110
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,271
What was the

111
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:41,599
I recall specific memories

112
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:42,623
Setting up

113
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,647
Microsoft

114
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:44,927
Voice command

115
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:46,719
Where you would record a voice command

116
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:49,279
I pocket PC in 2001

117
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:51,583
And we can figure that to do certain things

118
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:55,679
Scranton you can do nearly the things that you can do today backwards

119
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,471
That's exactly what they were

120
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:58,495
Yes

121
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:01,311
And I thought of that and then the other thing I thought of was

122
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:03,615
Shouldn't be assistant

123
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:04,639
ELearning

124
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,407
And

125
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:11,551
Know what my habits are in just set the configuration of sort of for me like surfaces at these kind of things

126
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:13,087
And to be fair

127
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:15,903
Siri will start doing more of that they did

128
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:16,671
Show

129
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:22,559
Circus Casino if you constantly go to the gym at 5 p.m. everyday and you open a particular running app like

130
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,583
Which I do not

131
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,119
Everyday at 5 but whatever

132
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,167
Eventually Siri will

133
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:33,055
See that you are there and before you even open the app it'll say hey looks like you're at the gym ready to start running at 4

134
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:35,103
It'll save you a Tapper 2

135
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:41,247
It just felt weird because the assistance were supposed to be getting smarter but in this case

136
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,527
You're teaching

137
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:45,855
Siri to get smarter on your own you have to configure it

138
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:49,695
And I wonder how many people are really going to take full advantage of this

139
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:51,487
How many Siri users

140
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:56,863
I don't think it's going to catch on where everybody's going to be using us who has an iPhone

141
00:05:57,119 --> 00:06:00,959
I just don't see it I'm actually curious cuz like you can do this with routines

142
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:04,031
Or I think it's routines in Amazon's world and in

143
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:05,567
And I've set up

144
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,591
A couple but

145
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,615
You know they're kind of

146
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:08,639
Pain

147
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:12,479
You have extra thing the whole point of the assistant is it supposed to do things

148
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:16,319
For you know this is kind of like programming your assistant salary

149
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:22,719
Simple fashion in a way that anybody can do but you're absolutely right these are like routines and in fact

150
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:24,767
One smart thing apple is done here is

151
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:25,791
The way you

152
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:28,607
Do this you have to link your apps with Siri and

153
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:29,887
Siri hasn't worked

154
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:34,239
Tremendously well with a lot of third-party apps Oye Apple for opening it up

155
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:38,591
And now you can link your app so that way another stage demo was a

156
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:40,127
Can't find my keys

157
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,663
Shortcut for you say that

158
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,199
And because you linked

159
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:43,967
Siri Twitter

160
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:44,991
Tile app

161
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:49,343
Siri would Buzz the tile Bluetooth tracker for you and pop up the app

162
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,903
So that's good but

163
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,439
I don't know it is since

164
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:55,231
Apple is not going the

165
00:06:55,743 --> 00:07:01,375
Amazon Google route with skills or actions and routines it's just using apps for those purposes I think

166
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,679
Yes and a friend of mine who's a Big Sur

167
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,447
Supporter of

168
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,471
Apple products

169
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:08,287
He pointed out that learning is really tough

170
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,847
And when you get it wrong it irritates

171
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:14,943
People in that actually brought me back to and I wrote about this but seeing Google's

172
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,759
Head of connected speaker products mark space

173
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,295
And he talked about

174
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:20,831
You know when you're doing

175
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,111
An AI model

176
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:28,767
If you're doing it for what he called a corrective experience so that's when a motion sensor doesn't detect motion for a while and it turns off the light

177
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:29,535
Automatically

178
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:32,607
It is a black at 85% confidence interval

179
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:34,143
Because it's really annoying when you

180
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:35,679
Sitting there in a room

181
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:40,031
And if you're actually going to start something

182
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:40,799
Lectern like

183
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:43,871
I'm going home turn on the oven or order a pizza

184
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:46,431
And it has real world applications that are

185
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:48,479
Kind of bigger than just waving your hands around

186
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,271
Then you got to have like 5 9

187
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:52,063
Which is why a lot of

188
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,343
Black people fight with their advice

189
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,879
Like learning thermostats

190
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:57,439
Can I come see you know apple does not want to build

191
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,463
Sprite

192
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,231
Right

193
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,511
Yeah that makes sense

194
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,791
The only other

195
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:04,095
Aspect that our listeners might be interested in

196
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:07,935
The Apple home app which is typically on iOS devices

197
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:11,775
Will also be available on Mac OS 10 this fall

198
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:14,079
With OS 10 Mojave

199
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,871
And that should be out

200
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,407
What they tested for

201
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,943
Suspect September issue

202
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,479
The public beta will

203
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:22,271
Probably kick off soon so

204
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,807
You'll be able to have a home on your Mac

205
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,343
Yay

206
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,671
I could actually play with it

207
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,207
Without but you wouldn't get to your fence

208
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:36,863
No no you have Siri built into the Mac already and then you would gain access

209
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,143
Your back was always

210
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:42,239
What's a good question they did not mention that didn't talk really about

211
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:48,639
Remote access and hubs and all that which I was actually hoping for him and they did have a whole Apple TV bin I was like oh please

212
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:51,199
Suzuki DRZ way radios in a new version

213
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:52,991
Didn't discuss

214
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,015
Sub-Zero

215
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,295
Okay

216
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,831
So that was what was new on

217
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,111
WWDC

218
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:02,207
That was very muted

219
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,023
You know I know we weren't expecting

220
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:10,399
All right so let's talk about

221
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:12,447
Homekit is coming to a computer

222
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,215
Are you suppose

223
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,239
Pacifically a map

224
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,543
And Madame

225
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,567
Amazon

226
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:18,847
Echo assistant

227
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,639
Is coming to a PC

228
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,407
Near you

229
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,431
Kevin what do you think

230
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,247
Well I think it's

231
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,551
Candida have these assistants

232
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,575
In and around

233
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:33,183
Us everywhere you can have in your home and such to me this is kind of

234
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:33,951
Probably

235
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:39,583
Something Microsoft is not too happy about because they want Cortana and all their Windows machines

236
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,863
Big partnership with him

237
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:44,959
Exactly exactly what Amazon is taking play out of Microsoft

238
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:46,495
Display book now because they work

239
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:49,567
Three different odms original design manufacturers

240
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,591
PCS

241
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,895
Compound quanta in Wichita and they all

242
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:56,479
Create PCS for PHP sadelle's and song they build them

243
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:58,271
What they have is for

244
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,039
Actual

245
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:02,879
Windows PCS that have Madame a built-in

246
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,927
And this will lead

247
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:06,207
Hardware makers just

248
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:10,303
Work with these designs and just have Madam a integrated automatic

249
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:16,703
Play there's nothing they'll have to do so there is one PC and three laptops that will cover makers can choose from

250
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,471
To build off of

251
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:18,495
I will have matinee

252
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,799
I think it's good I just I don't think

253
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,663
Yeah because they were trying to make this weird fine line that that I

254
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:28,479
Originally think was strange between

255
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,503
Matinee

256
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,271
Cortana

257
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:32,575
And Cortana was for business and Padme was for home

258
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,623
But even figuring out what was what

259
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,391
Didn't make sense

260
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,719
This would be a more Nativity

261
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:41,023
Screen Sunday Cortana asking

262
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,071
Padme to do something you know s

263
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:46,399
One assistant asking another so this would probably be a better

264
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,679
Amazon experience

265
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:48,447
What would help

266
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,215
I would hope

267
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,007
One of these days

268
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:53,055
You know what these are just

269
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:55,103
Again neither like design

270
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,383
Reference models

271
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,407
So

272
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:03,039
It's going to be up to Acer vs. Lenovo HP Dell etcetera to decide if they're going to use these

273
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:06,879
Reference models are not so I don't know if or when we'll see these

274
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:08,671
All right

275
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:09,695
And

276
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:10,719
In the

277
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,999
Maybe more exciting

278
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,535
World of crazy connect

279
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,839
The gadgets you can buy you found

280
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,119
A sensor that

281
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,423
I've seen it

282
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,447
You thought it was

283
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,239
Yeah we have seen

284
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:25,311
This type of sensors before this is a Kickstarter project

285
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:29,151
It has 8 days to go it's only halfway to its goal and if it's

286
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:33,503
Not funded all the way it's not happening it's one of those All or Nothing which is actually good

287
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:39,391
If it doesn't happen if you back that you'll get your money back this is called the oval and it's actually the second generation over

288
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:42,463
Basically it's a small 5 in 1 sensor

289
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:45,279
It can measure or tell you about motion

290
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,815
Light temperature

291
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:52,191
Water or humidity no video camera no microphone Rising like that there's no subscription fees

292
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:54,495
You just kind of stick these anywhere you want

293
00:11:55,007 --> 00:12:01,151
There's a little Gateway device of these things can talk to each other before the show station I were comparing pricing to

294
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:06,783
Something similar I think it was the notion you would said yes it's the notion sensors there

295
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,063
Colorado company

296
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:11,647
You can find them on Amazon or at their website getting ocean.com and

297
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:14,207
Pizza been out for a while they're just circular sensors that

298
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:15,487
To measure a bunch of

299
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,255
Different stuff temp

300
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:17,791
Humidity water

301
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:21,887
They don't measure light but they have a decibel tracker so they can measure things like

302
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,679
Glass breaking in that sort of

303
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:30,335
Right you know if you already have a smart home setup these are probably not for you I would say these are in fact

304
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:34,687
Ovals campaign is targeting apartment renters Airbnb host

305
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,479
In a roommate at College Maybe

306
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:37,759
Pricing isn't

307
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:40,831
Terrible you can literally get one sensor

308
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,367
And one

309
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,671
Gateway for 99 bucks

310
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:48,511
Join two sensors it's 129 price goes up from there

311
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:52,095
It was interesting to me I mean that they run on a coin cell battery so you don't

312
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:57,215
I have to really worry about that for about 6 months you just stick them anywhere you want there's double-sided tape included

313
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:59,519
Is subscription fees there's an app for

314
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:01,055
For IOS and Android

315
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:05,919
You obviously get push notifications but it can also send text or even emails

316
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,967
If you'd rather get notified of things that weigh

317
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:09,503
Integration wise

318
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,807
Currently only with if this then that

319
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:17,439
They are looking at homekit certification but they are saying upfront you know it's kind of costly so may not have

320
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,231
Okay

321
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:20,255
Yes and

322
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,535
Notion the other

323
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:25,631
Desensitize most reminded me of this is an Kevin the one that came and found us a novel

324
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:28,959
Do not have an if

325
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:31,775
Integration they do work with nest

326
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:32,543
So

327
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,335
You know you can actually like

328
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:36,639
Detect temperature and then turn on your

329
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,407
Air conditioner

330
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,431
Yay

331
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,967
That's where they are

332
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:41,503
Let's talk about kind of

333
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,527
Some fun little bit

334
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:43,295
7 News

335
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:49,183
Sweet got Lenovo smart display that Kevin and I are both really excited about these are the Google Assistant smart display

336
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,487
Well I can

337
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,255
Pre-order it now

338
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,279
Doesn't shift

339
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:57,119
Well I'm going to make it even sadder because

340
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,143
The LINQ

341
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,679
Was working before the show

342
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:00,703
And now

343
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,263
Page is down for pre-orders

344
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:08,383
Sounds to me like in this is B&H Photo

345
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:12,991
Yeah sounds to me like that went up a little early and they

346
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:15,807
Gave away the shipping date or rough

347
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:20,671
Estimation of when it will be available which was September 3rd so I don't know

348
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,207
What the deal is but

349
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,743
We haven't heard squat about this

350
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,023
Mustang shipping

351
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,815
What is the first time in the summer

352
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:27,839
So

353
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,375
Technically

354
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:30,399
Now it's right after

355
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:34,239
It's still summer so yeah

356
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:36,799
All right you know I can't hold it could be

357
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:40,639
This is not just a standard smart display running on Android wasn't this

358
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:42,431
We later found out Android things

359
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,991
That could be part of the issue

360
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,295
Find

361
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,319
Let's get business

362
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:49,599
Microsoft

363
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,159
New iot core services

364
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,463
What are they Kevin

365
00:14:54,975 --> 00:15:01,119
This will make you happy because they already announced the iot core products so the services at their nothing today provides

366
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:05,471
10 years of Windows OS support through the windows long-term service Channel

367
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:06,239
And

368
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,519
Obviously that means you have

369
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:13,919
Your devices will be support for 10 years but also if you're using that release you won't get feature updates

370
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:18,783
But that's not a bad thing because that will let you focus on stability if your device make

371
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:22,879
So that's good in this is actually super important in the industrial

372
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,159
Where patches

373
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:24,927
Can break like

374
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:25,695
Everything

375
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:29,023
If your patching a piece of equipment that's like

376
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,559
Gear manufacturing processes

377
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:31,327
Dependent on

378
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:32,607
You know you're looking at

379
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:37,727
Millions hundreds of thousands of dollars of lost Revenue if your line goes down I mean this is

380
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:44,383
For most of us in the consumer world were like I'd hate to have this but a lot of these big Industrial

381
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,919
Companies are Enterprises that

382
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:46,687
Epcot

383
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:47,967
A lot of things set up on

384
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:54,367
Or if your medical device manufacturer you don't want it like sending update to the FDA this kind of stability is

385
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,135
Really am

386
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:57,695
In Microsoft gets it

387
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,975
This is why

388
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:00,255
Azure cloud is doing

389
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:02,815
Sowell in Microsoft iot services

390
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,119
I wish that they had

391
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:11,519
More customers to talk about they still using the same reference customers in Sam George at Microsoft had told me

392
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:15,359
This is partially because a lot of customers are trying things out and if it works

393
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:17,407
It's so good for them that they don't want to share

394
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:20,223
And if they're kind of like I don't know what to do with it yet

395
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:21,247
Tentative

396
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,783
Stan pilot Purgatory for

397
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:29,439
I agree with you but I did notice I was very happy to see it that one of those customers using this

398
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,463
Misty robotics

399
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:32,767
Yes yes they are they were at build

400
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:33,535
Actually that's where I

401
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:35,583
Yeah

402
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:42,495
Two other things with this slick or Services they it works with Microsoft device Update Center so that way

403
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:48,639
Is your centralized way too controlling and send out updates as needed you can even Target a small group of devices

404
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:51,967
Testing updates that's good and then they have device

405
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:53,759
Health attestation

406
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:57,855
So you can enable the trustworthiness of a device at boot time

407
00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:00,671
Free trusted iot system so that is awesome

408
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:01,439
That is

409
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,207
Okay

410
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,231
Also

411
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:05,535
From Redmond Microsoft announced

412
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,583
This week that they are

413
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:10,143
They don't have a name for the service yet but

414
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:10,911
We'll call it

415
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,191
Spatial intelligence

416
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:15,775
So understanding of where things are in a building

417
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,567
So they released this

418
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:18,847
They actually showed off

419
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:21,407
Kind of a sense of this at build

420
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,431
A few weeks ago

421
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:27,295
When they did a conference room demo in the conference room understood who was in the room

422
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,831
Based on their ID that

423
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,111
And kind of

424
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:32,415
Where other people were in the building

425
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,951
So that was pretty cool

426
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:39,839
This is the service that enables this and it can do things like detect occupancy it can understand

427
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:44,959
If you have tags on furniture it can understand what Furnitures and what rooms and

428
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:46,239
All kind of

429
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:49,567
It understand how people move around the building and interact with

430
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,335
With the space

431
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:52,127
This is going to freak a lot of pee

432
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,175
If your employers like

433
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,199
Hey

434
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:57,247
Why aren't you in the office more

435
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:02,111
Do you spend all your time at the bathroom or at the water cooler that might

436
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,135
You know you might be like

437
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:07,999
But the goal is to understand how buildings are used

438
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:12,607
Where stuff is if employer needs it you know you're like I did the paper cutter

439
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:13,375
Where is it

440
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,399
We had this issue

441
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,423
Newsroom speech

442
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,543
From home person I love this

443
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:25,151
No, I'll never be monitored

444
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:25,919
Is my points

445
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:28,735
Well actually so you used to have

446
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:33,599
Used to have this idea when we were at gigaom together where you wanted to tie your chair

447
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:37,183
Your butt being in your chair to your I am status

448
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:40,255
Yeah see people would know when I'm available when I'm not

449
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,535
So you can do said yes

450
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:50,239
I was being facetious there's a lot of cool applications for the Senate when I was at Google we worked on the smart office

451
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,519
Projects in spare time

452
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:52,799
This is very cool stuff

453
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:55,359
Yes and her customers using it are Steelcase

454
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:57,151
And CBRE

455
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,175
Which is a

456
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:59,199
Huge

457
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,479
CB Richard Ellis

458
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:02,527
It's just a bunch of

459
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:03,807
Just a bunch of letters

460
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:05,087
Real estate

461
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:10,463
I'm a little surprised that maybe they are using this but I'm a little surprised that Microsoft

462
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:16,607
Seems to have abandoned all the technology that it Acquired and invested in with the Xbox Kinect

463
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:19,167
Yeah so they actually in the

464
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:19,935
Gemo

465
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:24,799
And this was a big thing at Microsoft build they had you know where the polycom speaker

466
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:26,079
Conference Center was

467
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,895
Cone and I wonder if

468
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:29,919
The connect

469
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:31,711
Hardware could be in the cold

470
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:33,247
Everyone was like what's in the cold

471
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,015
Nobody knows

472
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,039
So

473
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,575
They may not have a band

474
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:40,159
We'll just have to see where it

475
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,951
I mean they would be silly not to

476
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:42,719
Incorporate some

477
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,047
Pretty high bandwidth

478
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,583
Data so

479
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:49,375
True Faith at one point

480
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:50,399
Maybe

481
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,935
I mean I have to use all of the

482
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,727
Sensors you know the cameras and such

483
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,263
Time to do what they need to do

484
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:57,823
I remember after I bought the Kinect

485
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,615
They actually had an SDK

486
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:03,455
Kinect SDK for Windows and I was using it to kind of

487
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:09,855
Create a way to turn my lights on when I walked in my office when The Connect saw me and will not miss this goes back quite a ways

488
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:12,927
But all the pieces of the puzzle were there

489
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:14,975
Make a list

490
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:15,743
Who knows

491
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:18,815
And finally

492
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:21,631
Find a little bit of news Sierra Wireless has

493
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,423
Launched a new version of it

494
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,447
Mango

495
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:25,471
Open source

496
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:26,495
Hardware platform

497
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:28,799
For industrial iot

498
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:29,567
And so

499
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:32,383
The mango yellow is the new

500
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:34,431
Device it is a super sensor

501
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,223
The mango yellow has

502
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:39,295
14 sensors and actuators on board

503
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,063
Which is

504
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:42,111
Yeah

505
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:44,415
And it will function with

506
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:50,559
A wide variety of cellular-based low-power wide area networks such as cat M1 and nb-iot

507
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:53,631
So this joins the mango

508
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:55,167
Red and green Prada

509
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,191
That are out

510
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:59,007
And basically it's just got

511
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:00,031
More sensor

512
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:05,151
This is used by companies who want to try to build and prototype

513
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:06,687
Connected devices

514
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:08,735
Business processes

515
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:13,343
So you can buy a couple of these Papa around your manufacturing facility if you want and see like

516
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:15,135
What does it make sense to measure here

517
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:17,440
That's what these are

518
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,464
Pretty cool

519
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:19,488
And

520
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,768
The mango yellow

521
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:25,376
Is not going to be available though until May 2019

522
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:29,216
And now

523
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:33,312
Kevin and I are going to share things that we have spent our own money on

524
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,640
You spent more

525
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:41,760
I spent a lot more so I spent $99 on an aware glow this is a

526
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:48,160
Really interesting products that I've actually been looking at this company that used to make it bigger one there's a new one coming so the

527
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,440
Old one is being discounted

528
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:52,512
It was like $200 now it looks like

529
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:53,280
It might be on sale

530
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:58,400
If you get one but you may not want to get one cuz there's a new one coming out or you can spend

531
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,680
$99

532
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:00,448
And get

533
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:02,240
The glow which is what I did

534
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:03,520
It measures

535
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:06,080
Chemicals in the air so vocs in the air

536
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:07,104
It measures

537
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,128
Humidity

538
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:09,152
Temperature

539
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:10,944
And also carbon dioxide

540
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:12,224
And

541
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:17,600
I got it because I wanted to test the air quality in the Portables in my daughter's school

542
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:21,952
Because she has classes in them and she says it's so hot and stuffy

543
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:23,744
And I was trying to get data to like

544
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:24,768
Understand

545
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,048
How hot and stuffy

546
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:28,608
And the school allowed that which is awesome

547
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,424
He did now I had a hard time connecting it to their Network

548
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,728
So this is a Wi-Fi product

549
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,568
Power products they just pop it in and the coolest thing is they have a

550
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:38,336
Pass-through

551
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:39,616
Plug so

552
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:41,408
You do take up an outlet

553
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,432
When you plug this in

554
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:44,736
But you can plug other things in it and

555
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:46,016
Also acts as a smart

556
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:48,576
Plug even cooler is

557
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:51,136
In the app you can actually pick

558
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:52,928
Like if you plug in a fan

559
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:54,464
Or a humidifier

560
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,000
Dehumidifier

561
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:57,024
Or in my case

562
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,304
Air purifier

563
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:02,912
You tell it what you plugged in and it will automatically turn that device on

564
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:03,936
When it's needed

565
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:07,008
So if the temperature gets too high and it knows there's a fan plugged in

566
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,544
Intuit it'll automatically turn the fan

567
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:09,824
I think that's

568
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:12,384
This is basically in

569
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,224
This is good for anybody who's got who like lives in a New York City Apartment

570
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:16,992
Or has

571
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:18,528
Window air conditioning

572
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,088
You can actually take your old window air conditioning unit

573
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,392
Plug it into this and tell it hey

574
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:25,696
When the temperature gets above 90 degrees

575
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:26,720
Turn the sucker rod

576
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:27,488
Or

577
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,024
If you don't want that to happen cuz

578
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:30,816
At work all day you can also sets

579
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:33,632
I think it's a really nice mode

580
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:38,240
I'm not 100% sure it does not tell me how many parts

581
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:40,288
Vermillion is measuring for the boc

582
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,568
Short interest

583
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:42,592
There's a lot of

584
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:46,944
How sensitive these really are but it is very good for noticing

585
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:50,272
That's what I have to ask

586
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:53,088
What was the trend in the classroom

587
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:57,440
So because I had a hard time getting it on the Wi-Fi network I never actually got in

588
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:00,256
But I can tell you

589
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:01,280
It's right now in my car

590
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:02,816
Kitchen when I cook

591
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,352
Holy cow

592
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,632
I really should leave Italy

593
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,168
That is what yeah

594
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:08,704
I know

595
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,288
I can save you $99 and just tell you to do that

596
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,848
Fair

597
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,176
I should also say you can set preferences if this is kind of fun

598
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:23,040
It will tell you your air is bad with a little glowing light on the device or it will also send you a new

599
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,064
Vacation if you will

600
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:27,392
But you can set different priorities

601
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:29,952
With you basically tell the device

602
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:30,976
Like allergies aren't

603
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:33,024
To me so it will tell you

604
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,072
It's a little bit more sensitive to

605
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:35,840
Humidity

606
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:38,656
Chemicals if you want productivity

607
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:40,448
Carbon dioxide in the air

608
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,472
Becomes

609
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:42,496
Born critic

610
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:45,568
So I think it's a really fun product

611
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:47,360
For $99

612
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:50,688
They've got a promotion right now going on Spring 10

613
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:51,968
And then you get like

614
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:53,504
10% off which again

615
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:54,784
Huge but nice

616
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,576
I like it

617
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:57,600
So smart plugs

618
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:58,880
Also tracks my hair

619
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:03,744
Very nice sell it works with a bunch of other devices like Madam a

620
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,512
And I think

621
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:06,560
Hey

622
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:09,888
So I spent a whopping $2.99

623
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:10,656
As for my

624
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:12,448
Hey Big Spender

625
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,264
Yeah but I had to I had to have this

626
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,032
I'll tell you why

627
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:17,824
Because I couldn't believe it was true

628
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,592
Seriously

629
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:20,128
I found an app

630
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,664
For my Apple watch

631
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:23,712
But apparently allegedly

632
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:24,480
Reportedly

633
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:26,016
Put some anime

634
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:26,784
On my wrist

635
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:30,112
I'm thinking no way Applewood never allowed

636
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,904
Just can't work not possible

637
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:32,672
Turn off

638
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:33,696
It works

639
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:34,976
I'm not going to say it works

640
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:39,584
The way you would hope and I'll explain why in a second but it does work so

641
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:42,912
The name of the app is voice in a can

642
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:48,800
And maybe we can put a link in the show notes not just maybe to the app in appstore but also to a video demo

643
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:50,080
Tattoo developer

644
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:50,848
Chose

645
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:51,872
It works

646
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,432
Basically this is really clever

647
00:25:54,688 --> 00:26:00,576
You open the app on your watch and I have a complication on my watch that is a shortcut to it so I have to tap the watch obviously

648
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:02,112
And then I also have to

649
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:03,648
Tap the screen to

650
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:05,184
Tell the watch to start listening

651
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:06,720
So now I say my

652
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:08,256
I don't have to say Madam a I just

653
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,304
And I say my command

654
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:16,448
That information that sound bite is then sent to Amazon servers just like any other Echo device

655
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:19,776
And she responds and does or does whatever I've commanded

656
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:21,568
You know just like you would to an echo

657
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,432
So there's a little bit of lag in terms of the back-and-forth communication

658
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:28,224
And the fact you have to tap the screen

659
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,320
But it does work now and that it's not unbearable lag I mean it's just

660
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:35,392
Not as quick as using an actual Amazon product so

661
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:39,488
I'm impressed it does what it says it does and I did not think it would

662
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,512
That is rare in the

663
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:43,072
Yes very true

664
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:45,120
And now it is

665
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:47,936
Alright listener hotline

666
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:49,216
And guys

667
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:50,240
Andros

668
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:53,568
We are still doing a giveaway I am giving away my

669
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:56,640
SI thermostat

670
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:59,456
So this is not the cool looking ecobee that

671
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:04,064
And if they launched in response to Nest but it is a perfectly good

672
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,344
Connect a thermostat

673
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,440
It talks to Madame a and Google assistant and has a lovely ecobee app

674
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,208
So you'll

675
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:11,744
You got all the benefits in just

676
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,280
An older model thermostat

677
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:17,888
So that is what we are giving away if you leave a voicemail at 5 1/2

678
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:19,680
62374

679
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:20,448
2/4

680
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,056
And this week's voicemail comes to us from Dan in Charlotte

681
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,592
Hi Stacy and Kevin

682
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:28,128
This is dance with Charlotte

683
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:30,176
I got to be honest I am really struggling

684
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:30,944
Smart lighting

685
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,736
You both know a lot about the space

686
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:34,272
Stacy particular seems

687
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:35,296
Smart lighting

688
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:36,064
Chinato

689
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,624
I've thus far stayed away from Smart bulbs

690
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,696
Because balls are expensive and they put the burden on my wife and Young

691
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:42,464
Kids

692
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,000
Not to touch the wall switches

693
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:47,584
SmartThings user I've already installed about 5

694
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,352
GE smart

695
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:49,632
Which is around the house

696
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:53,472
Delete my basic GE smart switches I can schedule lights to go on and off

697
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:54,496
SmartThings

698
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:56,544
Turn on off groups of Lights

699
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,336
For example when we're going to bed

700
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:00,384
I am planning out a bunch more switches

701
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:02,688
And so I wonder what I'm missing out on

702
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:04,736
Should I honestly consider smart bulb

703
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:06,528
With Lutron caseta

704
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:07,296
For switches

705
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:09,088
Be much better for me than my tea

706
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:09,856
East Witches

707
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:11,648
What else would I want to

708
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:12,928
Regularly do

709
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,720
Gianna current GE smart

710
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:15,744
Switch features

711
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:18,048
Thanks very much for the recommendation

712
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,584
Oh damn

713
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:25,984
I kind of wish I knew a little bit more about your light switch but we are going to guess that it is the GE Z-Wave either

714
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:26,752
Either the demo

715
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:29,312
Switch or the on-off switch

716
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:31,104
If it is the on-off switch

717
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,384
I'm going to recommend you go for

718
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,408
Dimmer switches

719
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:35,456
I am not going to recommend you go for

720
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:36,224
Car bulbs

721
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,504
Unless you are doing

722
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:39,040
Actual

723
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:39,808
Lamps

724
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:41,088
Between lamps and bulbs

725
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,112
Perfectly except

726
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:44,928
But in terms of getting more

727
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,000
Out of switches if you are happy with those switches

728
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:50,048
Then I see keep going

729
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,352
I will say by switch of choice

730
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:54,400
Is the Lutron caseta

731
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:55,680
Only because

732
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:56,448
Cuz

733
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:57,472
With the Lutron

734
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:59,520
Hub they will work with homekit

735
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:00,288
And

736
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:01,568
A bunch of other

737

Wink

740
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:11,808
Yes so if that sort of like level of future-proofing and interoperability is important to you

741
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:12,576
Then

742
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:13,856
Yes gopher

743
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:20,256
That when you sell your house I would recommend in that case you sell the Lutron caseta Hub with it and then they

744
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:21,024
Nature's can do it

745
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:21,792
What they want

746
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:22,816
With the current

747
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:24,864
GE things you probably

748
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,192
It's going to be hard to convince someone to use SmartThings you know what I'm saying

749
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:28,960
It's a little tough

750
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,312
But those are really the only thing certain Kevin can you think of

751
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:35,360
Things that he's missing out on by

752
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:37,152
Going or sticking with it

753
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:38,432
GE

754
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:41,248
Either dimmers I would go with dimmers over the switch

755
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,552
Right because that way

756
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:50,208
Ciq the bulb route because I do lamps more than overhead lights and such in my family is trained that they'll get a small

757
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:52,768
Small electric shock if they touch any switches in the house

758
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:57,120
I can't think of anything the only other thing I would consider and I don't know if

759
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:58,912
The investment is worth it

760
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:04,288
We talked about a couple of switches and light sets that will kind of create the scenes for you

761
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,360
Things like new

762
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:08,896
Citracal that's the one

763
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:11,968
Noon does an in this is better for open floor plan

764
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:14,784
Plants this is not good for like individual rooms but

765
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,064
If you uninstall

766
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:17,856
And actually someone else will come out in

767
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:19,648
Install a bunch of noon switches for

768
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:25,280
Then they create they have a lighting designer whose pre-configured a bunch of options like movie time

769
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:27,840
This is what all the lights should do

770
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:28,608
Movie time

771
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,656
Some other things to think about

772
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:33,472
Lutron bought a company called catcher that also does this

773
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:36,288
So we may see that coming to luchon

774
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,312
Baby

775
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:39,104
I'm guessing maybe it would be nice but

776
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:39,872
I'm not holding my breath

777
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:43,456
And then only other thing that you might want is

778
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:47,296
There's a couple light switches that have like motion sensors

779
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:53,952
And ecobee4 example has a $99 light switch that has a motion sensor and Madame Abe

780
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:54,720
Belton

781
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:56,256
If that's appealing to you

782
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:59,072
Pretty expensive if you're going to replace a bunch of them

783
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,352
I don't know if I'd go there

784
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:02,144
But you got those do exist

785
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:04,448
And I couldn't help solve the whole

786
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:05,984
Use the switch or not use the switch

787
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,312
Issue because you got the motion sensor and they're granted

788
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:10,848
A little more than two times

789
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:11,872
The price of

790
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:13,664
The ge's that you have but

791
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,968
You know when you get mad at me so

792
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:19,296
Easy way to put an assistant in a room without buying another

793
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:21,344
Device itself another Standalone device

794
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:22,624

How technology

810
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:11,520
Can really

811
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:13,056
Change the equation

812
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:13,824

Let's get this started I saw you

Polar bear

851
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:03,904
On stage at an event and you saying

852
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:04,928
You danced

853
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:06,208
Polar bear dance

854
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:06,976
List with you

855
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:10,304
On the screen it was a really surreal in

856
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,608
Cool experience talk to me about

857
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:14,912
That performance in how it all came together

858
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:21,056
Quick Lacy with J which is a digital media

859
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:24,128
I'm usually from Melbourne Australia

860
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:26,432
And we connected about a year ago

861
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,712
They help

862
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:29,248
As the first time I Tibet

863
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:30,272
Try the glass

864
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,552
AR

865
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:35,136
Stances that kind of stuff

866
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:37,184
It's kind of been in the back of my mind

867
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,792
Do something as an extension of the music that I could use

868
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:43,072
Again about

869
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:44,864
She wants to know something and

870
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,424
We had this amazing Workshop actually

871
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,752
Basically with all these Amazing Ideas that we want to try and

872
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:52,032
What's the one thing

873
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:54,080
Right now

874
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:55,104
They just pets

875
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:56,640
Cool suits

876
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,712
I'm basically

877
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:03,296
I was like okay well maybe I can perform in this week

878
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:05,600
Something we can create

879
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:06,624
Kind of surreal

880
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,672
Experience

881
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:11,488
Into my into my songs and which song I wanted

882
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:12,768
Performance and

883
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:14,048
The bed sometimes

884
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:15,072
Smart Switch

885
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:19,680
It's credit personal songs to me it's with I wrote it just after my grandmother passed away

886
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:23,776
Then when I certainly went into a really lunch time

887
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:25,312
Which is why

888
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:26,848
Oh there's my eye

889
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:29,920
Because I deal with bipolar disorder and

890
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:30,944
Carnival

891
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:31,712
Spirit animal

892
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:34,016
Polar bear with dance

893
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:35,552
Different theme

894
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:39,648
Sorry that was a really great team

895
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:45,536
Fugees my vision I suppose so I gave them the conception they kind of morphed

896
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:47,840
We filmed in that are we feeling

897
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:49,120
At a club

898
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:51,424
Onion

899
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,704
Lovely experience

900
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:58,336
Came out so you guys I'll play a little snippet of the song for you and a link to a video of

901
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:00,640
Parts of the performance in the show notes in

902
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:01,408
In case you

903
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,176
Want to see

904
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:19,840
Alright so

905
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:21,376
Let's talk about

906
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:22,912
You as an artist

907
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:25,216
What do you do what do you focus on

908
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:28,544
And then we'll talk about how you think about bringing technology

909
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:33,408
I mean I know it's been a musician since I was quite young I played the trumpet

910
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:36,480
So many years and then black moose more and Chip quiet

911
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:37,504
Japan

912
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,784
And then now finally on

913
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,064
Play music

914
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,856
AnnaSophia code Ableton Live

915
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:43,904
Which is really intuitive

916
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:45,440
It software actually

917
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:47,488
Because you can pretty much orchestrate

918
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,768
As many sounds

919
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:49,536
Lively

920
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,072
Kind of things

921
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:54,144
Your software to my music so it can be quite emojis

922
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:54,912
I love chicken

923
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,960
Technology

924
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:58,240
Has the potential

925
00:36:58,496 --> 00:36:59,776
In a creative way to be

926
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:01,568
Really magical

927
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:03,616
So then let's talk about

928
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:06,176
This suit for example that was using lotion

929
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:06,944
Capture

930
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:08,992
Create this VR experience

931
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:13,856
And you have this idea for a VR elevator that I think is

932
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:14,880
Really interesting

933
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:16,160
Yeah yeah

934
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:18,720
I think it kind of came about

935
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:20,256
Initial Wikipedia

936
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:21,792
Create

937
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:22,816
Is that true

938
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:24,096
Stay so you can like

939
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:25,888
Choose where you want to go

940
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:27,424
Inside an elevator came

941
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:28,448
You know what shop

942
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:30,752
Black creatives

943
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:33,312
Virtual space so we can release Music Week

944
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:36,640
Have interviews people can go in and try instrument

945
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:37,408
Bavette

946
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:40,736
To space so I don't really really excited

947
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:44,064
It's something they were actually working on

948
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:48,672
And ideas what I'd love to do is to release my album

949
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:50,208
In the elevator

950
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:51,744
It does that make sense

951
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,512
It's a little bit

952
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:53,792
Big wild

953
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:55,328
Each floor could have

954
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:58,144
Find song I suppose you can like cheese

955
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,168
Selection

956
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:03,520
Maybe the top that be like a interview going on but I mean

957
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:05,056
Jose might Collective

958
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:10,432
Facilitate all different than Keurig different floors cuz I have a lot of

959
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:13,504
It's loud stated that IDK

960
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,040
Came out in the light wow wow

961
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:16,576
Have a whole system

962
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,440
And you just randomly pick a

963
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:25,536
The floor I mean

964
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:27,584
Technically that's what day would come

965
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:34,496
Yeah and let's talk about working and we'll get this in Spades in a moment

966
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:36,032
Let's talk about working with

967
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:37,312
Technology as an

968
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:38,080
Artist

969
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:39,104
How do you

970
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:44,224
I know that you're like oh I think this is need how could I use it how much do you have to collaborate with

971
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,504
Partners and what do you look

972
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:47,296
Yeah

973
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:50,880
I mean when it comes to the stuff we're able to have been using it for about 6

974
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:52,672
And I use it too

975
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:53,952
Sketch sound

976
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:54,976
Interscope

977
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:55,744
Sounds

978
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:57,536
Two different forms

979
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:59,328
Exemplify recorded

980
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:01,632
Snake like one of my Stones new country

981
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:02,912
Actually recorded

982
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:03,936
Snow

983
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:06,240
Steps to take on the snow and then

984
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:07,264
Transporter

985
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:08,544
Ableton

986
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,616
And I messed around with it to make it sound like a song

987
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:12,384
I said I do

988
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:15,968
Just on my own and I love doing that but I also really love

989
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:16,992
Clever

990
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:18,272
Expedition stickers

991
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:19,296
They add so much

992
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,576
Text Jen death

993
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:23,392
Cipher example my friend Looney she's

994
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:24,672
A trumpet player

995
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:26,208
Spreadable chocolate

996
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:27,232
And when she played

997
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:28,256
Ilovesukie

998
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:30,560
Trumpet Wild play

999
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:31,584
Lives

1000
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,352
Stuff

1001
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:35,680
Took sketch's real texture

1002
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:38,496
Imitation in my feelings electronic

1003
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:40,288
Music

1004
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,848
Think she knows technical it's very like

1005
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:47,968
Maybe a little solace in some way though just to check my banking music that actually

1006
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:49,248
It's kind of like having an old

1007
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:51,296
In your computer that you just

1008
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:52,832
Launch different sounds

1009
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:58,720
And when you're thinking about doing like these VR worlds

1010
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:01,024
How do you sync that collaboration

1011
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,584
Works do you like SketchUp

1012
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,352
With someone

1013
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:06,912
Yeah I'm not I love the idea of you

1014
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:07,936
Eating a live animation

1015
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:08,960
Analytics different

1016
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:11,008
Phoenix Artisan that way

1017
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:12,544
Visual artist salary

1018
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,360
If you in mind commissioning other artists

1019
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:18,432
She create there in floor

1020
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:19,456
The sequence

1021
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:20,480
Which BRS

1022
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:23,552
The accessibility some people

1023
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:25,600
So maybe you could be cool types

1024
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:26,368
Estates

1025
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,160
Arcade

1026
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:29,952
You can come in and try these

1027
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:37,376
So let's go to this concept of descent babes because this is something you are passionate about and it's

1028
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:38,400
The unjust use

1029
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:39,424
Talk to me about what that is

1030
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:43,520
Since paid records about 2 years ago

1031
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:48,128
Editor's Pitchfork Jessica Hopper

1032
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:49,920
Kum & Go

1033
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:52,992
Business ideas

1034
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:53,760
Because

1035
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:54,784
Traditional

1036
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,576
The music industry is very

1037
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:58,368
Enchanted

1038
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:00,416
The leadership structure sounds like

1039
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:01,952
I really want to create this

1040
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:02,720
Collective

1041
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:04,512
Basically of women

1042
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:06,304
Gender diverse

1043
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:09,632
And also I wanted to release my own album

1044
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:13,728
And that's always been the core I think you stop sitting

1045
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:14,496
Having

1046
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:16,032
Dynasty of my music

1047
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:19,872
I'm not handing it over and not losing the copyright to it and then

1048
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:21,920
It's kind of evolved into

1049
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:24,736
More of the collective more of a startup

1050
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:26,528
Because I wanted to

1051
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:27,296
Have impact

1052
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:29,344
I wanted to change the electronic music

1053
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,928
Representation is so loose women

1054
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:38,304
Biggest scale and it stinks one of the main issues is accessibility to

1055
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:40,352
Expensive music software

1056
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:41,120
I think

1057
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:42,400
United stilettos

1058
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:43,424
Gatekeepers

1059
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:49,824
That has many female artists because maybe they just got different biases

1060
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:53,663
About a year ago and how and why and those are the kind of reason

1061
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:55,711
Create

1062
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:57,247
Can a very cool online face

1063
00:41:57,503 --> 00:41:59,039
With the funding you're trying to raise

1064
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:02,623
You guys are going to create this online space where

1065
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:03,391
People will have

1066
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:05,695
Access to the discounted software

1067
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:06,975
Yeah kind of

1068
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:09,023
I think I was really inspired by

1069
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:10,047
The

1070
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:15,935
Wow

1071
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:19,519
Revolutionize the way you GPS me to basically

1072
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:23,103
I was discussing his concept of offering up the software

1073
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:26,431
Time I suppose

1074
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:27,455
Omnicef

1075
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:31,295
It takes a long time to learn

1076
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:32,831
I mean I had to Ableton

1077
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:35,903
6 years before I actually bought it myself

1078
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:39,999
Idea of like being able to share the stuff way around

1079
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:42,815
And then just being charged with what you used

1080
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:45,375
Taxi really cool concept

1081
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:46,911
That could be a really

1082
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:48,191
Cool idea where you could

1083
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:50,239
Try it out and then you can

1084
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:52,543
I had this idea

1085
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:54,079
Because cost of the way such as

1086
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:55,103
Thing that came up

1087
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:56,383
See my research

1088
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:57,663
As to why

1089
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:59,455
Why you do by the software

1090
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:03,807
I'm like well you know average and less than men

1091
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:05,087
Gender pay Gap

1092
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:05,855
Clean the world

1093
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:07,647
You know women on average have more

1094
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:09,183
Customer service

1095
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:16,607
You know some discounts you can also do you use the platform that's the kind of

1096
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:17,631
Thinking that I want

1097
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:19,423
Next to me feels like it was

1098
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:20,703
Create more impact

1099
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:21,983
Got it

1100
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:27,103
Okay and then the other part of this so after you got the online space you're also creating a festival

1101
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,383
Correct

1102
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:30,943
Exciting

1103
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:32,479
Gene study

1104
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:33,503
It's going to come from

1105
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:35,551
Conferences check music feminist

1106
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:41,183
And some of this money that the raising will go towards that and then we basically

1107
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:43,487
Cities around the world

1108
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:45,791
And yeah just inspire

1109
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:48,607
Basically because yeah

1110
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:50,399
Women have really interesting

1111
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:53,727
Ways of approaching technology and also making using it

1112
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:55,007
So I think it has a

1113
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:57,567
Potential to inspire

1114
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:59,103
Got it all right and

1115
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:01,407
Let's talk about the blockchain because yes

1116
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:02,175
Wouldn't

1117
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:07,551
After the conference when we went out to dinner we were all very excited about blockchain

1118
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:12,671
And I keep talking about

1119
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:15,743
Have you thought of ways to use it and music

1120
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:16,767
Seem like they might

1121
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:19,071
I know you Imogen Heap

1122
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:20,607
She's an amazing artist

1123
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:22,911
How do you

1124
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:23,935
Create transaction

1125
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:28,031
Assess streaming cost because the way I see it

1126
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:30,335
Have their own

1127
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:31,359
Justin on the Block

1128
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:33,151
We can see exactly how many

1129
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:34,175
Streams weekend

1130
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:37,503
We can see it's a nut-free put really subtract

1131
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:39,295
On a particular date that way

1132
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:41,343
Cuz right now

1133
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:42,623
If I

1134
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:43,647
You know I'm a

1135
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:44,671
Distributor

1136
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:46,463
If I take that down there

1137
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:47,231
What happens to the

1138
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:49,279
The song like I just think the permanent

1139
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:50,815
Of blockchain mixit

1140
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:51,839
Very exciting

1141
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:54,143
And you can really see exactly

1142
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:55,167
How many streams

1143
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:57,215
Did you get how much money you are

1144
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:58,239
That's what makes me

1145
00:44:58,495 --> 00:44:59,007
Meetfighters

1146
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:00,543
Okay so more is a payments

1147
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:03,871
Payment seeing the other than ulcers smart contract

1148
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:05,919
When you working with Odyssey

1149
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:06,943
You know you

1150
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:09,759
You want it to be as legitimate as possible

1151
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:11,039
And sometimes

1152
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:12,319
Where did I put that contract

1153
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:16,671
Quite exciting and then that's the stuff we're sharing

1154
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:17,439
System

1155
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:18,975
Would be in the blockchain because

1156
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:21,535
You know you use it and then it sits there as a wreck

1157
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:23,583
But this is kind of things that I'm

1158
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:25,375
Planning on thinking about

1159
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:26,655
And going forward

1160
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:30,495
How do you think that connectivity and Technology will change

1161
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:32,287
How we experience music

1162
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:35,103
That is a head of a human pillar

1163
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:36,383
It's like a it's a

1164
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:41,247
Play that is a Bluetooth cooler

1165
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:43,295
And had the speaker in it

1166
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:45,087
Jesus

1167
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:46,623
Flashlight

1168
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:47,647
50s music

1169
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:49,951
And they had beef United displays

1170
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:51,487
And it's just amazing

1171
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:53,023
Killer Bean spacing

1172
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:54,047
Enfamil enspire

1173
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:58,143
Can watch a movie on your phone or you could

1174
00:45:58,399 --> 00:45:59,679
I can sleep

1175
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:00,703
Something old list

1176
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:01,471
Listen to music

1177
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:03,007
I've been listening to it

1178
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:04,799
Vibration

1179
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:06,847
So I think that has

1180
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:07,871
Containment salon

1181
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:08,895
Will be a big

1182
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:10,943
Change when people stop to get all these

1183
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:11,967
Cool little gadgets

1184
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:13,759
Kids music

1185
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:14,783
Whole new way

1186
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:15,551
When it comes

1187
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:17,087
Forming like the way I talk

1188
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:19,135
Performed

1189
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:22,207
The order

1190
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:23,231
So I can

1191
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:24,511
Is my audio system

1192
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:25,535
Is motion sensor

1193
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:27,583
And when I move spinner

1194
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:28,607
Different

1195
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:31,167
Different different sounds can come out just

1196
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:31,935
Remind me

1197
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:33,215
Rather than me

1198
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:35,263
Ashley

1199
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:36,031
Maybe I could

1200
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:38,335
Control the music with membrane

1201
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:40,127
And I think that's really

1202
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:41,407
Very very cool and fun

1203
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:42,943
Hiking sweat

1204
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:47,551
I think it's kind of messy I think you know even stage cough like

1205
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:49,087
Microphones and mic French

1206
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:50,623
Stems and things like that

1207
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:52,415
Analogues

1208
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:55,487
I think the evolution of different products

1209
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:57,023
Can use on stage

1210
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:58,815
That maybe didn't exist

1211
00:46:59,071 --> 00:46:59,839
Music

1212
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:02,655
Oh so like we ditch the microphone and we go for something

1213
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:05,471
Yeah I have this idea of a

1214
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:08,031
Say

1215
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:10,079
Kind of follow you and

1216
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:11,871
You don't have sexy hold

1217
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:13,151
But she likes

1218
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:13,919
When you hold the next

1219
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:15,967
How to tell your whole performance

1220
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:20,063
Anna Kate Bush was one of the first people to request a headset mic

1221
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:21,599
You want to feel this moment

1222
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:23,391
She was one of the first people to do that

1223
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:25,439
Beside you is like a

1224
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:26,207
Train that could

1225
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:28,255
American flag in front of your face

1226
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:33,119
You can sing into it and then like I said about the elevator part

1227
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:35,423
Entertainment at home

1228
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:36,447
Feeling like

1229
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:39,007
And that gives access to a lot more

1230
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:39,775
People

1231
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:40,543
The people that

1232
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:41,823
Experience life

1233
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:43,103
Could be thousands

1234
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:44,895
And then

1235
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:51,807
Sew-in that gets to a big challenges right now it feels like the

1236
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:53,087
World for artists

1237
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:56,159
Is both wide open with crowdfunding taipei

1238
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:56,927
Opportunities and

1239
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:57,695
Patreon

1240
00:47:58,719 --> 00:47:59,487
Yes

1241
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:01,023
Yes is a lot of

1242
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:02,047
Construction happening

1243
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:04,095
Because he called music

1244
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:05,631
Industry model. Working

1245
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:08,703
Really

1246
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:10,751
Reclaim the in Independence

1247
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:11,775
Anoka

1248
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:20,223
Is to be able to send or the creative projects that we want to do and not operate like a like a not-for-profit

1249
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:22,527
Something actually operate on a business

1250
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:23,551
Stitches

1251
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:25,343
This is social cause

1252
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:26,623
No I think that's PayPal

1253
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:28,159
When that happens

1254
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:31,743
Okay well I'm here thank you so much for coming on the show

1255
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:33,535
Thank you

1256
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:35,839
That's it for this week

1257
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:39,679
