Xiaomi outdoor light

00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:24,064
And the rachio

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,088
Connected sprinkler

10
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:26,624
We're going to talk about

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,904
A possible deal for

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:28,672
Control

13
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:30,464
So let's get started Kevin

14
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:31,488
I purchased

15
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:32,512
Fitness tracker

16
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:33,536
Yes

17
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:36,096
Tell tell people what you bought

18
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:41,472
First because you did not get yours yet you ordered it I actually have two in my hand so what did you buy

19
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:43,264
I bought the Under Armour

20
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,032
Healthbox

21
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,312
You recommended last week

22
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:46,848
Week 4

23
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:49,152
Father's Day special in the reason I did it

24
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:50,432
Because I have been looking

25
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:51,968
SportsCenter looking at it

26
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:52,736
Since it launched

27
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:54,784
I got a $40 off

28
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,576
Promo code for UnderArmour

29
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:57,600
Because I'm at my fitness

30
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,160
Sam

31
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:00,928
Yes we say

32
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:07,328
And there it was already $50 off in the store so I got a total of 90 bucks off I don't know what that's going to

33
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:08,096
Astilbe

34
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:10,144
Available to People by the time this run

35
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:11,424
Right

36
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,960
The $50 off was

37
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:14,240
The way it was

38
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:22,688
So you don't have it yet but as I mentioned last week I wouldn't recommend it if I didn't like it and I do like it

39
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:23,456
I haven't

40
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:26,784
I think what you'll appreciate and we can talk about

41
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,064
Why does the port in a few minutes

42
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:31,904
I think you'll appreciate the whole view that they give you

43
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,440
Of your health meaning

44
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:37,280
If you wear the tracker in the heart rate monitor and use the scale

45
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:39,328
Obviously getting your weight body fat

46
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,608
Getting your steps

47
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:41,632
Your sleep

48
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:42,912
Activity

49
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:44,960
Because they own map my

50
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:46,752
Fitness and also MapMyRun

51
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:49,056
You can track your nutrition at MyFitnessPal

52
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:52,896
Sinks in nicely so you get a nice dashboard

53
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:54,944
In there app for IOS and Android

54
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:59,552
It's complete I love that I love that the reason I'm not using it

55
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:05,184
Is because they don't have like a GPS tracking device which I like to use when I run

56
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:11,584
I like my maps and whatnot and I've got seven years of data in RunKeeper all the map information and elevation and

57
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:18,496
Anyway that's why I'm not using it but I love it I think you're going to love it too but when I guess we'll find out in a week or two

58
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:20,032
We will it arrives on when

59
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,824
So cool

60
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,176
Okay so I actually did go out and purchase to fitness trackers

61
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,200
In two days

62
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,224
Over the past weekend

63
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,760
One's going back already

64
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:36,928
Tell you what I bought and why is my back and then leading to the bigger picture here because I'm going to get cranky in a few minutes about Health Data

65
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:40,256
So I bought the Samsung Gear Fit

66
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,024
2

67
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,840
Which looks very much like a Microsoft band it's it's

68
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:45,376
Pretty slim in Felton

69
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:48,192
Has a beautiful display and I love the harder

70
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:52,288
Just it just launched last week I got it like the day it came out and $179

71
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,312
It does

72
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:55,872
Work with any Android phone

73
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:58,432
Android 4.4 better and I said that because

74
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,712
Previous Samsung

75
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:03,040
Wearables on the first timeout only work with Samsung phones which was a

76
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:05,088
Terrible no no shame on Samsung for that

77
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:08,160
Twitter iOS user this is pretty much useless to you as well

78
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,184
So

79
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:14,816
I used it for a day and I will like the hardware the software is okay

80
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:18,656
It pretty much tracks everything is got a optical heart rate monitor

81
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:20,448
Scott GPS Senate even though it's

82
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,728
Pretty small

83
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,312
It actually can store 1000 songs

84
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,592
Turn on Bluetooth

85
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:27,360
It really nice

86
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:29,152
Sleep information was kind of like

87
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,200
The reasons going back

88
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,992
Has to do with my bigger picture

89
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,272
I'm going to get cranky now

90
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,088
S-health is the software that uses

91
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:38,624
Samsung S Health

92
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:43,232
Until a few days ago S Health really didn't work with any other services

93
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,560
I say until a few days ago because it wasn't update to S Health

94
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:52,960
I just Friday last week I believe where they share data with Microsoft Misfit RunKeeper and Strava

95
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,520
But here's my issue

96
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:59,872
And this may not be a problem for you Stacy cuz you're all in one package

97
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:01,152
Record

98
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:03,712
I am calling for a global

99
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:06,016
Mobile Health Data standards

100
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,808
Because all of these different

101
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:10,368
Applications all these trackers Ali services

102
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,672
They all want to own the data themselves

103
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:13,952
Occasionally

104
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:17,280
Some of them let you export your data manually which is great

105
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:20,607
Some of them sink to some Services some of them don't seem to others

106
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:24,447
And even when some a service or tracker says it syncs with something

107
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,215
It

108
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:29,055
You want to check the fine print because only certain things go

109
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,079
2

110
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:32,127
Get synced over property example

111
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:34,431
S-health actually does sync over to Fitbit

112
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:36,479
But all it stinks over is steps

113
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:37,503
To all of my

114
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,039
Calories burned my

115
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,831
Tracking my activities

116
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:41,855
None of that goes

117
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:44,415
They say it's thanks but just

118
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,183
This bit

119
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,207
Guess you better

120
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:51,327
Okay so this actually ties in cuz our guest this week is it for Desta Ramirez who is actually a

121
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,095
Public Health

122
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:57,983
PhD who did research on this so wonderful about why this matters

123
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,007
What's happening

124
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,311
But

125
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,079
What about

126
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,103
Something like healthkit

127
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,127
Cuz that's kind of what

128
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,199
IOS only

129
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:13,599
Right ok Google as Google Fit which actually is IOS and Android if I'm not mistaken it's Andrew and obviously

130
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,879
But frankly

131
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:19,231
It just doesn't track enough information and does not sync reliably for me I was thinking

132
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:24,351
Data over to Google Fit And it's like 4-5 days it would show nothing and then all of a sudden it would show like

133
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,375
Three days worth of stuff

134
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:30,239
It's just not reliable enough for me I mean I know other people use it

135
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:34,335
Google fits great if you don't even have a Tracker because your phone is your tracker

136
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:37,919
And in that case maybe it works well but I have dedicated trackers

137
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:41,759
Because I need more than what my phone gives me Android don't want to carry my phone everywhere

138
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:46,623
So you write how get it supposed to be that book of record Google Fit is supposed to be that book of records

139
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,415
Microsoft has their healthvault

140
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,695
The problem is

141
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:51,999
It's still very segmented peep

142
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,791
Still want to own the data

143
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:58,911
You know what it does not get any more personal than my personal Hell Date I should own the data

144
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:01,215
And be able to use anything I want and make it work

145
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:04,543
Because I have a broken toe for the last 4 weeks

146
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,079
Really disappointing

147
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:06,847
Bye

148
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,639
Jawbone software it is like

149
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:09,407
Stacy

150
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,479
Okay I'm like

151
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:13,503
I think I should be an injury

152
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,039
Itsfunneh

153
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:21,439
It's funny you say that because there is in your Under Armour app if you're going to have you can log a day as a rest day so you won't get mad

154
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:25,535
It's beautiful

155
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:28,351
You can you can you have

156
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,887
Now every time.

157
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:30,655
Consider that rest

158
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:37,311
We also I forgot to mention I also got a Fitbit Aria scale because my daughter has a Fitbit

159
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:42,175
And I just figured it was an easier thing to do is just at 1 skip

160
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:44,991
Then again it's getting the data from one map to the other

161
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:47,039
So we're on the Aria scale

162
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,063
Automat my

163
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,111
Yeah

164
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:51,903
Scale data

165
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:52,927
REI

166
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:57,535
It does so eat you will find things duesing but you got to

167
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,863
Don't assume everything will sink when somebody says it sent but you are correct

168
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,167
You can get your your weight data

169
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:06,495
Into other apps through MapMyFitness

170
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,263
Okay

171
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,799
I just hope this will be big for me

172
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,335
Cuz like I've never owned a scale

173
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,431
All right with that

174
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,199
So

175
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:15,967
New news

176
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,527
No actually read reviews first

177
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:19,551
Because

178
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:22,367
Sorry about this I mentioned this on a couple podcast ago

179
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,903
This is the first

180
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:26,207
Color rated outdoor

181
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,767
It's a par38 downlight

182
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:29,791
Yeah out there

183
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:33,631
Set a resistant all water resistant

184
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,167
And super water resistant

185
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:37,215
Because it's actually rained like 9 in

186
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:37,983
Since I put it up

187
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,775
And my uncovered roof

188
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,055
It is in a

189
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:43,615
So it's in a lighting fixture so the lighting pic

190
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:44,895
What it is

191
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,943
Because of the radios that are in it

192
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:51,295
It is a little bit more sensitive to moisture and dirt and stuff

193
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,575
So this is been up on my roof

194
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,855
For about

195
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,391
Two weeks now

196
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:58,463
This is the ilumi Outdoor rated color

197
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,743
BR30

198
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,279
It's $70

199
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,351
$60 is

200
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:07,167
Running rate for you-know-what connected light bulb

201
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,447
That's color

202
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,495
And it uses Bluetooth

203
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:11,775
Not to be

204
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,079
Bluetooth light bulb

205
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,103
And

206
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:17,151
It's been out there it's been like

207
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,967
Raining a lot it's super hot on my roof

208
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:23,039
Cuz I'm in Texas it's been like 95° outside

209
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:27,647
You know it hasn't made it through the 110 degree heat but you know

210
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:28,927
It's still pretty good

211
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,463
So

212
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:32,255
I really

213
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,791
Enjoy the illumise

214
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:34,559
They

215
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,839
Make a nice green

216
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:37,631
B Hughes don't actually do it

217
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,655
The green at all

218
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,703
And it has a fun feature

219
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:41,471
Where

220
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:47,871
You could do typical scene-setting in that sort of thing but they have a music setting which for my roof where we hold a lot of parties and stuff

221
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:49,919
Secret to

222
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:50,687
Spotify

223
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:51,967
Or Google Play

224
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:57,599
I hear your phone so what happens is and on your iOS device it will actually sync to download

225
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,391
That is

226
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,975
The music thing and what happens if you play this on your phone

227
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:04,255
And the lights

228
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:05,791
Go intermittent times

229
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:08,607
The downside is

230
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:09,631
If I

231
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:11,679
Because it doesn't work with Sonos switch

232
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:12,959
Speaker system I have on the

233
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:16,287
I would have to turn the volume down on my phone

234
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:18,335
Cuz it's not actually pulling for the volume

235
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,895
Are from the actual physical sound

236
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,943
Turn the volume

237
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,479
I can get the same kind of party

238
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,247
Experience

239
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,039
Fancy I

240
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:28,831
Sink a little

241
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:32,927
Like disco effect

242
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,231
And you're not really worried about the

243
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:36,767
You could do the same thing

244
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:41,887
Yeah since it's Bluetooth radio inside these there's you don't need a hub this works on the app

245
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,959
It does so here's where things get a little bit

246
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,615
Because it's on my roof which is really far away from the rest of my stuff

247
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:54,175
It's setup a Bluetooth mesh Network

248
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,455
But

249
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,735
Right now I don't have an

250
00:09:56,991 --> 00:10:02,879
I don't have any other ilumi lights anywhere in the house so I have to actually go in my second floor and kind of Stand Out On The Roof

251
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:06,719
Like a little bit on the terrorist I don't have to climb the pole stairs but

252
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:07,999
To turn it on

253
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:08,767
Gotcha

254
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:13,119
Limited limited range of Bluetooth and it would help if you had other devices other

255
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,423
Illumise cuz she said it would be mashed

256
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:18,239
So that is your downside

257
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:24,639
There's no way to make them work with any Hub but she might therefore Place little closer to them or no

258
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:26,687
I don't see that is not an option I

259
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:30,015
Now there are Bluetooth hubs out there

260
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,295
The

261
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,575
Mesh they're using

262
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,599
I should have checked this way

263
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,903
I will find out what mesh there

264
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,999
I don't know if it's the standard

265
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,279
Richard Smash Hit

266
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:44,351
Is tomorrow cuz I'm not sure if that's actually

267
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,399
Implemented yet is a

268
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,167
Tortoise and

269
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,215
I know that it's been talked about

270
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,495
I don't know that everyone

271
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,263
Got that out there

272
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:52,543
Right

273
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,103
Right now

274
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:59,455
I can't I can't control it from anywhere except for within woot

275
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,223
What is range

276
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:02,527
Of the light bulb itself

277
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:07,903
Your mileage may vary

278
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,951
Outside

279
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,999
I mean I think it's

280
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,023
The color is

281
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,327
Ed

282
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:18,143
Udo having having the ability to turn your outside

283
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,703
You know your porch light or whatever this color

284
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,727
Is just fine

285
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:24,287
What do your neighbors think of this

286
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,615
My neighbors know I'm

287
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:34,783
All right

288
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:39,903
Let's say we should talk about a bit about news of the week before

289
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,439
Skipping to

290
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:45,279
Another review this time for the rachio 2nd gen sprinkler

291
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,303
That my

292
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:47,839
My father-in-law is going to help us

293
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:50,655
And I don't

294
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:54,239
Oh I do I'm getting away from that lawn and

295
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,775
Right you're leaving here line

296
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,823
Leaving one acre behind

297
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,871
Let's talk about

298
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:00,895
You got something from Domino's

299
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:07,551
Yeah I thought this was kind of interesting I mean it's a little less irth but still smart devices

300
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:10,879
Domino's is actually testing

301
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:14,463
A on time cooking service for pick up customers

302
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:17,791
Basically they're going to use the GPS

303
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,327
To track where you are

304
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,119
On the way to pick up your pizza

305
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:27,519
And it really going to make the Peter start making it when you're close enough to the store so that way it is as fresh as pause

306
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,543
Possible literally

307
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:32,639
Custom made for you at a specific time based on your location so

308
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:36,991
If you're going to Domino's pick up a pizza and using the service you know don't make any side trips

309
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,015
You're going to

310
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,039
Hours of the pizza

311
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,063
Delivery

312
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:40,831
Because

313
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,111
They're going to make it in a computer

314
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:45,439
But I thought was kind of needles it's a start use of GPS

315
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:47,999
It is and other most people probably

316
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,279
Well maybe people order p

317
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:52,351
Pizza delivery on the way home I'm trying to think about the use case cuz

318
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,631
I usually order

319
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,655
Pizza when I'm already home

320
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:58,239
Driving from someplace to someplace then I just

321
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:03,359
Pick it up yes yes and actually use you still will pick it up but once you order it

322
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,383
Oh

323
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,735
They won't make it until you get close enough so that it's guaranteed so to speak fresh

324
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:15,391
They're trying to cut down there the time to actually making and they want pizza sitting around

325
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:17,695
They want them fresh for you when you get there

326
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:21,279
Don't know that because they'll see you so to speak on your way to pick it up

327
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:24,607
And oh no it takes us 7 1/2 minutes to make this pizza

328
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:27,423
Stacy is 7 1/2 minutes to get that thing in the oven

329
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:29,727
I guess it doesn't occur to me to actually

330
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,007
Stop and pick up a Domino's

331
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:32,287
Because

332
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,687
I cannot say that I we just we don't have one nearby it's like 10 miles away so

333
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:45,343
Yeah there's two people to do a common thing there's a coffee cup

334
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:47,903
Today in austin texas that call briggo

335
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,439
And they have a

336
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,999
Robot coffee maker on the UT campus that

337
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:55,839
When you it uses your GPS to know when to start making your coffee

338
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,399
Similar things

339
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:00,447
Other news

340
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,983
Last week I reported

341
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:02,751
That

342
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:06,847
Comcast and alarm.com are in talks to buy icontrol

343
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:10,175
What's going to happen is they're going to split I control into two bits

344
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,967
I am control

345
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:13,759
Flight control actually became

346
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,439
They control

347
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,743
That is the

348
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:26,303
News we should hear hopefully something on that in the neck

349
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:29,119
And it sounds like a deal that

350
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,167
Basically I control when they they

351
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,191
Put out some products

352
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,983
This is part of the kind of DIY effort

353
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:40,383
That seemed to confuse their customers cuz I controls customer base was companies like ATT and Comcast

354
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,407
Xfinity home

355
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,943
And I control

356
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,991
Would manage the backend software for

357
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,831
You started putting out products that were

358
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:52,159
They bought Piper which is an all-in-one security device

359
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:55,743
And then they introduced on the call Touchstone which was helping diyre setup

360
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:56,767
They're kind of home secure

361
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:57,535
Dirty stuff

362
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,559
And I probably

363
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:02,399
I'm imagining it best confuse their customers were like High

364
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:04,959
These products compete now with our product

365
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:05,727
What's happening

366
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,007
So

367
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:11,871
They've been kind of having some issues and some of their customers have not upgraded to

368
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,455
New contracts with them or added new devices with them

369
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,223
I'm so

370
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,759
Sounded like I control was having

371
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,599
I should note that

372
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:26,463
Because of recording schedules we are not going to be talking about what was announced it Apple's event

373
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,559
Cuz I type in a few hours from now

374
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:31,583
It's happening soon

375
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:34,399
We won't put this out for awhile in

376
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,935
Kevin is on the road

377
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:36,703
Because Kevin is

378
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:38,239
A man in demand

379
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:42,847
On the road all day and cross-country trips today in about an hour but

380
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,687
Before packing a lot I was paying attention to E3 which is the

381
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:53,087
Video game Electronics conference that's going on right now it's kinda like the CES of electronic video games

382
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:55,135
And I noticed

383
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:58,207
Late last night as I was watching the live stream

384
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:00,767
Tiaras getting a healthy nod

385
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:06,143
In the form of actual games on consoles with VR headsets

386
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,751
I think the HTC Vive will actually be supported by Bethesda software

387
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:12,799
And they are the makers of and

388
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,079
These are not kids games

389
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,103
I'm working it out

390
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,639
The makers of Doom

391
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:18,687
And Fallout 4

392
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:24,063
Both of which they were demonstrating in VR you can actually go where VR goggles and play the games

393
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:26,879
I thought you were out there in LA which I was not but

394
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:31,743
I just thought it was very interesting that the VR as we will

395
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:32,767
Boom right

396
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:36,607
From the center there it was at that III so it'll be interesting to watch

397
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:37,631
We'll keep an eye out

398
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,679
Alright well Kevin thanks so much

399
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,215
Let's see I think we will

400
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:46,079
Skip to our rachio review now and then stay tuned after that for our guest

401
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,615
Who is Ernesto Ramirez

402
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,895
Talking about public health

403
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:49,919
Data actually

404
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:53,247
Medical data and Public Health

405
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:59,647
As I mentioned before I'm bringing my father-in-law Gregg Allman on the show to talk about his

406
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:02,719
Experience with the rachio sprinkler

407
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,743
Where is I do not

408
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:13,215
So we saw this about 6 weeks ago and

409
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:15,263
The install process would you think

410
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,311
Steelers very simple Acts

411
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,151
Promise of the rachio is that it takes your old kind of dumb

412
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:24,735
Irrigation controls in Dad's kind of a wifi-connected

413
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,015
System that

414
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,807
Look at the weather forecast

415
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:32,671
We need to water we don't need to water it also takes into consideration, the type of

416
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:34,975
You can remotely control

417
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:36,255
Your Zone

418
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,047
What goes off at what time

419
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,327
So overall Greg

420
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,607
After living with this

421
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:41,887
What do you think

422
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:45,983
I think it is an excellent approach

423
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:49,055
Frankfort water

424
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,079
I

425
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,359
Think that

426
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:54,687
As good as the other measurements that are available

427
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:56,991
And in that regard about some issues

428
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:58,527
Nothing yet

429
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,551
Having mind

430
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:05,439
Home location not being too consistent with the weather station data that I'm

431
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:06,975
Ah-So

432
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:09,279
Your weather station how far away is

433
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:11,839
Does a mile and a half

434
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:14,143
All right and you told me that you had had

435
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,167
One day where it was

436
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,703
At your place in

437
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:18,495
0 according to Ranchos measure

438
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:19,519
Correct

439
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:23,615
Now you can connect sensors via if this then that

440
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:26,431
Put your own weather station in Leica netatmo woodwork

441
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:28,479
Or you could also add like

442
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:29,503
Moisture sensor

443
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:30,271
Jennifer soil

444
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:34,367
I think there's actually a connection for that but you don't have any of those things

445
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:35,903
Do you think it's safe

446
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:36,671
Yuan

447
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:39,487
Why would raisins

448
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:41,279
Certainly is contrasted

449
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:45,119
To just letting it

450
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:47,423
We're in one of those water areas where

451
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,495
The city says you can only water on these days so you have

452
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:51,775
Set that up

453
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:56,127
And then rocchio resident deciding which date

454
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,919
Side skip or not

455
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,455
Always a trainee.

456
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:01,247
So it's skip quite a bit

457
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:03,551
And therefore I've been saving money

458
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:08,415
I'm in my alternative in the past

459
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:12,767
That part is handled and if I'm away from home

460
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:15,071
It's only handled where I couldn't otherwise

461
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,863
Best Russo like

462
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,399
I think you were out of town for like a week

463
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,423
A couple weeks ago

464
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,215
We were out

465
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:21,983
It was raining

466
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:24,799
That's correct

467
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:26,079
But I did get messages

468
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:31,455
I was saying okay peace of mind and that way you got a little link to the weather back home

469
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:36,575
All right and what are the downsides like I know

470
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,343
Some trouble

471
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,111
Honda Wi-Fi

472
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,391
That is

473
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:41,695
Screw you do need a

474
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:43,743
Strong enough WiFi connection

475
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:45,791
30 weeks

476
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,887
Corner of the garage or waves

477
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:51,167
My router

478
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,447
We got it up

479
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,031
To turn onto it

480
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,567
Call three blues

481
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:01,663
But then I found out that I was getting messages but Russia was

482
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,199
Offline

483
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:05,247
And so I can put it that

484
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:07,807
Intermittently at least disconnect

485
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:08,575
Be quiet

486
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,879
So that's on the Wi-Fi

487
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:13,695
So I did Remedy by getting up

488
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:17,279
Stronger range extender in the new location in sunset time

489
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,559
It's been steady

490
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:19,583
All right

491
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,119
So the big question

492
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:27,263
The rachio 8 zone is $200 and the 16th

493
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:29,055
Is $250

494
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:31,871
When I take this away to send it back to rachio

495
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:32,895
Would you buy another one

496
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:35,199
What what you doing

497
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:45,439
Certainly has to also think through the other sensor situation because

498
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:49,023
In our local condition I think the make it

499
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:49,791
Really

500
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:51,071
A good performing

501
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,095
Item

502
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:54,399
I'd have to put in some sort of local sensor

503
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,703
But it's enough of a savior

504
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:57,983
In terms of not having

505
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,287
And having that

506
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:02,591
Remote access I guess for testing sprinkler heads

507
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:03,359
Isn't that kind of thing

508
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:10,015
All right well that's great now I know it's get your Father's Day so

509
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,831
And for the rest of you guys

510
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:14,111
You also

511
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:15,647
Because after this

512
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:22,304
We are going to be back with the Ernesto Ramirez talking about what to do with wearable data's and privacy and Public Health

513
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:30,240
Greater break into the podcast for a message from Wolf SSL here I've got Larry stefanik who is this

514
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,008
CEO

515
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:32,544
Larry who is

516
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,568
Wolf SSL

517
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:40,224
Stacy worthy experts on device security we've been working in the space for the last decade

518
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,064
We're now the most widely deployed security solution

519
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,160
For the iot with over a billion devices secured at this point

520
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:49,952
That is a lot

521
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:50,976
Devices

522
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,256
What goes into

523
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:53,792
Securing an iot device

524
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:57,120
So we think about three key things first of all

525
00:21:57,376 --> 00:22:00,448
The data in transit or the data between your device

526
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,240
And your cloud

527
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:05,568
So the the traditional are most popular way

528
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,640
To secure that data is through

529
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:12,224
The SSL protocol which is the protocol that is used

530
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,272
Unrest of the internet for securing

531
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:15,552
Data in transit

532
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:17,344
We also think a lot about

533
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,904
Securing data on the device itself

534
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,744
So encrypting data that you might have on your device that uses

535
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,024
Needs to be private

536
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:29,632
And it finally we help companies secure their firmware updates

537
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:36,032
It's one of the clever things that attackers like to do two devices is installed their firmware instead of year

538
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:39,104
So what you need to do is have a secure Channel

539
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,200
To your device the best way to do that the most common way to do that is through

540
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:43,968
SSL

541
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,784
And we do all of the above that's what we do

542
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:53,952
4Runner smart grid where in automotive Industrial Automation consumer devices

543
00:22:54,208 --> 00:23:00,352
In medical devices and we address this wide range of markets through a long list of Partnerships that we

544
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:03,936
We have with the silicone vendors in that the operating system vendors

545
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:05,216
Alright was everywhere

546
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:06,240
Where can we find

547
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:13,408
So just check us out and wolf ssl.com coyote

00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:19,808
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast

549
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:23,648
This is Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest is Ernesto Ramirez

550
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:26,976
Quiz a program director for the Quantified Self lab

551
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:29,024
He's also a PhD and Pub

552
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:30,304
Very recently

553
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,072
Congratulation

554
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:32,864
Thank you

555
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,888
And he's written about

556
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:35,936
Connected devices for The Last 5 Years

557
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:37,728
Zoe super-smart Ernesto

558
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:39,264
Thank you for coming on the show The

559
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:41,824
Picture of an excited to be here

560
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:44,128
Me too so I met Ernesto

561
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:46,688
Go to South by Southwest event

562
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:49,248
Was right after Apple introduced healthkit

563
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,808
And he was talking about what this

564
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:54,880
Gave to the medical community and how they might do something like

565
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:56,416
And I was just

566
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:57,184
Smitten

567
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,720
Smitten with his ideas

568
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,560
Let's talk about

569
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:03,840
Wearables

570
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,120
And Health Data

571
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:06,144
Big picture

572
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:08,192
What should I be thinking about

573
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,472
This space

574
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:10,496
What's the Big Apple

575
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,032
I think

576
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:12,800
They're almost

577
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:13,568
I wouldn't say there's

578
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:15,104
Limitless opportunities

579
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,688
What's available and what's possible with wearable but I think

580
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:19,456
We haven't

581
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:20,480
Quite scene

582
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,552
You know we see lots of things like

583
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:25,344
Step counters Eagle on your wrist

584
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,392
Hot reminders now that you can wear on your wrist

585
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:30,208
But I think the interesting thing that's going to happen

586
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:36,608
When these type of devices start talking to each other

587
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,704
And there's devices Note 8 screen start talking to other

588
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,496
Like the things in your home

589
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:43,776
Like your car

590
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:44,800
Like your medical record

591
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:48,896
Okay so like

592
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:51,456
CII know that I talked to somebody who

593
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:57,088
Kind of devices for monitoring people who are aging in place and they were talking about using

594
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,160
Censored on the bathroom door

595
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,696
Assess someone's

596
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:02,464
Health

597
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,256
Because apparently there's a correlation

598
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:07,328
Those are the kind of things that you're talking about

599
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,144
Exactly so

600
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,192
Yo I'm more connected future

601
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:14,240
What are the things that I

602
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:17,312
I think would be exciting this is something I'm still looking for someone

603
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:20,128
Hopefully one day I'll have enough money to buy it

604
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,920
If my bathroom scale

605
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:25,248
An my wearable device to understand all of my fitness

606
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,040
Can talk to my kitchen

607
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:29,088
That's what magic can really start to happen

608
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,440
So secrets in Seattle

609
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:34,464
Getting a lot of weight

610
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:36,768
I'm not very good at tracking my diet

611
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:41,376
What kitchen do what kind of food I had you can recommend the meals that I

612
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:42,144
Can make

613
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:42,912
2

614
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:48,800
No regionals and I'm ready to be physically active

615
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:52,896
Am I a technical standpoint I think will be really interesting to see in the future

616
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:54,688
My freezer would never let me at the ice

617
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:56,480
I know it

618
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,064
You haven't exercised

619
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:00,832
Enough

620
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:03,392
She want to lose those last 5 pounds

621
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:04,672
The answer is no

622
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:10,560
This is a great vision

623
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:12,864
Let's talk about the where we are today

624
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,424
It feels like I am inundated with

625
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:19,776
Studies showing that like my Fitbit isn't accurate was the most recent one

626
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:23,104
My Fitbit data into one of my doctors and they're like

627
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:26,176
Stacy I do not want to see that I don't care

628
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:32,064
So let's talk about how do we get this into the medical sphere or should we even

629
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,344
Get it into the medical sphere

630
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:35,136
That's a great question I think

631
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:40,000
Future

632
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:45,376
Which is a very very interesting question because it starts to get

633
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:46,400
Yelp

634
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:49,728
Try to ask yourself what

635
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:53,056
You know what is a Stafford what is the heart rate

636
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:54,592
And you have to really ask

637
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,384
What are these things

638
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,712
Could store and Bear

639
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:02,272
Even your bathroom

640
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,088
Stop medical device

641
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,624
Haven't gone through

642
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,440
That's rigorous FDA clearance process

643
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:11,744
Required of the things that we

644
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,280
We can't trim clinical

645
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:16,608
Actually I think

646
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:21,472
Fairly accurate the things that they say they do

647
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:22,752
And then

648
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:26,336
Once we decide whether or not they are accurate

649
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:28,640
Useful for what kind of day today

650
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:31,200
Getting them to talk to the medical record

651
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:35,296
It's a huge conversation and it's

652
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:36,832
So

653
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,368
Let's see how do we get them to

654
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,136
To talk to

655
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:43,744
A medical record cuz most of those are kind of proprietary they're locked up there

656
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:48,352
HIPAA compliance stairs

657
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:50,656
So what is this future world of

658
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:51,424
Look like

659
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:53,472
There's two pieces

660
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:56,544
What you just said that are super important

661
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:58,592
How do we get this data

662
00:27:58,848 --> 00:27:59,872
Into the system

663
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,688
Which is not a insurmountable

664
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,992
Although there are closed system

665
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:06,784
But you had your ethics in your cerner's

666
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:09,600
Electronic medical record providers

667
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,904
They are starting to be

668
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:17,280
More open to allowing data from other places

669
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:21,120
That's me, text

670
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:23,680
Is a

671
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:27,264
Not easy thing to do but it's not something that's going to be impossible

672
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:31,104
The social tees I think is even more interesting and

673
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,408
Probably orders of magnitude more important

674
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:37,504
Anti-social onion is how do we get the medical system

675
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,040
All the way down the line

676
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:41,344
All of those providers the position

677
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,368
The nurses

678
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:43,904
Assistant

679
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:49,024
To understand the type of information that people are using in the course of their everyday lives

680
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:52,608
How can I use that for actually impacting that character.

681
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:55,680
And so far we've actually seen this

682
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:58,240
Happen in a couple of instances there was the

683
00:28:58,496 --> 00:28:59,776
The famous case where

684
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:02,080
Some guy 42 year old man cave

685
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:04,640
Commando hospital after I believe it was a seizure

686
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:08,480
They used his Fitbit data so it feels like and I don't know if that's

687
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:10,016
Indicative of more to come

688
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:11,040
Is that

689
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:12,576
I don't know what do you think

690
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:22,304
Because I have something wrong with her heart rate

691
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,840
Know if we will chat

692
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,632
The wearable throughout their right

693
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:27,680
Now what are they measuring

694
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:29,728
What do people actually do anything

695
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:32,800
Health and wellness spaces

696
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:36,640
And then they're measuring what they eat

697
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:37,920
And those three things

698
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:39,712
Really add up to

699
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:43,040
I'm major in Canada to having a major impact on

700
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:44,064
Chronic disease

701
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,880
United States and worldwide

702
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:51,488
Edison could figure out a way to actually make that part of

703
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:56,608
You can have the conversation of hay

704
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:57,888
We noticed that

705
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:02,496
You know you haven't gone for a run or gone to the gym or you haven't got more than 5,000

706
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,312
Going on

707
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:06,848
How can you be helpful

708
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,432
Yes I actually have a friend that I share my fitness data with

709
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:11,200
And

710
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:13,248
A couple weeks ago I actually

711
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,272
Dislocated my

712
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:16,576
Sounds ridiculous but

713
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:18,112
I've been walking around in this boot

714
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:20,416
And I haven't been able to walk as much so

715
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:22,720
She actually sent me a text and she was like

716
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:27,328
Dude what is up with your barely making 4000 steps a day

717
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:32,704
You may not believe this but

718
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,752
Part of my dissertation research was

719
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:40,128
Talking to people about their experiences using

720
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:46,528
Talking to someone about their physical activity for what's going on your life

721
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,576
Is not actually that uncommon

722
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:49,856
We do it all the time

723
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:51,392
See that's so how do we

724
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:52,928
Take something like that

725
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:59,584
And make it I mean that that is kind of interesting if your doctor like even if it was an automated text

726
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,864
About something like that

727
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:01,888
To you I don't know how

728
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,936
How would you turn that into something

729
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:04,960
Good for health

730
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:07,520
There's a good example of people doing

731
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,056
Stuff like that

732
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,152
Nothing

733
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:13,920
PeopleNet

734
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:16,736
A company in San Francisco

735
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:18,784
What they did is they took

736
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:23,392
Clinically

737
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:25,952
Statistically significant

738
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:29,024
On obesity

739
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,560
And overall health

740
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:39,264
And they took that basically said let's just make this thing and now they're showing the same

741
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:42,592
We can make a difference

742
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:44,384
You can stay called yesterday

743
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:47,456
Base of a program that was developed a while ago

744
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:48,736
Without these

745
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:49,504
Schools

746
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,784
That being said

747
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,064
I don't think that that

748
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,600
It's going to be probably the case

749
00:31:54,112 --> 00:32:00,256
Overall I don't think magically everyone's going to

750
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:01,024
Because

751
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,304
Well what happened

752
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,840
If there's data

753
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:06,656
Inside your physical activity tracker

754
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:09,728
Sitting in your weight scale

755
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:16,128
And that shows that something might actually wrong with you that they nest know what are the

756
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:20,224
Cactus plants

757
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,528
That's something else I don't think any of us know yet

758
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,880
What my doctor didn't see my heart attack coming on my

759
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:28,416
Fitbit charge

760
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:31,232
Exactly this is the world we live in

761
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:34,560
Stop

762
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:38,400
That information

763
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:40,960
You know what's weird is that responsibility

764
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:42,240
That's worrisome

765
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:44,288
Let's switch a little too

766
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:46,592
Another use case for wearables

767
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:48,640
Cuz we talked about it mostly in the medical sense

768
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:49,408
Switch

769
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:51,456
Yeah but there's also an option

770
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:53,760
And players are keeping their employees

771
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:56,320
Fitbit sore jaw bones and

772
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:59,136
That opens up a can of worms on the Privacy side

773
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:00,928
I'd love to talk to you about

774
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:02,720
Kind of this the day that we're collecting

775
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:03,744
Privacy

776
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:05,536
What it means when

777
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:07,584
Your employer is asking you to wear what

778
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:10,912
Starting to give

779
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:12,448
Their employees devices

780
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:13,728
As part of these corporate Wellness

781
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:16,032
Plant or subsidized

782
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:19,104
Weight scalar or what-have-you

783
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:23,200
And then as part of Wellness Lee makes it up

784
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:24,992
Petition

785
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:28,320
North Central College

786
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:30,368
Corporate Wellness

787
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:31,648
And

788
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:33,952
It remains to be seen on way or what

789
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:35,488
What do we have a right to enter

790
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:37,280
Privacy around

791
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:41,120
Best Health Data Networks tracking you know it's not maybe as

792
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:43,936
Privacy Centric as blood testing results

793
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:45,472
But it's not

794
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:46,496
Nothing

795
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:50,080
You know it could be used against us for whatever reason

796
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:51,872
What might happen in the future

797
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,992
Sure I can see I think there was an article in the Wall Street Journal that talk to I think it was

798
00:33:57,248 --> 00:34:00,064
Shrp

799
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,624
They had this crazy anecdote

800
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,904
It was hypothetical

801
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:08,000
If you saw that one of your salespeople

802
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:11,584
Slept really well last night versus the other one who had

803
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,864
Like 2 hours of sleep

804
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:14,656
Seem to be lagging

805
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:18,496
You would choose the one that got more sleep to make the big pitch tomorrow

806
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:21,312
And I thought that was a really interesting

807
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:24,384
Example because you know there are plenty of people

808
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:27,968
Who is he of course she would give you know this person who's

809
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,504
More physically fit

810
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:35,904
To do something like that but that doesn't take into account all kinds of extraneous things like maybe they have a newborn at home and

811
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,952
Maybe they're still really awesome at pitching

812
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:39,744
Even when it had 2 hours of sleep

813
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:43,328
Cuz people tend to make correlations about things

814
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:44,864
Without actually

815
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,400
Having the root cause

816
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:48,960
I get what you're saying at the end of the day

817
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:51,264
Whatever you know you're wearing one of these things

818
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,056
You're using your phone to track your active

819
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:54,336
Heads up

820
00:34:54,848 --> 00:35:00,992
Zeros and ones in the database that's some kind of information

821
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:04,064
It doesn't really know who you are if you can't

822
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:05,600
Tell who I am

823
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:08,160
Employee and just because

824
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:09,440
I took

825
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:11,744
Steps one day and 10000 the next

826
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:13,024
I don't know

827
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:13,792
I might make some

828
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:19,936
There's a Reddit article and it was confirmed

829
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:23,008
Of Fitbit being able to anticipate somebody being pregnant

830
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,312
I'm just based on I think it was her heart rate

831
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:28,128
That was really interesting because

832
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,432
My employer's of all been very cool

833
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:33,760
About people getting pregnant but you know there's plenty out there who are not

834
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:36,576
And if someone could see something like that

835
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:42,720
Especially before the employee told them they could fire them right away and not run afoul of any sort of

836
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:44,768
Can people from fire

837
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:47,840
These are not

838
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:49,120
Crazy farfetch

839
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:50,656
Maybe

840
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:53,728
Definitely not and I think it does kind of

841
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:56,800
Who makes the case for us being careful

842
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:59,104
And how we use these devices

843
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,176
Where this data goes what decisions make about it

844
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:03,712
There was actually it is

845
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:06,016
Remind me there's a great example of

846
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:07,808
Tesco in the UK

847
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:12,416
I put device tracking devices on their users basically RFID tags

848
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:15,232
And how much

849
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:16,768
Where do we going in the warehouse

850
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:20,096
Expect too much time

851
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:21,120
In the restroom

852
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,960
That is the other

853
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:26,496
Utopia

854
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:32,896
So what do you recommend I mean like

855
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:34,944
Let's take it from a variety of different

856
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:35,968
Perspectives

857
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,040
From the perspective of a fitness tracking

858
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:41,344
How should they be thinking about these

859
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:42,368
Is a privacy

860
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:43,648
All of the things

861
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:44,928
What's your advice

862
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:46,208
I think

863
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:49,280
Whoever it is it's always think of the individual

864
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:50,560
Using the system

865
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:51,328
Yo

866
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,864
A person that that bought

867
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,400
Or is strapped on

868
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:55,936
That device on the wrist

869
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:57,728
For the person who

870
00:36:58,496 --> 00:36:59,008
And who's wearing it

871
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:01,312
That's true

872
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:04,896
Is it to get the end of the day it is always going to be the person that

873
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:06,944
Excuse

874
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,992
Where is haneda originating

875
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:10,016
And you don't

876
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:12,320
It whether or not your employer pot it for you

877
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:14,112
Or your grandma

878
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:15,392
If you're wearing it

879
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:18,464
You are the originator of that data and that at the end of the day

880
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:21,536
Needs to be

881
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:24,608
You to understand that they can trust

882
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:25,888
Whatever entity

883
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,240
Is making the right decision

884
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:31,008
So that

885
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:32,032
They are protective

886
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,824
In terms of their privacy

887
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,104
But also I think

888
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,152
You know I'm a big proponent of data access

889
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:39,200
It's actually quicker

890
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:41,760
Privacy is being able to actually have access

891
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:46,368
Should the information that you're creating and contributing to these huge data system

892
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:50,208
So I think as long as people are are taking those

893
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:53,024
Taking those ideas to Heart

894
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,072
I think you could look pretty good place

895
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:56,608
Okay and what about

896
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,168
Regulators so if I'm a lawmaker and I'm

897
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,960
Looking at these cases

898
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:05,056
What needs to change about how we manage the stuff

899
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:08,896
Should be done be looking at like what HR is doing

900
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:15,296
Like I said I'm a proponent for Access I think we should have some sort of legal structure that sets up

901
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:16,064
Are rice

902
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,600
To access the data

903
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:19,136
We are collecting

904
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:20,416
So

905
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:21,696
Lafayette Indiana weather.

906
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:24,768
You'll be able to go online and get a CSV download

907
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:25,536
Or

908
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:28,352
Being able to understand where that data is flowing

909
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:30,656
The way data flows right now is

910
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:33,984
Is just a weird tricky jumble of

911
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:34,752
Contract

912
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:36,800
Negotiations that we never see

913
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:38,848
I think having that open up

914
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,920
Especially with this deeply personal data

915
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:44,224
It needs to be taken care of at the legal level

916
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,528
Okay so what would your advice to

917
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:47,552
The businesses

918
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:48,832
Who are buying

919
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:49,856
Wearables

920
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:51,904
I think my number one piece of advice

921
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:52,928
Protect

922
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:54,720
And

923
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:55,488
I think

924
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:56,256
What is it

925
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:58,048
Things that people could do to protect our users

926
00:38:58,304 --> 00:39:00,352
Make sure people have access to their data

927
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:03,680
And like I said

928
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:05,472
Especially because

929
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,288
This is it still the Wild Wild West

930
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,080
In terms of like wearables

931
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:13,408
Devices in companies you know every day you hear about

932
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:18,784
1 feeling are going out of business because they feel they couldn't make enough money to keep the lights on

933
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:21,088
And then crazy things are happening

934
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:22,368
Either they just

935
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,904
Turn off the light

936
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:25,440
Shut down the servers

937
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,208
And that day.

938
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,232
Gone

939
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:30,048
And the people that use that device for

940
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:32,352
Six months or a year or a decade

941
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:34,144
Never going to be able to see it again

942
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:35,168
Or

943
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:38,240
That device in that data that IP the servers

944
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:40,288
It's sold to another third-party that

945
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,104
Keep device alive

946
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:46,176
They may contact those users again say Hey you can buy

947
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:47,968
Come get your dad out of this system

948
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:49,248
Who knows what

949
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:50,528
Actually

950
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:54,880
I don't know if you ever heard of the co that sleep tracking device

951
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,744
Remember this thing that you know you was crazy like a headband

952
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:02,304
You're really nice

953
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,584
Ariat

954
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,888
Really nice your sleep tracking system

955
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:09,216
And after two years I just couldn't make a go of it

956
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:11,264
Shut the lights off close down

957
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:15,872
But then all of that data and all of their IP was sold to another third-party

958
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:18,176
Call Musa

959
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:19,712
Hundreds of days

960
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,600
One day they had access the next day

961
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:27,136
Let someone else had all the

962
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:32,768
Clear data exactly and then someone else has all of their data and they don't know who that someone

963
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,864
Sometimes these companies don't do very good job of saying hey guess what

964
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:38,656
Shutter doors but

965
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:40,448
Yo company XYZ

966
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:43,520
She bought all of our stuff and they're going to do a really good job and they're going to

967
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:45,824
You know do all of these things for all of our past

968
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:51,456
No not the rule in this industry unfortunately

969
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:55,808
And then the people that actually signed

970
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:58,624
Disinformation and those devices note application

971
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:00,160
The left with nothing

972
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:02,208
You know a device it doesn't work

973
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:04,768
An application to stop tracking anything anymore

974
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:09,376
And nobility to make any sense out of that in your Richard formation that was a part of their life

975
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:11,680
Yes I would be really ticked off

976
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:13,984
If I lost all of my previous

977
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,264
Years of Fitness tracking

978
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:17,312
I've been wearing one since 2011

979
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:18,336
So yeah

980
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,128
Exactly

981
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:26,016
Just don't exist

982
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:27,552
That's why we hold them

983
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:28,320
To a higher standard

984
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:29,344
Okay

985
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:32,416
What is your advice to doctors

986
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:33,184
Or medical

987
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,232
Professionals who are looking at all of this

988
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:38,048
Listen to physics

989
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:40,096
No I think

990
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:41,888
Even though it may not be clinically

991
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:44,192
In terms of your practice

992
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:47,776
It doesn't mean it's not clinically meaningful for the life of an individual

993
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:50,336
I think understanding of what role

994
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:53,663
The devices in the data play in the life of the person

995
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:55,455
That's why I think we need to spend

996
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:56,479
What time is it

997
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:58,783
Acknowledging

998
00:41:59,039 --> 00:41:59,551
These things are important

999
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:02,367
And how they can actually help them

1000
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:04,159
Illbleed life they want to leave

1001
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:06,975
Will end on that very profound

1002
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:09,535

00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:16,191
