00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:11,776
Hey everyone welcome to the Internet of Things podcast

2
00:00:12,032 --> 00:00:15,104
This is your house Stacey Higginbotham

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,128
Kevin tofel

4
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:20,224
Are you today I think we say that every week but

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,320
3 week is totally true so we got some news about Lutron and Google home

6
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:28,160
We can have a really good discussion about the Amazon Echo and voice everywhere

7
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:31,232
Where to talk about iot developer trends

8
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:32,512
It's a survey that's just out

9
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,304
The eclipse Foundation

10
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,632
System installed on some Honeywell gear so we're going to talk about that

11
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:39,424
And there's some other news

12
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:43,008
Plus this week sponsors after work and get a little update there

13
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:47,360
And finally our guest this week is sean moss pultz of bitmark

14
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:49,152
It's company using

15
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:52,736
Blockchain for establishing digital property

16
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:57,600
Kind of a fun philosophical discussion we have so you'll want to stay tuned for all of that

17
00:00:58,112 --> 00:00:58,880
And now

18
00:00:59,136 --> 00:00:59,904
A quick word

19
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:06,304
From another of this week sponsor a great idea for an iot business Samsung

20
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,704
Arctic and easy interoperable and secure iot platform lets you focus on building your business

21
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:19,104
Rather than worrying about technology provides fully integrated Hardware cloud and services

22
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,688
Interoperability with other devices and service clouds and

23
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:29,088
System-wide security Samsung artik is how iot gets down to business for more information

24
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:34,208
Visit Arctic. IO that's a r t i k. IO

25
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:36,512
Okay Kevin

26
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:42,144
Last week you were sick so we're glad to have you back although I have to say Richard Gunther was super helpful

27
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,192
He's over at the home on podcast

28
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,216
So

29
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:46,496
I don't know

30
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:50,080
But I know that's great I'm glad you found a great

31
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:56,224
Co-host it which was sort of last minute so thank you Richard cuz I was really sick I'm still sick but at least I can

32
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:57,760
Jumping around these days

33
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,808
Yes

34
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,368
Are you guys he was willing to drive himself and

35
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,136
The break up.

36
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:03,904
Just to talk

37
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,720
Just in case I said I'd be here

38
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:11,072
What is Richard came through which I appreciate so that's awesome

39
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,096
It was awesome

40
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:17,472
Now I'm going to say that you did miss our big discussion which is I had a week with the Google home

41
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:19,008
In my own little

42
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:22,336
I did not go back and listen to show yet so

43
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:25,408
Give me the skinny if you can so quick

44
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:29,248
Take was it's not quite ready for a couple reasons

45
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:32,576
Biggest one for me was how the Google home

46
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:33,856
Divide

47
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:36,416
Rooms it asks you to do a room for every

48
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:38,720
Device doesn't have another set of

49
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,000
Relation

50
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,792
Something I like having

51
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,328
All of my lights for like

52
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,096
My living room

53
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,376
To be called the living room

54
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,168
And that is rightfully possible

55
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:47,936
With the Google home

56
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:51,008
But then in my Amazon Echo I have another set of categories

57
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:53,056
Gory switches downstairs

58
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,872
And in the Echo you can put

59
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,920
Devices in a double categories

60
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:58,944
In the home you cannot

61
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:08,672
Another limitation yet another reason Kevin does not have a Google home

62
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:13,280
This is something I just started playing with we hooked our Netflix account to it

63
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:19,680
And I'm actually seeing some really good stuff with the Chromecast stick in your Chromecast in with your Google home

64
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:22,496
TV is important to you

65
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:24,800
You can actually do a lot of things that are

66
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:27,360
Pretty compelling pigs for the Google Assistant

67
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,896
I don't know how much of it

68
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:31,200
The Netflix stuff does go over the Google home

69
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:33,504
Turn on

70
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:34,784
And watch

71
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,832
Try to take a show that's on

72
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:39,136
Stranger things

73
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:39,904
Sure

74
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,976
Watch stranger things it'll actually pull

75
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,256
All the way to

76
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,024
Stranger thing

77
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:46,560
Right

78
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,840
That was one of the

79
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:51,936
More compelling features on Google home was announced how you could use it to cast

80
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,472
Audio or video

81
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:56,544
Be a voice right so I suspect that

82
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,336
If a third party

83
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:00,384
Service or provider

84
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,760
Supports chromecasting it probably will work fine with Google home as long as long as you have a

85
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,552
25 $35 Chromecast

86
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:11,904
Hook up to a TV or speakers at the Chromecast audio so that's actually a

87
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,696
One of the biggest selling points

88
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:17,791
As opposed to an echo because for you to voice control your TV

89
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:20,607
You have your Echo working with that via the

90
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:23,679
Logitech write a Logitech home Harmony which

91
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:26,495
Second $90 Edition uses IR

92
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:27,775
If I'm not mistaken

93
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:31,359
I also have a controlling my Roku

94
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,895
So it actually brings him

95
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:35,455
So it's unlikely that Google

96
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:38,527
But

97
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:41,087
Yeah yeah I mean that

98
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,367
Yeah gif

99
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:44,159
If you do look at

100
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:46,463
The integrated services

101
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:50,303
With home it is very Google Centric obviously so that that is a good point

102
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,351
Disclosure time

103
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:56,191
Don't just close your time thank you see I'm still sick so I forget that

104
00:04:56,447 --> 00:05:00,287
I forget to tell people that I do work for Google as a consultant it's my full-time job

105
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:04,895
I don't work with them on the IRT type products in such a word with chrome in Android so

106
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,175
There we go

107
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,455
Let's be quick

108
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,807
Experience with one other thing that you can do that I thought was pretty cool

109
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,623
You can actually if you're using

110
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,647
Google photos

111
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,183
Like I am

112
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:19,999
Yep

113
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,071
My dog

114
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,119
On living room TV

115
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:27,679
And holy cow it shoots photos of your dog

116
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:28,703
And Olivia

117
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:29,727
Which is pretty

118
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:30,495
You're like

119
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,287
Computer yeah

120
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,847
That's actually one of those

121
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:37,151
Most impressive

122
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:43,551
Recent software apps that come out of Google in my opinion I even use it on my iPhone on my my SIM card currently in an iPhone

123
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:45,087
To be honest and

124
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:51,743
Google photos I use that too for the free storage because backs everything up into the cloud but the search capability

125
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,535
Image recognition I really

126
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,839
Impressive and then when you're tied into

127
00:05:56,095 --> 00:06:00,191
That search functionality to voice and casting that information to a screen

128
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,239
That's pretty cool I agree

129
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,007
It's magic

130
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,031
It's magic

131
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:09,663
What do you still say but you still real quick but you still say the home listens better than your Echo as well

132
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:13,247
Amazes me

133
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:15,807
You know something

134
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:22,719
No probably probably but no not in this nothing relevant to this

135
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:25,535
It just amazes me because I was always very impressed by the

136
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:28,351
The microphone array in the original Echo

137
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:29,631
And

138
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:35,519
I know Google home has an array I don't think it has seven microphones I don't recall the exact specs

139
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:38,335
And I'm just I'm just really surprised that

140
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:41,919
Pitbull listens well you're not the only person I've told me that so

141
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:44,991
And maybe it's got to do with the timber of my voice survey

142
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:49,087
Maybe Amazon listens better at certain frequencies

143
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,367
Google listens better at others

144
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:54,207
This is a Christian actually into some big news

145
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,231
Wichita

146
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,023
The Amazon

147
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,047
Folks

148
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,071
Have released

149
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,607
A madam

150
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:01,887
Hardware development

151
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,935
People which includes

152
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,471
The seven mic array

153
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:07,775
And basically if you want to build

154
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:11,103
Exactly an Amazon Echo

155
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:13,151
You can you can

156
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:16,479
Pop that Hardware into your particular device

157
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:20,063
And you can have the matinees voice services

158
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,343
And Wallah

159
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:22,623
There is

160
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,391
An echo

161
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,671
So that

162
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,207
Brings the question

163
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:31,839
How were people building Echo like devices before or were they doing it with

164
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:35,167
Fewer features like they couldn't have seven microphones there's an apple

165
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,447
They had one

166
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:37,727
2 microphone

167
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:38,495
Phone so Lake

168
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,519
The nucleus

169
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:43,615
They have

170
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:44,895
I think it's just one

171
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:45,919
1 FedEx

172
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:46,943
A secret

173
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:49,503
But they just put it in the Amazon voice services

174
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,807
What race really is is

175
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,087
A better listener

176
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,879
Device

177
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:57,695
It's also I look at this and I'm like

178
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,463
Yeah

179
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:03,071
Basically Amazon so I can't voice is going to be an essential UI of the future and we want people getting

180
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,351
Used to using

181
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,143
Our voice system

182
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,167
Sure

183
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,471
Just to add to what you had said about

184
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:10,751
How that can now make

185
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:16,895
Devices with the 7 Mike's it also supports beamforming noise reduction Echo cancellation so

186
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,175
Something like a nucleus

187
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,455
Probably don't need that

188
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,479
But

189
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:23,295
Home assistant type devices which

190
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:25,343
Seem to be cropping up every week now

191
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,879
That I could see why

192
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:29,951
Harbor makers would want you know the full feature set

193
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:32,255
No I'm

194
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,023
Curious bee

195
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,303
Because I don't know if this has it

196
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,095
Amazon has

197
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:39,167
I feel like after Google announced

198
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:41,215
Because Google has something that basically

199
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:45,823
Pics when you are in a room and you talked to something at picks the closest available

200
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,615
Assistant device that can

201
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:48,383
Panda lyrics

202
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:52,479
Quest so Amazon has something called ESP in that stands for

203
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,759
Echo spatial

204
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:54,527
Perception

205
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,319
That's basically

206
00:08:56,831 --> 00:09:00,159
So if you have a multiple Echo devices are. Surround

207
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:00,927
Your house

208
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:02,719
The closest one

209
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,023
Bright and

210
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:07,071
I don't know I assume that the

211
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:10,911
If it's a software update but I assume that your Hardware

212
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:17,311
Implementation would have this in the reason we bring this up is because holy cow we're putting Madame egg

213
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,079
And everything

214
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,103
Right

215
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:21,151
Just real quick I don't think

216
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:25,759
I don't know if Google has something similar like if you had multiple homes and the only reason I say that

217
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:28,063
I don't have a home so I can't say for sure

218
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:30,111
I keep hearing from multiple people

219
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:35,999
When I say the Wake word for Google home then my phone which is also set for the same wake word

220
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:39,071
Is firing up in responding and then I have

221
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:42,655
Seen that with multiple Android phones that I have so

222
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:45,727
I'm not sure if there's a similar Solution on the Google sign

223
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:46,751
You don't

224
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:48,543
I talked about having something

225
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:51,359
But I have had that problem I actually talked to her

226
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,919
Weeks ago cuz I was trying to

227
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:55,455
Get something started and I

228
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:57,247
I had to leave my phone elsewhere to get it

229
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,271
But

230
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:02,111
Pretty sure they talked about having a way to do that other than and I should say

231
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:04,159
You can always use

232
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,695
Okay g

233
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:07,743
For one device and Haji

234
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:08,511
Pretty

235
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,559
True

236
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:16,959
Well that's a thing and then I don't want to do that because I don't want to have to remember it sounds stupid but

237
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:18,751
Eventually you know when you have like

238
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:21,823
Today I have four five things listening all the time

239
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:25,407
I would imagine I have double that number in a year

240
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:29,247
I don't want to remember their names I can barely remember the names of my two kids so

241
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,271
I don't want to

242
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,807
Popular wake words for everything

243
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:34,111
Yeah well that actually so

244
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:36,671
What are the news items that were talking about this week

245
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,951
Because our buddy

246
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:40,255
Steve's at work

247
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:42,815
Who despite having a

248
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:44,351
A young child is still

249
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,375
Breaking stories

250
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:49,215
He found that the next version of ecobee 4

251
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,751
It's going to have

252
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:57,151
Metal May hanging out in there he actually found this information out prior we weren't sure about

253
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:00,735
Vehicle before I think it was another FTC filing

254
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:03,551
I'm sorry FCC find my phone

255
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:04,831
Camping difference there

256
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:05,599
But now

257
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:08,671
He's actually got a picture of the a blue light

258
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:11,231
Bar on the top of ecobee4 Witchwood

259
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:12,511
Simulate the blue

260
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:14,815
Light ring of an echo for example

261
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:20,447
We already saw the potential for speaker on the back of it I would say obviously there's a speaker on the back of it now

262
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,471
So

263
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,519
It's interesting I don't know we don't

264
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:25,567
Knowing anything about pricing or than cuz

265
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:28,127
Ecobee has an announcement so it's just this is just

266
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,663
Foundry ICC testing

267
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:32,479
You know what that's going to add in terms of cost

268
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:34,271
Do people who already have

269
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:35,551
Echo devices

270
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,319
Are they going to

271
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:40,415
Buy this and have another microphone and speaker that they need any

272
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:42,975
So it feels

273
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:43,999
Additive

274
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,047
Person

275
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,071
Who's like

276
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:49,631
Oh maybe I want to get the smart home to try

277
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,679
I'd love to save money on my air conditioning

278
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,751
And this Adele also has

279
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,031
Diego

280
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,055
And it's so

281
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:59,359
Maybe in depending on the price point

282
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,127
You know

283
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:03,455
Havasu mean it's more than 250 which is the

284
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:06,527
Kind of Baseline for the high-end

285
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:12,415
If you don't have either of these devices maybe this looks good if you have one of these devices

286
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:14,207
I don't see it because

287
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:18,559
You can already control these devices through what you already have right

288
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:24,191
And it's not like you're going to buy this is your first Echo device and play music on all day because of speakers not

289
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,215
Going to be loud

290
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:28,031
But if you are getting into the smart

291
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,823
This might be a tree

292
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,383
Interesting way to do it cuz you could just buy

293
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:34,943
A smart thermostat + a light bulb

294
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:37,247
You know you've got

295
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,783
We talked about

296
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:41,087
Buying someone a. Plus a little

297
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,623
Switch module and how

298
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,183
So now you can buy them

299
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,207
Two connected

300
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:48,255
Devices the thermostat and the connect

301
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:49,791
Are the connected

302
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:50,559
Switch module

303
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,607
You know why I can see

304
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,887
Especially if you don't

305
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:54,911
Want

306
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,959
Speaker in your house

307
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:58,751
Like

308
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:00,799
45 Blackstone

309
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,711
I'm pretty keen on that personally but okay

310
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:13,599
Oh thank you so I can see that but

311
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:16,671
If there's other plans

312
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:18,975
GE has that weird glowing light

313
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:22,047
You know I can see pudding

314
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:25,119
The Temptation and the goal is clearly to put the echo

315
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:25,887
So in everything

316
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,679
Where to put Madam and

317
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,263
What do I really want to talk to

318
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,055
Do I want to talk to

319
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:36,383
Every single individual device or do I want to talk to like a butler

320
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,175
Lakeside Grill

321
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,455
Exactly

322
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:41,247
That's the key right there and I

323
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,527
And that's why I think

324
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:44,319
And I can put it very well be wrong

325
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,855
I think this'll

326
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,903
Probably not be as big as sellers

327
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:48,671
Oaks my

328
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,439
Extinct

329
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:53,023
Because if you already have the cylinders around your house

330
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:56,607
You're not going to buy this version of an ecobee4

331
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:57,887
I don't think

332
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:58,911
I agree with you

333
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:02,751
And so the big question is is this is the echo

334
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,031
Orem anime

335
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:08,383
Compelling feature that pushes someone over the edge into a smart home

336
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,919
I think it's probably however

337
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,479
Yeah

338
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,783
Let me put it to you this way you have multiple homes

339
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,831
That goes I keep doing that

340
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,695
Is not home

341
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:25,279
You have multiple echos as do I

342
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:28,351
Throughout the house every week pretty much outfit at our homes

343
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,631
With echoes

344
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,423
So would you

345
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:34,239
If you need a thermostat would you buy they go before with

346
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,311
Voice and speaker

347
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,591
I'm guessing not

348
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:40,639
Hohhot

349
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,735
3x speaking of ecobee

350
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,551
They just did a deal where they

351
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:52,159
Now that you could be late which sells for about $170

352
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:54,207
It works now with external sensor

353
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:57,279
So the reason that the light was late is because I didn't have this

354
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,071
Sensors

355
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:02,911
But now for 80 bucks you can buy a sensor Pack 4

356
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:03,935
Toby in that kitchen

357
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:06,495
Koala

358
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:07,775
You now have

359
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,311
It's not lighted

360
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:14,943
So just in case you guys are looking out there for the

361
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:15,967
Smart thermostat work

362
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,783
Maybe go that way and

363
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,063
Keep your

364
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,087
I go I don't know

365
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,367
Okay

366
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:25,695
So that's that's a little little bit of each of the news there

367
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,743
Let's talk about

368
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:31,583
Should we talk about developer trans or should we keep going on thermostat

369
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:35,679
Let's keep going on thermostat sticking up thermostats

370
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:36,959
Why not temperature

371
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:38,239
Control is so exciting

372
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:44,127
Anna and I have a temperature control story from my weekend so

373
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,175
I like it

374
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:49,759
OKC were planning to hear you're watching the sausage get made right here

375
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:56,159
Yo I installed two weeks ago a Honeywell T5 thermostat

376
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:58,975
Breaking the great thermostat band

377
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:01,791
Of I think it was like 2813

378
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,351
No more no more

379
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:07,423
Big deal

380
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,191
So

381
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:09,727
I had some thoughts about

382
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:12,287
And I installed the T5i also

383
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,567
Got a version

384
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:14,335
Of the lyrics

385
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,871
Which is there voice control

386
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:16,639
Round

387
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:18,687
Thermostat what was interesting here

388
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,223
Is

389
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,271
Honeywell makes a universal

390
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:26,367
Plate that you install with your wiring against the wall

391
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:28,415
So you can actually pop any Honeywell

392
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,183
Well thermostat

393
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:30,719
Just write on

394
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:34,815
Which is really cool cuz as long as you're the Honeywell ecosystem

395
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:37,887
So

396
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:38,911
My call is

397
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:39,679
By God

398
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,703
Let's get a stand for

399
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,471
Call thermostat

400
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:43,775
We might be off

401
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,079
It would be very nice if

402
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:48,127
Because you know when I left my home

403
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,479
When I sold it last year and I had the The Nest down there I took the nest off

404
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:57,855
And like well because I painted around the plate and now they're going to have different colored different size plates

405
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:01,951
Are there thermostat I just I just left the nest I made such a hassle

406
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:05,535
I would be so mad if I showed up at the house and they taking the

407
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,559
Thermostat

408
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,095
Billiard

409
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:12,191
I suppose you're not supposed to listen to this technically wired to the house

410
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:14,239
Thermostat

411
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:17,055
This is a big debate

412
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,359
Oh no it's not making bag

413
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:22,431
I'd like that now I will say

414
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:24,735
That I've installed an ecobee

415
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:26,015
I've installed

416
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:26,783
The

417
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:27,551
Nest

418
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:31,391
The Honeywell was the least forgiving in terms of having Room 2

419
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,671
Pop my wires in

420
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:36,511
So I was doing some serious jam and some wires back into the wall

421
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,791
And some fairy

422
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:40,095
Delicate folding to try to just

423
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:42,143
Get that on there

424
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:43,423
But

425
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,215
The experience with the thermostat

426
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:46,751
Was good

427
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:48,543
I did call support

428
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:52,127
I'm at one point in their support was just bang on

429
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:52,895
Awesome

430
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,223
Good

431
00:17:56,735 --> 00:18:01,087
Am I tip for anybody who's installing a thermostat because it's been awhile since I had done it

432
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:06,207
Is how the information about your existing HVAC system available to you

433
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:10,559
I feel like in the instructions for all of these devices they should actually put

434
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:11,839
A little questionnaire like

435
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,119
You have a heat pump

436
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:17,727
Debra, Dwyer yeah that forces you to go through this

437
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:18,751
Because

438
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:22,079
Every thermostats going to ask you these questions and if you have it if

439
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,359
If you answer wrong

440
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:24,895
You're probably going to

441
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:26,175
End up like spewing

442
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,199
Hot air when you want

443
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:28,991
And another tip

444
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:31,807
When you take your old thermostat off

445
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:33,855
Before you remove the wiring

446
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:37,183
Take a photo of how it is connected via the wires

447
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:43,071
Adidas for two reasons one it makes it easy to transition the wires to the new thermostat so you can measure everything up

448
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:47,679
It sometimes the colored wires are not the correct colors and someone other than that label correctly

449
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:49,215
What to if you

450
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:52,543
For some reason can get your new thermostat working to get up hook up the alarm again

451
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:54,335
Is there any easy to redo it

452
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:55,359
Yes

453
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:58,175
And actually in the Honeywell install

454
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:59,455
They actually give you

455
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:00,991
I took my picture

456
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:03,551
But they actually give you a checklist where you

457
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:05,343
You're supposed to match your wires like

458
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:07,647
Before you do anything exactly

459
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,183
Where does your yellow wire

460
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,231
It goes to the White

461
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:15,839
You know you're coming about standardized

462
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,375
Plate System

463
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:19,935
Ashley resonates with me because

464
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:25,055
As I mentioned selling the old house it was a hassle with an S do I keep it to another what do I do with it

465
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,615
Imagine how many people

466
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:29,663
Don't buy these things

467
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,247
Or don't invest in Smart Home Products in general because they're

468
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,015
They may be

469
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:36,063
Continue moving in next couple of years

470
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:41,183
Well if you have a standardized Plate System you can make the investment and not worry

471
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:45,023
In a sense that the other the new people can be kind of screwed or whatever

472
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:49,119
Exactly

473
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:53,983
Really want it once a month

474
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:57,823
Said that bad but it's cool

475
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:00,383
Thermostat probably every two years but like

476
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:02,943
Every five years may make sense for

477
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:07,039
People in this is a really good thing that this would be great for the industry I don't

478
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:08,319
Bakery

479
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:11,135
This is this is a way to

480
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:12,415
To resolve

481
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,183
Boats

482
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:15,743
Industry if you're listening this is a good idea

483
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:16,511
Take it

484
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:17,535
Okay

485
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:20,095
Let's see the other Honeywell device that I had

486
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,631
So I did the T5

487
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,399
And

488
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:27,263
I did the water sensor we talked about this is an $80 Wi-Fi power

489
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,543
Water and leaked it

490
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,079
That has

491
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:31,359
Both the sensor

492
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:33,151
Module things

493
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:33,919
Square

494
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:36,223
It also comes with this for footlong

495
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:42,111
That you can wrap around a pipe or just extend along so it gives you more surface area to detect

496
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,135
Weeks cell

497
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:44,159
Apple

498
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:45,951
It is I love this sensor

499
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:48,511
So I got that I installed that

500
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:50,303
And you can daisy chain actually

501
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,071
Four of the

502
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:52,095
The cords together

503
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,631
Sulekha July 6th

504
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,191
That's a lot

505
00:20:57,471 --> 00:21:01,567
So there's two things to know about this one is because it's Wi-Fi and battery powered

506
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:03,871
You have to actually spend

507
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:07,967
It only checks in once a day to see if it's a check like temperature and other

508
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:11,039
You can set it for more often but then your battery is going to

509
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,319
Diminished

510
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,087
Broccoli

511
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:13,855
But

512
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:15,391
When it gets wet

513
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,720
Only way to shut it off is basically reset the device

514
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:19,744
Batteries out

515
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:23,328
As a as a tester this sucked

516
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:26,912
Because I was like how much water does it take not a lot

517
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:27,936
That's great

518
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:30,240
I got to be added to my

519
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:32,800
But

520
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:36,384
It does make sense because presumably this is not a device it's actually gonna

521
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,456
What it does go off you're probably like

522
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,224
Oh crap

523
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,248
My house is leaking

524
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,272
You know

525
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:45,344
You'll take it you'll shut that off and then you'll deal with your leak and then

526
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:50,208
That's true I wish I hope that in the future they caught up

527
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:52,256
I would like a beauty

528
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,048
They say they have

529
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,632
Okay

530
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:58,656
So

531
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:03,008
So this all ties into where I visited this weekend which I did not plan to visit

532
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,544
But I'm glad I did

533
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,128
Because this place could really use some of the stuff we talked about on the show

534
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,224
I went I went out in Arizona for the weekend we were visiting colleges

535
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:16,320
And on a win we drove two hours from Phoenix to Tucson

536
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:18,112
And then the answer to Tucson

537
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,648
In Oracle Junction

538
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:20,672
At work like

539
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,976
Is the biosphere

540
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:24,256
To which

541
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:26,816
For younger people you may not

542
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:28,864
Remember this but I do remember

543
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:34,496
People living in the biosphere for two full years like 1991 to 1993

544
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:37,568
Which at that time was it completely closed

545
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,104
Ecosystem

546
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:45,248
Yeah yeah

547
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,296
It was noted there was no Netflix

548
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,064
No

549
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,856
No it would life was tough kids

550
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:56,256
This is an amazing place I highly recommend you visit if this is your thing it's just

551
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:59,072
Interesting science experiment and they still run

552
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:01,376
Lots of science experiments to determine

553
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:04,960
The impact of CO2 on climate and so on and what not because

554
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:08,288
It is literally it can be a completely closed

555
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,568
System

556
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:13,920
Meaning no outside air or water or anything get in

557
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:15,968
And none of the stuff is inside gets out

558
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:16,736
Right

559
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:17,504
So

560
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:20,832
What was interesting and relevant to the show however

561
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:22,112
Was

562
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:28,768
I got a tour and we got to go underneath the biosphere which is multiple I mean a couple hundred acres this place you know

563
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:30,816
Glass domes and whatnot

564
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:31,584
Because there is

565
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,912
A rainforest room there's a desert room then there's there's a

566
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:38,496
Literally you think you're in a desert or the rainforest could they be simulated

567
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:39,264
And they paid

568
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,800
They actually built it that way

569
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:46,176
But to do that they have to control all of the air the water

570
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:47,968
Everything else is air pressure

571
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,088
And it's all done by computer controls through a control an energy center that's

572
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,416
Obviously to attach via wires but it's a separate building

573
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:58,208
And a single person

574
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:00,512
Because it's all computerized can actually

575
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:03,072
Monitor and change things so

576
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:05,376
They could use they have some

577
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:11,008
I'll call Early industrial iot stuff because up there a lot of computer control valves and such to do all this

578
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:15,104
I can easily see the meeting water sensors and maybe they have them and just didn't show them

579
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:15,872
Because

580
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:19,456
All the water inside the biosphere is already there

581
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:20,480
It literally

582
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:27,136
They put water into their ocean room and evaporates and then they condense the air and they recapture the the water

583
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:29,184
And the recirculated and solids

584
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,464
Auburn

585
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,536
750000 gallon tanks of water in this place

586
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:37,376
I got two prisoners water leak sensors in there but again I did not see any

587
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:39,168
In any case

588
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,240
It's just it was really amazing to see what I would

589
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:45,312
Consider early industrial iot on such a scale

590
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:48,896
For an interesting project like that so

591
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:50,432
Just something that

592
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:53,248
Kind of tied in with the show I thought I mentioned

593
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,784
That's like old school

594
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:56,064
Yes it is

595
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:56,832
Yes it is

596
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,880
Today would be less custom

597
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:00,672
Cheaper I don't know

598
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:04,512
Snooze beds

599
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:05,792
Logitech pop

600
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:06,816
They make a

601
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:07,584
Button

602
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,376
It is literally a fun button

603
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:11,936
Or $60 they now make a

604
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:12,704
Homekit

605
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,472
Button

606
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:16,800
August

607
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:19,104
The original Legend

608
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:19,872
Might be

609
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:26,784
And you can do three commands on this thing and I think there's a 1-tap a to tapping a person hold

610
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:30,112
Press and hold

611
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:34,720
All right

612
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:35,488
Messi

613
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:36,512
August locks

614
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:41,376
Has done a deal with HomeAway which is one of those vacation rental places

615
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:43,168
And now you can

616
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:44,448
Basically if you stick a

617
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:46,240
August lock on your door you can

618
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:50,080
Do an integration it's kind of like the integration they've done with Airbnb

619
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:56,480
So when someone signs up and they're running an app they can get into the house using the August lock

620
00:25:56,736 --> 00:26:02,880
Handy funny that you say that because while I was away this weekend in Arizona I had my front door painted here my townhouse

621
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:06,208
And I didn't know I was getting it painted needed a second coat

622
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:08,512
And I didn't realize that I was coming back this weekend so

623
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:11,072
Literally as I'm having breakfast in Arizona

624
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:12,608
He sent me an email says

625
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:16,960
Hey I'll be over 20 minutes to paint front door and give it a second coat in like no I'm not there

626
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:22,080
Sure enough I was like just text me when you get there cuz I want to give my code

627
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:24,128
Cuz I have a keypad code as well

628
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:27,968
And I'm like I'm just going to go into my Wink app and

629
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:31,040
Slide little slider and unlock the door when he gets there he was awesome

630
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,904
He knew about that already

631
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:36,928
Cuz I told him

632
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:40,000
When was painting the first time I gave to the lock locks on you

633
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,280
Your painting don't freak out

634
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:48,448
If anything was behind the nest cam going as well so I could see that he got in and didn't do anything nefarious to the house

635
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,240
And why not

636
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:52,800
It was a nice application biote

637
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:55,104
Yuriko IRT guys

638
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:55,872
All right

639
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:56,896
We should let see

640
00:26:57,152 --> 00:27:00,224
Let's talk about the iot developer Trends survey

641
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,272
Cuz that

642
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,552
That's

643
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:06,112
I thought so they do this

644
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,136
Every year

645
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,416
Well they did last year

646
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:14,560
2015-16 and 17

647
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:21,216
So the big thing that I thought was probably most interesting for our listeners is that Amazon is the top

648
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:23,776
Cloud is the top iot Cloud platform

649
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:25,824
MRSA when you're hosting your iot stuff

650
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,616
You're hosting an AWS

651
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:31,200
Let's see 42.7% of the time

652
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:33,760
I'm actually not surprised by that

653
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,040
I'll tell you why

654
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:37,344
And it's actually has to do with what I do at work

655
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,136
Because I work with the Google Cloud team

656
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:41,184
And I'm often looking at

657
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,536
Who is cloud is being used the most for what purposes and it is

658
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:50,144
AWS without a doubt is bleeder in just about every area that I have researched so far

659
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,960
Microsoft is a strong second with Google being third

660
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:54,496
Microsoft is big in the

661
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:56,544
Yes

662
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,080
So that's that

663
00:27:58,592 --> 00:27:59,616
They also had

664
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:01,920
IBM bluemix was still hanging out in there

665
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:04,736
GE predix is way down the list

666
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:05,760
So

667
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:09,856
The other thing that I thought was really interesting is they looked at

668
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:11,648
Connectivity protocols

669
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:12,672
And

670
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:13,696
Thread

671
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:15,232
Is seem like

672
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:16,256
Nothing

673
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:22,656
Tiny tiny tiny adoption at 6.4%

674
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:26,496
It was just this year I feel like that it really came out with their actual

675
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:30,080
It's definitely does not have first-mover status

676
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:32,896
The biggest protocol is TCP IP

677
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,176
Which

678
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:36,480
Makes total sense followed by Wi-Fi

679
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:39,808
Cellular is actually

680
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:40,832
The next most common

681
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:41,856
And

682
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:43,904
Way down there is like

683
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:48,000
Zigbee which makes sense cuz there's a lot of light bulbs running zigbee out there

684
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:48,768
And then

685
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,560
We get into like cereal

686
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:53,120
Lora sigfox and all that

687
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:56,192
Those aren't those are way down

688
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:58,496
It will include a link to the actual

689
00:28:58,752 --> 00:28:59,776
Report in the show notes

690
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:02,592
And then security is the top concern

691
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:06,944
Still good if it wasn't as high as I would have thought though

692
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,272
Not about security

693
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:14,880
But it is in the follow that's followed by interoperability

694
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:16,672
So we're still not there at

695
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:17,440
Fertility

696
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:22,304
We do have lots of middleware options were going to see some more stuff coming actually there

697
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:29,728
In the security technology cuz I asked about the top security related technologies that were being used for iot

698
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:33,312
One was basically TLS and dtls is the

699
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:35,360
The top option which makes sense

700
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,384
Skip test

701
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,920
Everybody I know is like yes

702
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:38,944
Start there

703
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,736
In data encryption followed that

704
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:42,272
In a pretty closely

705
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:44,320
What I did think was

706
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:48,160
We're talking about is Hardware oriented Security Solutions were less

707
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:49,440
Popular

708
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:52,768
Yeah that's surprising to me too

709
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:53,536
Now

710
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,584
Homekit uses Ace Hardware

711
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,632
Oriented security solution yes

712
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:58,400
It does

713
00:29:58,912 --> 00:29:59,424
And

714
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,496
Now I will say so I talked to the head of

715
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:07,360
Now he's got a crazy title but he's at nxp and he's head of he basically works on security platform

716
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:11,456
He said that they have like they have secure element

717
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,480
It is one of their that's there

718
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:14,528
Where based security

719
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:19,136
You said they put that on there if people buy it and they think they're using it

720
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:23,488
But in a lot of cases the way they're writing their firmware or their OS

721
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:25,536
It doesn't take advantage of

722
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:30,912
Because the software developers working on somebody's project don't know how to tie it back to the heart

723
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:35,264
Okay so I can see to things here one is what you mentioned in that

724
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:40,128
There is some level of effort required to integrate your software to work with a secure Hardware

725
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:44,992
And to I would imagine any Hardware security solution would also add cost

726
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:49,856
I wonder if these are part of the reasons why this adoption other usage is lower

727
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:56,256
So cost is coming down I actually so it's about $0.50 to a dollar so I talked to another chip

728
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:59,328
Person I talk to someone at silicon Labs who's working on the iot

729
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,400
And he said it's 2017 he anticipates

730
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:03,936
The cost to come down

731
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:04,960
Quite significant

732
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:06,240
Because security

733
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:07,264
Such a concern

734
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,824
So I think that's going to go away but I do think

735
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,384
The knowledge required to connect these two

736
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:13,664
It's going to

737
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:14,688
I have to work on

738
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,016
It sounded like like when

739
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:20,320
You say he would talk to the CEOs of these

740
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:22,112
Company

741
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:23,648
We got a hardware element

742
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:24,672
And they think they're

743
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:25,440
Can you sing it

744
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:27,232
Imagineers think they're you

745
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:29,024
But they're not actually

746
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,072
That's that's actually pretty scary

747
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:33,888
It is

748
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:34,912
He's a call we work with him

749
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:37,984
But so

750
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,264
Yeah take that is

751
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:40,800
Scary

752
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:42,592
Which is why I actually Microsoft

753
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:47,968
Comedies like electric imp are looking at a platform approach that actually tie those things together

754
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:49,248
Which

755
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:50,784
I wouldn't that actually

756
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:54,624
Yeah cuz security

757
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:56,672
Yeah

758
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:58,464
Feel like we

759
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:00,512
I talked about a lot of things this show

760
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:01,792
And

761
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:06,400
Feel like we should probably get to our sponsor message and our guests for this week

762
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:07,936
Which is

763
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:08,960
The CEO of

764
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:09,984
Bitmark

765
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:13,312
We are going to talk about creating digital property rights

766
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:15,360
And how we have perhaps

767
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:17,664
Done everything with the internet

768
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,432
Wrong

769
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,200
In the past

770
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:21,248
So yeah I know

771
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:28,160
So stay tuned for that because it's actually really fun and interesting conversation hey everyone this

772
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:34,560
Stacy breaking into the Internet of Things podcast

773
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:37,376
And I have Linden Tibbets here

774
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:39,168
Taylor Swift

775
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:41,216
Lyft allow

776
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:41,984
Anyone

777
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:45,312
To get their services and devices to work together

778
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:47,616
We want to be the standard

779
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:48,896
Or data access

780
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:52,480
Can I use it all the time so thank you

781
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:56,320
When did you're in a unique position to see so many iot devices

782
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:58,368
Are there any Trends you can share with

783
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:00,928
Absolutely what's really fast music

784
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:03,744
If we seen from talking about hardware and devices

785
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,816
The talking about services in API every device

786
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:07,584
To the service

787
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:10,144
Whether it's your phone your car your watcher

788
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,216
Thermostat refrigerator from our perspective

789
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:15,264
That Hardware that physical device is just

790
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,288
The starting point

791
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:17,568
First service

792
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:19,104
Experience that you can have

793
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,384
With your cuss

794
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:22,176
Whatever the internet touches

795
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:23,712
It tracks in it empowers

796
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:25,504
I'm changing all of our stuff

797
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:26,784
Every noun

798
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,064
Into a verb

799
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,904
Software is truly eating the world and see the World in a really good way

800
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,184
Experiences are getting

801
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,208
Much much better

802
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:34,976
Overtime

803
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:36,768
For all of these new services

804
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:38,304
Where should they be trying to reach

805
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:41,632
What's your bet on the next interface

806
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:42,400
Sza voice

807
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:47,520
Two voices going to elderly be a huge deal if it's already

808
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:49,568
We're still just kind of in this almost like this

809
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:52,896
Free iPhone remote for voice imagine in 10 years

810
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:54,688
It's going to be one of the primary ways

811
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:55,456
Which we interact

812
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:57,504
With the internet in our services

813
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,040
But what's so fascinating

814
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:01,344
Is that interfaces are really additive

815
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,928
She didn't kill the radio and in fact we're on a podcast right now

816
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:09,792
Free free right there every new interface is really a new way in addition

817
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:16,192
Call the current ways that we interact with the internet and we have this huge wave of potential new interface

818
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:21,312
Is coming down the pipeline voices one of us but there is everything related to arbr

819
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:22,592
We talked about chatbots

820
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,640
Your TVs are becoming more

821
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,992
What services and in devices

822
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:30,528
Think about

823
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:31,552
How do they have

824
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:32,320
Presents

825
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:33,088
How

826
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:33,856
Does Derek

827
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:37,696
Experience extend across kind of this never-ending March

828
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:38,720
Interfaces

829
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:42,048
How do I set themselves up for successful experiences

830
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:42,816
Given that

831
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:44,864
New interfaces apartments.com

832
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:48,448
So then what's your advice for iot companies trying to stand out

833
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:55,360
Try and see this future of more more devices more interfaces more data as a huge opportunity

834
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:57,408
From the get-go develop an integration

835
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,736
Unless you're the very first serve it that your customers invested in

836
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:02,784
It's very likely that your customers are going to have a

837
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:08,672
Big question as they're making a purchasing decision or whether or not your product is going to work with all the stuff they already have

838
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:09,440
Still working

839
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:10,208
Incredibly

840
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:12,256
Proud of our partner platform

841
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:16,352
Has over 400 services on it now we got hundreds more coming soon

842
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:17,632
Helps our partners

843
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:18,400
Integrate

844
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:21,472
Incredibly quickly with each other and that coolest features

845
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:22,752
For their end users

846
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:25,056
The sounds great where can I go to find out more

847
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:26,848
Anyone with an API

848
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:29,408
Any iot service any service at all

849
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:31,712
If you got an API you can become an ex-partner

850
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:35,552
We encourage you to visit if.com iot

851
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:36,320
If

852
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:37,344
TTT

853
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,416
Dot-com iot

854
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:52,960
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest is

855
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:53,728
Xiaomi

856
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:54,496
Moss

857
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:57,568
Hopes who is the CEO of a startup called

858
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:58,592
Fitmark

859
00:35:58,848 --> 00:35:59,872
Hey Sean how are you

860
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,688
Chris Stacey thank you so much for having me on the show

861
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,528
Man I'm super excited and I didn't know if I would because

862
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,576
You reached out to me and you're like

863
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,368
What is kind of cool

864
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:11,904
Cool idea about property

865
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:14,208
And digital ownership and I was like

866
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:14,976
Hello

867
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:16,768
Let's not keep people in suspense

868
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:18,816
Let's talk about kind of

869
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:20,352
Your thoughts about

870
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:21,376
How we're treating

871
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:22,144
Property

872
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,424
In a digital era

873
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,496
So on today's internet and this involves also Internet of Things

874
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:29,568
It's individuals that are creating all the value

875
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:32,896
But we're giving away almost all of these assets for free

876
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:35,968
The two companies that then take these and use them for

877
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:37,504
Quote-unquote Big Data

878
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,528
Which is really

879
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:41,088
Selling the analytics to other companies for profit

880
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:46,464
Okay and you're talking about my content like the things I'm creating on Facebook or

881
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,744
Maybe it's my

882
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,024
Camera data that

883
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:50,048
Submitting

884
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,072
Two-ness

885
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:54,144
Yea or it's your playlist to make on Spotify

886
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,168
Like if you just look

887
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,192
Kind of

888
00:36:56,448 --> 00:37:00,288
Completely analytically at any one of the evaluations of these big companies

889
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:03,616
And you say what does it cost to license all of the world's music

890
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:09,504
And what is the valuation of say Spotify for example and there's a massive gap between the two

891
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:15,136
And then you go to a school where is that value coming from that justify such a high valuation

892
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:16,160
End

893
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:17,696
We believe that it's because

894
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:21,024
The accounting so the value that's being created by individuals

895
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,048
Is off the books

896
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:23,328
Yet

897
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:26,656
In the eyes of a adventure capitalist it's absolutely on the

898
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:31,776
Okay so your thought is as a user of all these services

899
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:35,104
My data is worth something and we should figure out how to act

900
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:39,200
Account for it yes so our vision if you will the perspective is that

901
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:41,504
Data is the next major asset class

902
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,272
And

903
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:46,368
Until individuals can assert ownership rights over their data

904
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:53,024
That on the power that can come out of that asset class in terms of freedom in terms of wealth in terms of privacy

905
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:53,792
Realized

906
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:56,864
Okay so how do you propose we do that

907
00:37:57,376 --> 00:38:03,520
So this requires like a really brief history lesson right until property is this kind of strange abstract things

908
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:04,800
Michael's back hundreds of years

909
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:06,080
Property came out of

910
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:07,616
Land ownership

911
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:10,432
And something known as the enclosure movement

912
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:11,968
Square Farmers

913
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:13,248
Literally he said

914
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:14,272
I'm going to start

915
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:15,808
Boxing in my land

916
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:20,416
Before this happens only kings and queens in churches could own land and so there was this

917
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:24,256
Not very smooth in a very radical process.

918
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:28,096
Came to a conclusion in 1801 when Parliament created

919
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:30,400
The notion of individual private property

920
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:34,752
A very similar thing happened with knowledge with ideas with patents and trademarks

921
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:35,776
End

922
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:36,544
After

923
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,104
The democratization if you will

924
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:42,944
The ownership of land as an asset or knowledge as an asset

925
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:47,552
The moment individuals could own that it was a very short period of time before

926
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:49,856
The Agricultural Revolution happened

927
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:51,648
The Industrial Revolution happen

928
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:54,208
And so it's this theme if you will of

929
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:57,280
Democratizing who can own what an out of that

930
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:58,048
Comes

931
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:59,328
A massive growth

932
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:00,096
In Market

933
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:02,144
And so we look at

934
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:03,424
The 3rd

935
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,472
I'm stuck if you will is

936
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:07,264
Data as an asset class

937
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,568
And if individuals could own that

938
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:10,592
Then

939
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:11,872
You could have

940
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:17,504
I don't actually know what this name is called sometimes we call it information revolution but people think that's what I've already happened

941
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:23,904
But there's going to be something that will happen once individuals can assert ownership over their data and it becomes an asset

942
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,440
Class that generates wealth for them

943
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:29,792
This idea that is transferring this concept of old-school title Spacek

944
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:30,816
2

945
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:31,840
My data

946
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:32,864
Yeah that's right

947
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:34,144
I feel like

948
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,984
We shouldn't be talking about property rights at all we should be talking about

949
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:40,800
Ownership of data which

950
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:42,336
You're saying should be treated like

951
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,896
But it's really not

952
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:45,920
About property

953
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:47,200
It's really just about owning

954
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:53,600
Let me come back to it this way right so if this this relationship between titling assets

955
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:57,696
Ownership property property rights are all intertwined and

956
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:58,464
I think the

957
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:00,768
Simplest way to think about this is that

958
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:01,536
You need

959
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:05,120
A record of who owns white and from that record

960
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:06,144
You have

961
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,472
Titles that are being stored in a property as a title plus an acid

962
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:11,520
And now you want to say okay what what are the rights to

963
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:14,080
Talk about water rights are rights whatever you want

964
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:16,384
At the end of the day what we're talking about is

965
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:22,784
The ability for an individual to assert ownership over something such that they could then transfer the ownership of that in a way

966
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:23,552
Play it safe

967
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:25,856
Respect their privacy

968
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:26,880
That they can

969
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:28,416
Capture some of the values

970
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,976
The things that they create or they generate

971
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:32,000
Solo printing

972
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:35,072
Renting my data you can run your data you can lease your data

973
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:39,168
You can donate your data actually I think that donating side is particularly

974
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:39,936
Strong

975
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:43,264
All right we're going to get into that but first because you keep mentioning

976
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,032
The distributed

977
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:47,104
We should probably talk about how you do this

978
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:47,872
Everybody

979
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:48,896
Who's listening

980
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:51,200
Yes we are about to talk about

981
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:53,248
All right

982
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,784
Yasso

983
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,088
Without digging into the weeds too deeply

984
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:58,368
A blockchain is

985
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:01,696
A really new technology that allows two individuals

986
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:05,536
To exchange something of value without going through a central intermediary

987
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:08,352
And why that's important for property system

988
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:10,656
If we think about how

989
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:11,424
Humans

990
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,984
Behave in terms of exchanging property

991
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,264
I can sell you my car

992
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:19,360
That's a really a peer-to-peer transaction it's a decentralized transaction now

993
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:22,688
You could argue you have to take the title go to the DMV they update it

994
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:23,456
Fine

995
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:27,040
But I'm Toyota is not going to complain if I sell you my car

996
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:30,368
They have no right to complain if I sell you the car whereas

997
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:35,744
In the digital environment if I try to sell you the software that runs on my phone Apple could say no

998
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,304
Adobe could say no there's all of these people that

999
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:41,632
Have structured the digital environment to wear

1000
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:43,168
The transfer of things

1001
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:45,472
Do not look like property they look like

1002
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:48,032
License agreements in renting which

1003
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:49,568
From the perspective of

1004
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:52,895
Somebody that purchases something is radically different than owning something

1005
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:59,039
Ideal you're saying here is we should have some mechanism of ownership cuz right now we don't actually have

1006
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:00,575
Even wait a license

1007
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:08,767
Stacy in some ways we are granting license all day long to our data so when you use Facebook when you used to

1008
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:10,559
Twitter when you use these different services

1009
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:15,423
Within the terms of service is some Clause that resemble something like you are granting

1010
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:21,567
That platform and non-exclusive royalty-free irrevocable license to use your data to

1011
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:24,383
Create derivative Works your data to sell your data

1012
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:28,479
Big knock against creating individual datamark

1013
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:29,247
Places

1014
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:30,271
Has been

1015
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:32,575
Individually my data is

1016
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:35,647
It is only an aggregate that it becomes

1017
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:36,671
Worth something too

1018
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:40,767
Yeah so how does what you guys are doing

1019
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:42,815
Supply chain

1020
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:45,119
Give my individual data is some sense of

1021
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:46,143
Value to

1022
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:51,263
I'm revisit this from like a historical perspective

1023
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:54,847
On land also had no value before

1024
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:57,919
There were titling of land and individuals could

1025
00:42:58,431 --> 00:43:00,479
Could assert their property rights to land

1026
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:02,783
So it's like the Indians trading Manhattan

1027
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:07,647
Yes

1028
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:10,463
Yeah

1029
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:12,255
I don't know if you want to yes

1030
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:14,559
Strike we are giving up our

1031
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:15,327
Freedom

1032
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:16,607
Without knowing it

1033
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:20,959
Cuz we have bought into this argument that our data is not valuable

1034
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:23,007
But our perspective is that

1035
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:24,287
That's totally wrong

1036
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:27,359
Your data is super valuable and the reason it's not

1037
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:31,711
Economically valuable right now is because there's no way to assign property rights to it

1038
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:32,479
Okay

1039
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:37,087
What is this look like in practice and I think you mentioned that donations

1040
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:40,159
Yeah probably the place that this was going to start

1041
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:41,439
So can I

1042
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:42,719
Walk me through an example of

1043
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:44,767
Best example of this

1044
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:46,559
A public health researcher

1045
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:48,863
That would like access to

1046
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:52,959
Tell me if your photos and your location data and what's interesting is that

1047
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:56,031
You can run algorithms on photos now to

1048
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:56,799
Figure out what the

1049
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:58,847
Pollution levels are in certain places

1050
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:00,127
The number of

1051
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:04,479
Really interesting applications that you could do for public health benefits if you could

1052
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:05,503
Crowdsource

1053
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:06,527
If you will

1054
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:09,599
I'm photos with locations with individuals consent

1055
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:13,695
Can use that data and Anonymous way for

1056
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:16,255
Tracking pollution or air quality levels a lot better

1057
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:17,535
So how would that work

1058
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:19,583
A researcher would broadcast

1059
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:20,607
A study

1060
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:22,143
You as an individual

1061
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:22,911
Wood

1062
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:24,703
Opt-in using your phone

1063
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:31,103
And you would be able to donate your data and so technically what we're doing there's a company in Silicon Valley who are partnering

1064
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:33,407
If Tom if this then that

1065
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:34,943
And they provide ways

1066
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:35,967
Is of automating

1067
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:40,063
Date of rule so like if you upload a photo to Instagram when you can

1068
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:41,855
Save that photo in Dropbox

1069
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:48,255
And so we have something going on with them where you could say if you have a new location Point than bitmark that or if you haven't

1070
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:49,023
New photo

1071
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:53,119
Then didn't want that or if you have new sleep data or Fitness data

1072
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:54,911
Then bitmark that end

1073
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:56,447
Now there's an index

1074
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:57,983
Pics of who has what

1075
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:00,543
Indexes the blockchain as a database

1076
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:03,615
And researchers now would be able to

1077
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:04,383
Have

1078
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:06,943
Structured information of who has what data

1079
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:09,503
And individuals could donate that data

1080
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:15,391
And do so in a way that the consent is automated the privacy of the individual is respect

1081
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:17,183
No

1082
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:20,255
Go with us because I have connected if

1083
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:21,023
All kinds of

1084
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:22,559
Looks like Michael Pitt

1085
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:24,607
And I already signed

1086
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:26,143
So I can't not retroactive

1087
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:26,911
What do you like

1088
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:32,543
Or can I see this is this is where things get like who this is fun in theory but when it meets

1089
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:33,311
The road what happen

1090
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:35,103
Yeso

1091
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:39,711
You wouldn't be retroactively going back and getting all your data off that site again

1092
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:41,503
What you would be doing is that

1093
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:43,807
If can extract the data from Fitbit

1094
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:45,087
Write on your behalf

1095
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:47,135
And that is entirely legal

1096
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:51,487
What you're granting again in the terms of service is a non-exclusive

1097
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,023
Royalty-free license

1098
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:54,047
Stew what you're creating

1099
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:55,327
What your generating

1100
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:57,631
You're not actually transferring ownership

1101
00:45:58,143 --> 00:45:59,679
Of all the abilities

1102
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:00,447
Create

1103
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:01,983
Additional licenses

1104
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:03,007
Haha

1105
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:05,055
Tesla in their contracts

1106
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:07,615
With buyers of cars with autopilot

1107
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:10,175
They say you can't use their cars

1108
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:11,711
Or that service

1109
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:12,991
For your own kind of

1110
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:13,759
Rideshare

1111
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,063
Cramps which is very smart

1112
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:19,903
We're looking ahead and saying hey we want to do this ourselves

1113
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:22,207
That feels kind of like something

1114
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:23,231
It is

1115
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:26,047
Moving is more towards this subscription model

1116
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:29,119
Unless towards an ownership model so I wonder if we're like

1117
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:30,399
Too late

1118
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:31,935
Kind of pull this back a little

1119
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:38,847
The good thing is right now all of this stuff looks like the Wild Wild West and that's why companies can

1120
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:39,615
Claim

1121
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:40,895
Statements like that

1122
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:41,919
High-end

1123
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:43,199
So it's so early

1124
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:49,599
The way that we live in the digital environment for so many people is still so unclear what are those rights

1125
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:50,623
What's what's going on there

1126
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:54,719
How does the Constitution how does the rule of law protect me when I'm in

1127
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:56,511
Environments where

1128
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:58,047
The data the assets

1129
00:46:58,303 --> 00:46:59,327
Global

1130
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:00,863
So these are all

1131
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:03,167
Really early really unanswered questions

1132
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:05,983
And so we just kind of try to look back at

1133
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:06,751
Historical

1134
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:08,031
Perspective end

1135
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:10,335
Yes there were plenty of times where

1136
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:12,639
Companies kings queens churches whatever

1137
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:13,663
Unclaimed

1138
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:18,015
Ownership over a comment claimed ownership over a lot of different

1139
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:19,807
Things that arguably

1140
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:22,623
Should be owned by citizens in all should be owned by the

1141
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:24,671
Nobody individuals were creating them

1142
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:25,951
End

1143
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:27,743
Time and time again the courts

1144
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:29,023
Side with individuals

1145
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:31,839
I feel like Sean that I should be a lawyer

1146
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:34,399
And we should have a conversation based on like

1147
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:37,215
Entries of case law that I could say

1148
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:41,823
For most of history in Outlook a book printing that resembles

1149
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:43,103
Copyright copying

1150
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:48,735
Throughout most of History the average person never ever ever hit up against copyright law and this is

1151
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:50,783
Predominately because none of us are book

1152
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:55,647
In the internet the way that technology works this is Internet Internet of Things

1153
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:56,415
Same thing

1154
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:58,975
Our devices are constantly making coffee

1155
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:02,047
Copies in the cloud copies into local memory

1156
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:06,655
And each of these copies interacts if you will with copyright law

1157
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:07,423
And so

1158
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:12,287
Whereas nobody ever hit up against copyright law and now all day long were brought up against it

1159
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:13,055
All over the

1160
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:14,079
End

1161
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:15,615
Our perspective is that

1162
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:18,687
Copyright law never should have been applied

1163
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:19,455
2

1164
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:21,503
Things like data things like

1165
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:26,879
That the binary outputs of programs of musics of movies these sorts of media

1166
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:28,927
Once you apply copyright

1167
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:29,695
Right to it

1168
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:35,071
The ownership of that goes away it gets Stripped Away so the freedoms of an individual in terms of

1169
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:37,631
Things like for sale your ability to sell something

1170
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:41,471
Your ability to share it with somebody your ability to use it to create new works

1171
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:43,263
All of these get removed

1172
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:45,055
When something looks like renting

1173
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:46,335
As opposed to ownership

1174
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:49,151
So this

1175
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:51,199
This is a big philosophical thing

1176
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:52,479
It kind of scares

1177
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:57,343
Bejesus out of me so my big concern with iot is everything is becoming a subscription

1178
00:48:58,111 --> 00:48:59,135
We don't own this

1179
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:02,463
Yes what are the repercussions of this and so what you're saying

1180
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:03,999
Right here is

1181
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:06,047
When is we won't be able to

1182
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:08,095
Generator wealth we won't be able to

1183
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:10,911
Accumulate stuff over time pass it on etcetera

1184
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:13,471
Yep and we can go really

1185
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:16,543
Kind of far in this direction but there is

1186
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:17,823
What is the number of books

1187
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:20,383
6 famous book that says that

1188
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:22,687
Making money with property

1189
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:25,503
Generate a lot more money than making money with labor

1190
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:29,343
If you don't have the ability to assert ownership over something

1191
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:30,879
Then you are a renter

1192
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:33,183
And with renting you are right

1193
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:35,487
To create wealth are just

1194
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:38,047
How much is create wealth but your

1195
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:39,071
Privacy rights

1196
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:40,351
Are also

1197
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:41,631
Incredibly Limited

1198
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:43,935
You don't have a right to privacy in public

1199
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:45,215
In public places

1200
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:46,751
This is what you do have a right to private

1201
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:47,519
Mercy in your home

1202
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:48,543
Because you own your own

1203
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:49,823
Because it's your private property

1204
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:51,871
But you don't necessarily have a right to

1205
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:52,895
Privacy on your Facebook

1206
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:54,687
Which is you

1207
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:56,479
Yep

1208
00:49:56,735 --> 00:49:57,247
End

1209
00:49:57,503 --> 00:49:58,271
We think that

1210
00:49:58,527 --> 00:50:00,319
As these two environments look

1211
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:03,135
It's not fair to say anymore somebody is online or offline

1212
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:04,415
We're always

1213
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:09,279
And the digital environment is intersecting completely with the physical environment

1214
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:15,679
And it's just no longer possible to separate these too and to look at okay in the physical world we have these

1215
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:16,959
Liberties we have these freedoms

1216
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:18,239
In the digital world

1217
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:19,263
Everything is different

1218
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:20,287
It's just not right

1219
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:21,311
So this is an

1220
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:22,847
Awesome intellectual argument

1221
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:26,431
But because you are starting a company I have to ask you

1222
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:28,479
How are you guys planning to make money

1223
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:30,527
The way we'll make money is

1224
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:32,319
By giving you

1225
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:33,855
Simple ways hopefully

1226
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:36,415
To monetize your digital assets

1227
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:37,439
Demonetized

1228
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:39,231
And then you take a cut

1229
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:40,255
That's right

1230
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:41,023
Or I pay for

1231
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:45,375
That's right so we would take a commission when you sell your data

1232
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:46,911
So it's like

1233
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:47,679
A real estate

1234
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:50,495
Yeah or Merrill Lynch

1235
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:51,263
Stock broker

1236
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:55,359
You know you're going to sell some assets that you own we're going to help you find a buyer

1237
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:57,151
We're going to make that transaction

1238
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:58,431
Painless for you

1239
00:50:58,687 --> 00:50:59,711
And I like it

1240
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:01,503
And we're going to take a small piece

1241
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:03,039
So to see how far this

1242
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:05,599
This analogy extends let's talk about liquidity

1243
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:06,879
Because any good Market has

1244
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:08,671
Liquidity and right now

1245
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:10,207
You got zero the

1246
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:12,767
You have no market and

1247
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:14,559
How do you make Market swell

1248
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:15,583
Marketsource

1249
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:17,631
First made through

1250
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:20,447
What are known as like over the counter transaction

1251
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:21,471
So you

1252
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:24,543
Transfer ownership of something to

1253
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:25,311
Another party

1254
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:28,639
And over time you'll see

1255
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:31,199
Exchanges you'll see marketplaces

1256
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:32,223
But

1257
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:34,015
Until the property rights

1258
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:35,551
To the offsets

1259
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:38,111
The property rights to the data is clear

1260
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:40,671
And people can assert ownership over that end

1261
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:42,719
Courts can look at that and they can say yes

1262
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:44,511
Stacey homes.org

1263
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:45,791
Shawna

1264
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:47,839
Unless that's clear

1265
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:49,887
You can't have these sort of

1266
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:50,911
Economic models

1267
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:53,727
Alright so what you feel to the titling system

1268
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:57,823
To test this kind of titling system for my personal data

1269
00:51:59,103 --> 00:52:03,455
Need both Embark it or I need something to go awry so there's a court case about

1270
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:07,039
And nothing that you've described to me makes me feel like there's

1271
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:09,599
An opportunity for a court case because I'm

1272
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:15,743
I'm granting these non-exclusive rights and I'm talking to companies that are going to pay me buddy I'm just donating it to

1273
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:21,631
Court case would come about if you wanted to revoke some of those

1274
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:23,935
Rights that you've granted to the parties

1275
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:25,215
And so that's not what we're at

1276
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:26,239
Where after

1277
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:29,567
Giving you new ways of using your data to create wealth

1278
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:31,615
These new areas are things like

1279
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:35,199
You can donate your sleep data you can sell your location data

1280
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:36,479
You can

1281
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:37,503
Pass your

1282
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:42,111
Photos down to your children in a digital estate so these are things that

1283
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:44,671
Right now are incredibly difficult

1284
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:46,463
To do if you can do them at all

1285
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:48,767
Okay so walk me through this

1286
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:50,815
Let's talk about what I can create

1287
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:56,191
To pass down to my children as part of a digital estate email is probably a really good exam

1288
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:57,727
Or maybe a Facebook

1289
00:52:57,983 --> 00:52:58,495
Wallpaper

1290
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:05,407
Yeah you know all of these ones are really good examples because they're behind terms of service or something no one dies

1291
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:10,527
Fiduciary duty where if you die or if you become incapacitated then

1292
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:12,319
The court can appoint a lawyer

1293
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:13,855
The process is known as probate

1294
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:15,391
And the lawyer can

1295
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:19,999
Get access to your assets they can call if your bank if it's Bank of America they can say hey

1296
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:24,607
I'm Stacy is dead whole system work

1297
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:25,631
The banks

1298
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:27,935
Stockbrokers they all know how to deal with

1299
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:31,007
The ownership can be transferred passed between Generations

1300
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:33,055
About the tech companies

1301
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:37,151
Tech likes to say that yeah we're way ahead of law has to catch up

1302
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:39,455
But in this ownership perspective

1303
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:40,735
I think that

1304
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:43,039
The tech companies are totally wrong

1305
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:43,807
They're waiting

1306
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:49,951
Find very elegant Solutions of how you protect wealth how you transfer wealth how you move assets between

1307
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:51,487
Individuals

1308
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:54,815
That have been set up for hundreds of years that are very simple very elegant and

1309
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:57,119
That's what needs to be brought into the digital Empire

1310
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:59,679
Okay well I love what you're doing Shawn

1311
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:02,239

1318
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:16,831
