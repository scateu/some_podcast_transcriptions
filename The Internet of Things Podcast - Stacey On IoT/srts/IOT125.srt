Is VP of iot at silicon labs

22
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:52,992
And he's going to talk about

23
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:56,064
The hard problems that we need to solve

24
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,856
For The Internet of Things tours

25
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:02,208
We're also going to have a message from our sponsor haikou solution

26
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,256
And now let's go to another message

27
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:11,680
This week's sponsor is Eero earobics a Wi-Fi router that uses

28
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:16,800
Mesh WiFi entire house in to make it really easy to set up

29
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:22,176
Wi-Fi in areas that may be hard to reach so we're talking about the new

30
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:28,576
2nd generation mesh wi-fi system the Euro introduced earlier this year

31
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:34,976
Eero the taxes that have main router and then one to two beacons these are mesh access points

32
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:41,376
That plug right into the wall they have a night light they're super cool and all of this can be

33
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:47,776
Be yours for 399 for that one arrow in the two beacons you can also if you have existing

34
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:54,176
Heroes you can actually buy additional begins if you just want to extend your system

35
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,200
Night Beach

36
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:59,040
In the far up north area

37
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:05,440
The Canada if this sounds good to you Cody Eero e e r o

38
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:10,048
. calm and you can get free shipping if you include the code

Stacy

40
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:14,144
A before we get back to our show

41
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:19,520
Actually wanted to tell you the story because I have one of my Eero beacons upstairs on my roof deck

42
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:20,544
The power like

43
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,360
My Sonos system up there and some lights

44
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:25,664
And I got an email the other day from

45
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,224
Hero they were just like by the way we noticed that your

46
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,040
Roof Eero Beacon is having some erratic

47
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,320
Performance issues

48
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,088
And

49
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:35,392
We just wanted to get some information about it so we can

50
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,416
Find out what's going on

51
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:37,696
So

52
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:38,720
Isotope

53
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:39,488
Back to thing

54
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,792
Hey it's outside on my roof

55
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:45,120
Inside a metal cabinet so that probably explains why it's not working

56
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:45,888
They were like

57
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:47,680
Yes

58
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:52,544
Could you listen don't place your router's a faraday cage

59
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,568
Exactly

60
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:54,592
Also

61
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:57,920
Apparently these are only good at temperatures below 95

62
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:58,944
Switch is not

63
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,480
Summertime so

64
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:01,504
I move that

65
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:03,296
And

66
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:07,392
You know I just want you to know that if you buy these things you apparently get proactive service calls

67
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,416
Some things are not working

68
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:09,696
Yay

69
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:10,976
All right

70
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,512
Now back to the show

71
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,584
Let's start off talking about

72
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:16,608
Bricks

73
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,704
Actually we're going to talk about locks that turn into bricks

74
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,728
Yay

75
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:22,496
So

76
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,520
What state

77
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,056
They make lox

78
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:28,128
And they make locks actually that are used in Airbnb

79
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:32,480
Their profession that there should be professional-grade I guess is what I'm

80
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,016
Button

81
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:36,576
They sent out an update last Monday in

82
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:37,856
We did see this

83
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,648
Did brixham is there

84
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:42,464
Fox and so they got the software update

85
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,304
And then suddenly they were like I can't connect back to the home service

86
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,072
Or any other

87
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,864
So what that means is

88
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:52,192
Then they couldn't fix the problem without either

89
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,984
Padding the person uninstall the lock-in

90
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,288
Send it back to them or physically sending a person to

91
00:03:57,312 --> 00:04:00,640
Real remote access to do anything to the lock was just

92
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:01,664
Gone and

93
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:04,736
Basically customers of these lost could either

94
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,016
Channellock back

95
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:10,368
And it would take between 14 and 18 days for replacements

96
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,952
I guess maybe they could send somebody out to fix it

97
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:14,976
Luckily

98
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:17,280
It was only I say only an elder

99
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,071
It's all relative course

100
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,095
500

101
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,119
Customers were

102
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,399
I'm totally affected

103
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:25,471
And 200 of them were those were Airbnb host

104
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,519
These are all first generation

105
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:29,567
6000i models

106
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:30,591
Of the wok

107
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,127
So it's not like

108
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,919
Thousands or millions of blocks but

109
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:34,687
Still

110
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,039
Make a few reasons for Airbnb and it kind of puts out of business in a sentence right

111
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,063
Yeah because

112
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,879
You still have

113
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:44,671
But

114
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:51,583
But that make nearby that's a challenge yes that's how they are you have a rental home

115
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:56,959
Far far away and you just are being bit and now you got to work on the logistics of getting somebody the key

116
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:59,007
Getting the key back from them and so on

117
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:02,591
So this is actually not a new phenomenon back

118
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:07,199
Probably 2 years ago I think it was wink smart home hub

119
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,735
They actually had an update

120
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,783
The break their devices

121
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:13,343
Certification there DNS service

122
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:15,903
Vacation broke during a software update so

123
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,439
I couldn't call back to home

124
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:18,975
And what it meant

125
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:25,375
And this was a huge deal for them and I think probably contributed to kind of some of the problems and Corky's eventual bankruptcy

126
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:26,911
Was that

127
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,191
They had their

128
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,727
Customers send back there

129
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,007
Cubs

130
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,031
Or

131
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,823
You can actually go in on your own

132
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:36,383
In a log into your router and change the

133
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,151
DNS settings

134
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,711
For some people that was just too much

135
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,479
Touch in Sol

136
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,247
Those people

137
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,295
Week actually sent them

138
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,063
A box

139
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:48,927
You shipped it to them and then you got a new one back with all the

140
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:49,695
Your programming

141
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:59,679
So two things come to mind with a story to me

142
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:04,287
The one is that lockstate says they can manually update the lockup have physical access to it

143
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,311
Clearly

144
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:07,103
There's some communication Sports

145
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:09,663
On the device on the lock itself that is not

146
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:10,943
Rely upon

147
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:13,759
Wireless connectivity so I wonder

148
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:14,527
If

149
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:19,903
In the future some of these locks should be designed with actual customer access to that

150
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,951
Because that would save a lot of time if you could

151
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:25,023
Update your own firmware number one but you can't do it

152
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,559
Without access to that poor

153
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,351
Well so here's the downside though

154
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:31,167
Where that Port is

155
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,703
It may not be something you

156
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,727
He want on a lock

157
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,007
Because some thief

158
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:36,543
Is there only

159
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:39,103
USB with their own firmware on it

160
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,127
Indication for

161
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,175
Hahaha

162
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,199
I got you the crew

163
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:46,271
That's totally another Point ioi reason because

164
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:48,831
According to the weather reports I read lockstate

165
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:52,671
It says they can manually update the lock up their physical access to it meaning to me

166
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:55,487
Citrus swapping it out they're updating the firmware so that

167
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,535
Actually exist as how I'm reading

168
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,559
I could be wrong

169
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,607
No no that make sense

170
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,935
And the other thing is

171
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,471
You may disagree

172
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:07,775
But one of the reasons I've never

173
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,567
Look at the

174
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:12,127
Type of Smart Lock that fit over existing

175
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:12,895
Lock

176
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:13,919
Is

177
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:18,527
I want to make sure that I've got key access and other ways to get into something

178
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:23,903
Right I've always stayed with the traditional looking type locks which could happen

179
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,695
Type of problem as well but

180
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:27,743
Yeah exactly

181
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:32,863
There are cases like if your renting then this kind of lock

182
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,655
Baby

183
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:36,959
More acceptable to a landlord

184
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:40,543
But yes I'm I'm with you a hundred

185
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,311
2%

186
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:44,639
What kind of deadbolt turning lock that would be like in August or some

187
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,711
Ratatouille those have key access or no

188
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:49,759
I'm trying to remember I'm done

189
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,807
I had an August installed

190
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:54,367
It was like 2 years ago and now I'm like did it have a

191
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,415
I can't tell you

192
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:57,695
I don't know. Okay

193
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:00,255
It's okay I'm actually looking right now on there

194
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,535
On the product site

195
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,583
I'm just curious it looks like

196
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,607
There is a

197
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:06,143
Key type lock

198
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:10,751
So you do have access is probably not the same key as you would have for your door

199
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:14,591
It might be actually LOL

200
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:16,383
Actually

201
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:19,199
Yeah yeah so you're not covering the the locked

202
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,479
The key tumbler part

203
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:21,503
So you could do

204
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,551
Secrets

205
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,623
I rescind my point yes

206
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,903
Aventura

207
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:38,143
That's alright that's okay William

208
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:41,471
Sorry

209
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,263
Okay

210
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,591
Which makes all kinds of thing

211
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,383
Starbucks

212
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:54,015
Yes back in 2011 or 2012 or the software developers from Google Afton

213
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,831
Move to Shenzhen and traded

214
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:59,391
You say uncle right anchor but you're probably right

215
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:00,927
And then another

216
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,463
Key Personnel Google

217
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,231
Join him

218
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,511
And yeah they make

219
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:07,327
Y'all kind of terrestrial spring

220
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:12,703
Start with smart batteries now they make cables and adapters all things but

221
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,471
Now they make

222
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,519
Something else which is intriguing

223
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,823
You think it's the eufy genie

224
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,871
I think it is the eufy

225
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:20,639
Genie

226
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,175
Such a strange

227
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,783
Yuki Cheney $35

228
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,319
Madame GAO powers

229
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,087
Smart speed

230
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,367
So

231
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:32,671
This was a big deal people wrote about it a lot

232
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:36,511
Clare County review on CNBC and they were like

233
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:41,375
15 bus more just buy the echo instead because it has slightly

234
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,655
More capabilities

235
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,191
And so

236
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,239
I don't know

237
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:51,871
Well I mean on paper that you feed looks and sounds good is slightly bigger than an echo.

238
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:57,247
As you said it's $15 less expensive they say that the audio driver inside

239
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:02,879
Deliver stronger base in 20% more volume. Which I don't know because I have not seen this yet

240
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:05,183
One of the things that jumped out at me though is

241
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,719
It only has

242
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:09,279
A two microphone array

243
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,815
And I think the.

244
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:14,399
I want to say it's use the same 7 Michael raise the echo

245
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:20,287
Okay do you need sound from CNBC said that the sound was not that

246
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,639
Gotcha

247
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,527
That far field

248
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:35,903
Michael Ray is actually just mentions cuz interesting I didn't realize this is powered by synaptics

249
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:37,183
Who recently

250
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:37,951
Bought

251
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:38,719
Connexient

252
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:43,583
And it's actually connections product that does the the audio or the the microphone

253
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:47,423
Okay so you can tow and that thing that

254
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,703
They were sad about his cuz

255
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,751
It is not actually an echo

256
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:55,103
You could do some things that you can do with an echo but not others like calling other Echo

257
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,199
Amazon specific Services then

258
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:04,575
So so this has the voice Services behind the echo but not

259
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:07,135
Every single other Amazon service

260
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,719
I don't know I have yet to

261
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:12,255
Use other than calling you that

262
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,023
One time

263
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,815
I have yet to use

264
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:19,935
Any of my echo calling features including people call people on my Echo Show

265
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:24,799
Which is kind of a bummer I really want my mom to get one

266
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:25,567
Because of privacy

267
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:29,151
I can't talk to him

268
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:36,063
And I agree with you on that and I can also verify cousin looking at Amazon's pitching out the echo Dot drugs have 7 for free

269
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:38,367
Real microphones so there's a potential difference

270
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,695
Okay

271
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,463
So

272
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,999
That's that now

273
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,279
From the really cheap end

274
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:47,327
To directions to Tracy

275
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,631
What is talk about snoo

276
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:50,655
Because

277
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:54,239
There's a review out for the snoo and if you're like Stacy bless you

278
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:55,519
No

279
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,823
This is a party at you yes

280
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,359
What's new

281
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:01,919
It is a smart sleeping bassinet

282
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,199
Fur babies

283
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:07,807
You guys we remember this because it actually came out last year I actually saw it

284
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:08,575
In

285
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:12,159
CES it actually I think I saw it again in the beta store here in

286
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:12,927
In Austin

287
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,975
So but I don't have a baby

288
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:18,047
So I couldn't text review it and say

289
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:21,631
So baby tell me how did you sleep last night

290
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:23,935
Right

291
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:26,495
No one was willing to let me borrow a newborn

292
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,031
Go figure

293
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:30,591
Put in some crazy crib that comes with

294
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:31,871
You know basically a straight track

295
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:36,223
Well alright you turn the baby into a little caterpillar

296
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:38,015
There's a little

297
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:42,111
Yeah it's a sleepsuit so that the baby is he right kind of like in a straight jacket

298
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,415
Yeah

299
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,183
What's better

300
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:45,951
But

301
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:47,999
So this is a $1,200 crib

302
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:50,559
It's designed by Yves Behar

303
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:51,839
Doctor

304
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,423
It's the guy who wrote the happiest baby on the Block

305
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:58,239
Magikarp

306
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,007
Yes

307
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:01,567
And this is attachment parenting book it's

308
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,103
I read it when I was a boy

309
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:07,199
I paid my child sleep in the closet so I clearly

310
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,735
Maybe I shouldn't

311
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,015
People should not let me go

312
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:11,551
Options

313
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,319
But she's very high

314
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:14,879
Dispatch

315
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:19,743
Which it is only a bassinet apparently works for this one baby that tray

316
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:24,607
I don't the parent who did the review did not say if their baby was a

317
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:25,375
A good sleeper

318
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,143
Anyway

319
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,679
But she did say

320
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,751
Baby got 8 hours of sleep

321
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,031
At

322
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,311
8 weeks old

323
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,079
Which is

324
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,127
Uninterrupted sleep now

325
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:36,895
Yeah I would

326
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,175
I'll be honest

327
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,735
Yeah and then that's

328
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:44,063
We talked about pay for it we we are dimensions $1,200

329
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:46,111
Thing is it has a very limited

330
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,903
Shelf life because

331
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,975
After about three months in this particular parents case

332
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,511
The baby was too big for it

333
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:55,583
So you're paying basically $400 a month

334
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,119
For the most challenging

335
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,655
30 months have any babies

336
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:01,471
Wife and parents life

337
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,847
Definitely those first few months you're dying

338
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,407
You would do anything

339
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,175
I put your baby in

340
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:17,087
So if there's a safety factor involved because the the little swaddling

341
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,879
Burrito that you put the baby in

342
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,439
I'll keep them on their back but can't roll over

343
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:23,999
Great and you don't want your baby to roll over B

344
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,535
Danger of SIDS

345
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,327
All your doctors are going to be like

346
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,863
Can you put your baby on your back

347
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:29,631
So

348
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,703
Do we actually say what how it works

349
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,031
No I was just about to say what it does

350
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,567
That's the best part

351
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,615
Velcro your baby into the swaddle

352
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:43,199
You stick your baby into this water

353
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:44,991
And then the crib

354
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,783
It rocks back and

355
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:50,879
Fourth not rocking like a rocker but it goes from side to side

356
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,159
And then

357
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:55,231
Does it have sound does it detect when your baby's crying

358
00:14:55,743 --> 00:15:00,095
Basically it has sensors it has sound and there's a white noise

359
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:00,863
Option

360
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:04,703
But you can have and it rocks the baby when it senses that they're not sleeping

361
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:08,287
It's kind of got some smarts involve plus there's an app that you can actually

362
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,055
Engaged

363
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:12,383
White Noise turn on turn off or turn the rocking motion on or off

364
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,943
So I actually kind of want this

365
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:19,295
I think it would be amazing for adults to have a

366
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:21,855
Sleep Number

367
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:24,159
I have a Sleep Number and it doesn't do that

368
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,183
I know

369
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:28,767
See when you when you kind of like like oh they're having trouble sleeping

370
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,071
I'm a 45 by the way

371
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,607
Free sleep number for something

372
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:33,375
I'm not asleep

373
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,191
No number for you

374
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:36,959
Next

375
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:37,727
Next

376
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:41,311
Alright we had a couple people asked us to talk about this

377
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:43,359
So we're going to talk about this

378
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:45,663
NPR did a story on

379
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:49,759
It's a sensor developed by MIT it's called the super sensor

380
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:54,623
And basically this is a tiny sensor you stick it someplace and it uses

381
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:58,463
Audio signals to determine what's happening in a

382
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,999
Suenos

383
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:06,399
It's got algorithms it's a oh that's series of noises sounds like a shower or at that series of noises sounds like someone shedding

384
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,167
The microwave door

385
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,727
It's really clear what's happening in the

386
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:10,751
Home based on sale

387
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,543
Very small

388
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:13,567
It is it's like

389
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:17,407
It's a tube Square you just plug it into your wall

390
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:20,735
This is really cool we've actually talked about this many months ago

391
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,039
But NPR did a story that

392
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,063
Was basically like

393
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:26,879
Are you guys sure you want to put all the smart stuff in your

394
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:27,903
Home because

395
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:28,927
It sure a lot of

396
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:33,791
NPR is not wrong and we talked about this before like I have

397
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:36,095
Devices in my home that measure sound

398
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:38,143
Or humidity and I can tell things like

399
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,167
Oh hey

400
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:41,983
My family is in the kitchen eating dinner even though I'm not

401
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:42,751
At home

402
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:45,311
Or I can tell when someone's taking a shower

403
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:47,103
A sun-like humidity reading Spike

404
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:49,151
In certain rooms of my house

405
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:52,223
And people don't often think about the privacy and

406
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:56,575
Locations of this and that's one of the things we do on our show is we try to explain

407
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:58,111
Hey by the way

408
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:03,487
Used to drive what you're doing

409
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:05,279
And even who you're doing it with

410
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:06,559
So

411
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:08,863
Let me ask you this because I agree

412
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,191
Call Heartland the whole privacy aspect we have talked about it many times

413
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,471
In your home

414
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,775
I assume that your family has

415
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:18,591
Agreed to give up their privacy to you which

416
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,895
She's not a big deal you're a happy family

417
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:25,503
Are you talking about privacy that goes outside beyond the home and other companies

418
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,527
And the reason why

419
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:27,807
It's kind of a two prong

420
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:28,575
There is

421
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:30,623
And worried about companies getting the data

422
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:33,695
And or I guess I should say my case

423
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:35,743
Family is not too keen on me knowing

424
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,023
Where they are mother doing

425
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:38,559
So they were different

426
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:41,119
Yes so I think that you're right there

427
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,143
Definitely tula

428
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,775
We don't have gas family decided we don't want cameras inside our house

429
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:51,871
Face inside the house unless we're gone and then we position like Arlo's we got

430
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:54,431
Does fun Arlo cameras will position those differ

431
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,199
Places

432
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:58,783
And you know when my parents are here at there's an echo dot in the guest room

433
00:17:59,039 --> 00:17:59,807
They turn that off

434
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:00,831
I don't want that

435
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:06,975
Yeah when we have a sitter or someone like when we had when we went out of town

436
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:10,047
We actually told the person who is in our house I was like

437
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:12,607
Hey by the way there's cameras located here here

438
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,935
Because I trust her and I

439
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:18,751
I think she's going to do anything bad but I didn't want her to be caught

440
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:20,031
Picking her nose on the cameras up

441
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,311
I thought

442
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:24,383
So there's that level and I think there's a set of

443
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:28,223
And then there's the

444
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:29,759
Surveillance

445
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:32,575
Kind of Internet surveillance in

446
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:34,367
1 companies are not great with

447
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:37,951
What's using data we actually just saw the FTC this week find Uber

448
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:41,279
For having their employees finding out who is

449
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,047
Driving

450
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,071
Where is showing

451
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,863
That kind of thing

452
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:49,215
Is really unsettling to me like I am very aware that when I'm testing doorbell

453
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:51,519
When I go out at my front door

454
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:55,359
Grungy clothes in my hair's all a mess

455
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:57,151
Oh my God you know if I

456
00:18:57,407 --> 00:19:00,479
Pissed off his company and they were immature they could like totally

457
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:08,415
What

458
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,719
Play something

459
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:12,511
Sure

460
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:16,095
Yeah and then that's a thought that we talked about that topic many times

461
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,631
It's interesting

462
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:20,191
For me and my family when we got our Nest cam

463
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:23,775
The only way they would let me actually install it my family that is

464
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:24,799
Was

465
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:27,103
To make sure use all of the features

466
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:29,919
That use their phones for locations for them when they are

467
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:32,223
In the house it does not come on

468
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:35,295
And also to schedule it so that it goes

469
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:38,367
Automatically on the bed and it was

470
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,647
Off automatically

471
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:43,487
Before they go to bed and go downstairs and you know get themselves ready for the day

472
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:46,047
So they they set up Wii workout rules

473
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:47,839
To actually implement this

474
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:51,935
So it was compromised

475
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,239
You can't just start setting the stuff up

476
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:57,823
And I think the other thing that the story brings out that

477
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,103
People may not be aware of

478
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,127
Is

479
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:02,943
Not just bad or immature actors that accompanied

480
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:03,711
Doing something stupid

481
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:07,551
But there's also a lot of questions about

482
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,599
You know if you can tell

483
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:12,415
That there are three people who live in my home

484
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:18,559
And you can tell when we take showers and you can tell that we apparently use the microwave a whole lot

485
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:20,095
That data may be valuable

486
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:20,863
Malta Subway

487
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:28,031
Absolutely you know and if you can tell from the sound my appliances make maybe you can figure out what kind of appliances I have

488
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,359
Then you can start selling that data to others

489
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:32,895
That gets a little creepy

490
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:35,199
I think it should creep people out

491
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,223
Because

492
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:37,503
It's surprising to them

493
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:39,295
I think it's surprising to a lot of

494
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,063
People

495
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,599
We think of cameras

496
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:43,647
Is like

497
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:44,927
But we don't think about that

498
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:45,695
In relation to a lot

499
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:47,999
Which is funny because

500
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:52,607
We have thought about in the past but she said gone away just a smartphone itself which is been around

501
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:55,167
Modern version for amino 10 years now

502
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:57,727
It's got a camera it's got a microphone

503
00:20:58,495 --> 00:20:59,775
I've got GPS

504
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:00,799
The cellular

505
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:04,383
Carriers know where you are apps can know where you are

506
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:07,455
A whole Treasure Trove of that that's up there

507
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:10,015
And yet we've kind of mostly gotten over that

508
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:12,575
I think so and maybe that's why

509
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:14,111
Manufacturers of reliable

510
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:17,184
French

511
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,000
I don't know how to solve this

512
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:21,280
I dunno

513
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:22,560
You should definitely

514
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:24,608
And now

515
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:27,936
We're going to talk about the Internet of Things expanding outside of this

516
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:29,728
Into the city streets

517
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,288
Does an MIT project called carioca

518
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,080
I made it uses

519
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:34,848
Toll tag

520
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,640
On cars

521
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:37,664
2

522
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:42,016
Basically determine where they are in the city and ideas you could use this for

523
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,040
Figuring out

524
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:47,392
Where cars are parked and understand a little bit more about traffic patterns

525
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:48,416
And

526
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:49,696
You know figure out

527
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:50,976
Parking options

528
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:55,072
The challenge here is

529
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,168
Again privacy do you really want to know he don't do you want

530
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:01,728
Anyone else to know that you parked in front of

531
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:04,032
When you're at the grocery store right

532
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:05,312
Is any of the ads

533
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:09,408
I mean if it's if it's to help me find parking

534
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:13,248
Innocence I'm okay with that as long as I could Billy determine that

535
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:18,368
Technology honor off these are like an EZ Pass RFID type tags you don't turn them on or off

536
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,392
But

537
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:20,928
You know it's

538
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:22,208
An application that would

539
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,280
Work in conjunction with this but I can say okay I'd like to find a place to

540
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:27,840
The park you may use my location to help me

541
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:28,608
Cinema

542
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:31,424
I mean this is just an MIT research project

543
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,448
EXO

544
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:35,008
It's worth looking at because you know things like parking

545
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:38,592
Are not just inconvenient for you

546
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:39,872
How to circulating lights look

547
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:41,152
Looking for parking spaces

548
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:44,224
It causes congestion in the city

549
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,248
Pollution so

550
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:46,784
Who knows

551
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:51,136
This is a pilot project this is not something you need to worry about today

552
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:52,416
But maybe tomorrow

553
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,952
For those of you who are privacy mind

554
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:55,488
Let's go to the

555
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,560
To the small news bits that are kind of fun for

556
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,096
So

557
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:01,376
My small newspaper

558
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:04,704
Is actually like a cool little story that someone sent me about

559
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,240
Scheduling a Roomba

560
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:07,520
To clean

561
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:08,288
Your

562
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,056
Office

563
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:09,824
FaceTime

564
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,592
Outlook

565
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:11,872
So

566
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:15,200
Which is an IP licensing company

567
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:17,504
Did the license for MP3s

568
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,320
So they're developing an intelligent cleaning Concepts

569
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:23,136
And

570
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:26,720
Schedule something in Outlook and then your room

571
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:30,560
Go

572
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:33,376
And you can put the put the bookings in

573
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:35,168
Prioritize things

574
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,728
And then the robots going to basically update

575
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:39,520
Band

576
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,056
Go

577
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:42,848
Wander around

578
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:47,200
So if I had had that in my office

579
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:50,272
Environment I think I would try to find a way to hack it so that it

580
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:52,832
I could schedule the Roomba leg drop

581
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:58,720
Cherry was Oliver somebody's Florida prank

582
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:01,024
There you go. Yes if you dislike your boss

583
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:02,816
You could probably use this

584
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:06,400
Yay

585
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:07,680
I will say

586
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:08,960
They use the

587
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:10,240
Roomba 6

588
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:11,520
50 Robot vacuum

589
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:15,872
Camo that they're doing and not the

590
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:17,408
It's a 900 model

591
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,432
Don't worry about that

592
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:20,224
Recently was in the news

593
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,064
Because the CEO was like hey maybe we could sell its mapping data

594
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,136
Yasso different Roomba

595
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:31,488
Not the one whose data is getting sold cuz you probably don't want your

596
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:33,792
Maybe you do maybe you don't want your

597
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:34,816
Office

598
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:36,864
Layout

599
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,656
I cannot

600
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,192
Thinking.

601
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,776
Superfine

602
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:50,688
I have a small bit of news I just found out yesterday there is a new June oven

603
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:51,968
Model that is

604
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:53,760
Hungry soon was just announced

605
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:57,088
For those who are not familiar the June oven is a smart

606
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:57,856
Oven

607
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:58,880
That

608
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:00,672
Has WiFi has

609
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:02,976
Cameras ceramic heating elements

610
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:05,024
As a touch screen display

611
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,816
And basically identifies

612
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:11,168
Is food you just put it in and it has recipes for so many types of foods

613
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:12,960
I just cook sporty it's fantastic

614
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:15,008
Pretty sure that you

615
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,032
Still have one yes

616
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:17,568
I do I still love it

617
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,640
We both purchased our genes

618
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:26,016
I think it was $1,500 is not cheap obviously but unfortunately the new June oven model

619
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:30,112
Is even not cheaper because it's 1995 so another $500

620
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:31,136
But the difference is

621
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:32,672
Sedative being built

622
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:34,976
In as a standalone unit

623
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:37,024
And I think it's all aluminum

624
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:37,792
Right now

625
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:39,584
There's a built-in version with

626
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,120
Stainless steel

627
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:42,912
Food grade stainless steel and

628
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:46,240
You got has venting built-in as well so you can now

629
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,264
Dodgers

630
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,056
Put it right into a wall in your kid

631
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:51,872
Kitchen soap for people who want to insert an oven in there

632
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:54,432
The June oven is now insertable if you buy this model

633
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:58,528
It's all the same size and everything else there's no additional features

634
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,088
So it's still relatively small

635
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:03,136
I think I cooked up to a 5 and 1/2

636
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:04,160
Chicken

637
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:06,208
So in that was crammed in there

638
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,024
So this is basically a built-in version of the June

639
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:11,840
It's $500 more and

640
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:15,168
If you're building a house this would make an excellent secondary other

641
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,448
And it's not

642
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:22,848
Crazy like my two ovens in my house are Bosch ovens and they are my built ins and they were eating 15

643
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,432
Another.

644
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,016
I'm kind of like I wish I were building a house

645
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:34,112
I honestly can't remember the last time user full size oven

646
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:34,880
I really can't

647
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:39,232
I use mine in addition to I use one of mine because sometimes I'm doing two

648
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,000
Two things at once

649
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:42,304
So that's just me that's why I had

650
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:45,888
Okay other bit

651
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:47,424
Final small bits of news

652
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:53,824
Pulse which is used to be a company called cell Savers has raised 25 million dollars to switch its business model to be

653
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,592
Become

654
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:58,944
Not just someone who comes out and repairs your cell phone or your tablet when you break it but

655
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:03,808
To deal with smart home devices when they are broken so they will actually set up voice Act

656
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:08,160
Activated smart home stuff they will help repair things if they're broken or

657
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:09,184
You're experiencing trouble

658
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,208
And

659
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,048
This is part of an ongoing Trend in the Amazon team is

660
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:17,888
Experimenting with their own version of The Geek Squad The Geek Squad has its own version of

661
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:18,656
Geek Squad

662
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,960
Installations and

663
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:22,752
I imagine we're going to see a lot more

664
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,312
Yeah these folks

665
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:27,872
They repaired more than 100,000 devices

666
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:30,944
So far I'm actually in the last year

667
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:32,480
They're all smart phones and tablet

668
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:35,296
Topically so broken screens and whatever else might happen

669
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,112
It doesn't make sense to expand their

670
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:40,672
Yeah because

671
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:47,584
I mean if you think about it everybody has one maybe two smartphones maybe other tablets better than once a couple people whatever

672
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:51,680
But the house might have like how many devices do you have Stacy that could

673
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:53,984
He could breathable

674
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,288
Shrek

675
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:59,872
Right so bye-bye expanding into this Market

676
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:01,664
Their area of

677
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,712
The types of devices that can do an

678
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:07,552
Who knows how my devices are going to repair next year I'll be very curious to see if people

679
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:08,832
Use this new service

680
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,392
I'll be very curious maybe I should get

681
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:19,072
That's most of the news we also have a gadget for our Gadget Hall of Shame

682
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:21,888
We brought you the smoke

683
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:23,168
Few weeks back

684
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:24,960
And now we're bringing you

685
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:25,984
The sound

686
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:29,312
So

687
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:31,104
The sound caddy is

688
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,712
I know what it sounds like if a Bluetooth speaker that's in the shape of a golf club has a

689
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:37,504
A shaft in golf

690
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:42,624
Looking head on it so it looks like you could even put with it but I wouldn't do that that's not what it's for

691
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:43,904
But it plays

692
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:48,256
Music from your phone over Bluetooth and can also recharge device

693
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:50,816
Sisters take us a bit of a battery last on a battery in there

694
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:54,400
But so you can connect it maybe smartphone

695
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:57,216
And you can even turn it upside down and

696
00:28:57,472 --> 00:29:00,288
Shopping is at the ground while you're at the dry ranch or something like that

697
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:02,848
$129 for this

698
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,920
As of sometime not very good golfer

699
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:10,528
I would go absolutely berserk if somebody brought this thing to

700
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:13,344
The driving range next to me or Alto Golf Course

701
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:18,720
Just blaring music is not what conference talk about it is not acceptable so yes

702
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:23,584
I mean you can't even clap at golf tournaments you got to do the quotient.

703
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,632
Deer camera with a shutter though

704
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:26,912
Tell you did it out of here

705
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:27,936
No noise

706
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,472
So

707
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:31,776
This feels like a gimmick

708
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:34,080
Doesn't have a lot of

709
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:36,640
Purpose unless you're going to use it to charge

710
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:37,920
But that's what those

711
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:39,712
Anker / Anker charging

712
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,552
Right listen I've been on golf outings where we

713
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:44,832
Get a Little Rock SC

714
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:46,880
Noisy and whatnot

715
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:49,184
Okay maybe that would be fun

716
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:50,720
This would be fun for that

717
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:54,304
But that's not what most golfers about so I say to Mickey

718
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,840
So the sound caddy

719
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:57,376
Panera in the release disgusting

720
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:59,168
In the product golf is hard enough

721
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:04,032
But the sound caddy is helping to lighten things up while attracting Millennials and curious participant

722
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:07,104
To try so this is Millennials entry into golf

723
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:10,944
All right

724
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:13,504
So that concludes this week show

725
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:17,344

00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,552
Twist out hair

738
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:49,088
To talk to us about

739
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:49,856
Haikou

740
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:52,160
Hastatus love how are you doing

741
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:54,464
Hi Stacy I'm doing good how are you

742
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,488
Excellent

743
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:58,304
So first off remind me once again

744
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,584
What is it that high code

745
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:03,424
We got light at full range of services for it related projects

746
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,216
Mainly for US base camp

747
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:09,312
Emphasis is iot and what we call mdp

748
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:10,848
Mathematical data processing

749
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:14,432
Okay so what is mathematical data Pro

750
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,992
Play mathematical data processing

751
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:20,064
Cleaning the application of mathematical and scientific

752
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,112
Excuse to a wide range of problem

753
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,904
Mdp

754
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:29,792
Enclose machine learning computation geometry or statistical and numerical mathematics and daughters

755
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:33,632
The elderly clients to make sense of

756
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:35,424
Usually overwhelm anymore

757
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,704
What's the date today

758
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,472
And then

759
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:40,032
Help them to make better business

760
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,336
Excellent so you build algorithms

761
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:44,896
But there are a lot of platforms

762
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:45,920
Who's that provide

763
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:48,224
What makes Haiku different

764
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,504
Good questions to ask

765
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,088
Indeed provide great pieces of functionality

766
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:53,856
Machu Picchu

767
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:59,488
Bear in mind that there is no one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to real-world cases

768
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:01,536
Send a text tomorrow

769
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:04,864
You quick but often meteor crater

770
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:07,168
Did you find this

771
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:07,936
Is customized

772
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:09,984
Sleeper light I get to develop

773
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,008
Mathematical

774
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:15,104
Based on what the client requires we can often make a recommendation as to

775
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:17,152
What data needs to be collected

776
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:19,456
And provided as an equal to this model

777
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:21,248
Subject matter expertise

778
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:22,016
Essential

779
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:24,320
And to work closely with our clients

780
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:25,856
Understand babies

781
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:26,880
Sunday needs

782
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:28,160
Who developed the perfect

783
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:32,256
End this way bro scientific perspective becomes important

784
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:34,048
So could you give me an

785
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:40,192
Want religious comes to mind is where the girl was too focused price ranges of collect

786
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,032
And working together with our client would you like some water

787
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:45,568
Play Someday.

788
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:46,592
Sociology

789
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:48,128
And Kids TV

790
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:49,408
Slater

791
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:52,224
We applied a similar process in the financial in the

792
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:57,344
Our task was to recognize specific types of motion

793
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:59,648
Quotes on waiting

794
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,440
Play some ocean parameters

795
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:04,000
Flick speed and acceleration

796
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:05,536
This comes from a wearable

797
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:06,816
Using this data

798
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:08,352
Chanel booties

799
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:09,888
The detainment

800
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:11,936
The motion and gave

801
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:13,472
The proper recommendation

802
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:17,312
And to do this we borrow the knowledge of Arrow season

803
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:18,336
Knicks and police

804
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:19,872
And implemented

805
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:21,920
International navigation system

806
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:26,016
To estimate velocity and orientation with respect to gravity

807
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:29,088
Really cool because I am

808
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:29,856
Not good

809
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:30,624
Building outdoor

810
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:32,416
So where can I get more information

811
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:38,048
Go to www.icloud.com

812
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:43,936
That's www.har.com

813
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:56,736
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest is

814
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:59,552
Daniel Cooley who is senior vice president

815
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:01,600
Of iot at silicon labs

816
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:02,880
Hi Daniel

817
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:07,488
I'm doing great thanks for having me Stacy and I am super excited to have you

818
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:09,024
We're going to talk about

819
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,608
The tough problems the heart problems that were not thinking about you

820
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,632
With the Internet of Things

821
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:17,216
You mentioned to me that there are four main things that you want to talk about

822
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:18,240
So let's hit him

823
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:20,288
First just broadly so we know what's got

824
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:22,592
Sure so this is a

825
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:24,640
But working on it the Silicon level to enable and if

826
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:27,200
Future so these are the things that take a long time to play out

827
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:28,736
What is Edge computing

828
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:30,528
Iot data models

829
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:32,320
Human machine interfaces

830
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:35,904
And shifting business models around iot that impact of silicon

831
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:40,512
Awesome and we touched an Aldis so I'm looking forward to getting your perspective

832
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:43,072
Kick it off with Edge computing

833
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:46,912
Because I kind of feel like cloud is so yesterday

834
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:47,936
So

835
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:50,240
What do you mean when you're talking about

836
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:52,288
Edge Computing what are headed how do you define

837
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,312
First

838
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:54,592
That's a great question

839
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:58,176
So I I don't mean kind of the fog iot fog

840
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:59,456
That people may read about

841
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:04,576
Which is most recent around gateway's gateways in the home gateways in retail commercial Factory application

842
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:08,928
I mean doing computations at the actual end devices

843
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:09,952
In the iot

844
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:14,816
Doing math and making decisions on a door window sensor on a power tool

845
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:17,120
On a piece of equipment that sitting out there

846
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:19,168
Because today those devices

847
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:20,960
Necessitate provide

848
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:22,240
Actually don't make too many

849
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:26,336
Decisions

850
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:28,128
More massive power at the edge

851
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:29,408
Because there alot of trade-offs

852
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:33,248
This really comes down to things like memory

853
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:37,600
Rock compute for decision-making DSP for math I need a battery

854
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,416
Because a lot of these these cases have

855
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:43,232
Battery-powered devices to any efforts they can you know

856
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:49,632
Do they make better batteries is always good right now we're seeing as we've seen a big shift in the last few years from 8-bit to three

857
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:50,656
32-bit architecture

858
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:57,312
Stuff that was traditionally run on 851 Coors or or simpler architecture ship to 32 bit

859
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:59,104
Nothing great or the Eagles

860
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:02,688
But going forward is going to be a lot more need before

861
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:03,456
DSP

862
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:05,504
Computations in the math domain

863
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,112
As well to make better decisions around Sensor Fusion and was starting to Branch into topics like

864
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:11,392
Machine learning

865
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:12,160
At the edge

866
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:17,792
So that you can I know it's kind of out there but it is real and it's going to happen when I talk

867
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:20,608
Machine learning algorithms that get trained at the edge but

868
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:22,144
Ticket implemented out there

869
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:24,192
All right you just brought up like

870
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:25,984
Think so let's

871
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,776
I meant to say break it down a lot in the show

872
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:29,824
Let's talk about DSP

873
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:31,872
Because when I think of DSP

874
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:34,688
Math I think cellular base station

875
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:35,968
Voice process

876
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:39,040
So kind of threw that out there are we talkin about

877
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:40,064
Building Lee

878
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:44,160
Really power fishing DSP that are going to sit at the very edge is part of like a

879
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:45,440
An SOC or something

880
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:47,744
Pretty much it

881
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,536
Actually it's not that complicated

882
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:50,560
For the last few years

883
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:53,888
People making a lot of efforts on making better decisions

884
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:54,912
But that's not

885
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:57,216
Now people need a lot more math

886
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:59,776
How to make those decisions in this could be a fifties

887
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:01,056
Play fft

888
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:03,616
Fast Fourier transforms this could be

889
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:05,664
Yes

890
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:08,736
This could be voice recognition like think about

891
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:10,016
Something like Alexa

892
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:14,624
Sitting down in your sock to talk to a door lock how do you do that it's battery powered it's not plugged in

893
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,208
This could be in the form of image recognition this could be

894
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:24,096
Glass break detectors on running as with with a microphone as a sensor not necessarily for boys but for others

895
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:25,888
Presence detection

896
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:30,496
Is a lot of reasons people want to do more math at the most energy constrain in the most cost

897
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:31,776
Constrained devices

898
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:33,824
And putting a big DSP chip

899
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:37,920
Sitting in that system just doesn't work economically or powerful it's not very powerful

900
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:41,760
That's today so in the future we're going to make tsp smaller

901
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:44,576
Or are we going to do something completely different

902
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:47,648
We're just going to architect soc's for the iot

903
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:49,184
I'll say that most of the

904
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,208
DSP that you

905
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:50,976
You could have brought up in

906
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:52,256
You think about her knees

907
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:53,792
Big Iron

908
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:56,352
Applications or or centered around

909
00:37:56,864 --> 00:38:01,984
Strict audio but in the future we're going to make the right products for the iot just like we've done with the wireless

910
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,288
Systems and processors willing to do the same for math

911
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:07,104
Okay and now let's go into machine learning

912
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:10,432
Because this is something that the coolest product

913
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:11,200
It came out recent

914
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:13,248
Read to me was the Intel movidius

915
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:14,016
Dongle stick

916
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:18,368
It's like a stick you plug into the edge and it's using the movidius computer vision

917
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:20,672
Chips in architecture to

918
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:22,976
For robotics for other cool and stuff so I'm like

919
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:25,280
This is not what you're talking about

920
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:29,888
Middle part of it so those kind of sticks that are running our

921
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:32,960
Le running Linux systems with gigabytes of

922
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:35,008
In a Flash and RAM and

923
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:37,312
I mean this is what it in my world this is

924
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:38,592
Is pretty processor

925
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:39,360
Intensive

926
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:42,176
But the applications are going into don't necessarily need that

927
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:43,456
That's where they're starting to

928
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:46,784
The same kind of applications can be implemented in a much

929
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:51,392
Smaller architecture a much simpler software architecture and a much lower energy flicker

930
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:57,536
Once you kind of decide what you need it doesn't have to be this generic linux-based system it can be something that kind of extends

931
00:38:57,792 --> 00:39:00,352
Bring the cost down so can be adopted more widely

932
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:06,240
So that's kind of what I'm talking about here is in these iot use cases as they come up and they really come into their full form

933
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:08,288
You start to see more silicon

934
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,640
Tailored towards those use cases unless I caught generic architectures

935
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:15,712
Is it going to be generic in the sense of

936
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:17,504
In the cloud Microsoft and

937
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,296
EBay Google are looking at

938
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:22,624
Specifically architected chips for a certain workload

939
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,160
Big fat

940
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:28,512
When we bring that down to the iot are we going to be doing those same sort of

941
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:30,048
Custom architectures

942
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:32,096
In some cases yeah it's not nice

943
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:33,632
Necessarily that is

944
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:38,240
Divine for a specific application like a cell phone or a TV or something like that

945
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:40,288
But you look far enough commonality

946
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,824
When the volume justifies it

947
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:45,152
You go out into the system around then you can think about application

948
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:45,920
Mclighting

949
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:48,736
Being one here where there's a lot of lighting Products

950
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:50,528
Ticket shipping is about 4 billion

951
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:54,368
Products physical units that get shipped every year in lining

952
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:56,672
And it's not commonality across that segment

953
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:58,208
You can think about doing

954
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:02,048
Specific applications around lighting Building Products specifically for that

955
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:05,120
And you know they started by just doing lighting control and then they

956
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:06,400
You know Branch into other

957
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:08,448
Functions within the lighting system

958
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:09,472
Such as

959
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:11,008
Dippin Dots

960
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:15,872
Sensing relaying information these light bulbs are plugged in their power

961
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:17,920
Do a lot of relaying are they

962
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:20,992
P****** sand in these networks so there's a lot of

963
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:22,016
Functions of these are

964
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:24,832
See maybe in terms of sensing but there's a lot of fun

965
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:26,624
I don't see in terms of routing

966
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,440
So they're their partner an integral part of a network

967
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:30,976
In a lot of somewhere

968
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:35,584
Ford leaving architectures that are coming into the market and some of them are in the home but most of them

969
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,888
Kind of these kind of applications are outside of the home

970
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:40,960
All right in another area where I feel

971
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:47,360
Like we might have some custom chips and maybe some algorithms is around voice not just using tsp is

972
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:48,128
But also in

973
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:48,896
Machine learning

974
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:52,480
Now you're exactly right voice is starting to come up

975
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:54,016
Very very big

976
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:55,808
Element of the environment

977
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:58,368
Something environment who's there what do they need

978
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:01,184
What they saying identifying you as a person

979
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:05,792
There's a lot of that I know in this kind of starts branching into the human machine interface

980
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:08,096
She took my Segway

981
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:10,656
Yeah

982
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:11,424
So

983
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,448
How you interface with

984
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,240
Electronics is changing and

985
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:18,336
These Electronics want to know who you are on in Taylor they

986
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:21,920
The used towards you itself so they can do this with vision they can do this

987
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:23,712
I can do this in a number of ways

988
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:25,248
Your phone already doesn't with fingerprint

989
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:28,064
It's right your finger up your phone knows who you are based on

990
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:30,112
That was a big step forward

991
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:31,392
Machine interface actually

992
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,208
You may not think about it that way but that's the way the engineering side

993
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:36,512
Engineer thinking about this so

994
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:38,304
In the more that these Electronics

995
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,584
Taylor there

996
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,912
Application in their operation to the person

997
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:44,704
Using it it matters

998
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,752
I think about the lord always

999
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:47,520
Is like

1000
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:48,288
I want a

1001
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:49,824
Put my hand on a door lock

1002
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,640
It knows who I am by the time I start turning it

1003
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:54,431
Is either going to unlock or not

1004
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:55,455
Think about it that way

1005
00:41:55,711 --> 00:42:00,319
You're more generous that I am I think it should unlock or it should send it. Electricity

1006
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:03,135
Orgeat

1007
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:05,951
Exactly and so just the way you interface Electronics

1008
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:07,487
Products

1009
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:10,047
In general is changing but you need a lot of electronics

1010
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:10,815
To do that

1011
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:12,351
Decapitation

1012
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:14,655
Is a lot of privacy security needs around that

1013
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:19,007
A lot of data that has to be shared a different levels in the car called iot food chain

1014
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:20,543
And soul is driving laws

1015
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:26,943
Security needs but it's ultimately about tailoring the product experience to the user interfaces I feel like everyone's

1016
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:29,759
High voice I love your perspective about

1017
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:31,039
Prince but then

1018
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:32,831
It feels like we've gone from voice

1019
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:39,231
To like all of this like you will communicate directly via telepathy if you think of like Elon Musk and some of the Facebook ever

1020
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:46,399
And I feel like we've Miss like a huge chunk of the middle going straight for a veto I'm going to tell you to do something that I didn't think it and it will happen

1021
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:50,751
Being perhaps more practical cuz you have to sell actual products to

1022
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:51,775
Just like real

1023
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:52,799
Customers

1024
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:56,895
What do you think the interfaces are going to be or how are you thinking about

1025
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:57,663
The future here

1026
00:42:58,431 --> 00:42:59,199
Twister tracks

1027
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:00,223
Because I love that

1028
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:04,831
That angle here my head is making a big shift away from physical button

1029
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:06,111
Athens to capacitive button

1030
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:07,647
For example

1031
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:09,439
This is super practical

1032
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:12,511
Because the performance is better and less things break

1033
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:18,911
If there's not a mechanical switch anymore so it's easier to manufacture it's either produce less Q's but it doesn't really stop there I think

1034
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:21,983
The product companies that were working with right now

1035
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:25,055
Want to remove as much you as possible

1036
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:31,711
It is kind of a strange way to think about it but they want to remove as in decision-making and I think you can see that in his face

1037
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:34,015
Use casein in remote controls that are

1038
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:35,039
Being shipped with

1039
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:37,343
Televisions are over-the-top box

1040
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:41,183
You know just recently actually I had table service

1041
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:43,231
Installed in in in a property that I own

1042
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:44,255
And I haven't had cable

1043
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:45,023
4 years

1044
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:47,583
And they gave me this giant remotes like 50 buttons

1045
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:50,399
What would I do with this I'm used to my

1046
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:53,215
Single remote from Amazon and so everybody's driving

1047
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:56,799
Simplify simplify simplify and as much as possible and

1048
00:43:57,055 --> 00:44:02,431
I remove as much interface if they can really Taylor The Experience around what they want and not know

1049
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:06,015
Necessarily try to provide every single hook on hook and knob out there

1050
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:10,111
Okay so tedious feel almost like a bad example because you got a screen which makes you

1051
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:11,391
You able to do more with

1052
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:13,439
Four buttons rate it gives you a lot of like

1053
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:16,511
Assistant mousing over but pushing over whatever

1054
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:18,303
When you're talking about interfaces

1055
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:19,583
Devices that don't have

1056
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:20,607
Screens

1057
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,143
Voices obviously win

1058
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:23,679
What else is there

1059
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:25,471
I'm to get seems like haptic feedback

1060
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:26,495
Car

1061
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:27,263
I don't know

1062
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:29,567
Does haptic feedback there's lights

1063
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:32,639
So anything visual is always bigger eyes are fantastic

1064
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:34,175
Sense8 sensory objects

1065
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:39,551
This voice that comes into play like your Alexa is it in and all the products that are coming out around boys

1066
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:40,319
Control

1067
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:44,415
That's a huge question and one that's going to be big because it's the one of the most natural things

1068
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:45,183
You don't actually

1069
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:46,207
If you have to learn how to read

1070
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:47,231
Right

1071
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:48,511
You don't have to learn how to

1072
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:49,535
Speak it just

1073
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:51,071
Gym Kids

1074
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:52,351
You seeing this as an adult

1075
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:58,495
But I think that's one of the big things going for is anything that you can talk to you probably will be able to talk to

1076
00:44:59,007 --> 00:44:59,775
I just came back from

1077
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:02,847
You know I'm partner meetings and it was a big push around

1078
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:07,199
Fencing again it's more about figuring out who you are and

1079
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:09,247
Maybe how you're responding to

1080
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:12,831
Environment or two what's going on then examples of company that

1081
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:14,367
Was trying to

1082
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:15,647
Or actually has

1083
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:17,439
It'll mean a lot of Technology on EKG

1084
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:19,743
To not only identify you

1085
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:21,279
As a person uniquely

1086
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:22,559
But if you're stressed

1087
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:23,583
If you're dehydrated

1088
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:24,351
If your

1089
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:28,191
Hungry all of the other trying to figure out it interesting ways to actually do this

1090
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:28,959
And so

1091
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:30,495
If you want to think about that

1092
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:35,871
Enter the human machine interface you can it bathe they were selling this as being able to identify

1093
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:37,407
People on a factory floor

1094
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:39,199
And I like that scary that's 19

1095
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:40,479
84 territory for me

1096
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:43,295
Okay so you brought up business model

1097
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:44,831
Let's talk about that beat

1098
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:45,855
Because I spend

1099
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:52,767
Just a crazy amount of time thinking about how we're going to make this a hardware

1100
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:54,815
More money from

1101
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:56,351
So

1102
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:59,935
What is the future look like to you what are you what future are you building

1103
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:01,983
The question of businessman

1104
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:05,567
I guess the idea for me is that

1105
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:07,359
All products should be able to be

1106
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:08,127
Be connected to the in

1107
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:10,431
Scary

1108
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:12,223
I certainly is for me

1109
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:13,503
Intellij idea

1110
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:14,527
Is powerful though

1111
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:15,551
And

1112
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:17,343
The way that people built products

1113
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:19,391
The way they roll them out over time

1114
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:22,463
And the way that what you expect out of them all fundamentally

1115
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:23,231
Change

1116
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:24,511
So if you can get with Kinect

1117
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:26,047
The internet or some service

1118
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:27,327
Think about it that way

1119
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:28,351
Is

1120
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:29,119
Pretty dramatic

1121
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:31,679
But I think it hasn't really been done before

1122
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:33,983
Other than for cellular technology

1123
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:35,007
+ 4

1124
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:36,031
Set top boxes

1125
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:37,311
In a few of these other application

1126
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:38,847
Transport for the consumer site

1127
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:39,871
But it's

1128
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:42,687
Edit you sweet on proprietary wise brother application

1129
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:43,455
Smart metering

1130
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:44,991
That is a great example

1131
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:48,831
The internet but they are connected to some service

1132
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:51,135
You're certainly being transacted on how much energy you use

1133
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,159
We use at all times

1134
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:54,207
So this idea is that

1135
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:55,999
This is kind of my fear of

1136
00:46:56,255 --> 00:47:00,351
Oh my God everything is going to become a subscription so I will subscribe to

1137
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:03,423
Turn on my door locks are my car or

1138
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:06,495
You name it I'm going to subscribe to these connect two things

1139
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:08,543
Which is kind of cool in some ways

1140
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:10,591
What do you need to make that a reality

1141
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:11,615
On your end

1142
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:15,199
What do we need to make a reality in technology standpoint is

1143
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:16,479
It's actually not that

1144
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:19,807
You need consistent data connectivity to that device

1145
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:21,087
And you need to do it securely

1146
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:22,879
Most of the other stuff starting place

1147
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:27,231
Actually so people can buy chips that are pretty cheap to go build a door lock

1148
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:28,767
It's not the hardest thing

1149
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:33,631
But getting data in and out securely and reliably is a big problem that people are trying to solve right now

1150
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:36,959
But I think that's not the hardest for the hardest part here as in technology

1151
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:39,775
It's about convincing people to shift over

1152
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:43,103
There's a certain generation gap is a certain fear adapters a certain

1153
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:47,199
Y'all got going a lot of places where people just won't rent a device as a service

1154
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:49,759
Eustasis so compelling I'll just do it

1155
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:54,623
And there's not a whole lot of those right now so I think there's Marcus going to take a little while to adopt it

1156
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:55,903
Consumer side

1157
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:57,183
Onyx flip

1158
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:59,999
Of that the industrial commercial space

1159
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:01,279
This is normal

1160
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:08,703
You know you have service contracts left and right in an in a retail environment in a in a in a business environment in a factory

1161
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:13,055
You already have services for security near have services for a hundred other things

1162
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:15,359
This is being adopted a lot faster

1163
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:18,943
Actually in the in the commercial and Industrial side that's the focus

1164
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:22,015
That kind of a building for our products and those

1165
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:23,551
Same specs

1166
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:25,343
Meet the consumer need

1167
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:26,367
At the same time

1168
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:28,671
So it's mostly securities

1169
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:31,231
Industrial side

1170
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:36,095
Yeah there's a lot there secure boot authentication certification Key storage generation

1171
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:40,959
Acceleration all these kind of things

1172
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:43,775
Go to the kind things were building into our chips and in

1173
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:44,543
The whole industry

1174
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:45,823
Actually is racing towards

1175
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:47,359
To do this right now this is not just me

1176
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:48,639
So as a

1177
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:50,943
Average person running around out there going

1178
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:52,991
Why do we need all this

1179
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:55,039
What's the worst case scenario if you

1180
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:56,575
You don't have this and you have soups

1181
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:57,343
Scription baserva

1182
00:48:58,111 --> 00:49:01,695
I think it just won't scale it won't take off in the volumes whenever materialized

1183
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:03,999
The flywheel Easthampton

1184
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:05,023
Think about it that way

1185
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:06,047
I think that

1186
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:08,351
It only takes a few hacks really takes a few

1187
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:10,911
You know family members telling you no way don't go do that thing

1188
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:12,191
And then you wouldn't do it

1189
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:15,007
That's not out of the realm of happening I think that

1190
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:20,127
Working hard to make sure that doesn't happen but that iote's happening in fits and starts along the way

1191
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:22,431
I think in the end that the real use cases are

1192
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:24,479
Pretty compelling out there and

1193
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:26,783
DIYs too big to ignore so it's just

1194
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:29,087
It's not a matter of of S but when

1195
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:34,463
It's just going to be how how long does it take to get to security angle worked out and it's not just about songs

1196
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:37,023
Security and that's an enabler for everything else

1197
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:38,559
Really it's not about

1198
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:41,631
Making the most secure devices like without a secure device nothing else

1199
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:42,911
Is really going to scale

1200
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:48,031
Okay well let's go to the biggest I don't know if this is the biggest elephant but it does feel like a

1201
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:48,799
Huge elephant

1202
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:50,591
Which is data models

1203
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:56,735
She talked to me about what you mean by data bottles cuz people throw around that phrase a lot meeting a bunch of different thing

1204
00:49:57,503 --> 00:49:58,783
Serenity by data models is

1205
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:00,063
Is the code running on device

1206
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:01,087
That device

1207
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:02,367
And if you don't have

1208
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:04,159
Consistent data models to just stop going to work

1209
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:08,767
You know I could take lighting for example and you install 20 or 10 light bulbs and

1210
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:12,351
Can you start replacing them over the years 3 4 5 years down the line

1211
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:13,887
They all need to work together

1212
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:14,655
All the time

1213
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:16,447
On off dim color

1214
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:18,239
Control if you need that there is it has to be

1215
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:19,007
Process

1216
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:20,031
The same way

1217
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:21,567
So that that apis

1218
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:23,103
If you think about it that way or the

1219
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:24,895
The definition of that light bulb

1220
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:25,919
In soccer have to be

1221
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:27,967
And if you're relying on

1222
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:30,015
Fifty or a hundred proprietary

1223
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:32,319
Implementations of what that looks like it just won't scale

1224
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:33,599
It's not going to go back up

1225
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:36,415
So that will be a standardization

1226
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:37,695
There's a half a dozen of these

1227
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:38,975
Things that are in play right now

1228
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:41,535
And she's going to be there any two or three in the end

1229
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:43,839
So this is a big philosophical

1230
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:44,863
Question

1231
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:48,447
I remember in the early days of the week

1232
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:49,471
For the wind

1233
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:56,639
The open web is dead everything's an app in

1234
00:50:56,895 --> 00:51:02,527
Even things like amp services like that it killed it so it feels like every business has looked at that and said

1235
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:05,087
Hey you know what we can handle proprietary

1236
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:07,135
We can try to push people

1237
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:08,415
To buy all

1238
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:11,487
Philips hue light bulbs are all Cree light bulbs

1239
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:15,583
I know there are standards trying to make this work but it feels like

1240
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:21,983
The industry is not interested in listening to what is probably good for consumers or businesses

1241
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:25,567
They might be beating themselves against this light app to find

1242
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:26,591
For years to come

1243
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:28,127
I think that

1244
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:29,919
Part of the reason of doing that right now is

1245
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:30,687
Because

1246
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:33,759
They're looking for ways to differentiate and that's how they differentiate today

1247
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:35,039
And I just don't

1248
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:37,087
Think that's how they're going to differentiate

1249
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:38,879
I don't have a

1250
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:44,511
A more concrete answer than that but I do know all these companies are looking for different ways to differentiate

1251
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:45,791
Because they see

1252
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:48,095
The Legacy stop being commoditized

1253
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:48,863
Pretty rapidly

1254
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:50,143
So

1255
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:51,679
Having a connected device

1256
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:52,703
Enable fat

1257
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:56,799
You know I think that defining what a light bulb looks like an software isn't Phillips

1258
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:57,567
Just trying to do

1259
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:59,103
I think they're trying to do

1260
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:00,639
And I'm using that as an example

1261
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:01,919
You brought up the hill

1262
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:04,223
In which is in one that everybody knows and

1263
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:05,759
You know they're looking for other ways

1264
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:09,087
Differentiate whether it's working with different ecosystems are out there for the

1265
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:10,111
Control elements

1266
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:13,695
How you turn light bulb on and off and software isn't so important

1267
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:15,743
To them it's not where they differentiate their products

1268
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:20,095
Those are the kind of companies and whether it's lighting or or anything else in the home

1269
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:23,423
They're going to look for different ways to differentiate in the future that they don't have to do

1270
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:24,447
Today we made

1271
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:26,751
Really want their proprietary way of doing it

1272
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:32,639
To be standardized that's still yet to play out but I think that they're going to look for other ways to differentiate the future

1273
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:34,175
And do you guys have

1274
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:40,575
I guess a dog in that hunt in the standardization effort in the data model effort are you trying to push the industry one way or the other

1275
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:43,135
Different models are you just like please guys settlement

1276
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:44,415
Yes

1277
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:46,207
We are actually

1278
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:50,815
So there's kind of three entry points into the iot from a technology perspective

1279
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:53,887
There's the datacentre the Gateway and the edge device

1280
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:55,167
And

1281
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:57,727
Depending on where you start you'll try to drive

1282
00:52:58,495 --> 00:53:03,103
Decisions that actually impact all the others without realizing it or maybe you're doing it on purpose

1283
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:06,431
It's a data models that are birth out of organizations that starting

1284
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:07,199
The cloud

1285
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:09,247
Practical to implement for

1286
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:10,783
Certain cost energy

1287
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:14,111
Complexity budget at the edge starting the gateways

1288
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:19,231
Usually Implement security requirements on National devices that just don't work you can't implement

1289
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:20,767
Certain kind of security at a

1290
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:24,607
There's a lot of I keep saying that the cost word because that's what the price

1291
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:28,447
Optical element throwing the stuff out so we push Verde tomatoes that are light

1292
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:30,239
It has appropriate amounts

1293
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:31,519
Security and Trust

1294
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:35,615
Put on the IRT and so let you know I don't just want to go into all the ones that still come out to

1295
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:37,663
Pushing through the standards bodies right now

1296
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:38,687
But we're

1297
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:39,455
In general

1298
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:40,735
Shooting for lightweight

1299
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:44,575
Models that Define only what they need to define a nothing more

1300
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:48,159
And then have security elements built in at the chip level

1301
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:49,695
And yeah

1302
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:50,463
Okay

1303
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:52,767
Security requirements

1304
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:54,303
Encryption

1305
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:56,351
4 key storage generation 4

1306
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:58,655
Boots certifying firmware images

1307
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:02,239
Already

1308
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:06,591
Mostly. And then it becomes how do you put all this together to Define what a product looks like

1309
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:07,359
Software

1310
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:13,759
Oh my gosh why can't wait to talk to you in like three maybe four years to see if we've actually done this

1311
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:15,295
Because my hopes are not high

1312
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:18,623
We'll see I think that you're going to see

1313
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:19,647
No not one

1314
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:20,415
I think there will be more

1315
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:23,999
All right will Daniel thank you so much for

1316
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:26,303
Thank you for having me

1317
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:33,471
That's it for this week show thank you so much for listening and if you want more.

1318
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:37,055
Tnews you can sign up for my newsletter Stacy knows things at

1319
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:43,455
Stacey on iot cam will see you next week
