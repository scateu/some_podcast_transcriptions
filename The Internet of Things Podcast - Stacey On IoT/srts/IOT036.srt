00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:09,984
Hey everyone welcome back to the end

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,336
Internet of Things podcast I'm your host Stacey Higginbotham and here is your co-host

3
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:15,616
Kevin tofel

4
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:17,408
Had today we have got

5
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:18,176
Lots of

6
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:20,736
I was going to say we have lots of security news for you

7
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:23,296
But actually it's insecurity news

8
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:29,184
We almost were in unison there

9
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:35,840
That was not planned either know nothing about our show is plant has

10
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:38,656
As most people. They probably can tell Kevin

11
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:39,680
Pretty obvious

12
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:40,448
So

13
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:46,336
As a parent both of us probably had the same reaction to the news this week that Packers

14
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:48,896
8Ball actually not hackers a single hacker

15
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:53,760
And this is a person who actually isn't selling the date or doing anything with it but just

16
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:55,296
Just to see that if he could

17
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:58,624
Got into vtext servers and

18
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,696
Basically got access to the tally is now

19
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:04,512
6 million data on six million children

20
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:10,656
It is at 6.3 million children and 4.8 million parent account so obviously

21
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:13,472
Some of those parents have multiple kids using VTech products

22
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:16,544
And this this is just a tragedy I mean yes

23
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,872
Brass parents but just in general this is terrible

24
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:24,736
I mean there are photos of these kids chat logs all kinds of things and it's

25
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:28,064
It's it's just such a shame in VTEC

26
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,208
VTech is said it admits the database was not as secure as it should have been what was your first clue folks

27
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:37,280
Sorry

28
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:40,608
No no this is this is this is bad I wouldn't

29
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:44,192
I wouldn't call it a tragedy I mean there's there's not a loss of life here

30
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:47,008
This is a Taxco this is more of a

31
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,080
HS something hack is opposed to a

32
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:53,408
What we call it a actual breach stats

33
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:55,200
You know design to show your data

34
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:56,224
Hurt

35
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,248
Cause actual harm

36
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,832
The VTech makes a variety of toys they make a

37
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:03,648
Connected tablets for kids they make

38
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:04,416
What else do they make

39
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,184
Etsy

40
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,792
Some of them have you know I have some smarts to them and displays and obviously some have cameras

41
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:13,120
It's a wide range of of kids toys

42
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:15,424
And basically what happened

43
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:16,448
Is

44
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,800
Behavior performed basically he didn't SQL injection hack

45
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:23,616
And this is this is kind of a Brute Force attack

46
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:25,152
Have they they

47
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:28,224
Insert malicious commands into the websites forms

48
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:28,992
Tent

49
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,272
Trickett to get

50
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,040
Other data

51
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:33,856
Database access database access

52
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,392
Once I had database access

53
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:37,952
What they discovered was that the

54
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,232
Passwords

55
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,792
Were not stored

56
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:45,376
Well they were stored securely but they weren't hashed correct

57
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,680
The passwords were hashed

58
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:49,728
They were protected so they weren't

59
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:50,752
Like that's not

60
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:54,592
It's not like they were in plain text and so on so are you know

61
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:58,944
I don't want to backtrack when I said to be check is obviously they realize they have an issue but

62
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,736
At least they were not in any

63
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:02,016
Plain text passwords

64
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:06,112
Yeah cuz we ever we've seen actually a lot of hacks recently and

65
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:08,672
Basically what happens is they get into the database

66
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:09,696
Boom

67
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:10,720
Your passwords

68
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:12,256
All right there

69
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,024
Exteriors

70
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,072
So okay

71
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:18,144
But what the heck are did discover is that

72
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,704
They could actually tie the information about

73
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:25,824
The kids so they had the kids names ages that sort of thing in the nick of time it back to the parents

74
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,104
Which then

75
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,944
Had the parents names and their addresses so they had the kids

76
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,528
Tied to their parents which gave them the kids

77
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,552
Names

78
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,344
Your address

79
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,136
Genders birthdates

80
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,416
Photographs

81
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,184
Remove

82
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:41,952
Yeah it's

83
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:42,976
It's not great

84
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:49,376
The chat logs that the audiophiles cuz you can do audio chat on some of these devices they are encrypted by AAS

85
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,144
128

86
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,192
Is according to vitek's

87
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:56,800
Public statement on on the topics princess chat logs are not encrypted

88
00:03:57,056 --> 00:04:00,128
Okay so they couldn't hear your children but they could see what they were typing

89
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:03,456
That's correct no credit card information

90
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:09,344
Social Security numbers or any or driver's license numbers of parent that's not part of the profiles

91
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,904
So I mean it's just

92
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,256
Some identity information and a lot of it obviously is

93
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:18,559
Mimosa is is children

94
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,119
And so

95
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,143
Again

96
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:25,215
I'll say it as a parent your fear here isn't

97
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,519
Is it a visceral fear of your kids

98
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,287
Picture

99
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,847
Interstate is like

100
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,895
It is kind of like a like a

101
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:33,919
One-Stop shopping

102
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,967
Pedophiles is basically

103
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,783
Skip that that's that's worst case I totally agree

104
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:39,807
So

105
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,343
It reality

106
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:46,975
This is probably more inflammatory because you know again that that root beer is pretty bad is

107
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:50,047
The parent you're like oh my gosh you know you're never supposed to put your

108
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:56,447
Kids picture online we do it all the time you know if if I'm looking at someone's Facebook page I could probably figure out where they live they got

109
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,983
Their kids picture up there

110
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:00,031
You know is it that hard

111
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,847
If I really wanted to get that in

112
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:03,615
Information prop

113
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:09,503
It would be worse obviously if it was a true hack to get and either

114
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,807
Salwar

115
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:12,575
Give out

116
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:15,135
Information but that hacker did not do that this was a

117
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:18,207
A test of his abilities and their seeking VTech security

118
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:21,023
So from that perspective it it's it's a little

119
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,303
Better than it could have been

120
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:24,351
I'm surprised the hacker didn't

121
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:28,703
I should say this way I'm surprised VTech didn't find out from the hacker

122
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:31,775
That's what I would have preferred to see happen in this situation

123
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:35,359
However when asked what have you checked on that about the Bridget said they

124
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,895
That they received an email

125
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:40,735
From a Canadian journalist asking about the incident on November 23rd

126
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:43,039
So they found out not from the hacker

127
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,063
Yeah

128
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,087
So

129
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,647
It's been all around I mean it's

130
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:50,719
There's nothing good here and

131
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:58,143
There is going to be something good, and that is there going to be f***** there are protocols on how they handle

132
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:58,911
The state

133
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:01,215
So going forward you would hope that

134
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:03,007
The odds of this happening again are far less

135
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:05,823
So if there's a silver lining that's what it is

136
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:06,591
Maybe

137
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:10,175
Yes I mean that is the Silver Lining it also I think

138
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:12,735
Guitar necks point which is

139
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:13,759
Yikes

140
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:17,087
A lot of stuff that we have right now

141
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,367
Redis connected

142
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,183
Why the information companies are asking for

143
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,231
We really should

144
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:24,767
Be asking to them

145
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:27,327
Do they need this and how are they storing

146
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,631
And I think the fact that this is

147
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,423
Information about children

148
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:34,239
Which right now under our laws are

149
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:37,567
Kind of a protected class in a way because of the

150
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:38,847
Additional

151
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,895
I always forget the name of this law

152
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:41,919
BMI

153
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:46,527
Digital Millennium Information Act maybe Digital Millennium Copyright Act

154
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:47,295
Okay

155
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,111
It's an act

156
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:54,463
It's always Lucy

157
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,231
However

158
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,255
Basically

159
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,023
Say that

160
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,583
You can't collect information about

161
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:02,143
Kids under the age of 13

162
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:05,471
I'm getting you can advertise to them rather is kind of

163
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:07,775
The actual link are the

164
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,823
Issues at stake here

165
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,359
VTech obviously wasn't

166
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,407
Advertising to these children

167
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:16,479
It you can actually collect information about them

168
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,247
But

169
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,575
The fact that it puts this data at risk like that

170
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,111
And puts his children at risk

171
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,903
Kind of all kinds of things

172
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,695
Nobody in Congress is

173
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:29,535
Is going to be thrilled about this which means the FTC is probably going to be like

174
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,583
Oh hellos VTech

175
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,631
What is talk about your data storage racks

176
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,935
Perhaps well

177
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:36,959
Step Up

178
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:41,823
Yeah and if I'm not mistaken VTech is based in Hong Kong

179
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,895
Yeah but if you want to sell your product

180
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:47,199
In the United States

181
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:47,967
Yeah

182
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:48,991
Totally agree

183
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,599
So hand you know as you can see in the list of where these

184
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,879
Accounts were

185
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:57,183
The US has a rather large Market

186
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,463
4

187
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,231
PTAC

188
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:04,351
Based on the fact that 2.2 million of the parent accounts are here in two point

189
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:07,167
Yeah almost 50% of the parent accounts

190
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,959
We're from the US

191
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,311
Sidebar

192
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:17,407
Third to a half of the child profiles were from the USA value

193
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,431
So

194
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,735
Yeah

195
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:27,903
Also so that that's our hope is maybe maybe now Will get less of a hands-off laissez-faire approach to

196
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:28,927
How

197
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,207
Not only just

198
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:33,791
Giving us lip service to privacy around their data in

199
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,327
Companies needing to

200
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,631
Be kind of car does it have this but actually

201
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,983
Okay maybe we need to start setting some baseline standards about

202
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:47,615
How did he needs to be stored and it may be that VTEC would be following those minimum standards but

203
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,151
Hey let's get them in place

204
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,967
You know I I wonder though if it's

205
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:56,575
If companies have put standards in place but having evolved them with the times

206
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,623
I think right now

207
00:08:59,135 --> 00:08:59,903
We should

208
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,951
Set some standards

209
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:06,559
And I'd like to see outcome be standards as opposed to just like

210
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:12,959
Thou shalt store your databases are passwords and hashed insulted her with his hashed insult

211
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:14,495
How to databases

212
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:17,311
Ouch ouch

213
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,335
You know

214
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:22,431
Maintain and then I guess this is this is kind of one of those things

215
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,247
Top Shop perform audits on your database

216
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,015
Udo

217
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,551
Password

218
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:29,855
Where you store your passwords

219
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,927
You know every 6 months and you don't

220
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,207
Make sure that

221
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:37,535
A hacker with this level of skill Kant

222
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:41,375
You know spending X number of hours on it can't get past it

223
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,423
Maybe that's a way to think about it

224
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,447
So

225
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:47,007
Much more outcome is opposed to prescriptive

226
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,311
Because that feels like

227
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:54,943
It may be a wiser way to deal with security especially since things just Arkansas

228
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,735
Circling to continually evolve

229
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:59,039
Yeah that the trick is that

230
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:03,903
Security was always important it's just now it's important for far more

231
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,183
Devices

232
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:09,023
And industries then it was say you can just five or 10 years ago

233
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:12,607
Every every industry is now impacted by

234
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:15,423
Data or big data and therefore leads to

235
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,215
Have security measures in place

236
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:18,751
Yeah and maybe

237
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,543
Maybe there's a

238
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:23,359
The way that we should be thinking about you know

239
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:24,895
Baby

240
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:27,455
Not every company needs to handle their own security

241
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,759
Maybe there should be

242
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,039
Escrow I mean

243
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:37,183
In a way that's kind of one of the services that a lot of the big cloud providers offer is they store your data for you

244
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,975
And some of them are

245
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:40,511
Better at it than others

246
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:45,631
I don't know I mean that kind of creates a booming industry for like an IBM Iran AWS

247
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:48,447
And then you get into who's watching the Watchers

248
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:50,751
It's it's there's no easy answer

249
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,287
There isn't

250
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:58,687
But being able to shrug your shoulders and say that's a hard problem I'm not going to deal with that I was going to offer kids a connected to

251
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,479
Glitter I'm just going to offer

252
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:05,343
A you know connected cooking stove that's going to pull up a bunch of data that

253
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:08,927
We may want some day doesn't seem to be the right thing to do

254
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,207
Here

255
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,231
Hagrid

256
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:11,999
Angry

257
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,791
We can't just walk away because

258
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:14,559
It's hard

259
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:16,863
So speaking of security

260
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:17,631
Or

261
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:21,983
Practices that maybe we should think about might not be the best

262
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:28,383
We saw the sea who was it who published this survey

263
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,151
That is

264
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,455
OLCC consult

265
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:34,015
Yes SEC consult

266
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:38,111
This this was worth mentioning it was a

267
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:42,463
Is a survey that was published on Wednesday right before Thanksgiving

268
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:44,511
Not the greatest I mean I got to say but

269
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:47,327
You know I picked it up and I'm glad they did

270
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,607
Because

271
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:49,887
These guys

272
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:52,447
Analyzed firmware from more than

273
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:54,495
4000 embedded devices

274
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,775
From 70 vendors

275
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,567
And it looked at them and they said

276
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:59,615
Holy cow these devices

277
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:02,431
Use a remarkably similar number of

278
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:06,271
SSH host keys because they're all using the same

279
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,551
Software

280
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:10,367
Development kits from these vendors

281
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,159
Time in Saudi

282
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:15,999
This is akin to basically what would it be like Kevin

283
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:21,119
Do you like yeah you know out of a hundred of us 50 of us are using the same password and

284
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,655
We all know what that password is

285
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:24,191
Exactly

286
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,543
How did you know that I use that

287
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,335
Oh Manuel

288
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,871
Just tell her 50 closest friend

289
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:34,175
What are the odds

290
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:40,575
So basically we're all using password which would be great if everyone's as trustworthy is Kevin and I that you know

291
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:45,951
Sometimes we have friends who aren't as trustworthy and they might use password and since they know we use password

292
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:48,511
They're just going to pop on in and be like

293
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:55,167
Hey I bet Kevin and Stacey are also using password and I really want access to their device let me see if they're using it to

294
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:04,383
You never talked about this a little bit before the show even started and we're trying to figure out why this situation actually exists and I think you hit a

295
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,407
On the key point

296
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:11,295
Cuz I thought was it a technical issue how difficult is it to generate a different key or whatever

297
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:14,623
And you said no it's probably pretty easy and it's

298
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,415
Got kind of a matter of laziness

299
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:23,071
It is not laziness out of maliciousness no no no it's just laziness because up until now you've

300
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:25,375
Never really had to think about this before because

301
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:29,727
You know who's really mucking around with SDK on some random sensor

302
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:32,543
Connected dog collar right and that's

303
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:35,871
You know these things have been used in like these weird and better

304
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:40,735
Projects for a while but now that they're getting an stuck in like consumer devices

305
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,807
Is there becoming kind of interesting

306
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:44,575
Targets

307
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:46,367
We may not even be that attractive

308
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:50,975
Honestly but when you're like it Blackadder doing something you know they're they're certainly like

309
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,511
Celebratory targets

310
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:54,559
I just acted toilet

311
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:56,095
So

312
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:58,911
I think what happened is suddenly people in like

313
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:03,007
Oh shoot now I got to close the back door

314
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,031
Yep

315
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:10,687
So that's what this is and we'll put the link to the survey for people who want to you know I don't know security people like to see

316
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,223
The stuff they like to argue with it

317
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:17,343
Whether there's a lot of good day to here and in particular I was looking at the vendors and products that were affected

318
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:21,183
They said they were more than 900 products from 50 vendors to be vulnerable

319
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:25,023
Based on just their limited survey and there are big names in this list

320
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:28,351
Oh yeah I'm going to go pick 3

321
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,655
What do you want

322
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:33,727
Take 5 I don't I don't care there's MN

323
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:36,543
People will know these names this is not you know

324
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:37,823
Small companies

325
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:41,663
Okay so these are I mean these are the CD link

326
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,431
Netgear

327
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,223
Western Digital

328
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:44,991
Cisco

329
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,527
Ride time

330
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,551
GE

331
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:48,575
Phillips

332
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:50,111
Motorola

333
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,391
Pirelli they make tires

334
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:56,511
Maybe the tire sensors the air pressure sensors or something I don't know

335
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,887
Sierra Wireless Seagate

336
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,679
Yeah Ubiquiti Network

337
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:10,335
Oh yeah it's nothing against these companies that's not why I brought this up I'm just wanted people to understand the

338
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,615
Breadth and scope of

339
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:16,223
Of what in a way this problem actually is it's it's pretty widespread

340
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:18,527
I mean these are yet these are not

341
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,575
Do not these are not kickstarter's

342
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:23,391
These are yeah and these are in this is not by any

343
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:26,463
This is not by any stretch of the imagination like a

344
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:32,607
Idea here is there using things like broadcom's sdks and there

345
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:34,911
You know they're basically just

346
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:38,495
Using the keys that came with it and there's no stopping that code and they're like

347
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,799
Now it's Anarchy no

348
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:41,567
Because

349
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,639
Because they've always done it and I've haven't had to think about it

350
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,943
They could get away with it before but

351
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:50,271
Given the way that iot the outer market and

352
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:55,903
Mainstream consumers getting into smart devices you can't get away with that anymore

353
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:56,927
Yasso

354
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:59,487
So this is this is pretty cool

355
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:01,279
Cool in the sense that like

356
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:02,559
Yikes

357
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:06,655
And cool that this research is out there and has been done so

358
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:09,983
I'm going to encourage you guys if you're interested in it take a look at it

359
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,799
A scary but also

360
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:19,199
We're looking at got to be informed and this is this is the first step to actually doing something about it so

361
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:21,247
Let's make it happen

362
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:24,319
So that was the scary part of our podcast

363
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:27,647
Let's move on to something exciting times happy times

364
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:30,719
Let's talk about should we talk about

365
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:33,535
The latest Pi zero or should we talk about making

366
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,559
Christmas

367
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:35,839
Iot enabled

368
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:38,655
Let's go with the pi zero because

369
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:43,519
You know this is a time where everything is low-cost cuz it's on sale for the holidays

370
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:48,639
But this is low-cost all the time five bucks it's brand new

371
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:51,711
On Thanksgiving here in the US Senate

372
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:53,759
Not on Thanksgiving in the UK

373
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:57,599
The Raspberry Pi Foundation launched the pi zero which is a

374
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:59,135
Chip chip chip

375
00:16:59,391 --> 00:16:59,903
Bored

376
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:02,463
Containing a 1 gigahertz arm

377
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,999
11 processor

378
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:06,047
It's got an SD card and

379
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:11,167
I'm not going to go too much into this because our guest today is Eben Upton

380
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:15,263
Who is the creator of the Raspberry Pi and we're going to talk a lot about it

381
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:18,335
I'm it's a shame Kevin wasn't here for this because he in

382
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:20,127
Get Evan could have had a great time

383
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:20,895
So

384
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:27,295
Stay tuned podcast because Evan is going to talk to us about like what you can use it for how it differs from like the other pies

385
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,599
Why cheap

386
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:35,743
Besides being cheap yes we talked about it and we can talk about that earlier if we actually get kind of crazy detailed so

387
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:38,815
Yeah we talked about pin counts manso

388
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,607
Those who don't care about pin count

389
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:41,631
Just bare with us

390
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:45,471
Yeah you know it's what's crazy about this $5

391
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:47,007
Card sized computer

392
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:50,079
They're saying it's half the size of the model A+ What would

393
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,359
Twice the utility

394
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,383
They didn't just

395
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,919
Take all the components in

396
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:58,271
You know downsizing Alex still has 1080p 60 frames per second

397
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:00,063
HDMI out for example

398
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:03,391
I literally am thinking about getting one to turn into a home media server

399
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,927
Current for streaming online content

400
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:06,463
So you can't get one now.

401
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:10,815
Because I know it's sold out there only making $10,000 a week

402
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:14,655
So you may have to wait a little bit don't call anybody just just wait

403
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:18,751
But in the meantime you can maybe order the the chip

404
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:22,335
Which is a $9 computer that also went on sale on Cyber Monday

405
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:26,175
Which was November 28th November 30th

406
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:28,223
I mean that's for the next thing Co

407
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:28,991
And that

408
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:31,551
Also I believe has

409
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:33,855
A 1 gigahertz processor

410
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:35,903
I don't know it's

411
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:36,927
Scrap Escape

412
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,207
Abilities

413
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,231
But

414
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:40,255
Also cheap

415
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:46,911
Skip pretty cool. Great for tanker and little computer projects learning teaching kids program

416
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,703
Learning how to use Linux I mean

417
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:51,263
There's so many things you can do with a Raspberry Pi

418
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:52,287
There are

419
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,567
And will will

420
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:54,591
We'll come back to that

421
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:56,383
Later on in the show

422
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,407
But

423
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,199
Moving right along

424
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,223
Yes

425
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:01,503
Because we have to

426
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,319
Let's talk about Christmas

427
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:07,647
Because you guys might be getting your holiday decorations out

428
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:08,927
And I have some

429
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:10,719
Some ideas and thoughts for you

430
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:11,999
So

431
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:14,815
If you were listening to the show last year around this time

432
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:18,655
Have you may have heard that I bought a pair of connected lights

433
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:21,471
These were the itwinkle lights from GE

434
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,263
And I have to tell you

435
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:27,103
But I brought him out again they still work after

436
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,383
A year in

437
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:32,479
And I brought him out actually for two holidays cuz you can turn the lights a bunch of different colors

438
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:36,319
I'm still in the market for a slightly better connected light

439
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,623
These are bluetooth-connected so

440
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:41,439
In actually the updates to that make them better

441
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:44,511
So they can connect both to the IOS and Android phone

442
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:46,559
And they play music

443
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:48,351
Free connected pair of

444
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:54,751
Lights the cost about 50 bucks I think they're on sale at Home Depot so it was it's 25 lights

445
00:19:55,007 --> 00:20:00,639
Teaching yoga to strands of 25 lights their huge ginormous Globes you can also buy

446
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:03,455
Smaller versions of these for your tree

447
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:07,295
I would like for them to be a little bit more customizable

448
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:12,671
But basically I can't get the lights to do much of anything except be all one color

449
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:15,487
Unless I'm also playing music which my neighbors

450
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:16,255
Would kill me if

451
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,047
Yeah

452
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,351
That's the downside of

453
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,119
Desperate

454
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,143
Particular brand of light

455
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:26,239
If the Philips light strips work outdoors I wouldn't get those at heart

456
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:29,567
If they look nice we've all actually has a

457
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:31,103
Set of outdoor light strip

458
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:33,151
Outdoor lights

459
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:36,479
Think might be colored

460
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:40,063
I'm going to try to get some of those and see what

461
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,087
How they work

462
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:46,463
I'm a little funeral Erie of the WeMo software experience but it is Christmas

463
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:48,511
I wish that I was thinking the

464
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:49,279
WeMo

465
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:53,375
Switch my work outside is probably not the weather resistant unfortunately

466
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:59,007
Old standby policy Jasco Z-Wave

467
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:02,591
Sorry it's the GE Jasco

468
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:08,735
Z-Wave outdoor switch it is connected to my SmartThings Hub you could also

469
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,015
Dear wingcup

470
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:13,855
It is pricey I think it's about 40 bucks right now

471
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:20,000
Hot Home Depot you're going to pay more for something that's weather resistant no that's fine I have four of them

472
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:21,280
Those guys

473
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:25,120
I know I buy I buy more every year cuz my my light show at

474
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,144
And every year

475
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:27,680
But this year

476
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:31,008
New new tweak on that old design

477
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,568
Because I got it blows on SmartThings

478
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:34,848
Or you could do it on me

479
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,200
You can group them under a setting on your Amazon Echo

480
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:42,784
Now if I say to she who shall not be named

481
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,320
Christmas

482
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:46,112
Turn Christmas on

483
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:46,880
Boom

484
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:48,416
Are you outside lights are on

485
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,952
All might well actually I

486
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:50,720
Put it up into

487
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:53,536
Show all Christmas comes on

488
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:55,072
What's a scene

489
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:56,352
It's ass eating baby

490
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:59,424
Wow it's pretty freaking awesome

491
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,192
Nice

492
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:05,312
It is nice and if I could actually get my Sonos has to reliably work

493
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:07,104
Actually make it so late

494
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:08,384
Music

495
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:11,712
Which kind of amazing

496
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:17,600
You have to give tours of your helmet that point Christmas tours

497
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,184
Yeah but just the whole voice command thing the kids would love it

498
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:23,744
Music on the lights go on

499
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,536
Oh yeah

500
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:26,304
Dance

501
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:31,424
I did see in the Wall Street Journal Gregory Fowler they're kind of personal device columnist

502
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,960
Yep has a

503
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:36,288
He actually used some little bits to make ornaments for his tree

504
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,312
Smart

505
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:39,104
So I'm actually going to

506
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:44,480
Can I see how that works out for us because I hadn't thought of that and I thought that was a really light up ornaments

507
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:46,016
Pretty slick idea yeah

508
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,552
Yes yes very nice

509
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,136
So that's what I'm going to try out I'm going to try out some

510
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:53,440
See if I can't score some

511
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,976
Different outdoor lights

512
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:57,024
If you're if you're in the market for him

513
00:22:57,536 --> 00:23:00,608
See if you can't find the I twinkle lights on sale they're pretty good

514
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,728
Of all the ones that are out there

515
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,080
They were the best we tried another brand I can't remember right now and

516
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:12,640
Last year

517
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:15,968
I'm surprised actually that the lighting technology has knotted

518
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:18,784
Willits

519
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:24,928
It's not cheap for one thing and I think with the lighting companies are doing is focusing on

520
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:28,256
Lowest paying for most bang for buck and that's indoors

521
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,792
You know traditional lighting

522
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,072
Christmas

523
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:33,632
People spend a lot of money on Christmas

524
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:39,520
People spend $60 on their pets but they're not putting lights on them so I don't know about that I think

525
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:41,568
They're spending the money where they

526
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:42,592
See the biggest thing

527
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:47,712
You could do

528
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:48,480
Youku

529
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:49,504
Holiday poop

530
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:52,832
All right I think you bought something cool you want to talk about it

531
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,160
I do want to talk about it but I can't talk about it because

532
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:57,952
Much because I don't have it yet

533
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:02,816
Don't know I don't know I want to share the news at least

534
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:04,096
The news is

535
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:04,864
That

536
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,632
And this is

537
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:08,192
Not all this is brand new news

538
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:12,544
Back when Amazon came out with this new Fire TV which I think was September

539
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,592
It said that it didn't work with

540
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:16,384
The Amazon Echo

541
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:18,944
And it did but now

542
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,808
And I can't give you the exact date because Amazon doesn't updated support pages with dates

543
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:29,952
But this week I saw that the Fire TV now works with the echo specifically to control Smart devices

544
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:31,744
So you know what

545
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:33,792
$25 off with this

546
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:38,144
Cyber Monday deal I ordered a Fire TV actually needed a streaming stick anyway

547
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:40,960
I order Fire TV with the voice remote

548
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:41,984
And the voice remote

549
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:42,752
Will be

550
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:45,056
I'll be able to control things around my house

551
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:47,616
Through the Fire TV remote to the echo

552
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:48,896
A very roundabout way

553
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:52,224
But that's a good thing because we only have the one Echo and it's

554
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,528
Second floor of our house my home office

555
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:57,088
Where is mostly watch TV downstairs

556
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:58,624
So

557
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,160
For watching TV on the

558
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:02,720
Fire TV we can still turn off lights

559
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:06,816
You can still get information from Alexa and actually I don't know if you knew this station

560
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:11,168
The information pops up on the screen almost on like like giant cards

561
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:13,472
So if you want to Wikipedia entry

562
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:15,264
Our traffic or weather

563
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,848
It'll actually visit visually show that on firetv I did not know that

564
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:24,736
Oh man I wish I had known that cuz I would have gotten the Fire TV cuz it was on sale for Black Friday

565
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:26,528
That's what it was

566
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:30,880
Cyber Monday 2 and might still be on sale I don't know how much did you buy it for

567
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:33,184
$75 of the voice remote

568
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:37,280
Okay

569
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,048
Well

570
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:45,216
He was it's okay it's interesting thing the voice remote looks like the same voice remote you use for an Echo

571
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:52,128
They just pictures Bluetooth. I suspected the Fire TV and it looks like the identical products and maybe didn't even need to buy The Voice remote

572
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:54,432
How much is it without the voice real

573
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:56,736
We can just get a Fire TV stick

574
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:59,808
First low well over the holidays it was $25

575
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,344
That does the same thing

576
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:02,624
The same thing as my Chrome

577
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:06,208
Basically yeah yeah if you have a

578
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:10,560
A voice remote for your Echo you could probably Bluetooth connected to the

579
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:13,120
TV stick and use that in lieu of

580
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:14,656
Chemically speaking to the echo

581
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:15,680
I do have

582
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:16,960
Voice remote for the echo

583
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:18,240
We could see if they work together

584
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:22,080
It's 3999 for TV stick now

585
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:25,408
Papa

586
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:28,224
Killer all the sea in the cards up cuz

587
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,016
One of the things we actually do

588
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:32,320
With the echo is my daughter

589
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:35,392
Isn't a Spanish Immersion program in so

590
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:40,512
We ask the echo what something is in Spanish and she sends the translation

591
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:41,792
To the cards

592
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:44,352
But it would be kind of neat

593
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:49,216
To send it to the TV instead of to my phone cuz then what happens is my daughter takes my phone

594
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:53,056
Well the full price Fire TV is 99

595
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:55,616
With a voice remote the Fire TV stick

596
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:57,408
Does not come with a voice remote

597
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:59,456
It's $40

598
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:02,784
But you could probably use your existing is my guess

599
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:04,576
Well

600
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:09,184
It's something to think about maybe maybe I'll just wait for the Fire TV stick to go on sale again

601
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:09,952
Hey go

602
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:10,720
All right

603
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:11,744
Will awesome

604
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,328
Let us not take much more time on our section of the show because

605
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,168
I want us to get to heaven so he can talk to us more about

606
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:20,448
The pi zero

607
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:23,520
And he's also going to give us some advice which

608
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:25,824
I want to spoil it for you guys but

609
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:27,616
I'd inspire me

610
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:30,432
Actually fulfill my New Year's resolution from

611
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:31,456
This last year

612
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:33,248
And it was

613
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:39,904
But if I told you it would say would tell you was the advice so you're at your

614
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:40,928
So stay tuned

615
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:47,328
We are fat

616
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:50,144
Did the holiday break with an awesome guest

617
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:50,912
This is

618
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:52,448
Evan Upton

619
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,472
Who is

620
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:54,752
Oh gosh

621
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:57,568
I don't know the head of the Raspberry Pi Foundation

622
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:59,360
Make a little generic here because

623
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:02,432
What is your actual title

624
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:09,344
And so I'm one of the founders of the foundation and I'm currently the chief executive of Ralphie Pike Trading

625
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,952
Which is the for the foundations of Charity and it has a

626
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:16,256
Have a surgery

627
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:18,304
Restart the engineering and marketing

628
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:20,864
Got it

629
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:21,632
Okay

630
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:22,912
So you know

631
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:26,240
It's a longer arm so maybe then then you will look

632
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:27,520
New

633
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:28,800
The most accurate

634
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:31,360
I'm always looking for the most accurate and

635
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:32,384
That's what we want

636
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:36,224
Alright so you guys had big news on on Thanksgiving day here

637
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:38,016
In America and

638
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,808
November

639
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:43,392
26 / the UK you guys released the

640
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:44,416
Pi zero

641
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:45,952
Tell us about the

642
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:47,744
$5 Pi zero

643
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:51,584
Let's let me think

644
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,376
0 is

645
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:54,144
Cheapest

646
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,728
Raspberry Pi tonight so when we been around for about

647
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:58,496
3 + 1/2

648
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:02,848
We kind of kicked off with this $25 the idea building

649
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:06,176
$25

650
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:09,248
Answer most of our existence we had a

651
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:12,576
2520 $25 entry level product

652
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:14,880
$35 Deluxe products

653
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:21,280
Product ads

654
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:23,072
Reasonable person

655
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:27,424
I'm sorry I should

656
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:31,008
For people who don't know what the pie is it's a linux-based computer

657
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:34,592
Kevin actually has one and he uses it to run a

658
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:40,992
Actually runs a server off of his router that I think he uses a printer or some sort of thing in his house

659
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:42,528
But you can use this to do

660
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:44,832
Any number of things you can

661
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:48,416
I actually had one for a while and I didn't use it for much

662
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,488
Cuz I'm more of a nerd

663
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:57,888
Shame on me no I have a

664
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:06,336
You can now if it is telling us what the pi zero is I just want to people

665
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:08,640
Delicious

666
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:17,344
Can we build a little credit card-sized computer that cost about 25 bucks

667
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:20,160
About the same amount you

668
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:21,696
Tie for a school textbook

669
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:23,488
Can we make a

670
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:27,584
Can we make a little PC for kids a little program located kids

671
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,864
They cost

672
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:33,472
I'm so weeping we three and a half years now we've been selling

673
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:35,264
Several iterations of

674
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,288
This product

675
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:40,896
Priceless

676
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:43,456
It's going really well we sold

677
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:45,760
787 million

678
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:46,784
Open now

679
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:55,232
Please do all cells only one week we go to the $25

680
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:57,024
And prosper

681
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:02,912
But that we still keep meeting people

682
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:04,960
So who who say things like

683
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:08,032
Yeah you know I'm interested in getting in

684
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:10,848
Getting involved in in Computing and programming

685
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:15,200
I'm Point taking the plunge

686
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:17,248
It's

687
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:18,784
It becomes apparent to us

688
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:20,576
Reno

689
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:22,624
$25 35

690
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:26,464
It's a significant amount of money is enough money

691
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,744
You might choose not to spend

692
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,512
Michuzi

693
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,328
So over the Lost year what week

694
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:39,008
Trying to figure out how we can make something for people who care about this sort of thing this is a 1 gigahertz

695
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,032
Processor with

696
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,848
512 megabytes of RAM

697
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:44,384
Right now

698
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:47,968
You got to warm get pressure ulcer

699
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:54,624
Why buy anything but the stamps in the last 5 or 10 years

700
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:03,584
This was 2000

701
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,632
Pomsky

702
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:07,168
Norcross replies always be

703
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:08,448
About delivering a doll

704
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,472
Performance

705
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:10,496
Delivering

706
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:14,592
What's the performance of wood if you would have seen in a PC

707
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:19,456
Take you out level performance they would have cost you hundreds of dollars

708
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:21,504
I've been delivering that app swell

709
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,648
Well if I'm a kid can I can I use this to play Minecraft on

710
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:30,464
Yes

711
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,280
Disappointment a special version of Minecraft

712
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,352
That the pi zero

713
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:38,656
Yes

714
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:41,216
OKC that's

715
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:43,264
Casino as it as a child

716
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,288
I feel like that is like

717
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,592
The number one thing that

718
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:47,872
Scratch

719
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:49,152
Minecraft

720
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:52,992
I don't know if they're like a trifecta of programs that you think about when you're doing this

721
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:55,552
Minecraft

722
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:59,648
Poison gases

723
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:01,184
Estelle Parsons

724
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:04,256
So I kind of utility stuff a web browser

725
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:10,400
You know it's important if it's not a computer if it doesn't have web browser I think he's probably fat

Applications

755
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:03,040
We'll wait because this doesn't have I don't see room for battery

756
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:04,832
How am I going to get power to this thing

757
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:09,184
Okay so that you can either pirated house

00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:17,376
Tsp

761
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:19,168
Cedar Point

762
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:20,960
Go plug it into the wall

Intuit

764
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:25,568
If you want a parrot

765
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:27,616
Fabrics

766
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,504
I'm popular gif

767
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:42,976
All right so I brought you in this is

768
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:45,536
This is a tiny tiny little thing

769
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,328
Bunty

770
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:48,608
I'm terrible it

771
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:50,912
I'm terrible at

772
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:51,680
Thinking

773
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:56,032
We don't like me a few original music credit card

774
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:02,432
Comic books

775
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:04,480
All right

776
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:05,248
So

777
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:06,272
So I've got this

778
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:07,040
Spend

779
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:07,808
You know

780
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:09,344
You're on the iot show

781
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:12,672
And I'm having you here even though this is not fundamentally

782
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:19,328
INE time I see cool cheap Computing devices and you know the pie Community is

783
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,608
Amazing

784
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:24,448
I mean people people build supercomputers with the sayings they're just a bunch

785
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:29,312
I love them through the nuttiest people in the face of the planet and they talked about what they're doing and they're really helpful

786
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:30,592
So

787
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,384
What do you think

788
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:36,224
For the people out there who are listening in her like I want to build with this is

789
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,528
Cheap and finding I can blow stuff up

790
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:41,344
Because I feel like that's kind of our listeners mindset sometime

791
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:45,184
Benign

792
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,048
Like I say

793
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:52,864
If you want to do iot tub stopper

794
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,656
What are you going to need to plug some soul

795
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,704
Radio

796
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:04,128
Body so I would probably plug a

797
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:11,296
Attwifi

798
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:14,368
So I would be inclined to plug that into my single USB

799
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:25,376
An Eddy Max

800
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:27,680
USB Wi-Fi dongle

801
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:28,960
Take it out of its case

802
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:30,496
I've wrapped it up in concert

803
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:32,800
I've been sold an adult in the back

804
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,128
The pants only

805
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:37,664
Disemboweled

806
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,968
IUSB

807
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:42,784
Wi-Fi adapter

808
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:46,624
Update on the Eric

809
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:52,000
Slightly

810
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:57,888
Not waived in Wi-Fi

811
00:37:58,144 --> 00:37:58,656
I just got

812
00:37:58,912 --> 00:37:59,680
You're not going to come up with

813
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:03,008
So why of getting Wi-Fi conceivably Bluetooth

814
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,568
I'm on to that and that's going to be there

815
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:09,408
Yeah cuz I feel like I've got like a $15 Bluetooth

816
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,712
Kind of radio that's just a straight-up

817
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:15,040
E90 little Bluetooth radio size of like maybe

818
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:18,368
I mean it's like a little like a nickel

819
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,160
So if I stuck this with the

820
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:21,184
Computer

821
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:27,584
That I could actually make some of my presents that I can give my presence detectors a little bit more intelligence that I've been kind of blue

822
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,352
Looking for

823
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:29,888
Outside of the

824
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:30,656
Proprietary

825
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:35,776
So that

826
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,336
This wonderful thing about usb

827
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:41,664
You know USPS is going to lowest common denominator

828
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,456
Stand up for collecting stuff together

829
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:44,736
If you go on

830
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:46,272
If you go on eBay

831
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:48,064
Amazon

832
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:50,880
You'll find

833
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:56,512
Really really really really cheap wireless USB dongle for every conceivable Wallace

834
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:59,584
That's why we picked

835
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:01,632
The wife

836
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,752
Because it just means you just got buy things for a dollar

837
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:09,056
And it'll give you some kind of right here

838
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:13,152
Which is providing the brights

839
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:15,968
I think we can run Linux

840
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,272
I'm a man

841
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:24,928
So the people that want to use it for a little hunger it peyote project

842
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:29,792
Mango salsa

843
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:31,328
Effectively the weekend

844
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:35,168
Okay and how long it take for a power consumption perspective

845
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:36,704
What am I looking at

846
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,752
At the power consumption for this board

847
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:41,312
And can you talk to me in terms of like battery life

848
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:42,848
As opposed to

849
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:47,456
So ya like it well

850
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:49,248
Starting off from the vault

851
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:53,344
Outside the thing drawers

852
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:57,696
Something like that

853
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:00,256
It's something like

854
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:03,328
Between 150 million

855
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:12,288
Actually

856
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:18,688
USB device compatibility

857
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:20,736
G303 vs Rey

858
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:24,064
It sits on the

859
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,088
You're without doing any

860
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:26,880
It's

861
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:27,648
Under Hawthorne

862
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:30,720
Consumption

863
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:31,488
Keep this thing

864
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,072
Just running for a very nice on seeing the bowl light

865
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,056
You know 45 hours

866
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:51,712
Something like that particular lady

867
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:55,296
You know it really yeah

868
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:56,320
It'll keep going

869
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:59,136
I need you prepared to do

870
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:00,416
Clock speed

871
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:06,816
I stopped turning things off on the on the CPU on the device you can probably squeeze another older my vagine out of them

872
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:07,840
All right

873
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:10,656
So maybe I should look for someone to start squeezing

874
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:13,472
But doing the work for me cuz I am not

875
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:15,264
I'm not that kind of engineer

876
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,800
To like start turning things off of this

877
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:20,384
Pretty good about about the pie Community mentioned

878
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,016
Is that generally Google is your friend not right so

879
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:27,552
If you want if you want to

880
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:31,136
Squeeze the packets of Julep I download

881
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:32,928
I would guess the doodling

882
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:39,840
I want to reduce the packets option of my Raspberry Pi Bolton turn off $100 goals

883
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,496
A people who done these things already

884
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:50,080
People being that before you know Blaziken trial

885
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:51,360
United States

886
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:53,151
The stuff's going to work

887
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:55,199
How do you confirm we're here

888
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:56,991
Okay

889
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:58,015
This is awesome

890
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:59,807
So let's talk a little bit about

891
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:01,343
How did you

892
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:03,391
I read somewhere that

893
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:05,695
I believe was it

894
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:09,791
Did Eric Schmidt tell you to actually

895
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:12,863
Yeah yeah this is business advice from Eric

896
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:15,935
This is one of these this is one of these really weird,

897
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:24,895
But you know you see them

898
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:26,687
You seem to be very effective

899
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:29,503
And

900
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:33,087
Can be hard to tell when someone is effective because they

901
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:34,367
Fact beaker's lab

902
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:37,695
Over there if I could because I would like it

903
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:43,327
But I have it I decide to Charleston beach

00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:06,111
I'll stay

914
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:07,647
Bealls me what are you doing

915
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:12,767
A bit more expensive

916
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:16,095
And he told me I was an idiot

917
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:19,167
That was absolutely the wrong thing to do and that I should try be cheap

918
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:20,703
But

919
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:24,287
That I should try to strive to find ways to make

920
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:26,079
The product

921
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:27,615
Closer to free

922
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:33,247
And so I went back to the end because

923
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:37,855
Because

924
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:39,135
Cheapness

925
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:40,415
Leads the volume

926
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:43,487
Volume leads to

927
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:45,279
Ubiquiti

928
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:46,815
Lately

929
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:51,935
So I went back to the office and I cancelled

930
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:54,239
Making more expensive

931
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:01,407
If we did all this

932
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:02,175
Eventually

933
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:10,111
If we take it late

934
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:11,647
Good morning Spencer

935
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:15,743
What we did was this

936
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:18,559
Tie-dye longer harder route

937
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:27,775
CrossPointe

938
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:31,359
Yellow

939
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:33,663
I was just thinking about how do we take

940
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:36,223
Speech about you know how do we make something cheaper

941
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:37,247
Halloween

942
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:40,319
You're welcome or you're welcome you remove from the pile

943
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:41,855
What compromises

944
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:48,511
Did to be cheaper the first fruits of that was his toward this reduction of all entry level price point from 25 to 20

945
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:49,279
You lost yet

946
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:54,143
Ultimate consequence of this

947
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:56,959
Nice all right

948
00:44:57,215 --> 00:45:02,335
I've answered an interesting question which is there is Eric Schmidt small lucky

949
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:08,735
There is a 12 we'll see I mean so far you sold out

950
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:11,039
When can we expect

951
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:11,807
To be able to buy more

952
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:13,855
I'm so we made

953
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:16,159
Mm so the first post

954
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:19,231
Lawrence Municipal Dynamite couple thousand today

955
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:22,303
I would expect

956
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:24,863
These will make their way into channel in the neck

957
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:26,655
She dies

958
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:32,031
We actually need to

959
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:34,335
Front of a magazine

960
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:37,663
So we have our own magazine called the magpie

961
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:40,479
I'm we put on the front cover

962
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:46,879
We have some

963
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:47,647
You get up

964
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:49,183
You got free

965
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:51,743
La Frontera

966
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:58,399
And the rest will get put into reverse distribution channels in the UK in the US

967
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:04,031
Ten Thousand Fists

968
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:07,615
Which is actually quite slow for us

969
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:10,175
I mean in terms of the big product

970
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:11,711
Weebill

971
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:14,783
What would it be it would be

972
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:16,575
60 of 70000

973
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:20,159
Aquatis bowls calibration first of the month

974
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:22,719
Hard to wrap it up

975
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:25,791
Got it

976
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:28,351
All right and then in the spirit of a

977
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,143
In the spirit of Schmidt

978
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:34,239
What would your advice be to people who are listening and

979
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:35,263
Thinking about

980
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:40,895
Building their own product or even learning learning to code I mean there's lots of people

981
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:42,175
Who look up to you

982
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:44,479
Ucumberlands

983
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:49,087
You come across people who have

984
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:51,391
Like an idea you get these people who

985
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:57,791
I just need to find

986
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:00,607
I'm am

987
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:03,423
That's iron

988
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:09,567
You going to have a technical

Albertsons

990
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:18,271
This is probably going to want

991
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:20,575
Do you have

992
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:24,159
Technical capability comes

993
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:28,255
So down song Sometimes in terms of I set up

994
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:29,791
In terms of how I think about

995
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:31,071
Problems

996
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:33,887
I know what you think about

997
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:36,191
Launch

998
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:37,215

So

1020
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:49,919
Learn to code

1021
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:50,943
Laterally

I'm at cliches because

1028
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:12,447
Because

1029
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:13,727
People ignore them

1030
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:18,847
Things are well known to be

1031
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:22,687
Disabled people inside

1032
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:26,783
Exactly I was going to say

1033
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:29,343
I've been meaning to learn to code for you know

1034
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:31,647
3 years now and

1035
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:34,207
