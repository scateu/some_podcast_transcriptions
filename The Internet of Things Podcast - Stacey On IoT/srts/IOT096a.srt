00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:11,264
Hey everyone welcome to the Internet of Things podcast

2
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:13,312
This is your host Stacey Higginbotham

3
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:14,592
And this is your Coast

4
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:15,872
Kevin tofel

5
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:17,920
I don't know if you realize this but

6
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:22,528
When I make these intros I actually gesture over to the

7
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:23,808
Who's always sitting

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:24,832
To my right

9
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:31,488
We should invest in one of those telepresence things and you can actually be pointing to a little screen with my face on I can move around 2

10
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:34,048
We have had requests

11
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:35,072
To do this live

12
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,376
Which I thought about that

13
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:40,704
Since we do it so early in the morning I'm always a little underdressed

14
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:45,824
Plus he'll have all the banter we have off the air

15
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:52,992
He's just really cute cards people

16
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,880
This week we have an awesome show for you we're going to talk about Google home partners

17
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:03,232
And we've got some great news on the echo

18
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:04,000
I think it's great

19
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:06,304
Is Kevin's not so sure

20
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:08,864
Ring raising a lot of money

21
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,656
We got some updates on jaw bone

22
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:14,240
We've got openhab2 oh if you don't know what this is

23
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:16,544
And we're going to talk a little bit

24
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,312
About

25
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:18,592
Apple homekit

26
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:21,152
Because I've been playing around with this and have some

27
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,176
Opinions

28
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:26,016
I guess this week is Susan Norris of P G & E

29
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:29,856
Who's going to talk about Energy Efficiency programs at how startups can work with China

30
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:31,904
But first

31
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:34,976
Let's go to a message from our sponsor

32
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:37,536
Our sponsor this week is June

33
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:43,424
June makes an intelligent countertop convection oven that takes the guesswork out of cooking

34
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,824
And let me tell you guys I love this thing it uses an HD internal camera along with the latest in art

35
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:56,224
Artificial intelligence to identify the food that you're cooking it's a Jessup Reset program that they've developed

36
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:02,624
And they close it and it's Android notification when it's done if you'd like and basically

37
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,720
Is awesome I love this thing I actually bought one

38
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:13,120
So in putting my money where my mouth is on this particular sponsor it has 100 day risk free guarantee

39
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:19,520
Auntie for all purchases made before March 31st 2017

40
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:25,920
The next two months you can test this out basically and ship it back if you don't like it

41
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:32,320
June oven can be found at www.even.com

42
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:35,648
It will also be at the June pop-up showroom which is located

43
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:42,048
At The Village at Corte Madera in Marin County California if you're out that way

44
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:46,656
Okay Kevin are we ready to get on with our show

45
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:53,568
We are before we start only because we're going to talk about some Google stuff I just want to say to everybody who met

46
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:55,104
Not already

47
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,896
Regular listener where you been

48
00:02:57,152 --> 00:03:00,224
Google I mention that I am a full-time consultant for Google

49
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,808
I do not work in their smart home iot efforts at

50
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:07,904
Any way shape or form I should wear with Android and chrome folks in the Enterprise.

51
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,928
Just want to get that out there

52
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:11,232
And so far it hasn't affected

53
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,000
Kevin's

54
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,280
Wonderfully unbiased

55
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:20,960
You know a lot of people are surprised that I have not yet bought a Google home which is what we're going to talk about instead I own four

56
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:24,288
For Echo devices and I mention previous shows why that isn't

57
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:28,896
We're going to continue to talk about that maybe I'll change her mind but it's not because

58
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:32,992
So the news out this week on Google home is that they have

59
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,016
Teamed up with

60
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:36,320
WeMo Belkin products

61
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,088
And

62
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:38,880
Honeywell

63
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:41,440
Works with the Honeywell

64
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:43,232
Lyric thermostats

65
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:49,120
I don't have a Honeywell thermostat but I do have WeMo products and I hooked it up

66
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,656
The hookup process

67
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:51,936
Super easy

68
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:54,240
Basically when you go to the smart home section

69
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:56,544
You can add a device and then you'll see

70
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:58,080
The new options

71
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:02,432
So let me just quickly ask because I don't have a Google home

72
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:06,528
When you say go to the smart home options I'm assuming that's in the Google home

73
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,296
App

74
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:10,112
It isn't actually biscuits to something that drives me a little nut

75
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:14,208
That's because Google home the app actually encompasses a lot of different

76
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,744
It does the Chromecast

77
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,024
Southern Stone

78
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,071
So when do you actually go to the app

79
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,863
You go to

80
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,143
Video Star

81
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:25,471
So I get YouTube as my first option Google Play Movies & TV

82
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:29,311
I have to actually go to the drop-down menu to the

83
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,591
The home control section

84
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:37,503
Catch it again I don't have the app because I don't have Google home so I don't know how it works

85
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:42,111
That sounds sort of similar to how you set up an echo with Smart Home Stuff although

86
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:47,999
All the different options are pretty obvious on the main screen even there in a list on the left but

87
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,023
Home

88
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:53,887
What happens if you go to the

89
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,679
Home control section in the drop top

90
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,471
And

91
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:58,495
You basically

92
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,287
Do you click on a device

93
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:05,663
You pull down the home control in the drop-down menu and there's a tiny little plus sign at the bottom when you hit that plus sign

94
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,711
You get

95
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,015
In those options are nest

96
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,551
Philips Hue SmartThings

97
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,319
WeMo

98
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,087
And

99
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:13,855
Honeywell

100
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,159
Basically

101
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:19,743
I've learned everything except for Honeywell and with WeMo

102
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,535
Which is the latest and newest thing

103
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,583
I noticed a couple things

104
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:27,167
1 WeMo has historically been a little iffy about state

105
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:29,215
If you switch between clap

106
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:31,775
So knowing if it's on or off

107
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,311
If I turn it off with like

108
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,871
SmartThings sometimes it would be like

109
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,175
When I try to turn it off using Echo would be like

110
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,455
What will it now

111
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,479
So

112
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,759
With Google

113
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,039
Home this hasn't been

114
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:44,575
So that's good

115
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:50,463
That is good cuz I actually see that cuz he's multiple phones IOS and Android and sometimes on

116
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,487
The WeMo app

117
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:55,327
Even though a light is on the switch shows it is off when I switch phones and

118
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,351
So I've seen that

119
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:59,679
On phone so that's good I don't know how they resolved that but

120
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,703
That's good news

121
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:03,007
So I went back and forth turning my

122
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,055
WeMo switch on from my

123
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:07,103
Echo and then turning it off

124
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:07,871
Where's my Google home

125
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,455
The other thing I noticed which is really nice is

126
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:13,247
Google home you can actually say

127
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,575
I'm just going to tell you one of my WeMo switches called Afro Circus

128
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:20,927
It is from Madagascar 3 or 4 to my daughter named it

129
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:21,951
Just

130
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:22,975
So I

131
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,815
Minor called mortar

132
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:27,583
The Shire

133
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,471
Okay

134
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:37,055
So I say is Afro Circus on

135
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,335
And it says

136
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:40,639
Yes the afro circus is

137
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:43,967
So it's kind of nice because you can't do that you can't

138
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:45,503
Ask if something is on or off

139
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,783
So it will tell me state

140
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,063
The other thing is

141
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,135
If I want the echo to do something I have to say

142
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,415
Hey

143
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,951
Turn on

144
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:54,975
Afro Circus

145
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,535
But with Google

146
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:58,815
I can say

147
00:06:59,327 --> 00:06:59,839
Haji

148
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,399
Turn Afro Circus on

149
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,679
Or I can say

150
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,447
Turn on

151
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,751
With the echo

152
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:12,895
Order of operations actually matters otherwise she would know what to do with Google

153
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:14,687
Interesting

154
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:16,991
Those are the two things

155
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,527
That I've discovered

156
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:19,551
So far

157
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:22,111
Obviously this happened yesterday so I haven't

158
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,183
Tivoli Lake

159
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,719
Discover yunnan

160
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:28,255
If it's going to throw some errors

161
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,023
We'll talk about it next

162
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:33,887
So even though I don't have a Google home I do have two WeMo switches

163
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:38,751
And I actually will get to try this in the near future I don't have a time frame yet

164
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:41,055
The reason I say that is because

165
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,335
WeMo and Honeywell

166
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,615
Coming to

167
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:47,199
The assistant on the Google pixel as well

168
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:49,503
It says Google this is an soon

169
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,527
Kunming

170
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,295
So

171
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:54,623
Using Google Assistant I'll be able to do this and try it out as well as

172
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,927
Imagine that expression

173
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,207
I don't know yet but

174
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,999
Give it a shot to

175
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,279
Yay

176
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,583
All right also in

177
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,119
Voice controlled speakers

178
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,143
We have

179
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:08,703
The echo has a new wake word

180
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,263
In my newsletter last week

181
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:14,335
So if you got that you're already up on this news before everyone else

182
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,127
But

183
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,407
The new word is

184
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,431
Computer

185
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:19,711
Which is taken from

186
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:21,503
Star Trek

187
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:24,831
Yeah which I love the I love the fact that

188
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,879
Star Trek fan always have been

189
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,671
I love the fact that you can now

190
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,975
Call your Echo computer in that respect

191
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:34,815
But for practical purposes I do not like it and the reason why

192
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:39,679
Because if you look at the existing wake words and looking at run through the 3 hours on that there are

193
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:43,263
They're not common either they're not things you would say a lot

194
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:44,799
The computer

195
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:50,175
These days computers is use an awful lot in my house I don't know about you and I just

196
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,711
It just would not work in my house

197
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,783
Calling it phone or tablet

198
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,319
No it's never going to work out

199
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:59,135
I would challenge you to try it for

200
00:08:59,391 --> 00:08:59,903
24 hours

201
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:05,279
Because I thought the same thing but we don't actually say it we say where's the laptop

202
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,303
See

203
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,351
So we don't actually say computer various

204
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:09,887
Oh I'm so sorry

205
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:10,911
Oh my God

206
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:14,239
We're going to have to figure out if that's really a problem

207
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:22,175
Going forward I don't think it's a problem for today cuz I doubt many people automatically to switch it over last night

208
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:27,039
I love it on you

209
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:32,415
That's fair I just swap it out for 24 hours see what happens

210
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:33,951
And then next week we'll

211
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:39,839
All right do I have to set it up on my computer I just said the word

212
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:40,607
I'm kidding

213
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:41,887
I will try it

214
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:45,215
All right so that's probably enough of all of that

215
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,239
Let's get the funding

216
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,519
Because holy moly

217
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,287
Ring

218
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:52,639
Doorbell company has raised 109 million

219
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:53,663
Dollars

220
00:09:55,711 --> 00:10:01,599
This comes on top of a 61.2 million year ago

221
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:02,623
And

222
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:07,487
Team on top of the 28 Million Dollar Round which is when Richard Branson actually gotten

223
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,535
That's the

224
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,167
209 million

225
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:18,751
Dollar Tree

226
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:22,847
This a lot of money it was led by

227
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:23,871
Dfj

228
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,151
Goldman Sachs

229
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:29,247
Qualcomm

230
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:31,807
I don't know

231
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,927
One I would love to know them cuz I'm wondering why they needed

232
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:37,951
Itchy raised

233
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:38,975
Almost

234
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:41,279
Enough money that's almost double what they previously

235
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,327
Write this is like an IPA

236
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,119
Kind of this is for a smoke

237
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:46,911
What I think is happening

238
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:50,495
They see that the market is going to be a make-or-break here for a lot of

239
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,519
You're going to have to

240
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,335
Grow massively

241
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:58,431
And figure out your established business models and ring has actually put out a lot

242
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:02,271
Different pieces of Hardware is part of their

243
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:05,087
Jamie siminoff the CEO of ring calls it his

244
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,439
They thought

245
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,719
You know they're two doorbells

246
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:12,255
They've got

247
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:14,815
Outdoor camera and then they now have

248
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:16,351
They launched at CES

249
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,631
This outdoor camera

250
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,399
Light

251
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:21,983
So imagine if you've got a neighborhood full of rings

252
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,519
What happens if

253
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:27,359
1 triggers you know some weird activity and

254
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:32,735
Maybe Simpson notification to the homeowner and the homeowners like yeah that was my package

255
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,783
And then all the lights go on

256
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,319
Everybody's ring down the

257
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:39,647
Kind of like a coyote neighborhood watch

258
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,671
Yes

259
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,207
That's the vision

260
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,255
It takes a lot of

261
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:48,351
Product in marketing to get to that because that's not going to be useful

262
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,911
Unless a lot of people have that's right

263
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:55,519
Right right right you need to build up adoption to get the maximum benefit for the neighborhood

264
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,823
And they got a lot of people that got a

265
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:01,151
It says a thousand employees which is a ton of people

266
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:06,783
My understanding is in this is what sources of Told Me Not

267
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:07,807
Confirm

268
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,087
Talk about this

269
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,623
They're not profit

270
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:14,207
So they've to make an IPO you got it prove that you're

271
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:16,255
Profitable and then you have a good pasta

272
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,607
And I don't know if they've actually achieved out yet

273
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,143
Plains weather

274
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,167
Candice Edition

275
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,983
Yeah and it's interesting that

276
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:30,079
Yes I read that looking at it on venturebeat who reported this

277
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:32,895
It's also debt element involved as well so it's

278
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:37,759
I don't know if that's part of the 109 or they have a line of credit or whatever

279
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,551
I think it's back to the

280
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:43,391
What you said earlier this is a make-or-break year for a lot of companies I think now that they have

281
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,415
Grab this

282
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,695
Chunk of change

283
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:50,559
This is probably their make-or-break year if they're going to go hog-wild with marketing and train

284
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,327
Achieve

285
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,607
Jamie's vision

286
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,887
Am I going to go quick

287
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,167
It is

288
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:59,007
Speaking of make-or-break years and companies that raised a lot of money

289
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,287
Jawbone

290
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,615
Jaw bone has

291
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:07,199
I ever this down his jaw bone is giving out but really what happened is

292
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,479
Jaw bone is

293
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:09,759
Stopping

294
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:13,087
It basically hasn't communicated with this customer since

295
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:13,855
December

296
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:14,623
The middle of December

297
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,415
Is it the support

298
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,439
MS support group

299
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,463
This is the support

300
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:19,999
So like

301
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:23,327
Most of the fitness trackers have fairly good support

302
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:24,607
People

303
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:25,887
They buy them

304
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:31,007
They wash them in the washing machine

305
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:36,639
I'm in a lot of them you know if you if it if something happens to it within a year they're like will replace it so

306
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,663
People have been

307
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,967
Emailing with Jawbone support

308
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:42,015
They're not getting anywhere

309
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:44,319
Pazzo job and support has gone silent

310
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,343
According to the bird

311
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,927
And this is maybe not surprising

312
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,463
Kevin you want to talk about

313
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:51,743
What you think might be

314
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:54,559
Well it kind of relates back to the

315
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,583
The funding store

316
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,959
I just talked about with ring and actions such as this when you might have company takes down and support

317
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:02,495
Process

318
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:04,543
And it has been known to have

319
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,847
Sales problems with its Hardware

320
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:09,663
It's almost like those are a series of steps to just train

321
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:13,503
Keep the company going as long as possible as long as there's money

322
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,783
While they trying

323
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:17,343
Keen other money Thea true funding

324
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:19,135
Through sales and like that

325
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,159
And

326
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:22,463
They're obviously not going to tell her

327
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,487
They're doing

328
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:27,327
They're going to try and keep things afloat for as long as I can.

329
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:31,935
One of two things is going to happen to be there when I get some funding or a buyer or they're just going to

330
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:32,959
Sold

331
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:34,751
And I don't know which it is

332
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:35,519
They don't

333
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:42,943
You know when the money is gone the money is gone so that's the way I see this when I ask again I hope I'm wrong

334
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:48,063
Their efforts behind creating like true medical devices as opposed to consumer

335
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:51,647
Skip it and I forget what that was

336
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,231
Don't bite about a year ago yeah

337
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:56,767
Back in May I'm sorry

338
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,887
Alright so that is

339
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:08,543
Other news for people who love their Smart Homes and their smart home hubs and feel particularly

340
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,311
Kiki

341
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,383
Openhab which is the eclipse

342
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,151
Open

343
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:16,735
Smart home where is this the open-source version of

344
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:18,015
Built on Eclipse

345
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,039
Yes yes

346
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,599
They've released openhab2

347
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:25,695
Confess that I said I was going to do it

348
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,463
Openhab

349
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:27,999
Configuration

350
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:28,767
And I

351
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:36,703
It takes a little effort I mean you're not buying at a hub you're basically building a hub with a Raspberry Pi or a

352
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,519
Anticodon and you're using it open have software so your

353
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:41,055
Creating your own Hub so

354
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:42,591
I was really into

355
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:46,431
I looked at it and like all right

356
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:49,759
Pi

357
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,807
I got to get it

358
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:55,391
So then I was looking at the pine64 Smart Home

359
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,695
Care up there

360
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,463
Do the smart

361
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,231
Conversion

362
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:01,023
No but I can always add

363
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,815
To the pine64

364
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:03,583
Yes

365
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,631
I was looking at that and then

366
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:07,935
I looked at the instructions and then I was like

367
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:11,775
Holychild I am going to really find myself into

368
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:12,799
So

369
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,079
It's always been like a

370
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:15,359
What to do but

371
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:20,479
Because openhab2

372
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,527
Apparently has a nice

373
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,695
It's better

374
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:30,719
Better

375
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,095
It's not cloudconnect

376
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:36,863
To the top logo

377
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:37,887
And

378
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,215
Nice dashboards

379
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,495
Call this nice

380
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:43,519
I don't know

381
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:46,847
It's much cleaner and more modernized in the field

382
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,223
It's pretty

383
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:53,503
Pretty so

384
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,039
I'm actually hoping

385
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,343
To do this because

386
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,135
I think I can I think I can

387
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,415
Call Kevin

388
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,695
I'm going to call Kevin

389
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:08,863
I haven't gone through this and set up and had myself but I I set up a ton of different things on Raspberry Pi

390
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,911
Brothers retropie with

391
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,447
Game emulators

392
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,215
Or

393
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:15,519
Linux or whatever maybe

394
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:17,823
It may look intimidating but I think

395
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,103
You'll be surprised

396
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:22,175
Two things one it will probably be simpler than you thought

397
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:23,711
And to you will learn a lot

398
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:29,087
It's actually good experience to have in a minute that's how you buy these raspberry pies and so on so forth anyway

399
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:30,367
It's a tinker so

400
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:32,415
I don't think it's going to be that bad in the benefit is

401
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,719
Perspective or somebody doesn't like cloud-connected

402
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,743
7/8 local

403
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:39,071
And you pick and choose what radios you want you can

404
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,351
Customize

405
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,375
Door hardware

406
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,911
To the way you want

407
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:45,983
You should do is

408
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,775
I want all the radios

409
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,847
So what you're in your house you need all

410
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:54,431
Not all of us have a hundred different things connected in her house

411
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:55,455
Don't have that

412
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:57,503
Yesterday

413
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:02,367
I love the fact that you know what I look at my wife

414
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,927
You only have basically f45

415
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:05,695
Wifikill

416
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:13,119
And then add your Bluetooth you see way they should be excited I'm like I'm not so bad

417
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,655
But then I realized it

418
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,423
That doesn't account

419
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:16,959
Other stuff

420
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,263
Sad

421
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,031
All right

422
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:20,799
So

423
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:23,615
Let's see so that's open have news very exciting

424
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,407
Stacey has a promise

425
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:26,687
The promises

426
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,735
Actually download and do this

427
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:33,599
Alright this is kind of tie a couple pieces of news

428
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:34,879
Together

429
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:37,183
It's topical we might get a little political

430
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,207
So just

431
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,231
Retro

432
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:42,303
Everybody everybody

433
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,327
Let's take two deep breaths

434
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,351
Okay

435
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:45,119
So

436
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,911
This week the FTC

437
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,727
The Federal Trade Commission filed a complaint against

438
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,007
The breath

439
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,799
Which is a Bluetooth connected

440
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:53,567
Breathalyzer

441
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:54,847
And

442
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,895
It also appeared on Shark Tank

443
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:58,943
So if you've heard of it that's probably why

444
00:18:59,199 --> 00:18:59,711
If your Shark Tank

445
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:00,991
So

446
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:05,087
The FTC basically filed a complaint saying that

447
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:08,927
The company lacks scientific evidence to back up their

448
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:13,535
This is, this is what the FTC does it basically protects consumers against

449
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:14,815
False

450
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,119
It's one of its many sticks

451
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,167
Well it's actually probably one of its few sticks

452
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:19,935
It has to be

453
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:24,543
So the FTC actually did this very recently

454
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,823
Earlier in January

455
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:29,407
D'link saying that it advertised it

456
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:31,967
It's routers were more secure than they actually

457
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:33,503
And so

458
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,295
Once again FTC

459
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,087
Basically

460
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:37,855
People for bad advert

461
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:42,463
What is interesting here is Edith Ramirez

462
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,231
Chair

463
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:45,535
Woman of the FTC actually step down

464
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,815
Because she wasn't Obama

465
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,375
And with the Trump Administration come

466
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:52,959
I'm very curious how active the FTC is going

467
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:53,727
To be here

468
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:55,775
Consumers can always make

469
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:56,543
Complaints

470
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,079
But the FTC doesn't actually have

471
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:58,847
Act on them

472
00:19:59,103 --> 00:19:59,615
And

473
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:02,687
All of these connected devices

474
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,455
There's

475
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:05,503
A lot of opportunity

476
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:07,039
For complaints coming

477
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:08,575
Related to privacy

478
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:12,671
Related to false advertising and I'm curious who will pick up the slack

479
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,207
I bring this up

480
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,487
Because

481
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:16,255
Lily

482
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,535
The maker of

483
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,815
That robotic drone

484
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:19,839
I guess it's just a drone

485
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,631
The Drone that you basically

486
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,655
Toss up in the air

487
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,935
It follows you and takes pic

488
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:25,471
Everyone is very excited about

489
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:31,615
Lily is actually been sued by the San Francisco district attorney it filed a civil consumer protection suit

490
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:35,455
Saying that the company had lied to customers with its launch video

491
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,735
And

492
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:40,319
It couldn't actually do any of that and so Lily basically said that

493
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,855
It wasn't going to build its

494
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:43,391
Cool drones

495
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:44,415
Sings everybody

496
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:46,463
The next day

497
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:48,511
The San Francisco DEA was like

498
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,839
The question here is

499
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,167
Certain States going to

500
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,727
Pick up the slack where the FTC

501
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:03,871
Yeah that's that's going to be interesting because people especially with how easy it is to order online

502
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:05,919
From other areas of the country

503
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,223
Towel that will actually be effective

504
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:10,527
Right people will find ways around that

505
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,575
True now the publicity could be

506
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:14,879
Be interesting and I would say a lot of these

507
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:15,647
Companies are based in

508
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:16,416
In California

509
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:17,440
Which

510
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:19,232
We already know is going

511
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:22,816
Which Prides itself on becoming a thorn in the side of

512
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,096
Current Administration

513
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,120
So

514
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:27,424
It kind of makes me wonder

515
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:30,240
I think there's going to be jurisdiction in those cases if

516
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:31,520
Companies based there

517
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,568
And if anyone in California orders one

518
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,104
Thank you for that

519
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:40,480
So this is going to be a really interesting thing to watch I believe over the next

520
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:41,504
You're so

521
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,528
Because again

522
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:47,648
Make a break here for iot for a lot of these companies that raise funding in 2012-2013

523
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:48,928
So

524
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:51,488
Keep an eye on this you guys

525
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:53,024
Finally

526
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:54,816
Let's go to

527
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:56,096
Homekit

528
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:58,400
What you been playing with them.

529
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:00,192
So I set up a basic

530
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:03,008
Home kit installation

531
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:05,312
Text I have an iPad so that's going to be my

532
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,336
Like living at home

533
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:07,872
I didn't buy an Apple TV

534
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:09,664
Thai pads

535
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:12,224
Either can be a Gateway for the home stuff

536
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:15,808
So I have is devices right now I have an eye devices

537
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:17,344

00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:25,024
Controls now all of my Lutron.

542
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:25,792
Devices

543
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:26,816
I have

544
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:28,096
The Philips Hue

545
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:30,400
My Philips Hue Lights cuz the Hub is homekit

00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:52,928
I feel like I have one more that I haven't set up

557
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:53,696
But I don't remember

558
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:57,024
With those things

559
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,816
I've been trying some very basic stuff

560
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:04,704
Their new door locks or anything like that because I think the only door lock right now is August and he don't have an August on my

561
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,496
My door because my doors

562
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:08,288
My front doors don't actually work

563
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,568
My Backdoor

564
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:10,848
Has

565
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:14,944
So I may get one just to try that out though

566
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:16,224
Because it feels like summer

567
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:19,296
Set up on this

568
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,576
Is super easy

569
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:23,136
And what's important to know

570
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:27,488
Is in some cases you don't actually even need to install the app

571
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:28,256
For the

572
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:31,072
Correct

573
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,096
So

574
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:36,704
I have the Philips Hue already connected in the Lutron Hub already can

575
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,264
Connect it so those I basically opened

576
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,800
The whole map from

577
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:42,336
An iOS home screen

578
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,896
Oh that's going to be terrible you guys

579
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:50,528
And I was like add a new device and it actually saw that those devices were already on my network

580
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:51,808
Clicked on them

581
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,088
I added them

582
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,624
I could put them in a room

583
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:56,416
I can put them on

584
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:57,440
The home screen

585
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,208
Witches

586
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,816
This is this is ridiculous you guys the home screen

587
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:08,448
So in some cases I did like I have I have motion sensor setup for my laundry room in my closet

588
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:10,496
Through the Hue and I was like

589
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,288
Those are

590
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:17,664
And it only saw the lights didn't see the motions

591
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,432
Sensors for my

592
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,200
Queue system

593
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:20,736
Switch

594
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:21,760
That's important

595
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,064
It took

596
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:25,600
Maybe

597
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:26,624
92nd

598
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,672
To do all of my lights

599
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:29,696
From Hue and Lutron

600
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:31,744
Which is about a dozen lights

601
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,792
Name them classify them all of that

602
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:37,888
The active setting this up basically involved

603
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:39,424
Clicking on that

604
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,192
Button

605
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:41,472
Cuz it was self discovered in

606
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:42,240
Chase

607
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:43,008
And then

608
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:46,848
Lighting up the code on the bottom of the bridges and then AB sees it

609
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:48,384
Takes kind of a picture it's

610
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:50,432
And it's like

611
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:51,456
You're connected

612
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:52,224
And it was

613
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,248
Spokane

614
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:55,296
So easy so they nailed that

615
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,832
Yeah setup is

616
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:58,624
I did this with ecobee

617
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,672
As the only homekit device I have here

618
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:02,464
And setup was

619
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,256
Super simple just like you described

620
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,024
That was awesome

621
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:06,816
So

622
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:09,120
If something hadn't been connected

623
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:10,912
It already so with my

624
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:12,704
My other stuff that already been online

625
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:14,496
I also did the

626
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:15,264
You stuff

627
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:16,288
And

628
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:18,592
Basically I didn't download the eve app

629
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:20,640
Elgato

630
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:22,176
So I didn't download that at all

631
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,504
Instead I went to the home app and I've clicked

632
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:27,296
Wants to add the device

633
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:30,368
Because it was nearby and powered on

634
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:33,440
It was like hey

635
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:34,976
That's what I want to add

636
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,512
And then

637
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:42,400
I took the picture and boom it was on and then I got a notification saying hey there's a firmware update

638
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:43,424
So

639
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,448
Basically

640
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,472
Nail in it

641
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:46,240
On this side

642
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:47,776
On the outside

643
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:51,872
Getting things to work together is also

644
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,920
Pretty rudimentary

645
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:57,504
That's kind of where this falls down I wanted like some more

646
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,784
Options for

647
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:02,368
Cool style Integrations but

648
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,648
The pretty-much

649
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:04,928
Where they've been for

650
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:07,232
Two or three years which is I program like

651
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,512
Windows motion detector

652
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,304
Comes off Iran

653
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:11,328
Do this

654
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:12,096
And that works

655
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,632
Super fast

656
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:17,728
And this is all in the automation tab of the home app if I recall

657
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:23,360
Doing this like not like

658
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:25,152
I also I will tell you guys that

659
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:26,688
But I also have a challenge here

660
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:27,712
Because

661
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:28,992
I am not used to iPhone

662
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:32,064
Apple nailed it on the setup

663
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,856
And next week we're going to talk about

664
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:35,392
How well it is

665
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,160
When you live

666
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,976
Final tip for you guys

667
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:41,536
Remember last week I talked to you about stringify

668
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:46,400
Stringify was that app that basically is a software-based home automation Hub it ties into Lots

669
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:47,168
Some other things

670
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:51,008
So I discovered that they have a math function

671
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,568
Option as one of their triggers

672
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,152
Actually it's really cool because it lets you

673
00:26:57,408 --> 00:27:01,760
Continuous Flow based on comparing numbers so you can actually put that in seoul

674
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:04,064
After this time of day

675
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:06,624
Turn the nest on

676
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,184
If it is greater than

677
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:10,464
This many took

678
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,232
Greece

679
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,768
Which is pretty cool

680
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:16,608
That's interesting and then you can perform math operations

681
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:17,632
Khon2 values

682
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,168
And that's like

683
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:21,216
Adding or doing other things

684
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:23,776
I'm not 100% sure how to use that yet

685
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:24,544
Cuz I haven't

686
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,080
Haven't found a use for it

687
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:26,848
But

688
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:27,616
If you guys can

689
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,200
They also have a text function

690
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:31,968
And I should tell you

691
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:35,040
That's basically continue the flow if the text

692
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:36,320
Says this

693
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:37,344
Continue the flow

694
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,112
If the text

695
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,136
Does not say

696
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:41,184
This is good for things like

697
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:44,256
Hey when I text the following

698
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:47,328
To my smart home system to stringify

699
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:48,864
Do this

700
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:49,888
Is a mattress

701
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:55,008
If that makes sense so basically it allows you to write text commands

702
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,032
Do so

703
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:57,568
Sometimes like for example

704
00:27:58,848 --> 00:27:59,616
Because our

705
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:00,896
Like when I come into bed

706
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:01,664
Late at night

707
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:02,944
I don't actually want to

708
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:04,480
Tell the echo

709
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:06,016
But I try text

710
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:09,600
So rats like an alternative

711
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,184
Some of that sounds like what

712
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:19,584
Zuckerberg is done with Jarvis cuz I know he's got text controls built-in for that same reason he doesn't want to wake somebody up with voice commands so

713
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,632
Send a text to make something happen

714
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:22,912
Exactly

715
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:24,704
So I think this could

716
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:26,240
Really handy actually for

717
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:30,080
I don't know what actually let me think about this because right now

718
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:34,944
One of the things I commonly do where I'd like to tell the echo something but I can't

719
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:37,504
Is the middle of the night sometimes

720
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:39,808
He tore my AC is just

721
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:40,832
I wake up in a

722
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:44,160
I couldn't get

723
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:46,720
My smartphone and just use the app

724
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:51,328
Turn it back which is probably just as reasonable is creating a flow

725
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:52,608
To do the same thing

726
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,680
And then cuz if I create a stringify flow

727
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:57,216
I'm going to get my phone to text something

728
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:59,520
In Massachusetts the appen

729
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:03,872
Hours of fun in that

730
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,920
So today I actually

731
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:08,224
Everything else just

732
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:09,760
Okay

733
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:11,552
So that's it for this week's show

734
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,368
Stay tuned because we have an awesome guess this way

735
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:17,440
We have Susan Norris of Pacific Gas and

736
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:18,208
Electric

737
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:25,120
Who is going to talk to us about how the Internet of Things helps with conservation and energy-efficiency and what's

738
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:26,400
Startups need to know

739
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:32,800
What did companies about working with PG&E going to be awesome

740
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:39,200
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is

741
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:45,600
Does your host today Susan Norris who is a senior manager in Peach

742
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:46,880
Energy

Efficiency products organization

744
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:50,720
Hey Susan

745
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:52,000
Man that title timeout

746
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:55,072
But you want to tell people kind of Simply what you do

747
00:29:55,328 --> 00:30:00,192
We're really trying to inspire and Empower our customers to eliminate unnecessary energy use

748
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:01,984
Which is still a mouthful

749
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:04,800
That is but at least makes makes sense

750
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:08,128
So you're one of the people behind the efforts to

751
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:09,152
Take my old

752
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:12,992
Incandescent bulbs out replacing with LEDs and maybe reminding me to

753
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:15,808
Turn up the air-conditioning when I leave in the US

754
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:19,392
And not just replace your light bulbs fit turn them off when you don't need

755
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:21,952
What's the elimination of it when it's not enough

756
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:24,768
Keyword there

757
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:26,048
You're in California

758
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,888
In California is he a Korean state has some very aggressive energy

759
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,680
Conservation goals

760
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:37,824
Do you guys have any official metrics that you're working towards internally or as a state

761
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,128
Getting Gold by our Utility Commission

762
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:41,152
To achieve

763
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:42,176
Each year

764
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:45,248
Demand which is measured in megabytes or gigabytes

765
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:47,040
You said which is measured in

766
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:50,368
Watt hours to kilowatt hours or megawatt hours

767
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:52,672
And sperms which is the gas side

768
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:54,208
Sing to me end

769
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:57,536
Reducing usage overall and reducing gas

770
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:00,352
And how are you guys doing

771
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,424
Start over

772
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,496
So it sounds like you guys have pretty big conservation

773
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:10,080
Does that conflict with your goals to actually sell it

774
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:17,248
The unique situation in California and investor-owned utilities are in is that we don't have that tension between

775
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:18,272
Revenues from

776
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:20,064
Selling our commodity to our cost

777
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:21,088
And

778
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,672
Ice cannibalizing that Revenue by doing energy-efficient

779
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:31,840
And that's because we're a public utility that is decoupled which means that the revenues are disassociated from

780
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:32,608
Commodity

781
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:36,448
If we get our customers to reduce their energy consumption we don't take a hit Financial

782
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:39,264
And that's a good thing because if you look at California that are cheap

783
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:45,152
Consumption since we started implementing Energy Efficiency programs our population has grown

784
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:45,920
That's not

785
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:52,320
So one of the things that people are excited about with the Internet of Things smart home however you want to look at it

786
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:53,088
Is it

787
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:54,368
Really has huge

788
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:57,184
Potential just cut down on energy use

789
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,232
Even in my house just having

790
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:02,560
Motion sensor switch is like the lowest hanging fruit ever

791
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:04,096
Turn off the lights after I leave

792
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,376
Leave saved me tons

793
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:06,400
And

794
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:08,704
You know things like The Nest Thermostat

795
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:12,800
Honeywell lyric they all just turn down the heat when you leave and turn up your AC

796
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:14,848
And that's got to be great so

797
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:20,224
Is that enough gets a good start I am both terrified and thrilled about where things are going

798
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,296
What terrifies me a little bit is that it a lot of this

799
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:29,440
Technology in your newsletter and in your recent podcast from CES you talk about

800
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:34,048
The proliferation of SmartThings and that is plug load that is going into home

801
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:35,584
It's also a lot of batteries

802
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,352
Switch

803
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:37,376
A crate for the

804
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:43,776
The environment and a lot of things getting plugged into outlets in homes and that that's a little terrifying for me in the space because they

805
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:44,544
That's where

806
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,080
A lot of those little hidden

807
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:47,104
Usage

808
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:48,384
Comes in

809
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,664
That in

810
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:53,760
In a 1D 2D cases isn't a lot but when you start to pile it on it becomes

811
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:58,112
It becomes extensive and it used to be that everyone had one television in their home

812
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:04,000
And now people even have televisions in the refrigerator than in their bathrooms and there are bedrooms and every bedroom

813
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,560
When you start to pile it on

814
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:13,216
It gets a little unwieldy for us when we're trying on our side when we're trying to eliminate that unnecessary and I

815
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:15,264
How to use and even those products

816
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,312
Don't look like they're consuming

817
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:19,360
If it hasn't always on feature

818
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:24,224
Like a smart TV or a game console or a computer

819
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,064
It's still consuming energy even though you're not benefiting from the energy of cancer

820
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:30,880
Those are the types of things that we're trying to

821
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:31,904
Solve

822
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,208
Forever either trying to solve sweat at

823
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:35,488
Consumer level

824
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:39,584
You Stacy can you just turn off the lights when you're not using them or when you don't need them

825
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,864
Can you unplug your

826
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:42,912
Computer or make sure that your

827
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:45,728
Set-top box goes off and really turn

828
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:46,496
Lights off when you

829
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,288
Can you do that

830
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:50,848
But it's better if we make it really simple for Custer

831
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,944
To do that and that's where the manufacturers come in

832
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:59,040
And so that's why it's exciting for me because I think a lot of disconnected

833
00:33:59,296 --> 00:33:59,808
Stuff

834
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:02,368
Can help make it really easy for customers

835
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:03,904
To take those actions

836
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,696
So let's break this down a little bit

837
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:07,744
Because you brought up two things one is

838
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,024
More devices in the home

839
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:09,792
Because they're connect

840
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:14,912
Is

841
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:16,448
Using their intelligence

842
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,728
To help with conservation

843
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,008
So let's start with a

844
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:20,288
The first witch

845
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:22,848
You kind of alluding to this vampire power consumption

846
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:24,128
Challenge

847
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,688
In one of the ways you can deal with that

848
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:28,736
Maybe by installing

849
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:30,272
Smart switches so

850
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:32,064
You can plug your

851
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:35,648
Killbox which is a notorious culprit into

852
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:36,672
Connected Outlet

853
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:38,464
And turn it off when the TV is actually

854
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:39,744
Not on

855
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,024
Yes

856
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:41,792
Right

857
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:44,864
Some of that dodos devices themselves

858
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,400
Because they have

859
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:50,240
Southstate you know they have they have hard drives in them that aren't

860
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:52,800
Really designed to be completely

861
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:53,824
Kilt

862
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:55,360
Hi

863
00:34:56,128 --> 00:35:02,272
So that's where we're going with manufacturers and and I think consumers have a pretty with we just talked about set-top box

864
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:04,576
Consumers have a pretty low tolerance

865
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:06,112
Spread out startup time

866
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:08,672
When you do completely power that unit off

867
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:14,048
I want to see the channel Selections in the guide instantly when I turn on my television and those

868
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:15,584
Device is currently

869
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:17,376
Many of them have to reboot

870
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:20,704
And so consumers don't have a high tolerance

871
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,776
We're going to have to figure that out and manufacturers are going to

872
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:28,128
I have to help figure that out but we're striving for is to have that device you

873
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:30,432
The least amount of energy is necessary

874
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:31,968
So let's go to the bigger issue

875
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:34,528
Which is using the stuff to help conserve

876
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:37,856
And I feel like there's kind of a couple steps here one is like

877
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:44,512
And you can totally argue with me cuz you're smarter and actually deal with consumers in electricity

878
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:46,560
What you're using and then

879
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:47,328
Automated

880
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:48,608
Ways to save

881
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:49,632
Or replacing

882
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:51,680
I guess replacing a device or automated

883
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:52,960
Something to save energy

884
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:54,496
Does that seem reasonable

885
00:35:55,264 --> 00:36:01,408
It doesn't and the way I look at it I always break it down into these two different factors and ultimately there two different factors that

886
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:05,504
What is motivation somebody has to be motivated to want to take action

887
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:12,160
And the second thing is you have to have the ability to do something about it so seeing how you're consuming energy

888
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:16,000
Do your higher houses performing or how big that iceberg is underneath

889
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:19,584
The polar bear and that it's melting and things that motivate you

890
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,632
To do something about something

891
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:24,192
Are very motivational but if you

892
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:24,960
Really

893
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:27,776
Feel like the solution to that is out of your reach

894
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:32,128
You're going to get frustrated so so seeing consumption a lot of these

895
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:34,432
Devices can show you your energy

896
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:37,504
Consumption but they don't give you away to do anything about it

897
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:42,624
And after a while you sit there and you're like okay so my TV is using energy when it's not on

898
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,904
I don't know what to do about it

899
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:46,464
So I think some of this connected stuff

900
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,792
And that's where I've heard Kevin talk about we're getting towards the

901
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:51,584
Smart part of the smart stuff

902
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,144
When it really starts to interact

903
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:59,776
That's when you I think we will all start to see this conservation effect of the technology

904
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:06,176
You have two effects taking place you got what we call efficiency where if I get Stacy to take out an income

905
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:08,480
Doesn't light bulb and put in an LED

906
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:09,760
The Delta between those

907
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:12,064
2 Technologies is efficient

908
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:16,160
You Stacy the consumer still get the same benefit of the light

909
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:17,440
But it's using less energy

910
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:18,720
When I get

911
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:21,024
The second measurement is conservation

912
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,352
So I can get you to turn off that light when it's not needed

913
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:26,144
That's an added bonus

914
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,192
And a lot of this technology is

915
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:31,520
Delivering both of those things so smart light bulbs

916
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:35,872
Are helping deliver the conservation and the fact that it's an LED

917
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:38,432
And not an incandescent it consumes less

918
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,248
So what are some examples

919
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:43,040
Because that's what

920
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:43,808
People's brains go to

921
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:45,344
Where this kind of Technology

922
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:48,928
So we went from a top-loading washing machine

923
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,512
To a front loading washing machine

924
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,864
Lots and lots and lots of water you can actually wash way more clothes in it

925
00:37:57,632 --> 00:38:00,704
Then you could enact in a top-loading washing machine that's great

926
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,752
Static Energy Efficiency move

927
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:05,056
The challenge that I have with these washing machine

928
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:06,592
Now is that many of them

929
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:09,920
Still default the user to warm water

930
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:11,712
Wash and Cold Water Rinse

931
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:17,344
That's great it's not a war model Reds but why not just default them to cold water wash and cold water mint

932
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:20,160
And then it's a washing machine was really smart

933
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:25,024
It could prompt the consumers say are you sure you really want to do that or it can show them their energy

934
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:26,560
Because once they're smart they

935
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:32,704
Exactly it's actually tapping into their rate

936
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,800
Order rate plan because if they're on a time of use plan it might say

937
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:39,616
Are you sure you want to start your washing machine now

938
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:42,176
It's costing you $0.22 a kilowatt hour

939
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:44,992
But if you waited until after 9 p.m. it would only cost

940
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:46,272
B12

941
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:50,112
You know I think there's a huge opportunity for the technology system

942
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:51,648
Start to interact

943
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:52,672
Together

944
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:54,208
In the home and

945
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:59,328
Some of those use cases are the thermostat registering that you're no longer there

946
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:01,888
Let's take down the lights for at least asked you whether

947
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:02,656
You want

948
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:05,728
The system to take down the lights that you've left on

949
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,800
So let's talk about the user interface for the consumer

950
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:12,896
Then we'll move to what startups need to do for you guys too

951
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:17,504
Proviable to do this and then we'll talk about what you guys need to do to kind of

952
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,040
On your end to make these sorts of

953
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:20,832
Cool things like sending XS power.

954
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:21,856
Your neighbor possible

955
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:24,672
Chicken

956
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:29,792
The user interface so right now I have to program everything to happen in my house

957
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:33,120
Which is a lot of work on my end and I do it cuz I love it

958
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:34,144
Most people are not

959
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:36,448
Weather and you know how

960
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,216
Right

961
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:38,752
So how do you get

962
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:40,800
Consumers and your customers

963
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,080
To actually

964
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:43,104
Program their lights

965
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,408
Terre Haute their nest

966
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:46,688
I think

967
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:48,480
Today it's a pretty big challenge

968
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:53,088
And I think that's one of the barriers that consumers have to really setting up these this

969
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:53,856
System

970
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:56,928
Approach I also think that some of the Technologies aren't

971
00:39:57,184 --> 00:40:02,048
Ready for that system approach because as you described they set up these walls

972
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:05,120
Systems that unless I can see more dives into

973
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:05,888
A closed

974
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:08,960
System like a Lowe's Iris system

975
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:15,360
Where everything just will automatically recognize and talk to itself so that becomes a simpler solution but it limits your

976
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:19,200
Ability to add more stuff from that is not part of that system

977
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:25,856
I also think that experiences when if your your power goes out in your Wi-Fi or your Wi-Fi goes down

978
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:27,136
And all of that stuff

979
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:31,744
Loses its connection it doesn't automatically always come back together

980
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:32,768
And that's

981
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:35,328
Going to be really frustrating for somebody who

982
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:37,376
Decided they were going to take the time

983
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:40,192
To hack this stuff together and then

984
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:43,264
I have to do it again right honestly that is this

985
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:48,640
When you spend that much money on something that you're like spending hours

986
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:49,920
Fixing it or repairing it

987
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:51,200
Yeah they're over there maybe something

988
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:55,040
Susan I just want

989
00:40:55,552 --> 00:41:00,672
I do think that it's you know it's getting there and I think manufacturers are recognizing it I do think that there are

990
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:03,744
Situations where consumers don't quite quote-unquote gat

991
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,024
That use case

992
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:11,424
And what really concerns me in if you do consider that diffusion of innovation model that innovator

993
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,728
Innovate and innovators don't really

994
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:14,752
Inform

995
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:15,776
The next

996
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:16,800
Group of

997
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:20,384
Consumers those early adopters because innovators will try anything

998
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:24,480
But early adopters actually have a strong influence on the early majority

999
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:28,064
And if we don't get this right for the early adopters

1000
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:31,392
We're going to really struggle in this is that Chasm that they talked about Crossing

1001
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:33,952
In the chasm things like that so I really do have

1002
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:38,304
Something that space that we really need to nail this with the early adopters

1003
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:41,888
And get it right for that so with that in mind

1004
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:44,192
What do you want the startups

1005
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:45,728
Or established

1006
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:47,264
Tresor in the space

1007
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:49,312
What should they be thinking about

1008
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:50,848
To work with the

1009
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:53,151
Company

1010
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:55,455
Maybe it's just making life easier for

1011
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:58,015
For consumers what are the things they need to take into

1012
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:58,783
Consideration

1013
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:04,671
One thing I would love to just shout out to all the manufacturers and developers and whether their existing

1014
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:07,487
Organizations or whether they're just getting their feet wet in the

1015
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:08,511
Space is

1016
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:11,839
Utilities act across the country across the world

1017
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:12,863
How to play

1018
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:16,447
To help accelerate adoption of this technology in the marketplace

1019
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:18,751
Many utilities across the

1020
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:19,775
The world

1021
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:21,823
Actually have programs like ours

1022
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:25,151
That can can provide incentives for customers or can

1023
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:30,015
Do things in ways that try to accelerate adoption of this technology in the marketplace

1024
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:33,343
The challenge utilities have is that technology

1025
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:34,879
Have to have an effect

1026
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:36,671
A measurable effect

1027
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:39,231
That's where it gets a little tricky

1028
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:43,583
We have to be able to justify our return-on-investment

1029
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:46,911
So we have in our Ally and that Roi shows up for us

1030
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:47,935
As

1031
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:49,727
Savings or conservation

1032
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:53,823
We have to be able to measure that just like a bank would need to measure the

1033
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:56,383
The return on investment in monetary terms

1034
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:58,175
We have to register it as

1035
00:42:58,687 --> 00:42:59,711
Savings so

1036
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:02,527
When I talk to manufacturers I often say

1037
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:04,319
You know it's great that your device

1038
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:09,439
Shows customers how much energy does consuming at this time and how much that energy is cost

1039
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:16,607
If that doesn't cause them to go take action and persistent action that action has to be has to be sticky

1040
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:19,167
Then I'm really I can't do anything with

1041
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:20,703
That's where it gets hard to measure

1042
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:24,799
And especially for talking about small loads but then residential homes

1043
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:26,591
Score in small businesses

1044
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:28,127
Those little tiny

1045
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:30,175
Little loads like light bulbs

1046
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:32,991
Better internet and then everybody uses them differently

1047
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:34,783
Televisions and

1048
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:36,319
Curling irons curling irons

1049
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:39,135
We can help from a Utility side

1050
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:42,207
It accelerating adoption of these Technologies in the mark

1051
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:48,607
Place with the technologies that was cells have to come in with a way for us to measure the effect and the

1052
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:52,447
How is it we have is that that process often takes a while

1053
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:54,751
Because we have to do field studies

1054
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:55,775
We also have

1055
00:43:56,031 --> 00:44:01,151
There's a temperature effect of that device like a thermostat we have to do it over summer and winter

1056
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:04,223
We may have to do it in a variety of different climate zones

1057
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:06,783
California is Rife with climate zones

1058
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:12,159
Those processes take a while in order to really do the scientific study to

1059
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:16,255
Determine the actual effect of a piece of technology or a

1060
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:20,607
Combination of Technologies on a customer's usage

1061
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:23,679
Got it now you also mentioned a couple things that

1062
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:26,239
Like I imagine most startups or

1063
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:29,567
Manufacturers are like okay

1064
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:33,151
Then you have some other things like

1065
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:34,943
I don't know how much startups think about

1066
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:36,735
What else is there

1067
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:40,319
That you're like oh by the way you need this to those things definitely help

1068
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:45,695
To make sure there is a audio out there that has reviewed your technology and make sure it's

1069
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:46,719
If it needs

1070
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:48,767
Safety standards and

1071
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:53,631
Other qualities that are going to be promoted we don't want somebody's house to catch on fire

1072
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:55,423
Now what about security

1073
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:57,471
Because now that becomes

1074
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:58,751
Now everybody's like

1075
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:01,567
Crap I'll just connect and stuff it may not be the best thing

1076
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:03,103
Install

1077
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:06,175
That is a big concern of a lot of consumers

1078
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:08,735
And every time the news

1079
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:10,015
Comes out with the latest

1080
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:11,551
Breach and somebody's

1081
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:17,951
Smart technology stuff I mean I just watched an old episode of Modern Family Modern Family where the

1082
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:21,023
They were overhearing the neighbors baby monitor

1083
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:24,607
To be fair that was doable all the way back in the

1084
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:26,143
The 900

1085
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:27,935
But I do I do

1086
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:34,335
Do you think a lot of consumers are very concerned about the security and I think our responsibility I consider us it a trusted energy advisor

1087
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:38,943
And I think we're moving into this space where we need to also provide cuss

1088
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:39,967
Northwest

1089
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:41,759
Information on

1090
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:42,527
How they can

1091
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:44,063
Keep their systems as a

1092
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:50,207
Secure is possible and I actually just recently wrote a piece for our website so that that we could

1093
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:53,023
Just haven't have some references for customers

1094
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:56,095
To go online in and take a look at different

1095
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:57,375
Buying advice

1096
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:59,935
When they consider connecting SmartThings and then just

1097
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:00,959
Fundamentals

1098
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:04,799
Security things to consider like you know just make sure that you have your

1099
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:11,711
Most secure settings on your wireless system that you don't identify your home or your family address

1100
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:15,551
Or your family name or the device name in the

1101
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:17,087
In the description

1102
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:18,111
So that people

1103
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:24,767
Can't hack into it make sure you change the password to something strong and secure don't use the one that came with the product and don't use

1104
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:26,047
Something that you

1105
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:27,583
You use for other things

1106
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:29,119
Common Sense things

1107
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:31,423
But we are putting up on our website

1108
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:35,263
For our consumers to discover and we're trying to help them make

1109
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:41,663
Good decisions on how they repair things together so if they decide to go down the echo route what works

1110
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:46,783
Good luck with that it's a it's a pretty big challenge you know and I think

1111
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:53,183
You seen some of that the work that we've contracted with to get this list of technology so that we can try to figure out these cross

1112
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:56,767
Pairings that we might be able to help customers figure out

1113
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:00,095
How does

1114
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:01,375
PG&E

1115
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:02,143
Prepare

1116
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:02,911
Itself

1117
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:03,935
For things like

1118
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:10,335
Demand response that step one but then you think about the effect of Renewables on the grid how are you guys planning

1119
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:11,103
When to use Chi

1120
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:11,871
Coyote

1121
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:18,783
Operations we have several different initiatives across the organization that I am not fully tapped into

1122
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:25,183
Mattress pumps it's within our organization and customer Energy Solutions and said that Groot is always looking at

1123
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:29,279
How do we manage load on the Greyhound that stature megawatt in kilowatt

1124
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:30,559
That's your demand

1125
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:31,327
And

1126
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:33,375
Our demand is shifting

1127
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:40,031
Where will you have pizza man in the middle of the afternoon on those hot days in the summer when all the businesses were

1128
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:40,799
Hainan

1129
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:42,591
Consumers are also consuming

1130
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:45,407
With so much proliferation of solar

1131
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:46,943
In our territory

1132
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:48,991
The demand to shift it till later in the afternoon

1133
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:51,039
When the Sun Goes Down

1134
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:57,439
You don't have as much solar production I'm not sure how many people are actually aware of that that you're sober isn't producing when the Sun

1135
00:47:57,695 --> 00:47:58,463
Isn't shining

1136
00:47:58,719 --> 00:47:59,743
Which is an interesting

1137
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:04,351
And I'm so the demand has shifted to later in the afternoon to like 6 at night

1138
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:07,167
So for many years decades

1139
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:13,567
Steven Wilson asking our customers to reduce their energy consumption on those super hot days in the summer when the grid needs some early

1140
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:17,407
And now we're trying to ship everyone to realize that that

1141
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:18,687
Happening later

1142
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:19,455
When

1143
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:20,479
The sun goes down

1144
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:22,783
Consumers get home and start flipping things on

1145
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:25,087
To cook dinner and to get ready for their evening

1146
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:26,879
So we look at at

1147
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:33,535
Did opportunities in end the challenge that the utilities are going to have across the country in the world and this is how

1148
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:35,839
Having a lion you're up to with a lot of solar pain

1149
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:36,607
Coming online

1150
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:39,167
Where you're really moving from

1151
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:41,215
Customers being passive

1152
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:44,799
And receiving your your services gas and electricity

1153
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:46,847
At what we lovingly referred to as

1154
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:48,383
Cold beer and hot showers

1155
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:49,919
Stop static gauges

1156
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:51,455
Two more of a

1157
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:52,735
Prosumer

1158
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:54,015
Partnership

1159
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:56,831
Where we may need you to react

1160
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:59,135
And ask you to react to be a partner

1161
00:48:59,391 --> 00:48:59,903
Frost

1162
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:05,535
Situation because you may have storage or you may have extrasolar that you can push back to the grid

1163
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:08,607
And some of that is happening today but some of that is really just

1164
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:10,399
Planning for the scenarios in the

1165
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:11,167
Teacher

1166
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:12,447
And pulling out together

1167
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:14,239
And looking at how those

1168
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:16,799
Integrated demand-side resources

1169
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:19,871
Fit into the whole transmission and distribution

1170
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:22,431
Infrastructure that's been around for a hundred years

1171
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:26,527
