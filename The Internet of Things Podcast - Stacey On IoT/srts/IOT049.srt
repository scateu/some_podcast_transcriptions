00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:14,336
Your co-host

00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:15,360
Kevin tofel

5
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:18,688
Today we have got a great show for you we have got

6
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:20,480
Nest new features from it

7
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:22,272
We're going to talk about the Amazon.

8
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:23,296
Intapp we got

9
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:25,088
Awesome updates on semiconductor sales

10
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,624
We've got mozilla's

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,904
Iot strategy

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:28,928
What's up with that

13
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:30,464
And I'm a

14
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,256
Even talk to you about why I

15
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:35,328
I'm not sure we should call the Internet of Things The Internet of Things anymore

16
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,352
So

17
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:37,120
Big Show

18
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:39,168
But because I'm traveling

19
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:41,472
A the sound quality maybe a little iffy

20
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:43,264
MP we don't have a guest

21
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,800
This is Jessica Kevin and Stacey

22
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:45,568
Baby show

23
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:47,104
We'll make due

24
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:48,384
We had a blast.

25
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:51,712
All right now wait to get to the Amazon stuff we'll talk about it later

26
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:52,736
West 1st

27
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:53,504
Asperger's

28
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:55,296
So

29
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:56,320
Nest isn't

30
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:57,344
I think

31
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,880
Is great will let you talk about it

32
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,536
Yes there are two new features coming to Nest thermostats which is nice cuz we never had we had a ton of

33
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:10,912
New features lately the two figures are family accounts and home away assist

34
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:13,216
They are pretty much what they sound like

35
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:14,240
Family counts

36
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:18,080
You don't have to after the you get this update you won't have to

37
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:19,872
Share your login your password

38
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:20,640
Because right now

39
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:25,248
You don't like on my Nest I'm signed in with my own Gmail account and

40
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:26,272
Amion password

41
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:28,832
I have to give that to everybody in the family not a big deal

42
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,880
Pretty much trust my family but still

43
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:34,720
It can be a bit of a hassle for other people who want to share their nest

44
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:37,024
Access family access to the

45
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,560
Set thermostat without

46
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:40,352
Sharing credentials so that's kind of

47
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,120
Cool

48
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:43,680
Leaving the throne copy of the monthly home report

49
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:46,496
Which I like to see all my little leaves as i r in them

50
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:48,544
Solar house

51
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:52,128
Lots of leaves on trees

52
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:55,968
Yes so there's that I know you're pretty excited about the family accounts

53
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:57,248
I am so

54
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,528
Well I'm excited about boats

55
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:01,088
The second picture is

56
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,952
Basically it's an improvement on the features

57
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:08,000
Nest traditionally has used

58
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:10,816
IR sensor proximity sensor

59
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:12,096
Tire sensor on the thermostat

60
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:15,936
But they've also built

61
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:16,704
What's an algorithm

62
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,056
Hey early in the morning if you don't sense motion

63
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:23,872
It's most likely that someone has left the house

64
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,152
Like for the day

65
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:28,736
And so it'll more quickly transition to the away mode when they

66
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,272
Turn off your heat or AC

67
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:31,296
If possible

68
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,320
And so

69
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:35,136
What they've done now is there using you

70
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:35,904
Your phone

71
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,976
Because I don't know I just happens to me a lot cuz my office

72
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:42,048
It's not near the thermostat I'll be in my office for a while

73
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:45,120
What happened

74
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,656
My head out

75
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:55,104
And I'm in the same boat because my home office is on the second floor of the nests in the first floor in

76
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,992
You know their initial attempt to do home away settings I think was a step forward at the time

77
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:03,040
But now they're taking advantage of

78
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:05,600
Available hardware and smarts today

79
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:07,136
To bring It Forward even more I think

80
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,440
Yes there's a couple things

81
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:11,744
This one is the big macro thing that I love from

82
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:13,536
Twitches

83
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:14,816
Masters final

84
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:16,608
Getting things ready for the fact

85
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,216
People don't live in a home by themselves people live in a home usually

86
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,264
So

87
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,056
This is great because the family account

88
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:25,824
How to make it

89
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,152
Very easy to share and you don't like let's say you've got

90
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:32,992
Airbnb are you get gas coming and you can't even give him that without compromise

91
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,272
Security

92
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:37,600
And also kind of comes back to this idea of like your home

93
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:39,136
Maybe getting its own email address

94
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:41,184
Previous shows about this

Scott Jensen

97
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,024
Who works at Google

98
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:45,792
He's like

99
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:48,096
I don't actually like my home having an email address

100
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:50,912
It's still better than one person

101
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:53,728
Being tied to a device so having a home

102
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,264
Or Family Ties

103
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,032
Two devices

104
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:59,360
And then the same thing for the

105
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:04,480
A wasting that's also a nice way to kind of keep track of a number of people in the home

106
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,272
Especially in a larger home with

107
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,808
Upstairs Downstairs

108
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:08,832
Unless whatever

109
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:12,928
Working on this with Integrations from

110
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,208
A bunch of other partners like

111
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:19,583
Zoo leaders I'm testing out some lights right now that that I'm home

112
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,631
Even when I'm not in front of my nest

113
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:22,911
So there's

114
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,959
There's other ways of doing this that aren't the phone

115
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:25,727
Especially

116
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:26,751
If you're someone who

117
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:27,519
It's like

118
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,799
I don't have a cell phone

119
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,383
Or you got a kid that maybe doesn't

120
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:38,271
Actually that's the key I don't know if he made that clear up front so I apologize for the home away assist uses

121
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:40,319
Your phone data sensors on your phone

122
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:42,367
To help Nest understand who

123
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:44,671
Is home and or who is away

124
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:47,487
Whether it's GPS sensors or whatever else

125
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:49,535
Rental homes

126
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,815
So they're expanding their

127
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:53,887
Smart around proximity who is home and

128
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:56,191
Is anybody home and visitor who is it

129
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:58,751
So this is an opt-in feature by the way

130
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:01,567
It says when family members opt-in

131
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:04,127
It lets the harmonious use data from the phone

132
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,687
For the nest so you don't have to use

133
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:09,503
This feature I know some people may have concerns about privacy and

134
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,063
GPS in geofencing and all that so

135
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,855
But the nice thing is if you do opt in

136
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:16,415
The home away assist won't switch

137
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,695
To away

138
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:21,535
If they're still somebody in the house if it and it knows that through the phone

139
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:24,351
So I like this because Nest is it essentially

140
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,631
Expanding its presence

141
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:29,727
Yeah and if you think about it it also gives you away to say hey

142
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:34,591
If I'm the only person in the whole because now it's got a family account

143
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:36,895
It can say

144
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:39,199
Stacy is right now the only person home

145
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:42,015
I could then setup my Integrations to work

146
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:44,063
With things I like when I'm home

147
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:47,391
So that's kind of cool especially if you

148
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,159
Like you and your

149
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,439
Pick another fight a lot over the

150
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,207
Temperature

151
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,743
Like

152
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:54,303
This is not a feature by the way that Nest is offering now

153
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,839
Thinking forward

154
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:57,375
Think about things like

155
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:59,423
My guess is Stacy's home

156
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,727
She likes it you know 75 degree

157
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:05,055
Oh Stacy's husband's home and he's by himself he loves it

158
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:05,823
68

159
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:08,127
I would expect them to expand

160
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:10,175
To that type of personalization

161
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:13,503
In the future man I know I will see a technical reason for not happening

162
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:14,527
I don't either

163
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:15,551
What does it mean

164
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,087
It will

165
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:21,439
Complex and then they've always been

166
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:24,255
Depart of themselves on being

167
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,791
Really easy for

168
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:27,071
Consumers to get

169
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,607
So you don't have to wake

170
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,911
There's not a lot of programming there's not a lot of

171
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,959
Conditional statements you're making

172
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:34,751
You know a lot of that stuff that

173
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:36,543
Happens with a lot of other application

174
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,847
Ensign services

175
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,151
Okay

176
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:43,967
So that is the nest news and it's pretty good

177
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:47,039
I can't wait to try these features on my nest and see what have

178
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:50,879
Will light in the South with Mozilla and its iot strata

179
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,975
Kevin has a penny

180
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:59,839
We should say back in February so February Mazzella said hey we're going to not be

181
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:01,375
A mobile browser kind of

182
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:03,935
I think we're going to be a connected device company

183
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:06,495
And they decided that that's where they were going to focus

184
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,775
Add Mozilla

185
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:11,871
You're not aware is the creator of the Firefox browser

186
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:17,503
Tan and gray things to advance the web in an open-source over the past house at least decade

187
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,319
And I have nothing but respect for what they've done

188
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:22,879
And unfortunately hasn't really panned out

189
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:28,511
Firefox browser market share has been declining in the face of other browsers and Salon

190
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,303
And they're kind of pivoting a little bit but

191
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:35,423
You know I think there's still a lot they can do here I think it's a smart move for them to get into it IRT

192
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:36,959
Space I mean

193
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:39,775
You stepped back a week because they announced a couple of

194
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:44,127
A potential Solutions as they say on their on their blog for iot such as

195
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,687
Endless Run 3 is real quick project link

196
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,807
Which is at personal user agent that understands preferences for how you want to interact with devices

197
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,135
Father's project sensor web so it's a way to get

198
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:58,207
Data from sensors to

199
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:00,255
Apps and such there it is

200
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,791
Project Smart Home

201
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:07,679
Which they say is a middle ground between solution such as apple homekit and the Raspberry Pi so they want to

202
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:11,007
Middle Ground between the in a box solution and then do it yourself

203
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:14,591
Elena project Vanni which is an

204
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:17,663
IRT enabler package for developers and device makers

205
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,247
I want to add a voice interface to their devices which sounds really cool

206
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:23,039
It all sounds really cool I'll be honest

207
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,831
Banana pudding on my

208
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,367
Opinion hat for a second

209
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,159
And it just seems to me like

210
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:30,463
A lot of this already exists

211
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,999
And it works

212
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:32,767
Pretty well

213
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:38,655
So it kind of saddens me to see Missoula used too often be at the Forefront of new technology

214
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:40,703
And leading the way perfectly with some

215
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,239
Open source approaches to it

216
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:44,287
Now trying to

217
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,567
I'll say ketchup

218
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,103
To say for voicemail

219
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:50,687
Go to the series in the Google Now is in the Amazon voice services and so on

220
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:53,503
And I say that because when I look at their Wiki

221
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:56,063
Thanks for that project Danny which is the voice enabling

222
00:08:56,575 --> 00:09:02,719
They're saying right now the van team is brainstorming how we can create our own unique solution that does not have to compete with or catch up with

223
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,279
The existing players such as Siri and Google Now

224
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:08,095
It seems like they're just

225
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:14,495
Floating an idea out there that really not don't have a lot of focus yet and I'm not sure there's a big need for what they're going to

226
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:17,055
Potentially offer if they offer anything at all

227
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:21,663
So that's the best I take my pain and head off now and I'll shoot it over to you for your thoughts cuz

228
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,199
I want a bathroom too much air

229
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,735
No that's fine in time

230
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,343
Privacy and

231
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,159
Which I think is a reason

232
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,439
That you could

233
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:35,487
See something like this flourishing

234
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:41,119
And maybe Danny is a terrible example

235
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,423
The project smart home sounds a lot like

236
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,215
Something like SmartThings only

237
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:48,799
It sounds like it would be completely open as opposed to being built

238
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,103
I would love

239
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:55,199
Something like this I think if it got enough market share

240
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,479
You could see

241
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:58,527
Developers building for this

242
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,295
In a way that

243
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:03,135
It makes him not have to participate with some of these closed-door ecosystems

244
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:06,463
Resources you could just pick one that you could pick something

245
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,743
Hidden Lake Project

246
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:11,327
Especially with them

247
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,887
Established already

248
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,703
And in their wikis

249
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,727
Things on it

250
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:20,543
Wow this is really

251
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,823
I'm with you on

252
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:25,919
Choices good in the end they could offer something at the others

253
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:29,247
Don't especially when it comes to you no privacy security

254
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:32,063
Simplicity. Some of the things you did mention

255
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,855
But is that going to be enough

256
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,647
At this point in time

257
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:38,463
I don't know I do know there are things I would like

258
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:43,327
So on The Voice side I would love to see if I can if this then that service

259
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,375
Integration

260
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,143
Amazon Echo

261
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,191
So I think that would be

262
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:48,959
Awesome

263
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:49,983
If I were

264
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:52,799
It just a little bit easier than their STK which is

265
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,079
Great Bear Lake

266
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:56,895
Developers

267
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:57,919
Going to build their own

268
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:02,527
Suffer for this a little easier and I think it'd be kind of

269
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,807
Awesome to have it

270
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:07,391
So I think that would be

271
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:14,559
On the open side you know if if they could create like a true bridge between something like homekit and all the other stuff out on the

272
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:15,327
Market

273
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,607
That would be really valuable

274
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,911
You just don't know if that's

275
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,959
In all of these are very much

276
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:21,727
Much like

277
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:24,287
We are literally throwing this

278
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,967
You know props to them for being late

279
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,503
Hey Ya

280
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,295
So that's what mozilla's doing

281
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:37,599
I think we should probably talk

282
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:39,903
About what would you chew quick items

283
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,671
Amazon

284
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,767
We are going to talk

285
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,095
A report came out

286
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,119
For the McLean group

287
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,167
Semiconductors

288
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:52,959
You guys are like

289
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,751
Who cares but

290
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,031
We are about to hit

291
00:11:56,287 --> 00:12:00,127
1 trillion semiconductors sold by 2018

292
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,431
In a single year

293
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,967
That is one trillion

294
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,247
And that is a lot

295
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,271
A semiconductor

296
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,063
What's kind of exciting

297
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:11,903
And it just give you a sense the industry is expected to sell

298
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:12,927
800

299
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,719
An 86.7

300
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:16,511
This year

301
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:17,535
September

302
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,327
This is all anytime.

303
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:23,167
Play ten million

304
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:27,775
Yeah and then they say 950 billion Siamese next year and then it's

305
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,567
1.02 trillion in

306
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:34,943
In 2018 which has happened to coincide with the number of zeros in a trillion 18

307
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:36,991
Ingrate

308
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,527
We know cuz we chat before the show

309
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,295
We did

310
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:43,903
Before you guys get like and it's not just the Internet of Things

311
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:44,671
This is just a

312
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,207
Ramp up

313
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:49,535
We just use more chips because we can there cheaper

314
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,583
The average selling price of these chips

315
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,375
Is only $0.30

316
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:56,447
It's because over 70% of these chips are in

317
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,215
Include

318
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,519
Opto sensor discrete

319
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:03,103
So these are like tiny little things like actuators

320
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,919
Resistor is little power management chips

321
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,967
Little tiny bits that you

322
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:08,735
You sticking

323
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:09,503
Senior phone

324
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,295
International single-purpose

325
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,087
It's been expensive chips

326
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:15,391
That brings the average selling price down

327
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,463
But they're still

328
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:21,791
Pisces which are integrated circuits which of the fancier things like

329
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,327
Microcontrollers

330
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,119
Application process Solutions

331
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,423
Server chips

332
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,215
So lot of chips

333
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:34,847
It was crazy about this as if this didn't happen I mean I mean I know this is going to sound obvious but

334
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:38,431
Your phone's wouldn't be as powerful as inexpensive as they are relatively

335
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,199
Expensive

336
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:43,039
Iot devices to be a lot more of the easier to get into that market

337
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,831
It just it's amazing

338
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:45,855
What is impacts

339
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,135
It's

340
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:48,671
Are everywhere

341
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:49,695
So

342
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,487
Yay 1 trillion

343
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,535
All right that's it

344
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:57,119
Weird passive Wi-Fi I just wanted to drop you

345
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,911
Because it's not real it's not

346
00:13:59,167 --> 00:13:59,679
Commercialized

347
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,983
I mean it's real that people

348
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:05,823
What is making stuff up today

349
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:10,175
No this is real but it's still research that needs to be commercialized so

350
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,455
Take that as

351
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:13,503
It's called

352
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,295
Passive Wi-Fi and its

353
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:19,391
It's low power Wi-Fi in this isn't like the Halo Wi-Fi spec which is

354
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:23,999
At the Wi-Fi Alliance right now trying to get certified this is

355
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,279
Actually

356
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,559
A way to

357
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:31,679
Transmit Wi-Fi signals using kind of a reflection of a signal called Backscatter

358
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,471
To transmit the data so

359
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,007
Like ten thousand

360
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,031
Sometimes less powers

361
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:40,895
That's a huge huge difference in terms of power and

362
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:47,551
Well I wouldn't say something like this say in a connection that you want always on and always fast cuz I think at the moment they test

363
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:49,855
I stood up to 11 megabits per second

364
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:53,951
You know I could see it lesson phones and tablets and TVs and such

365
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:56,255
Four more in iot devices which

366
00:14:57,023 --> 00:15:00,095
Today might use Bluetooth instead of Wi-Fi and so on

367
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,911
So you're getting Bluetooth like speeds but even

368
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,959
Much less power than the Bluetooth

369
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,775
Yeah and what's kind of neat about it is

370
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:11,359
It's much more Distributing so it's kind of like a peer-to-peer data

371
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:13,151
Link as opposed to Lake

372
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:16,735
Your thing talking to your router and then to the public internet

373
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:19,551
The things can actually use this to talk to each other

374
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,575
And then back to the

375
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:21,855
So

376
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,135
From an architecture

377
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:25,439
This is kind of really fascinating to

378
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,743
But we're just thinking about it

379
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:28,767
Research being done

380
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:29,791
At the University of Hawaii

381
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:32,863
And it looks like I killed a company

382
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:35,935
Call jeeva Wireless jeeva

383
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:37,471
To help commercial Isis

384
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,239
So

385
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:41,055
Be interesting to see if they make this happen

386
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:43,103
Yeah but they've been working on it actually since

387
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:43,871
2014

388
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:46,431
So let's go

389
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:47,967
Hopefully all right

390
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,247
Shall we do it

391
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:52,063
Let's do it been waiting for days to do it

392
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:58,207
Dino Amazon

393
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:59,999
Which is 2 days after

394
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,023
Recorded it so

395
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:01,791
Yeah

396
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:06,143
Lunch tomorrow or the next day

397
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,447
Kevin

398
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:09,983
All right

399
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,007
Foremost

400
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:13,311
Everybody Knows by now but for those that do not

401
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:16,383
Amazon has added two new Echo devices

402
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,175
3D family of echo products

403
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:24,575
When we we had rumors I've been kind of knew about that would be what is called the Amazon tap

404
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:27,647
And that is a smaller version of the current Hardware

405
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:30,207
But it's also portable battery powered

406
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:35,071
And yes you do have to tap the button or press the button before you can get your voice services

407
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,351
Go and get your

408
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,375
You commands in such

409
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,423
The other one kind of came out of left

410
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,191
Field

411
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,215
And I think

412
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:43,519
You and I both ordered it on day one

413
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,847
We did that is the echo Dot

414
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,895
So imagine if you will

415
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,431
Somebody

416
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:56,319
Smashing down Amazon Echo pushing straight down on it to get rid of the your speaker in the height and all that

417
00:16:56,831 --> 00:17:00,927
And that comes up with something that's maybe I don't know 2in tall looks like a hockey puck

418
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:04,767
It's like the top of the echo in the bottom of the echo no middle

419
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:09,375
That's because you're just speaker inside it short of a small speaker similar phone speaker

420
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:10,399
So the

421
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,167
God

422
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:13,727
Is always listening always on which is nice

423
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:18,847
However if you're going to use it for music you would Bluetooth or wired parrot 2

424
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:20,127
A set of speakers

425
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,919
So it's basically

426
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,455
An echo without the speaker

427
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:26,015
The way to add your own speakers to the

428
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:30,879
Self but you prices for these are 12999 for the portable

429
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,159
Echo tap

430
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:36,255
And 8999 for the echo Dot

431
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,535
An interesting way

432
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,327
You can only order the.

433
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:42,655
Through your existing Amazon Echo you had to ask

434
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:45,727
She We Shall Not Be Named to order an echo. Which

435
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,519
Work well for me and I'll die for you

436
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,823
Super Why

437
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,359
If you work around 6

438
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,127
You could do like

439
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,407
I think it is

440
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,943
You could go to the app and do it

441
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:55,967
Some things like that

442
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,039
If you really want it.

443
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:01,599
So quick take you want to go for it or should I go

444
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,415
Well we both were the same thing

445
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:08,255
So let's talk about why you didn't and I can do the same

446
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:10,559
Why you didn't order the Amazon tap

447
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:12,863
Alexa enabled portable speaker

448
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:17,727
So Timmy the tap looks like kind of like we said originally when we were talking about the

449
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:21,567
Does product because it's portable it doesn't have the always-on speaker capability

450
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:24,639
Anatomy voice is a hands-free kind of

451
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:28,479
User interface and tap to touch something to talk to it

452
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:30,271
Sex the magic real

453
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:33,087
So it feels like Amazon here is

454
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,879
I don't know if they're testing

455
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:37,183
The viability of portability

456
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,463
With this product

457
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:40,255
To see if that you know has

458
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:41,791
Is leg somewhere

459
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:48,191
Send me $430 to get basically a Bluetooth speaker with with Amazon voice services

460
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:48,959
A lot of money

461
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:52,799
Nothing I wanted yeah I mean it's all about the portability

462
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:54,335
I completely agree with you

463
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:57,151
And I don't think I'm going to changes having to Tap a button

464
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,431
To do voice services

465
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,967
It does take the magic out

466
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:00,991
What is the

467
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:05,343
Like the magic the coolest thing about the current Echo it's the fact that

468
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:11,231
Anybody who is it within voice range can ask it a question send a command get information

469
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:14,047
Having to walk over and tap the button I know it sounds like a

470
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:15,327
First world problems

471
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:18,399
Really that's the magic of the device so

472
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:24,799
I'm a little disappointed this this comes with a little charging puff that you plug in and you set this Amazon tap on tablet

473
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:25,567
Charging pack

474
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:28,383
And I really thought I think I said in a private show

475
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:29,663
I really thought

476
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,735
Maybe they will enable it so that if it's sitting on the charging

477
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:36,319
Meaning it's not going to use the internal battery for power

478
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:40,415
Maybe we're having always listening mode it does not from what I can see so far

479
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:42,719
That could be changing the future but then again

480
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:46,559
It is called the tap I don't think I'm going to take the path away

481
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:48,607
Ya don't say anything

482
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:49,375
Cute app

483
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,655
How do you feel about this

484
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,703
A little device

485
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,471
So

486
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:54,239
I don't know

487
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,007
So that's

488
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,799
I am very curious

489
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,335
Like looks at the tap

490
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:00,895
That is something I need in my life

491
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:02,431
Please let us know why

492
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:06,015
We won't make fun of you really really

493
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,807
Maybe I'll go

494
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:12,671
The voice is Magic

495
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:20,351
Maybe I mean and I totally get the pole portability thing I mean I've always wish I could it was easier to move around the current

496
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,119
Echo that I have

497
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,423
The answer right now is go buy more echoes

498
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:29,567
So this geocache this is another Echo but this can go anywhere in the battery will last for up to 9 hours of playback and

499
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,615
And if it had always on voice

500
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:36,223
Listening then it would last for 9 hours so I totally understand why they're doing it that way

501
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,039
It doesn't give you any other features that

502
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:42,111
The existing Echo has other than really portability

503
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,927
Now on to the Amazon

504
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:46,975
I ordered it

505
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:47,743
You ordered it

506
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:48,511
Kevin

507
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:50,815
I mean the fact is okay it's

508
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:52,863
It's an Echo - the Maine

509
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:53,631
Speaker

510
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:54,399
But

511
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:57,215
I can put several of these around the house

512
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:59,775
And instead of having to

513
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:05,919
Going to a particular room to use the the echo on you know I can do it throughout my house now it's

514
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:09,759
Adding microphones and stands small speakers in the House Everywhere I Go

515
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:13,343
Be invisible interface that's what I want my house wherever I am in the house if I want

516
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,879
To control the house

517
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:17,184
Music writer I just want to do what I don't have

518
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,488
I have to go somewhere or Tap a button

519
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,768
Or whatnot so

520
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,328
Doesn't do anything differently but

521
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,864
I just like the idea of

522
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,168
Buying one of these as opposed to

523
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,192
Spending

524
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:30,240
You know double the money for a full

525
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,264
Amazon Echo

526
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:34,336
Also a lot of people really like to use their own speakers

527
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:35,616
So

528
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:36,640
You can do this

529
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:43,296
You can do that with that since I meant to do that so I like that as well I don't need speakers in every room

530
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:44,576
Define with

531
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:48,416
Just having a small phone like speaker that can read back anything I ask

532
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:53,280
The echo so I'm fine with that so to me it's just a way to expand my echo ecosystem in the house

533
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:55,328
At a relatively low cost

534
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,912
Two of those for one Echo

535
00:21:59,168 --> 00:21:59,680
And so

536
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:00,960
If I cuz I was looking at

537
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:01,728
Buy another

538
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,592
So

539
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,896
Where is your Echo today where do you think

540
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:14,528
My echo today is about 3 feet from where I'm sitting right now on my second floor home office

541
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,064
Yeah I do have

542
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:22,464
A Fire TV with a voice remote downstairs in one of the base of the family room

543
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,000
So we could do

544
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,280
Things through

545
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:27,072
Through the voice service through that

546
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:30,656
I hope I put this closer to the kitchen and the main living room

547
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:32,704
Because that's where I spend most of our time

548
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:35,776
Will I use an external speaker and play music on it

549
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:37,056
I don't know

550
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:40,896
We're going to have like a Jambox I could always wire to that or Bluetooth it to that

551
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:41,920
So maybe

552
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:45,760
But it's getting more for informational and smart home control things for me

553
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:50,112
Wiring it into my receiver in

554
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,392
Sticking

555
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,416
In my living room

556
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:54,720
And so

557
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:56,000
But it would go

558
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:56,768
Over my

559
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:57,536
My speakers

560
00:22:58,048 --> 00:23:02,144
And then I'd have all the home control that we already have and then I've moved

561
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,168
Upstairs

562
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:05,728
Go to my officer I still want one in the bathroom

563
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:10,592
Do that the places where we are the most are the places where we want to

564
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:14,688
Control the lights that are around us in the rooms around us when I control the thermostat

565
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,528
Do you know

566
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:19,296
This is crazy

567
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:23,136
Is I want I want to just go out while I'm in the shower like Play the song

568
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:24,928
And I want to know what time it is

569
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,256
Possibly information about like my day or my commute

570
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:30,304
You know while I'm getting ready

571
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:31,328
So

572
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,608
I don't actually

573
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:37,216
For my bathroom

574
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:42,336
Which is why my husband thinks I'm crazy for putting something because he thinks of it totally is a home

575
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:44,128
Echo please flush

576
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:48,480
Touchless

577
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:51,296
No no no

578
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:53,344
Sorry

579
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,112
That's kind of

580
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:55,904
I really actually that's one of the

581
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,720
Few places where I wanted to have like a higher-quality

582
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:03,072
That makes sense and as far as the speaker goes

583
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:06,656
You know I have not heard it I mean that we're buying this Sight & Sound on scene

584
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:09,728
But it basically they do say it includes a built-in speaker

585
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,336
So you can use it as a Smart Alarm Clock in the bedroom and assisted in the kitchen etcetera so

586
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:19,200
Don't feel like you must attach speakers to it if you're just going to use it as a voice

587
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:20,480
Assistant type device

588
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:22,784
You know it will work

589
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:26,624
It's not mandatory to add speakers to it that would be if you're going to listen to music

590
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,440
It's interesting to me because it essentially

591
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:32,512
This has become similar to my current Android phone which

592
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:33,536
I can

593
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:37,376
You know a cat by saying OK Google at any time and then perform voice command

594
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:40,704
And that's always with me so it's very similar in that regard

595
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:43,520
This is so tied into my smart home

596
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:44,800
System right now that

597
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:46,080
It just made sense for me to buy

598
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:47,104
Right

599
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,432
So March 31st is when we get ours

600
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:52,224
What's happening

601
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,552
I'm curious if you know it seems to me like they weren't sure this was going to

602
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:59,392
A big hit just yet so they did what they've done before The Limited

603
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:04,000
Who can purchase at 6 women to one unit per order and only 2 per customer

604
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:07,072
And you had to buy a technically had to buy it

605
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:07,840
Through

606
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:08,608
The echo

607
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,192
Set what wax you could through do it you're an Amazon Fire TV as well so

608
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:14,240
I would have things I don't know that you know

609
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:15,520
Mass-produced

610
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:17,056
Ginormous run of these

611
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,336
As of yet

612
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:19,616
It may just be a test

613
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:20,384
That kind of

614
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:22,176
Amazon

615
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:24,992
But I did think it was kind of weird

616
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:27,552
Because I'm very curious like with a lot of people

617
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:29,088
Reading about the ecobee

618
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,112
Successful

619
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:33,184
And now I'm at this tiny little one

620
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,208
Instead

621
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,280
Cuz it is to say it's a nice lower price points so we'll see

622
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:38,304
And

623
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:41,120
I don't know why I can't wait

624
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:45,472
Yeah I'm looking for 2 minutes again it doesn't do anything that

625
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:51,360
The current one doesn't do base the right price point and it's an easy way to expand if you would like the Amazon ecosystem

626
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:54,688
We do

627
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:55,456
Yay

628
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,224
Okay

629
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,600
The only other thing I wanted to talk about first episode about a bill that was introduced to the Senate last

630
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:02,624
End

631
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:06,976
This is just introduced it may not go anywhere but it's worth talking about because

632
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,536
How to get the Internet of Things

633
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:11,072
Digit bill

634
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:13,888
It's to get the FCC the Federal Communications

635
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:18,496
Commissioned to do a report on and then to regulate The Internet of Things

636
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:20,288
Which is worth notice

637
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,312
Because

638
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:24,640
Up until now most of the efforts around iot

639
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:25,664
I've actually been

640
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,712
Federal Trade Commission

641
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:28,992
To the FTC

642
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:31,808
And that's been around things like data privacy

643
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,344
And devices

644
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,112
Give that up

645
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,672
So there Ben a couple finds out there

646
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:39,744
Basically on establish laws and then now the f

647
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,512
CC

648
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:44,096
Is saying an innocent been kind of burbling over in Washington

649
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,376
Entities to agencies

650
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:46,144
Has it been like

651
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:47,936
Maybe I'll take care of the internet

652
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:50,752
I got it I got I got

653
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,800
So this bill

654
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:54,080
Is basically saying hey

655
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:56,896
Let's give it to the Federal Communications Commission

656
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:58,432
And it's

657
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:03,552
It's calling for a working group till like study this

658
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:04,320
Again

659
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:08,160
And they want the FCC to study whether there's enough Spectrum

660
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:11,232
Yeah the regulatory barriers that might

661
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,512
Exist

662
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:13,792
Getting more Spectrum

663
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:17,120
Understanding what government

664
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:20,704
Stakeholder should be involved in any other regulatory processes

665
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:27,360
I think it makes more sense to be with the FCC then with the FTC quite honestly

666
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,640
What does spectrum stuff

667
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:32,736
Yes there is there's a role for the ftce

668
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:35,552
Asking several agencies to get together to

669
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:37,856
Can a Prius medical reports that will

670
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:40,160
One day possibly lead to laws

671
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:42,464
After this one day possibly leads to Allah

672
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,024
And those agencies of the Department of

673
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:46,048
Asportation

674
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:52,704
Tftc the National Science Foundation and the Department of Commerce including at the national telecommunications and information

675
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,472
Administration

676
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:57,568
If this is a little bit different I think then then Pryor

677
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:59,872
Industry efforts to either regulator

678
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:01,664
Monitor or protect

679
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,944
Citizens and such because

680
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:07,296
IRT is such a broad range of devices and services

681
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:11,648
We talked about car so how do you not have an automobile Regulatory Commission not involved

682
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:14,208
It may make sense in this case to

683
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:16,000
As broad collaboration

684
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:17,024
Between these groups

685
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:20,096
Security and safety in

686
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:22,656
How things will work together and so on so

687
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:29,056
I don't have a problem with this I'm not saying that I'm in all four more regulations or anything but

688
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:30,336
This is something that is

689
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:32,640
This is literally calling for

690
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,408
A report

691
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:35,968
Now that I'm for it

692
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:40,064
Make a report it's going to be like

693
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:46,208
I better run along cuz this industry is changing very quickly

694
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,048
Very quickly

695
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:54,400
It is so this is the developing Innovation and growing The Internet of Things at

696
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:58,240
Which I wonder if you come up with a lob

697
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:00,032
The clever acronyms

698
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:03,872
Probably not

699
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:06,688
Done

700
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:08,480
So this is it this is out there

701
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:09,760
If you guys want to look it up

702
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:10,784
Go for it

703
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,552
Try to follow it

704
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:13,088
We'll keep an eye on it

705
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:14,112
Interesting happens there

706
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:17,184
I think that's

707
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:21,792
I'll be at South by Southwest next week

708
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:25,376
Fighting for their review

709
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:26,400
Are you guys

710
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:29,216
So far

711
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:30,240
And who knows

712
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:31,776
Sounds good

713
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:34,848
That's all for this week

714
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:39,712
Thanks for listening and we'll see you next week on the Internet of Things podcast
