And we also have a message from this week's other sponsor

28
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:01,952
Level education

00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:08,608
Are you prepared for the future iot is going to be huge it's going to be

30
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:15,008
So prepare for the future with iot training from Level education in Cisco they've developed

35
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:36,000
Ready

36
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:38,048
The course starts February 13th

And I find out more go to level edu.com

38
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,264
Okay Kevin

39
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,568
I don't even know

40
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:53,408
How are you holding up I am not at CES just to be clear

41
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:55,712
After 10 years I took a hiatus

42
00:01:55,968 --> 00:02:00,576
So how are you holding up

43
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:05,696
I'm missing it a little bit missing the peeps I'm missing the the town and all the cool gadgets

44
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,232
And there are

45
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:08,256
Are so many cool Gadget

46
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,328
I have seen so much stuff so I have

47
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:12,352
Connected hairbrush

48
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,120
Toothbrushes

49
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,656
Scooters

50
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:17,472
Space heaters that are powered by CPUs that

51
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:20,800
Actually felt the compute power from them

52
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:21,568
Icing

53
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:23,104
Car stuff I've seen

54
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,640
Appliances that work with

55
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:25,664
The echo

56
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:26,944
I have seen

57
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,224
Other echoes

58
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:29,504
I've seen robots

59
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:30,784
Racine

60
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,064
Lights

61
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:32,832
Always sunny

62
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,648
I have seen the future and it is iot

63
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,672
Exact

64
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:40,256
There were there actually have been many cancer

65
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,024
Watches

66
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,304
I just don't care about

67
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,608
Basically if you can put

68
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,888
A chip in it

69
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:47,424
It exists so

70
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,448
Will kick it off with

71
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,216
Crazy stuff

72
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:55,104
First the craziest thing I was at CES unveiled last night which is a bunch of startups and

73
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,128
Keppra

74
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,152
Look at it

75
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:01,504
And the craziest thing I saw was connected

76
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,528
Grooming products

77
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,320
This is apparently a theme

78
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:05,600
So

79
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:10,976
There are connected toothbrushes and there have been for a while and I've actually tried it connected to

80
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:11,744
Thrush

81
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,024
Colibri

82
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,048
Never say the name

83
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:17,120
Is a French company and they're making a toothbrush

84
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,168
But now has a i

85
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,704
Help you brush better

86
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:24,544
And if you want to just come by and to macro-trends together

87
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,336
Iot + AI

88
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:30,432
It basically means that like this device is tracking all this data about you and it's

89
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,200
Trying to adapt

90
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,064
Become sentient and

91
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:39,136
Or breakfast

92
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:39,904
Let's hope

93
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:42,208
Monumental it's gone

94
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:44,512
This toothbrush

95
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:50,144
People that tells everything right there

96
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:55,264
I think they've had one for a while

97
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:57,824
This is $79 for this toothbrush

98
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,872
That's a special introductory price

99
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:01,152
130

100
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,224
I will tell you that there is a company that makes

101
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:08,832
A beam connected toothbrush that is actually the toothbrush as part of an insurance

102
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,392
So you buy your insurance

103
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:12,416
Invasive

104
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:14,208
Through beam and they send you this to

105
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,000
So

106
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:18,559
There is a business model here

107
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:19,839
I don't know if it's okay

108
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:20,607
Consumer business

109
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,143
No

110
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:24,191
There you go you let you know that you're brushing have

111
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,471
Even more ridiculous

112
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:26,751
Kevin do you want to tell them

113
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:34,687
Well considering I haven't even combed my hair yet today I think yes it would be a good thing for me to talk about

114
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,223
Nstemi

115
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,503
But I could be wrong

116
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,039
People may disagree and that's fine

117
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,063
To me this is just

118
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:44,415
A classic case of let's put chips and something and Paulette smart because we can

119
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:46,975
This is a new hairbrush

120
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:51,327
That is the collaboration of why things

121
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,119
Which is owned by Nokia

122
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,911
And L'Oreal

123
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:59,007
Which is very prominent in the personal care space

124
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:01,311
They've created a hair brush that has

125
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,359
Both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth

126
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,151
And of course it has an app

127
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:09,503
I'm not on the toothbrush on 50 a hairbrush rather but on your phone

128
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:12,063
Are there sensors in the hairbrush

129
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:16,159
Based on the sensors and

130
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:21,791
The hairbrush can determine if your hair is unruly because maybe you spend a lot of time

131
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:25,887
Coming or brushing your hair today I can tell if your hair is damaged

132
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:28,959
Has breakage is dry Tangled

133
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:30,239
How do you has a microphone

134
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:32,799
I mean microphone accelerometer gyroscope

135
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:37,919
The microphone might be useful because

136
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:40,479
The hairbrush was employed as a microphone

137
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,247
When we did our dance

138
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:46,623
Yeah but it's not really there for a karaoke

139
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,695
Hear your hairbrush patterns according to

140
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,975
Eric Stokes

141
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,255
It sounds

142
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:54,815
Interesting and interesting use of

143
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:56,607
Applying technology and sensors

144
00:05:56,863 --> 00:06:02,751
Really do we really need that I mean this thing's going to cost I think over $200

145
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:03,775
As a lot of my

146
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,311
I will be out of

147
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:09,919
I will say the only thing the only Pro there and I wouldn't

148
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,711
Is my daughter has

149
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,735
Unruly

150
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:16,319
Tangled hair and I think part of that reason is cuz she doesn't always brush it

151
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,367
She's like me I asked

152
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:22,975
Also because I

153
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:25,535
And she doesn't brush her hair but she needs

154
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:26,559
And

155
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:29,119
Holy cow I would love something that's like

156
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:30,655
Brush your hair

157
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:31,679
Brush your hair

158
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:32,703
And tells her

159
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:33,983
But that's about it

160
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:39,103
That use case makes sense to me

161
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,895
But I'm not even sure

162
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:46,783
That this will do that I think this is going to capture all the information of the brushing activity nut

163
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,063
Remind you

164
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,343
Tooth brushing activity

165
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:55,487
Will insult this segues nicely into another theme that I'm seeing is seeing

166
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:56,767
Witches

167
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,303
Data collection

168
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,327
So

169
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,351
Bye

170
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,143
Like so

171
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,679
L'Oreal I'm sure

172
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,983
I'm sure that the data they get here

173
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,263
From everybody's hair

174
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,591
Thousand times better than Market data

175
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,127
Consumers

176
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,431
They're like

177
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:16,223
I can sell you the exact

178
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,503
Conditioner and shampoo

179
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:21,087
And that kind of ties into

180
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,135
A couple other products

181
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,415
That we seen

182
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,695
Which is

183
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,463
There is a

184
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:27,743
Smart

185
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:30,303
Echo like device called the Aristotle

186
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,399
For kids and basically

187
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:37,983
It is a baby monitor you can talk to it

188
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,519
It also has a camera

189
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,311
What's interesting is its

190
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:42,591
It's designed to give

191
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,615
Your baby

192
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,407
Let's talk with your baby a bit

193
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,431
But

194
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:51,295
It also does things like if it's seizure child playing with a Mattel toy

195
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:53,855
It's going to the ideas that it will

196
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,647
Produce extra special effects

197
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,719
And then all of that data is going to go back

198
00:07:59,231 --> 00:07:59,999
2 Mattel

199
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,535
So basically

200
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:06,143
You're spending $300 to enroll your child in the most intrusive Focus

201
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:13,055
Yes I know that's worth a lot to a company such as Mattel in this case

202
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:13,823
It's an

203
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:17,407
I want an easy way but it's an effective way for them to

204
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,431
To get

205
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,479
Product information on how

206
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,015
Kids use their products

207
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:24,575
What preferences these kids may have

208
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:27,391
And let's do some towards other products and so on

209
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:31,743
Yeah I mean it in a sense you this almost goes all the way back to

210
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:35,071
When I first started Loyalty cards reward cards in stores

211
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:40,959
Henry's like I always are great I get discounts on my stuff yes but you were giving up all your demands preferences

212
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:42,239
To the stores

213
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:44,287
And this is just I'll call her in a while

214
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,823
More modern way to do so

215
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:46,847
Loyalty cards

216
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:47,615
2.0

217
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:53,759
Ana titer the same thing because it's not just happening

218
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,295
In your home

219
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:58,111
UnitedHealthcare has a program called UnitedHealth

220
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:58,879
Ocean

221
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,927
And what it does is it offers

222
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:01,695
Employers

223
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,743
Your boss basically

224
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:09,119
The ability to gather Fitness data and set goals for their

225
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:12,191
Employees like walk 10000 steps a day

226
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:12,959
Where

227
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,751
Walk for 5 minutes

228
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,543
For 6 hours during the day

229
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:20,127
All of these things in the ideas of your

230
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:20,895
Please

231
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,431
Can earn up to

232
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,503
$4 a day in Lake health savings account

233
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:27,551
Money

234
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:30,367
So it be money that goes towards your age

235
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,135
HSA

236
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:36,255
And ideas that you know how their employees Cost-U-Less so this is a cheap way to

237
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,559
Can I push your employees to be a little bit

238
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:39,583
Do things that are

239
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,119
Incentivizes

240
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:41,887
Yes

241
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,239
So what they've done at CES is they've done it they've allowed fitbit's

242
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,775
So you can bring your Fitbit

243
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:48,543
Data in

244
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,591
And then they also

245
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,383
How to deal with Qualcomm

246
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,175
Coconuts Health platform

247
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,199
Recalled to life

248
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:59,551
And there are there working with that in the program itself has been expanded to

249
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,831
40 States of

250
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,367
12 States about a year ago

251
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:03,647
So

252
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,719
I really feel like giving all of these things

253
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:09,023
We really need to start having this

254
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,047
Conversation

255
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:11,583
About privacy

256
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:14,143
Is it make people aware that

257
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,423
Can you use these

258
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,703
Products right now

259
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,239
Your data

260
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:21,055
In most cases is going to accompany

261
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:23,615
And they're going to be using it and it's not negative

262
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,663
You don't know

263
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,455
To make a better toy

264
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:30,783
You know based on watching kids play it's not a

265
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,063
Bad goal

266
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,671
No but what worries me a little bit

267
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:39,743
Companies have been collecting data for years so that's not different

268
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:40,511
But

269
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,815
In this particular case Okay so the data

270
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:45,631
Is going back to United Healthcare and that can

271
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:46,655
Save

272
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,959
People money because they get the credits and so on

273
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,495
What is the employer

274
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:55,103
Is getting that information to and I do not know that they are aren't I'm just thinking out loud here

275
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,383
And eventually

276
00:10:56,895 --> 00:11:00,991
Templar start putting that into like job evaluations

277
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:05,343
Will you not as healthy as you need to be to do well in this job I'm so I may be here

278
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:07,647
Mental Fitness is down because you're not

279
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,927
Getting a physical fitness

280
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:11,231
I mean I don't know what I want that

281
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:16,351
That's a real question I have tried it guys so many times to get an HR person on the show

282
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,887
We talked about this

283
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:21,727
Good lucks

284
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,775
The HR people that I have talked to

285
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:24,799
Art on the show

286
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:29,407
They said they don't want that data their company should avoid having that data

287
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:31,455
Because because of issues

288
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:32,735
But it is

289
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:34,015
At a certain point

290
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,039
It is like

291
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,831
How can we not take this

292
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:37,599
Stata

293
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:39,391
Because it will be so

294
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,159
Impactful

295
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,207
Wrecked

296
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:45,023
And that is a big question and that's why if you

297
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,815
Pop supplies in there

298
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:48,607
Standards

299
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,399
Maybe we can

300
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,423
Not even open

301
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,471
Is there a agent that's a door that you

302
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,847
Maybe I'm crazy

303
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:01,407
So I don't think so

304
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:04,479
So there was a lot of stuff for kids

305
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:08,831
There's there's the curry home robot that was roaming around in that

306
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,111
Basically

307
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,903
Visually recognize your kids

308
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,439
Let me tell you guys

309
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,231
Computer vision was

310
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:17,535
Baby sister

311
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:20,095
Which is is good it's actually very helpful

312
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,911
Listening is with

313
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:25,727
Computer vision I mean this the camera sensors have

314
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,519
Incapable

315
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:29,311
Quite a while to enable this

316
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:31,871
That hasn't been issued and that it's been the

317
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:34,687
The machine learning and the recognition

318
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:40,319
Are the algorithms in and sifting through the data to actually make the recognition that's been lacking and I think

319
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:44,927
Many companies have made great strides in the past I'll say two years on that front

320
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:47,487
To bring it to a defective but inexpensive level

321
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:53,375
Yes in this this robot which is not actually available but speed real clear it's not coming out till

322
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,655
Next holiday

323
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,679
So that's crazy

324
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,447
But it's

325
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:58,751
It's $700 at 699

326
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:03,615
Talk to your kids reads to them at Rooms around your house looking for things that are wrong

327
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:14,111
Cuz this is my thing about robots I haven't seen the laundry folding robot that has been touted

328
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,135
Being as being

329
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:18,463
I want my robot to do more than just roll around my home

330
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,279
Cuz I have a dog

331
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,375
As I say my pets do that just fine

332
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,423
So that's my thought

333
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,031
Holy cow

334
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:35,871
The service provider Market with iot is getting really interesting

335
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:38,175
And we're going to talk more about this on the special

336
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,711
Our special edition episode

337
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:40,735
Quickly

338
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:44,319
Alarm.com actually has introduced something called

339
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:46,623
It's insights program and basically

340
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:48,159
Any smart devices

341
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:54,559
They have in your house there pulling data on it and now they can actually proactively notify you when something unusual

342
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,327
Happens in your eye

343
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:58,143
So an example might be

344
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,191
You know if you if you guys

345
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,471
During weekdays

346
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:02,239
Leave

347
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:04,031
And your house is empty

348
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,567
And then the door open

349
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,615
Like maybe one of you forgot something

350
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,407
I'm back in the middle of the day

351
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:14,015
It's actually going to send you a notification cuz that's something weird that happened that doesn't usually happen

352
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,831
It takes into account weekends

353
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:20,671
Holidays that sort of thing so it sounds actually really interesting

354
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,463
The crazy part about the

355
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:26,559
Is there working with Qualcomm to develop a drone

356
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,095
Somehow

357
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:30,655
Your house would launch the Drone

358
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:33,983
When one of these things happened so you could get a visual

359
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,591
That's not real insights is real

360
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:46,527
Interesting I don't want to see all these drones flying up out of my neighbors houses when walking the dog or something

361
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,551
Why won't they

362
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:50,111
Where are the Drone landing pads

363
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,695
That that that is like a legit question

364
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:54,975
Answer

365
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,279
Absolutely I don't know

366
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:59,327
Did the other thing is going back to

367
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:04,959
When it notices using the AI insights platform and notices something different out of the norm

368
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:05,727
I think that's

369
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,775
Interesting but also in a sentence

370
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:08,799
Scary

371
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:11,615
Because I didn't talk about Haiti Security in

372
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,151
And a few seconds but

373
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:16,735
Basically it's learning the patterns of how you

374
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:18,271
Come and go from your house and

375
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:20,319
Do things in your house and so on and so forth

376
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,855
And if that information gets

377
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,391
Use buy some

378
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,927
Third-party dunnuck Nino

379
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,975
Stolen or hack or whatever

380
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:29,791
That's really scary because now it's like

381
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:32,351
I know these folks you know are gone

382
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:36,447
Every other weekend because AI insights is telling me that some

383
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,983
That's kind of concerning to me

384
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,263
Well yes but that's

385
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,823
I need the company will take

386
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,359
Security measures

387
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,127
But that

388
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,663
I think the challenge will be

389
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:48,479
If someone at alarm.com

390
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:51,551
They see that

391
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,087
Acme

392
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:53,855
Who's houses

393
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:56,159
That's a problem that alarm

394
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,279
People like I might

395
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,815
My mother-in-law never stops her

396
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:03,583
Newspaper because

397
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,351
She feels like

398
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:06,143
That person the carrier made

399
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:10,239
Shore shore an antibiotic cement

400
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:15,615
Kind of become accustomed to checking into places online anyway and telling people our whereabouts so

401
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,919
Without knowing the patterns you could

402
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,479
Look at somebody's Facebook page maybe they

403
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:24,319
Get checked into place new account they're not let me go to their house or whatever so it's

404
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,343
Unique

405
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:27,135
New situation it's just

406
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:29,695
I just worry about all that data on my

407
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:30,719
My living pattern

408
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:33,535
That are available in in one spot

409
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,839
And let's talk about the others

410
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:36,607
Security device

411
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:43,263
Yeah so I could swear that just one or two shows a guy said I wish the router companies would

412
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:46,847
Beef up Security on their routers to

413
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:48,383
Kind of integrate

414
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,175
IRT security right

415
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:52,223
Again I don't remember if I did or not if I

416
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:52,991
I should have

417
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:59,391
But it looks like Symantec is actually doing just that Mary have announced the Norton core

418
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,159
Router

419
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:03,999
Which does sort of look like a disco ball is a geodesic dome

420
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,279
Type of

421
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,047
Top shape

422
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:08,607
It has multiple USB ports

423
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,399
Onyx and

424
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:13,727
The big thing here is besides being a typical Wi-Fi router

425
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:14,495
It

426
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:19,871
Can protect your home basically it's kinda like the front door of all your iot devices lock

427
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,663
The front door and everything should be safe

428
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:24,735
So they're using data encryption secure DNS

429
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:27,039
Automatic update switches

430
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:29,855
T I think when it comes to iot security

431
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:32,159
He will help protect your web traffic

432
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:37,279
Give you warnings if there is some insecure or unsecure web traffic going through

433
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,815
Got parental controls

434
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:41,375
You can prioritize Wifi to devices

435
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:43,167
So it's kind of got all of the

436
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:46,495
Table stakes in a regular Wi-Fi router for the home

437
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:47,775
But also adds

438
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:48,799
The

439
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:54,687
Ability to update in case of sick of IRT issues or web attack since on a sofa

440
00:17:55,711 --> 00:18:01,343
I think it is available for pre-order now I know they just announced it but it is approved for $200

441
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:06,719
Which isn't too too bad and that 200 includes a 1 year subscription to their core Security Plus

442
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:11,071
Program for all your updates regular price is going to be $280 so

443
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:16,703
I'm country by cuz I don't need a new router but this is exactly what I want to say I want to see more

444
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:21,311
Security at the router level four but all the iot devices behind the router

445
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:26,175
Of that Nelson ways to do that in Lake

446
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:29,503
There are actually protocols that are like trying to do that

447
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:31,551
By limiting what devices

448
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:32,575
Can talk to

449
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:33,343
What other device

450
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:38,975
Right so that is yet another in it that's not

451
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:41,279
Either or that's kind of an addition

452
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:43,071
So another layer

453
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,607
Okay so

454
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:45,375
More

455
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,399
News

456
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,423
We're just going to run through

457
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,447
Some crazy stuff

458
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:51,263
So speaking of security

459
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,055
The

460
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:56,895
Voice over IP phone company I don't know if you guys remember them

461
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:57,663
There

462
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,687
White terrier

463
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:00,479
They're still around doing well

464
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:02,015
I actually

465
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,807
My buddy and your buddy Kevin

466
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:08,159
Dave's that's noted a couple weeks ago that they had an SEC filing for some

467
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,463
And now it is out

468
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:14,047
It is a home monitoring service that runs on your

469
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:14,815
Hello

470
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:15,583
Smart Home

471
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:16,607
Service

472
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,143
So there's

473
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:20,191
Sensors there are

474
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,983
Basically just add this stuff and it's

475
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:26,079
Again monitored home security there's a camera with motion sensors

476
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:27,615
And

477
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:30,943
You know you can just add this on it becomes like a premium service

478
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:33,503
You can add to your voice calling so it's

479
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,807
It's like maybe it's the new double play

480
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,343
Security invoice

481
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,879
Security of broadband

482
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,439
Got to get your broadband

483
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:46,303
If you're a subscriber I would definitely look at this because

484
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:49,119
All monitoring is $6 extra a month

485
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:51,167
And if your premier

486
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,703
Customer of Ooma service

487
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:54,751
Like

488
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:58,335
So they have a water sensor that's going to be $30

489
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,871
I have to pick up a motion sensor.

490
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:00,895
It's $35

491
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:02,687
Indoor window sensors for 25

492
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,223
Hope there is no video

493
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,271
Okay

494
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:09,855
I think this is interesting it is legit and real it can be

495
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:11,903
Out in the first quarter of this year

496
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:12,927
Yay

497
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,207
Earthquake news

498
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:14,975
August

499
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:16,511
Door lock

500
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,279
Doorbells

501
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,303
Keypads

502
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,095
Actually now integrate with

503
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,631
The Logitech pop

504
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,655
Home switch

505
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:24,703
Andrew Logitech Harmony Home

506
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:28,031
You're not going to be able to unlock your doors with your voice

507
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,055
Guys don't try it

508
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:31,103
But you can

509
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,383
Hit the pot switch

510
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,943
Adorable

511
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:38,783
So if you have like a Goodnight Thing associated with your hot

512
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,831
Top switch now you can add your August door lock

513
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:42,367
Nice

514
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:49,279
So we mow has a couple of updates actually Belkin as couple updates on their WeMo line product line

515
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:55,679
EBay WeMo mini which is a sinner smart plug about half the size of the old WeMo switch witch

516
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:59,519
I still have two of the Insight switches and they are big and bulky

517
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:01,567
These are nice and thin

518
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:06,175
So you don't want you guys to have two of them plug-in dirty easily into a traditional Outlet

519
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:10,527
There's still a little button on there in case you don't want to use your app or use your

520
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:12,831
Voice controls if you'd be to use them

521
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:15,391
I think it is $35 available for

522
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:20,256
Pre-order now I saw an Amazon yesterday January 10th available

523
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:22,560
And it's called the WeMo Mini

524
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,352
Make sense cuz it's Minier

525
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,376
And then they all

526
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:27,936
I was going to interrupt you just to say

527
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:31,008
Tp-link has the same thing

528
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:31,776
Also works

529
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:32,800
Amazon Echo

530
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:35,616
Same style

531
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:39,200
TP Link hs105

532
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:41,760
People been asking me about that that it is a lovely

533
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:43,808
Spark plug and it is $40

534
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:48,672
If they're essential the same I'm going to go with the cheaper one person like a

535
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:51,744
They both work with my account so I'll be happy

536
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:58,656
Yeah and then we will also has a dimmer switch their next-generation smart dimming light switch has a night mode

537
00:21:59,424 --> 00:21:59,936
Prevents heart

538
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:01,472
Harsh lights at night

539
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,592
And this also would work for with voice controls I presume so you could

540
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:09,664
You could Jim things by voice if you have

541
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,456
An echo which is kind of nice

542
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:13,248
Will be in stores later in

543
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:14,272
January

544
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:17,088
This is an actual wall switch that is not like a

545
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:20,160
Plugging kind of thing so this is something off to install I would say

546
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:22,208
Do you know what is so cool about the

547
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,232
Switch

548
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,256
I do not

549
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:28,864
Exists because people have hated the fact that the WeMo light switch

550
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:37,824
But to it has these lovely little LED lights on it and they change color based on what type of

551
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,592
Command

552
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:39,360
Triggered it

553
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:44,736
So if it's a voice command it turns Aqua if it if this then that Amanda turns an amber color

554
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:47,040
And I feel like there's some other colors but

555
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:48,832
I love the idea

556
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:51,648
Of giving someone a visual cue

557
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,232
What triggered it because right now

558
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,024
I have WeMo switches that

559
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,560
Triggered all the time by things

560
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:02,400
And I have no idea what you just did that

561
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:07,264
You know that's kind of a nice thing so if the lights come on in your room all of a sudden you're like

562
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,288
What just happened

563
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:10,848
You can glance over there and you'll see it

564
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,640
Someone gave a voice command to her

565
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:16,224
Why is this in that recipe must have been triggered

566
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:19,808
So that's actually kind of a really nice

567
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:20,832
User interface

568
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:23,136
So I like that a lot

569
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:26,976
Did you get to see this at CES unveiled or some other I did

570
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,512
But I got to see it now

571
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:31,584
They don't know exactly when it's going to be

572
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,120
Out there

573
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:34,656
Expecting it sometime

574
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:37,216
Later this year I bet early this year like

575
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:38,752
The plugs are out

576
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,544
Real life

577
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:41,824
Or not

578
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,384
And I don't think they set pricing it for the lights

579
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:45,664
So

580
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:48,224
We'll wait and see but I can't wait to get my

581
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:49,760
Hot little hands

582
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:54,368
I'm just I'm curious cuz they mentioned using the WeMo app to custom calibrate

583
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:56,160
Four different dog types of the day

584
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:59,232
Talk about that or show that to you

585
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:01,792
Yeah the lighting is always wacky overs

586
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:03,840
So other quick

587
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:07,424
News things I'm going to find out more about this cuz it's really interesting

588
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,704
And I don't have any other information

589
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,984
Cremation with zigbee

590
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:12,032
Thread if introduced

591
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:14,080
..

592
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:14,848
Twitch

593
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:15,872
Is ridiculous

594
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:18,688
Dot-dot is going to be a

595
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,736
Language for smart home devices

596
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:21,504
Communicate

597
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:24,832
And I'm kind of like what is it like a protocol that

598
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:27,392
Harris would like iotivity or alljoyn

599
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:28,416
Or is it

600
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,184
Just

601
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:30,976
You know like profiles

602
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:34,048
Cuz it be used to have these lovely profiles that made

603
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:35,840
Trippy things not work together

604
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,656
Somm, Lake

605
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:40,960
I need more information I asked for it

606
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:42,240
When I get it

607
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:44,800
Update YouTube it is worth noting that this exists

608
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:48,896
Yeah it and I noticed in their press release they say that

609
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:52,224
Etsy Esther dammerung prototypes

610
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,272
A products that speak..

611
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,552
Running on top of

612
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:57,600
Ipps thread Networks

613
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:58,368
Rate

614
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:01,184
And that makes sense cuz they're being thread

615
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,208
Same radio

616
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:06,304
Slightly different protocols but they've been working together to get things to

617
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:07,584
Phoebe running

618
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:10,912
I can't remember is it be running over thread or thread running over

619
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,472
Yes

620
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,312
That's a quick thing

621
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,592
Keep that in mind as we

622
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:19,872
We'll come back to that

623
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:22,176
Other

624
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,480
Is going to work with SmartThings

625
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:25,504
Yay

626
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:26,784
Nice

627
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:31,648
Was just a real quick it seems like everybody is trying to make

628
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:32,416
Amazon Echo

629
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:33,696
Yes

630
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:34,976
Lenovo made an echo

631
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:39,840
How do you make an echo

632
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:43,424
Yeah but we did talk about them until 1 but then the Lenovo one

633
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:47,520
Which is more expensive than the traditional Native Echo

634
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:49,056
It looks like an echo to me

635
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,360
It's a cylinder and so on

636
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:53,152
Bass boosted the

637
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,224
The speaker capability so it's much much louder

638
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,320
But it's just interesting that they're trying to make an echo now and all these other people making

639
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,344
Echoes by putting

640
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:03,392
The Amazons voice service

641
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:06,464
Package in there and then that's even equating to

642
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,256
Cars with some people try to put

643
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:09,280
Echo in cars

644
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:11,328
It is true in Rex

645
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,120
Which is a

646
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,912
Traffic prediction

647
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:15,680
Company

648
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:16,960
Out of Kirkland

649
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:19,520
Hasn't popped open car where

650
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:20,288
There's different

651
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:25,152
Things you can do with open car but like finding parking spaces it's kind of like a ways

652
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,944
Option 2

653
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,224
So they have

654
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,296
Integrated the echo into their open car platform

655
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,600
The other things.

656
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:34,880
The car is it competes with

657
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:37,184
Apple's carplay and Google's

658
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:37,952
Android

659
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:40,000
Kevin and I had a hard time finding

660
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,792
Things that actually use

661
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:42,560
Open

662
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:43,328
Car

663
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:44,352
Porsche

664
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,216
Yeah push it does BMW.

665
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:54,848
And Volvo does but they only use the entire open car platform for everything

666
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:59,712
Babe BBC use a piece of that like BMW has in their I3 electric vehicle

667
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:02,016
They use in wrecks to help find

668
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:04,064
Charging places nearby and so on and so forth

669
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:07,904
But what interests seems to be trying to do is bring in

670
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:11,488
The echo voice Services into their platform so you could

671
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,024
Basically control urine

672
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:13,792
Infotainment

673
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:19,680
Through voice in a cards on which again you can do through carplay Android auto and War

674
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:21,472
Whatever car manufacturer

675
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:23,264
Uses for their own systems

676
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,056
But it's interesting because

677
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:27,616
Once you do that you start bringing in

678
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:33,248
Ways to say at home I'm going to be going to such a such place get me directions

679
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:34,784
Send it to the car and it

680
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,600
Will work through traps for your Echo

681
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:39,392
And then return car parts

682
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:41,696
There's a lot of possibilities here but

683
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:44,768
Again as you said Stacy we looked around we don't see a ton of

684
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,304
Big partners

685
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:49,120
Car manufacturers using the entire plateau

686
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,936
Because

687
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:54,240
Most of them do not want to give their data to Google

688
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:55,264
So

689
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:56,288
That could be

690
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:58,336
Where is everybody

691
00:27:59,104 --> 00:27:59,616
I know it's

692
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:00,896
Okay

693
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,944
So lots of Echoes

694
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:03,968
What's a computer

695
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,248
Weird grooming

696
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:08,832
Tons of updates from our traditional smart

697
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:09,856
Companies

698
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:10,624
So

699
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:15,488
We got the Lutron SmartThings which by the way you guys have to be big for y'all

700
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,792
Who keep asking me about

701
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,328
Light switches

702
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,120
Because now

703
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:23,424
You can you have it yet another platform

704
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,240
Which actually means I may try to

705
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:28,800
Swap back over and not use the link platform

706
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:31,104
So we will see

707
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:31,872
We've got

708
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:33,152
...

709
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:36,224
Service providers doing

710
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:38,784
Security and hubs all in one

711
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,088
Possibly

712
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,112
Drone landing pads

713
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:45,696
And you know what CSS just getting started

714
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:49,024
Is

715
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,560
We didn't talk about this so

716
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:51,584
Next

717
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,352
Episode

718
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:54,912
I'm going to do a review of the stringify platform

719
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:57,472
But in case you guys want to work ahead

720
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:59,520
Stringify is like

721
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:00,288
Suspend that

722
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:01,824
But it's far more power

723
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:06,176
It's only been iOS I've used it on iOS and I really had a lot of fun

724
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:08,992
Basically connected to your gadgets and then you do this like

725
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,808
GUI programming thing where you're like

726
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,136
If this happens and it does

727
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,160
You know

728
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:18,720
Then make this happen and you can control a lot

729
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,512
So

730
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:24,352
The news out of CES is it they just released their Android

731
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:25,888
Which I've been waiting for

732
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:26,912
So

733
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,960
Review coming next week

734
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:30,752
But in the meantime

735
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:32,544
See what you think

736
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:34,336
And I think

737
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:35,616
That's plenty

738
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:41,760
Yeah I take a breath catcher catch your breath because you've got lots of walking running around to do a next couple days

739
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:43,808
What to bring you guys so many cool things

740
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:44,832
Remember

741
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:46,112
Monday

742
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:46,880
Special

743
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:48,416
CES episode

744
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:50,208
Thursday

745
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:50,976
We will have

746

I say goodbye for now get back to the show floors

749
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,752
When I get back to my car to get back to the taxi cab line

00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,336
Back to the taxicab lives and

751
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:07,616

00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:21,696
Hey everyone we're interrupting the podcast with the message from this week sponsor this week sponsor is Dell and we have

755
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:25,536

Sales at Dell EMC

757
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:31,168
I'm more familiar with the center in the

758
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:31,936
Computer space

759
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:33,472
What is it doing with iot

760
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:35,776
What cell is trying to do is focus

761
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:39,104
Kind of the industrial embedded Edge

762
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,640
Environmental economist

763
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:41,408
Talking about

764
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:42,432
Traditional embedded

765
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,456
Computers that are cut

766
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:44,480
Long life

767
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:48,576
Rugged industrial when you think about some of the key application

768
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:54,976
Pacifically on that industrial side you really need something that's a little bit more rugged and robust

769
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:56,512
The kind of handle those environment

770
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:59,840
We're taking the hardware solutions that we've come out with weave

771
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:03,168
Come out for the entirety partner program that can really bring

772
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:03,936
Software

773
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:06,752
He sends to create kind of a hardware software solution

774
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:08,544
In that Industrial iot

775
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:11,616
You leave the sales team and your team is talking with

776
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:12,384
Customers

777
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,664
What do you hear from them

778
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,200
One thing that we here

779
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:17,248
Is there trying to figure out what they're

780
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:19,808
Trying to do two everybody understands iot

781
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:22,880
Teorias broader terms digital transformation

782
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:24,928
It's something that needs to be part of their focus

783
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:25,952
Some part of their strategy

784
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:27,488
Enter looking for Dal because

785
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,280
We do business with 98

786
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:31,072
Percent of the global Fortune 500

787
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:32,864
The really looking for us to kind of help me

788
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:33,888
Lead them down that path

789
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:35,680
So what customers really need to see

790
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:37,984
Is multiple layers of Roi

791
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,288
Yeah one good example of that is

792
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,568
In high-value asset

793
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,104
Mining equipment

794
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,896
Heavy duty structural

795
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:47,200
High-cost medical equipment

796
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:51,808
You know in terms of like predictive maintenance they're monitoring so they're getting that information back

797
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,088
Which allows them

798
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:54,112
How to make better equipment

799
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:54,880
The future

800
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:58,976
They're also trying to understand when things are going to fail so they can provide

801
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:00,768
Better service to their customers

802
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:02,816
Suning parts

803
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:03,840
Before that party

804
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:04,608
Tails

805
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:07,168
So what makes Dells iot Hardware unique

806
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:08,704
Versus all of the other option

807
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:10,496
What are the reasons I came

808
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:12,032
Citadel to lead this group

809
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:15,360
Is I really saw that there's a chance for somebody

810
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:16,640
Differentiated in the

811
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:17,408
Marketing

812
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:18,688
In Dallas really doing that

813
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:20,736
Speak taking their strategy around

814
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:21,760
PCS

815
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:22,528
And brought that

816
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:24,320
Two kind of the embedded Gateway Market

817
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:26,624
Meaning that we can deliver products

818
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,392
And weeks

819
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:30,464
2 3 weeks we can deliver 3 for 500

820
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:32,000
Noah Nelson

821
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:35,584
Market can do that and look in iot there's a lot of lot of

822
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,608
Face type solution

823
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:37,632
She's going out there so

824
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:40,448
Somebody wins the solution they need Hardware right away

825
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:41,472
So we can do that

826
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:44,032
The other piece which is key is Globus

827
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:45,312
You talking about

828
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:46,336
Managing

829
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:47,616
Critical assets

830
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:49,920
If something does go down there want to be able to

831
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:52,224
Get that swapped out really quickly whether it's

832
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,528
Science technician or get that product really quick

833
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:55,552
We have that

834
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:57,088
And then I think the

835
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:59,392
The third area is the manageability

836
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:00,672
We're bringing that

837
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:01,696
Server

838
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:04,512
Workstation manageability that Dell has

839
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:05,536
Throughout its products

840
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:06,560
And trying to bring that too

841
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:07,328
To the edge

842
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:09,376
So that when people have these assets

843
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:10,912
They can actually monitor them

844
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:12,192
And figure out the help

845
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:14,496
Configure them update them all of those kind of

846
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:18,592
There's a couple other ones but those are really the key that are kind of differentiate ourselves in this

847
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,896
Where can I find out more

848
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:24,992
Probably the best place to go would be www.

849
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:25,760
Key partners

850
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:26,528
Dot-com

851
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:33,184
And that shows our products as well as our partner Solutions

852
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:38,560
Hey everyone this is Stacy and I'm coming back to you with the

853
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:40,096
Internet of Things podcast

854
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,888
My guest today is Tim

855
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:42,656
Crawford

856
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:47,520
Who is a strategic advisor to cios with about 25 years

857
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:48,544
In the IT industry

858
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,104
So Tim thanks so much for coming on the show

859
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:56,736
Thanks Stacy for the invitation to join you today really looking forward to the conversation

860
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:58,016
Me too so

861
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:59,552
I've known him for

862
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:04,416
A long time I've been reading in Forever especially when I was covering cloud computing and

863
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:06,208
You're struck me as being

864
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,512
Very attuned to like

865
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:09,536
Real life

866
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,096
So we might all be over here thinking

867
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:14,144
Oh this is going to be awesome everything

868
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,680
Go to the cloud and you were like

869
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:17,728
Check you guys

870
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:22,336
Here's how it's going to have to happen and it hears what real people think so I'm hoping you can do that

871
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:23,104
With

872
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,384
How did the Internet of Things

873
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,152
MCI Airport

874
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:28,736
Yeah I'm looking forward to it I think that's

875
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:33,600
That's a great Segway is that you know there's a lot of great things happening

876
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:38,976
But I do think there is a dose of reality that we just have to stop and take a breath and

877
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:41,024
And recognize and respect

878
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:42,048
All right

879
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:45,120
RCI was coming to you asking about the internet if they

880
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:45,888
Things yet

881
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:47,424
They absolutely are

882
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:51,008
But I think a lot of it comes from an educational standpoint

883
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,848
I've had a number of cios approach me and say okay I understand what

884
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:55,872
Iot is

885
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:57,664
From a definition standpoint

886
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:59,456
What I don't understand is

887
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:01,248
How can it help my business

888
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:02,528
How does a

889
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:05,344
Fit in I mean I can think of some basic things

890
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,648
Such a sensors in Telemetry but

891
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,232
I really don't understand how this works and what they're really asking is

892
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:13,024
Help me connect the dots and

893
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,584
And that's a theme that that I often talked about his

894
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,376
This concept of connecting the dots

895
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:18,400
But

896
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:19,936
Help me understand

897
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:21,216
How this solves

898
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:22,240
The business problem

899
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:28,128
Did it come to you like having a mandate from their board or from their CEO that says

900
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:28,896
Hey

901
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:30,432
Go get me some of that iot

902
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:35,040
You know it's funny you mentioned Cloud earlier in the podcast

903
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:36,320
And I would say that

904
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:39,392
I have seen a number of cases where

905
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:40,160
Bored

906
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:41,952
Publicly traded companies

907
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:42,976
Have approached

908
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:45,792
Executive team and specifically the CIO and said

909
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:47,072
We need to do cloud

910
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:49,120
I don't think iot is there yet

911
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:51,424
At least I haven't seen it in Mass where

912
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:52,704
Executives

913
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:53,728
And

914
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:54,752
I would include

915
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:56,800
The board of directors of an organization in that

916
00:35:57,312 --> 00:36:01,408
Are specifically calling out iot there's a lot of questions about it but

917
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:04,480
Not where they're calling it out saying okay we need to do this

918
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:06,016
For the most part

919
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:07,296
I would put iot

920
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:08,320
He's still in that

921
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:09,600
Experimental camp

922
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:14,464
So very few companies are looking at it on the hole on

923
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,744
I brought take

924
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:16,768
But

925
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:18,048
More so from that

926
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:20,096
Experimental or very specific

927
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:21,120
Use case

928
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:23,168
And do you think that's the right

929
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:24,704
Way to look at it I mean

930
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:27,008
I hear so much about

931
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:29,312
My coyote is business transformation

932
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:33,152
But you also hear kind of it feels like conflicting advice which is

933
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:35,456
Pick up small project

934
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:37,248
See if it works and then

935
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:43,392
Go from there basically to spread out through your business see what else you can apply that to so I'm very curious like what your

936
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:44,672
Tactical advice

937
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:48,256
Yeah this is where we have to separate the wheat

938
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:53,888
You know every technology becomes a business transformation opportunity

939
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:55,936
I've had startups that I've advised

940
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:58,752
That they've approached me with their pitch and their pictures

941
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,800
We transform businesses

942
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:03,872
Am I a natural reaction is without saying the words

943
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:05,664
This is basically hogwash

944
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:07,200
More

945
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:08,224
Eloquent words

946
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,528
And the reason for that is that

947
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,344
Turn my credibility standpoint they don't do that

948
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,624
I mean iot

949
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,672
Whether it's iot cloud

950
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:18,464
Pick your favorite

951
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,000
New technology

952
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:20,768
In itself

953
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,072
Doesn't do anything for you

954
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:25,120
It's how you use it

955
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:26,656
Is the differentiator

956
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:30,240
And so I think that's a real important distinction because

957
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:35,616
The company that build the iot solution whether it be an isv or consultant or

958
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,152
A Product Company

959
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:38,688
They don't do anything

960
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:40,736
For your business directly in fact

961
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:41,760
In many cases

962
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:46,112
Didn't even understand your business or if they do they don't understand the intricacies of it

963
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:51,232
And so that's why I think it's really really important for people to understand there is no magic bullet here

964
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:52,768
It's a partnership

965
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:55,584
You have to understand what tools to use

966
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:56,608
And then

967
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:58,912
How to appropriately apply those tools

968
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:03,776
And So eventually what you start to realize they're selling you on something that is

969
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:07,104
Not necessarily meaningful it sounds good

970
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:10,944
But it's not something that you can really cut a tangibly get into

971
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:11,968
And that

972
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:18,368
To me is a is a real problem that I see I saw it and cloud and I see it in Spades and iot right now

973
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,184
You've got a lot of folks selling on a promise that

974
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,720
Will never be fulfilled

975
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:24,256
Let's get into

976
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:26,304
Some of the deployments used

977
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,120
What are people doing that are successful

978
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:29,888
Nowadays

979
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,168
They're a couple of

980
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:32,704
Examples of app

981
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,544
One is where the technology hits the custom

982
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:42,688
The customer engagement opportunity I was having a conversation with the friend of mine who is a CIO

983
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,992
In retail in a retail business

984
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:51,392
He was asking the question about iot and how iot kind of fits in and said you know there's a great way for it to fit in in

985
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:52,160
And I'll give you a

986
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:53,696
A perfect example of this

987
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:56,256
Imagine putting Telemetry on

988
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:57,024
The baskets

989
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:01,376
Write the little hand baskets that you carry around the store or putting on the shopping cart

990
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:04,448
Now you start to understand the path

991
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:10,080
That Shoppers are taking through your store so you can kind of figure out what what are hot spots and cold spots

992
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:10,848
Within the store

993
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:15,712
Now if you were to take that and tie it to particular transactions like

994
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:19,296
This car went through this register and

995
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:21,344
That was tied to this

996
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:27,744
Frequent shopper because they have a loyalty card value can start to understand more behaviors about the

997
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,816
The customer and their buying habits when they're in the store

998
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:33,888
That some might say wait a second that's a little big brother

999
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:35,424
Baidu

1000
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:37,984
If you can really start to understand

1001
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,800
What is selling and what isn't selling more than just

1002
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:46,432
A binary yes or no but rather to say you know they kind of went by the shirts or went by the pants but

1003
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:47,968
It really just bought socks

1004
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:51,552
I think that gives you some insights that you wouldn't otherwise have Acts

1005
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:52,576
Access to

1006
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:54,880
To me what this is all about is

1007
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:55,904
Iot

1008
00:39:56,416 --> 00:40:01,024
Like Cloud before it gives you the ability to do something you couldn't otherwise do

1009
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:02,304
Other than

1010
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:08,704
Having an employee follow a customer around the store and say who they went to this one and went to this island this album

1011
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,472
Not that aisle

1012
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:10,752
Maybe a little creepy

1013
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:14,080
Yes incredibly

1014
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:16,640
Part of what we're talking about here is

1015
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:18,432
Iot gives you the

1016
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:20,480
The data stream the information

1017
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:22,016
In an automated way

1018
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:28,672
Without having to induce more labor into the equation which is as you mentioned expensive and error-prone

1019
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:30,208
Okay so now

1020
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:35,584
Cios are already in charge of like maintaining computers and I was thinking of Peters and everything and that feels like

1021
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,376
Huge expansion of their you know

1022
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:38,400
Purview

1023
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:39,424
So

1024
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:44,032
Who's going to be in charge of these things on the tech side is it still the CIA

1025
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:47,616
And does that mean their role kind of changes to

1026
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:48,896
Adapt to

1027
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:53,760
Controlling more things or should they also be dealing with the business side more now to

1028
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:57,856
I guess it's really what is the CIO to when we have

1029
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:59,904
Like this Grand connected

1030
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,184
Retail

1031
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:03,744
I think the first thing you have to do is

1032
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,024
Is take a step back

1033
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:05,792
And

1034
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:08,352
Let's just spend a couple of seconds talking about

1035
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:11,680
How the cio's role is changing because I think that creates

1036
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:13,984
The context in which to answer your question

1037
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:15,776
The CIO

1038
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:18,848
Historically has been a technology leader

1039
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:22,432
And it's what I've referred to for some time now is 2

1040
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:23,712
Traditional Cil

1041
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:27,296
But there's a new type of CIO this come about

1042
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:29,856
And that's the transformational see I am

1043
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:36,256
And the difference between those two individuals fundamentally is one is very technology Centric the traditional one

1044
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:39,072
The transformational one is very business-centric

1045
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:43,936
And what I mean by that is that the transformational CIO did it 10 times

1046
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,008
The transformational CIO

1047
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:49,312
Is a business leader first

1048
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:51,360
That happens to have responsibility

1049
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:52,384
Before it

1050
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:54,943
Letters that say it not

1051
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:55,711
Technology

1052
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:58,527
And the reason for that is that

1053
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:03,647
The it organization needs to be more business-centric today than it ever has

1054
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:04,415
Has been

1055
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:06,975
So understanding that context

1056
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:12,863
To answer your question the CIO quite often will not be involved in these technology

1057
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:13,887
Conversations the

1058
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:15,679
Transformational CIO that is

1059
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:18,495
And so they're more focused on

1060
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:21,055
If we're talking about the shopping cart example

1061
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:23,103
How did this really solve a business

1062
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:24,127
Problem for me

1063
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:25,663
How does a tie

1064
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:32,063
Iot into a business problem and I can't tie it into a business problem and it's just about who cool we can put dilemma

1065
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:33,343
Metreon shopping carts

1066
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:36,927
Okay that's interesting maybe but

1067
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:41,535
Why are we doing it we've got a big huge heaping plate of things to do

1068
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:43,839
It's overflowing and that hasn't changed

1069
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:45,375
We want to throw up

1070
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:47,679
Cool Nifty little thing on the plate

1071
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:49,727
Without tying it to a business center

1072
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:53,311
Problem that we're trying to solve that's going to be really hard to get

1073
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:55,103
Support and funding for

1074
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:56,383
Okay

1075
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:57,663
And what skills

1076
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:58,943
Do you think

1077
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:03,039
The CIO needs in the organization needs as we start to embrace all of the

1078
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:04,831
This is new sensors

1079
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:05,855
The snoo

1080
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:07,647
Ways of managing data

1081
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:09,183
And I'm just trying to think about

1082
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:11,231
The guy who's really good at like

1083
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:17,119
Troubleshooting computer problems do you send him out to you know install the sensors does that change your

1084
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:19,679
Types of people you hire the skills you need

1085
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:22,751
The CIO needs to understand a couple of things

1086
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:23,775
Number one

1087
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:28,127
They need to understand how the company spends money and how the company makes money

1088
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:29,663
And I don't mean

1089
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:33,759
You know that they sell pants and sell shirts and sell socks if that's

1090
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:35,551
What I mean is that

1091
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:38,623
They need to understand how the customer in gauges

1092
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:41,183
And the different opportunities the customer has to engage

1093
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:42,463
Purchase those products

1094
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:47,071
But they also need to understand the whole supply chain of how products are designed

1095
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:51,935
The timeline that they go through for design to manufacturing to

1096
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:54,239
Supply chain to distribution

1097
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:55,775
And how all of that works

1098
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:56,543
Soup To Nuts

1099
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:57,567
Now that's

1100
00:43:57,823 --> 00:44:02,943
A very tall order but to a large degree these days the CIO needs to be thinking like

1101
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:07,551
In the role of the CEO and I don't mean the CEO of it I mean the CEO of

1102
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:08,319
The company

1103
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:10,879
And so there's a much broader / view that

1104
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:12,159
The CIO needs to have

1105
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:17,279
What that means then is that a lot of these technology conversations

1106
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:20,351
Because you will need to have those technology conversation

1107
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:21,631
Those need to be pushed

1108
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:22,911
Further into

1109
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:24,703
The it organization

1110
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:26,495
And so it needs to

1111
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:29,823
Understand that and so of course they're new skill sets

1112
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:31,103
With regards

1113
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:34,687
Two new architectures around iot and I've written a bit about

1114
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:40,063
You have some suggested architectures for iot to to have the conversation cuz that's

1115
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:45,439
Whole nother thing right everything falls into the iot packet but iot is not iot is not iot

1116
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:48,511
It's understanding that is really important

1117
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:53,119
And so does new skill sets are required within the it organization

1118
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:55,423
It is a division of labor

1119
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:58,239
Even within the it organization

1120
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:02,591
You still have to have some business sense today it still can't be

1121
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:04,895
A technology Centric conversation

1122
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:08,991
In line with this conversation about skills right now there is a lot

1123
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:10,271
Of

1124
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:14,879
Back and forth in the kind of industrial or Enterprise iot space about

1125
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:16,415
Disparaging of

1126
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:18,975
Information Technology with

1127
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:19,999
Operations

1128
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:20,767
Technology

1129
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:21,535
And you don't

1130
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:23,327
Itot divide

1131
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:24,095
In

1132
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:24,863
Salata

1133
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:26,399
A lot of acronyms but

1134
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:28,191
It's also kind of an interesting

1135
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:32,287
Discussion because a lot of the IT people in the cio's are like

1136
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:34,591
Oh my God I have to deal with life

1137
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:36,383
Fike fire alarm systems

1138
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:39,199
I'm I'm working on our email

1139
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:40,223
So there's this like

1140
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:44,063
Concerned about like where the role of facilities kind of management

1141
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:47,135
Comes in here and if it does it all and I'd be curious about your take

1142
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:48,927
You know it's

1143
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:50,207
It's funny you bring that up

1144
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:51,999
Because I can recall

1145
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:55,071
A very distinct conversation I had several years ago

1146
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:57,887
In past organization where the

1147
00:45:58,143 --> 00:46:01,983
Facilities organization had responsibility for the photocopier

1148
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:03,007
No coffee Man

1149
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:04,287
And

1150
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:05,311
These

1151
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:06,847
Machines guide

1152
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:08,383
Really complex

1153
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:09,151
It's really fast

1154
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:10,943
They started connecting to the internet

1155
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:12,223
Connecting to your network

1156
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:15,295
They had a hard drive in them they had software that had to be updated

1157
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:16,831
And the facilities folks

1158
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:21,439
This is out of our wheelhouse we don't know what to do with it it's all technology

1159
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:22,207
And they kept

1160
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:23,743
Calling it to

1161
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:25,791
To help address it

1162
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:26,815
Help

1163
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:28,095
You don't resolve it

1164
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:30,143
Because we had processes we had

1165
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:32,959
Means to be able to handle all of them

1166
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:35,007
The functions we just couldn't deal with

1167
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:37,567
Things like supplies and Ana type of stuff

1168
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:39,615
Although arguably at someone

1169
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:40,639
Like a printer

1170
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:41,919
But anyway

1171
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:44,479
It was interesting to have that conversation because

1172
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:45,247
I think

1173
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:47,807
The one thing you have to be careful about is

1174
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:50,623
If you use an assumption that

1175
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:52,927
As soon as it connects to a network

1176
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:55,487
It falls under the purview of it

1177
00:46:55,743 --> 00:47:00,095
It becomes this massive organization is responsible for a lot of things that

1178
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:02,911
It doesn't necessarily understand

1179
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:04,191
And

1180
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:05,983
Shouldn't necessarily manage

1181
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:09,311
But rather other parts of the organization need to get more

1182
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:10,335
Sophisticated to

1183
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:11,871
And I think there's a balance

1184
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:12,895
Destructor iron

1185
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:17,759
And we're just seeing kind of dere the inkling of the pendulum starting to swing

1186
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:19,295
Any other direction

1187
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:21,087
And eventually it'll swing back

1188
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:22,367
To something more neutral

1189
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:26,207
So let's let's going to delve into this little bit because there are things like

1190
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:28,255
Security that is

1191
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:30,559
Probably very much something

1192
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:32,351
I mean I know we have sex

1193
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:33,887
Sisal ciss

1194
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:34,911
Is that how you say it

1195
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:36,959
Right Caesars Caesars

1196
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:39,519
I know we have cesos now that are

1197
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:46,431
Totally responsible for that and when you think about things like the target breach which was coming in through an a

1198
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:50,271
HP AC system to the point-of-sale system to steal people's credit cards

1199
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:52,063
That suddenly becomes like

1200
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:53,343
Bully Chivas

1201
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:55,391
That's on the network is that it

1202
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:56,927
When you're dealing with

1203
00:47:57,183 --> 00:48:02,815
All of these devices that people are going to be plugging on or attaching to your network it becomes like who's in charge of that

1204
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:09,471
I guess that's the thing that I often get pulled into is the conversation around security regardless of what

1205
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:11,263
It's right you know we talked about

1206
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:14,079
Comparing some of the analogs of iot to Cloud

1207
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:15,359
It's the same issue

1208
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:19,711
We had the same conversation about security when the internet came about the 90s

1209
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:22,783
Oh we're not going to use it because it's insecure

1210
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:24,575
Okay well today

1211
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:25,599
If you don't use it

1212
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:27,391
Your youre neanderthal

1213
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:33,791
You know we had the same conversation about distributed computing we had the same conversation about Cloud we're having the same conversation

1214
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:34,815
Json about iot

1215
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:38,655
The bigger challenge that with iot unlike the other

1216
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:39,935
Predecessor

1217
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:40,703
Services

1218
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:46,079
The sheer number of devices that were talking about in the intelligence of the devices

1219
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:47,359
It creates

1220
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:51,455
An exponentially more complicated problem to solve 4

1221
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:53,759
That we don't necessarily have

1222
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:54,783
A direct answer

1223
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:57,087
What I mean by that is

1224
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:59,391
If you think about every single device

1225
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:00,159
In your house

1226
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:01,951
And I forget about your office

1227
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:06,047
Just think about your house from a personal standpoint how many devices do you have the

1228
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:07,071
Connect to

1229
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:10,143
Your internet service and if you start adding it up

1230
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:11,423
I think on average

1231
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:14,239
She probably have somewhere between 10 and 20 devices

1232
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:15,519
Sprint average household

1233
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:19,359
That's a lot of devices and that's probably not even everything that could connect

1234
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:23,967
And so how do you manage those devices becomes the second piece of it which is

1235
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:27,551
We're talking about sensors were talking about small

1236
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:30,111
Circuitry and

1237
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:32,671
Technology in small bits of software

1238
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:36,511
That now we have to figure out how to effectively secure

1239
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:37,791
And

1240
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:42,655
That becomes incredibly problematic not just on a personal standpoint in our homes but

1241
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:45,727
Think about it now in the office man the corporate environment

1242
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:47,007
It's a problem

1243
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:49,823
It's a personal conversation that they bring up which is

1244
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:52,383
Okay I want to do this but how do I say

1245
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:54,943
And even when they say those words

1246
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:57,247
The whole concept of how do I say

1247
00:49:57,503 --> 00:49:58,015
Secure it

1248
00:49:58,271 --> 00:50:01,087
Has a whole nother set of questions that come with it

1249
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:02,623
What do you mean by

1250
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:03,391
CARiD

1251
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:06,207
What does it what exactly does that mean

1252
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:07,231
And how much

1253
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:08,255
Do you want to secure it

1254
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:09,791
Do you want it to be like for dogs

1255
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:10,815
Do you want it to be

1256
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:13,631
Just something that kind of keeps the riffraff out

1257
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:16,191
It feels like we have to come up with a new model

1258
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:20,287
First Security like a new mental model because like the firewall model doesn't work

1259
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:23,615
Giant hole to dump your traffic in for it to be

1260
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:26,431
I cleaned kind of doesn't work like it did for cloud

1261
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:33,087
And just going back again to your retail example you're going to be putting connected carts in the hands of your user

1262
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:34,111
Service which means

1263
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:36,927
You can't even protect the physical assets

1264
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:41,535
In many cases are going to be in the hands of other people and then you're opening up

1265
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:43,839
Maybe not ports but

1266
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:46,143
Opening up doors into your system be alike

1267
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:47,167
Apis for

1268
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:52,287
You're basically sticking a lot of stuff outside whatever wallet so you may have built in

1269
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:54,335
Both physically and

1270
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:55,615
Virtually so

1271
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:58,175
I just don't I don't even know how to think about that

1272
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:00,735
You're more spot-on than

1273
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:03,039
You probably think you are because

1274
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:04,575
The issue here is

1275
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:06,111
The old adage of

1276
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:09,695
Crunchy on the outside chewy on the inside that perimeter

1277
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:11,999
Security Paradigm has long since been dead

1278
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:14,303
More than a dozen years ago

1279
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:16,351
I was with an organization that

1280
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:19,167
It was an institution it was at Stanford University

1281
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:20,959
And here's a prominent insta

1282
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:23,007
Institution and one of the

1283
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:24,287
Paradigm's

1284
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:29,919
That we had to look at is we had to assume that in our in the world that I lived in there

1285
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:32,991
We had assumed that our network was a dirty Network

1286
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:34,783
Is the default thinking

1287
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:37,855
Most corporate entities don't think that way they think of

1288
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:44,255
Their internal network is a clean Network and you set up the perimeter and all the sensors to be able to protect you

1289
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:46,815
As long as something's on the inside you're good

1290
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:48,863
But when you're talking about

1291
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:54,239
College students dirty dirty college students with

1292
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:56,287
That's exactly right right

1293
00:51:56,543 --> 00:51:57,055
You know

1294
00:51:57,311 --> 00:52:03,455
Unlike a corporate environment where 90% of the devices you know about he have the random Consultants or whatnot that comes in

1295
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:04,991
Cannon plugs into your network

1296
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:06,271
In

1297
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:08,319
An educational Institution

1298
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:09,855
90% of the devices

1299
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:10,879
You don't touch

1300
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:12,415
You don't have control over

1301
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:16,767
And so it changes the Paradigm and I think that's part of what we have to

1302
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:18,815
Start to think about it it is

1303
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:21,631
How do we start to assume that

1304
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:24,191
We're not in a secure world

1305
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:25,983
We don't live in a secure network

1306
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:27,775
And so we have to take

1307
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:28,543
Appropriate

1308
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:31,103
Precautions we can't make that assumption that

1309
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:36,223
Oh well if we just plug it on our Network and it's behind a firewall we're good to go right

1310
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:36,991
Wrong

1311
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:39,295
You know in the retail example with the shopping carts

1312
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:41,855
How many times have you seen a shopping card

1313
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:46,975
Out in some random parking lot somewhere that's nowhere near the store that it belongs to

1314
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:48,767
Now imagine if it has

1315
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:50,559
And iot device on it

1316
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:55,423
And you get some kid that wants to kind of Tinker around and hack that system

1317
00:52:55,935 --> 00:52:56,703
Great so now they've got

1318
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:57,471
The device

1319
00:52:57,727 --> 00:52:59,263
Is the devices connected into your

1320
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:00,543
Your network

1321
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:05,407
That they have full access to be able to Tinker around and play with it outside of your purview

1322
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:11,295
That's just one simple example but I think we could go on for days and days talking about examples in

1323
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:15,135
Just about every industry to and that's the other thing to think about is

1324
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:16,927
What we're talking about today

1325
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:21,023
Is not relegated to just retail or just certain industries

1326
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:26,655
There are examples of this that cross every single industry that I've run across so far

1327
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:27,935
Guys

1328
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:29,471
This is very

1329
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:30,239
Real talk

1330
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:32,287
And if you want examples

1331
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:34,591
From other Industries and other thinking

1332
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:37,663
You're going to have to call Tim because we are out of time
