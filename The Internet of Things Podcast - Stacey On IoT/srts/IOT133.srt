28
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:19,872
What's the Internet of Things

29
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:24,224
You're going to experience these Technologies rather than just hearing about them

30
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:24,992
Insurance

31
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:25,760
You're going to

32
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:32,160
Innovate instead of just talking about it you're going to get hands-on experience with Innovations from iot machine

33
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:36,256
Machine learning analytics Big Data blockchain data intelligence

34
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:40,864
And all of this is enabled by sap Cloud platform and design picking services

35
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:45,984
You're going to hear from customers such as caterpillar UPS HP Bosch

36

Water live in a sap.com sap Leonardo

43
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:17,216
Anime

44
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:20,032
And now back to the show

45
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,104
Skip this week we'll talk about Dell

46
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,872
Which is it

47
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:26,432
Best billion dollars in iot

48
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,736
R&D over the next 3 years

49
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:31,040
Around a couple different projects

50
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:34,624
It's also really trying hard to integrate all of its

51
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,160
Business units into

52
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:38,208
1iota option

53
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:39,232
10 / customers

54
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:41,280
Prior to this gel was really involved

55
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,560
Selling gateways

56
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:46,144
And it did work with a lot of customers individually to set of solutions

57
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,680
But now it's got this

58
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:49,728
Unified approach to Route it

59
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,776
Many many products so we're talkin

60
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:53,568
Dell EMC stock

61
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:54,592
VMware

62
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:55,616
Pivotal

63
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:56,640
All of that

64
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:59,712
It's also made some investments into a bunch of IO

65
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:00,992
40 startups

66
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:05,344
So when I talked to Del

67
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,368
Last week

68
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:09,184
About the snooze Leon

69
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:09,952
Green

70
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,744
Distributed back into the

71
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:14,560
So they really wanted to focus

72
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:17,376
At the edge not necessarily the sensors

73
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:20,448
At the gateways and then in the

74
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:23,264
Concept in some places you're going to have data centers

75
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,544
You're not actually

76
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,592
Data centers on site

77
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:29,664
So that's kind of their focus and then some of it goes bad

78
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:34,528
Obviously

79
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:36,832
Companies in Inwood VMware

80
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:38,112
AMC

81
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:46,048
Docker project Nautilus

82
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:48,864
Which I think is in beta right now just ingested

83
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,424
Queries data from the iot gateways

84
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,264
So you're taking that edge data and mash it up and see what they can find out

85
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:57,568
And that's really important because obviously

86
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,616
There are so many situations of

87
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,384
People are realizing

88
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,176
Coyote

89
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:02,944
Dealt with

90
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,968
In real time

91
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,040
To be like you

92
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,064
Admittedly

93
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:09,856
Actually

94
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:12,928
Real-time because of someone's operating like a smelt

95
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,464
Machine and the temperature gets too

96
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,000
The high that needs to be

97
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:24,191
So I think the IT world is kind of waking up to the fact that when they started selling the stuff into some of the many

98
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:24,959
Passion planner

99
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:33,151
Do you not understand what we do all the time and how dangerous that can be so that's why the other is data

100
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,943
So much data center

101
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,247
Doesn't make sense manufacturing Park

102
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:39,807
Generate like a petabyte of data a day

103
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:43,135
Nobody needs all of that nobody needs all of us

104
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,975
To spend it the money to send that up to the cloud storage

105
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:47,999
Do stuff there

106
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,791
So finally there's a

107
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:50,559
Security company

108
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:53,119
It's a lot of this is very critical data

109
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,143
And

110
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:58,495
So that's what those doing here it's a smart

111
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,031
Makes sense

112
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:02,847
I don't have a lot more to say

113
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:08,991
Well I'm glad you mentioned security bit because it's a common theme in our shows

114
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:15,391
And they actually is part of this initiative project Iris under the ribs

115
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:21,023
So they are working to provide certain disabilities in Monterey out to the edges what they're saying so that's good to say

116
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:25,119
Yes yes

117
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,471
It's a hyper-converged platform

118
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,519
Part of the VMware family

119
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:34,079
And it's basically going to let you do

120
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,359
Software

121
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,127
Consistent

122
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,407
All the way from

123
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,687
Not the sensors

124
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:39,967
Probably the Gateway

125
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:43,295
To the core area which is to be that little mini Datacenter all the way to the

126
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,063
Cloud

127
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:48,927
So it's just going to make life easier I know we're talking very much in generalities

128
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,975
And the devil is in the details on these

129
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:53,023
I don't want to

130
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:56,095
It is

131
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:58,655
High-level framework

132
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:05,311
So here are the devil's in the details will see what happens if I was playing buzzword bingo hyper-converged

133
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,335
Yes

134
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,615
I should have Piper

135
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,431
Basically your storage your networking

136
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,967
Computing it's all kind of in the same

137
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:12,735
Please possible

138
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:16,063
Allocate resources on the flights Ferry

139
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,599
I'm going to stop

140
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:19,903
Because

141
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,439
Salesforce

142
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,487
Another kind of industrial iot

143
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,535
Salesforce

144
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,559
They came in

145
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,327
Big

146
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,887
2015

147
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,983
And then we didn't really hear

148
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:40,895
So what they did at dreamforce this week they basically said they've created

149
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,687
Summon call the IMT Expo

150
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,711
Explorer Edition

151
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:46,271
And this is just to help people deal with data

152
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,039
Better

153
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:49,343
And it's doing it in a way that doesn't it

154
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,623
Kodi

155
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:51,647
So

156
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:52,415
You guys maybe

157
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,951
Salesforce what the heck

158
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:57,279
Important thing because

159
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:59,071
WeChat

160
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,607
Overseeing staff

161
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:03,167
But you have to eventually evolve

162
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:06,239
So that's what Salesforce is Hope

163
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,287
So all of that

164
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,591
To be analyzed

165
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,503
Anixter like think of service calls examples

166
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:19,551
Disturbing company

167
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,599
It service call

168
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:23,391
There's going to be service required

169
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,927
Potato

170
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:27,999
From the turbine to figure out what's going on

171
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,535
What happened what went wrong

172
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:32,863
Rather than go after it after the fact that you're getting real time reading

173
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:36,703
As a service calls coming in it really cuts down on the time it takes

174
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,727
Solve the problem

175
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,007
Exactly

176
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:41,055
If you don't believe that this is a thing

177
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,871
Go back in time to November

178
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:44,639
2016

179
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:45,919
GE

180
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,711
Bought servicemax

181
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,991
Or 900 in

182
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,271
And I think it's 950

183
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,063
Million dollars

184
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,855
And that was a deal

185
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:58,719
Basically to bring people into the predix GE predix infrastructure

186
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,743
Service calls me

187
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:02,559
Managing all of that Salesforce obviously wants to get in

188
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,887
And it'll do it

189
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:08,959
I want to say this cuz I haven't looked at servicemax to my

190
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:10,751
Might do it like a

191
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:14,079
Comfortable for the Enterprise way so maybe we'll see

192
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:19,199
It is the more OT side of the GE way and for the it side

193
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,991
Enterprise spokes go

194
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,271
More Salesforce

195
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:23,551
All right

196
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:24,831
Let's talk about Amazon

197
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,135
Yeah

198
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:32,255
So I think we talked about

199
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,535
What's good weather

200
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:34,815
Yes

201
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:36,863
Walmart was work

202
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,143
Google for

203
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,167
Rihanna

204
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:43,519
That was that yes yes yes I forgot it was a Google home or Amazon

205
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:46,335
Certainly don't want to be shut out of this concern Adra

206
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:51,711
Shoots Walmart competitor

207
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:56,063
Can you use a Smart locks in your home to get your stuff in your house also

208
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:03,999
Smart license plate Josh and deliver things to your car just put in your trunk for you

209
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:06,303
Frame is the name of the smart license plate maker

210
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:10,143
Part of frame is a license plate frame

211
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,167
There's a little

212
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:13,983
Space to store a key for the trunk of your car in there

213
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,519
You can remotely open now

214
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:17,055
Provide access to your trunk

215
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:20,895
It's kind of interesting cuz there's such a focus on home delivery

216
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:26,271
Guess what you're not always at home

217
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:29,343
So if you were at work and you want something over there

218
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:32,159
Actually just drop it off in your car trunk

219
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:32,927
You don't

220
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:35,231
I feel like they were talking about that earlier

221
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:38,559
I filed a patent for the info is it now real

222
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,863
Or is there a box with frame

223
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:47,263
Anything yet but that's the reporting is that they were talking with frame to make us a delivery service

224
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,543
Okay cool

225
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,567
I'm all for it

226
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,591
Make my life

227
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,895
Okay now

228
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,431
Speaking of Google home

229
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,455
Google home Mini

230
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:56,991
Sao Paulo

231
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:01,599
It was last week

232
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:02,623
Yes

233
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,391
Yes

234
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,183
Oh yeah

235
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:08,511
Of course some of it was

236
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:10,559
Google home

237
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:17,215
Product family

238
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:20,543
The reviewers actually

239
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:29,759
And found out some trial-and-error and some wacky

240
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:36,159
That it was listening and recording and sending everything up to the cloud which we know

241
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:42,559
But it only supposed to happen when you actually trigger the keyword this is happening 7 by 20

242
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:45,887
4 and that is a very very bad and so

243
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,495
And replace it exactly what they should do as a response to review really reached out to Google

244
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:57,151
Record the issue Google and they have already

245
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:01,247
Exit this problems if you ordered one on don't worry this is not

246
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:07,903
I don't understand how this happened

247
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:12,255
The Google home mini has to be sharing and reusing tons of the code

248
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:15,327
It's already in Google home and ordering Google assist

249
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,655
So what happened somebody

250
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,471
I just understand

251
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:22,751
Well and

252
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:26,591
This is like everybody's worst fear about bringing these in

253
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,663
So you would think that

254
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,431
Google would be like

255
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,711
Hey guys

256
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,479
What's me

257
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:35,039
For real sure that this doesn't

258
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:35,807
Happen

259
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,343
Apparently that didn't

260
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:40,671
QA test manager

261
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:45,023
This would certainly be one of the use cases I be testing that's all I mean

262
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:47,071
All right

263
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,863
All right

264
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:50,399
Option

265
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,935
We don't actually have an official thing

266
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:59,103
Call game

267
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,127
No no no

268
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:02,943
No you can go in and erase this stuff

269
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:05,503
That's doable you just go in

270
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,039
Your privacy settings

271
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:11,135
You should be able to see you can hear everything that it's hard

272
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:13,951
Do you want to get rid of it now when you get rid of it

273
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,231
Will tell you this

274
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:16,255
You are

275
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,791
Messing with this effective

276
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,631
Everything is learned

277
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:23,935
Is Tatiana starting from scratch

278
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:29,055
Okay let's talk about

279
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:32,383
GM

280
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,919
Company called stroke

281
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,199
Make it slime

282
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:36,991
Better

283
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:39,039
I don't know what else to say about that

284
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:41,087
I can tell you what else

285
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:46,207
I think this is awesome and I'll tell you why let me give you a very quick little backstory

286
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,743
When I was working at Google

287
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:50,047
Spaces group

288
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:50,815
And we

289
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:53,375
Set up a booth at the Google Cloud event

290
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:57,727
And we got a $25,000 lidar sensor

291
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,007
We were showing

292
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:01,311
People who may be on retail stores

293
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,335
How you can track

294
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:05,919
Motion movement Etc

295
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:08,991
Amazing

296
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,271
It's basically sending

297
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:13,343
From top to bottom 30 thousand lines of

298
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:18,719
Weezer's and that way you can get the depth and width of everything so I'm support does that every second

299
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:19,487
But again

300
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,791
$25,000

301
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:26,911
The report is by GM buying strobe

302
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:31,263
They will reduce the cost of lidar by 99%

303
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,311
Actually do that

304
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,615
Scale

305
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:38,175
And you can start putting the cost out of these things

306
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,967
That's when it's going to be

307
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:43,551
Attractive in London market and become more useful

308
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:48,671
So that means the big think reducing the cost of lidar

309
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:50,463
Computer vision

310
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:55,071
3D depth sensing which I've written about we're all very excited about

311
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,607
Computer vision right now

312
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:58,399
It's weird because we see one way

313
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,423
Everything everything

314
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,215
That is not true

315
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:03,519
Computer vision is

316
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,847
It is flat in doboj to contacts

317
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:07,871
Except

318
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:08,895
We can figure out

319
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,431
Oh I see these things

320
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,967
Pixels in when I get this arranged

321
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:13,503
Pixels it is a cat

322
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,527
What is

323
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:15,807
Cool about text

324
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:21,439
3D 3D

325
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,207
Until things like

326
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:25,279
If you put a white box against the white wall it can actually say

327
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,559
Not This Is Us

328
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:28,607
White Walls

329
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:32,191
It can actually sit here

330
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,471
This is really

331
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,007
Cool stuff

332
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:35,775
Because

333
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:36,799
I can put that

334
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:37,567
Places

335
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,591
Computer skin

336
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:43,455
Well they can analyze more information see more of us in oh my God our privacy is dead

337
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:47,807
Okay and you should see how much data that creates these letters

338
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:50,623
Lee County Jail space Weaver doing

339
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,487
In a car

340
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:58,047
It's going to be the same thing you're going to need that though for

341
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,583
Seeing all around me

342
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,119
Turn 60 degrees

343
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,399
It's going to be awesome

344
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:04,703
You're going to need a lot of gpus

345
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,543
Just so happen space

346
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:11,359
Step somebody Makes You music video

347
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,895
Says it's got a chip

348
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:18,015
That can take all that data and bring what they call level 5 autonomous driving

349
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:20,319
This is the new Drive PX

350
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,599
Xbox One hunting video

351
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:25,439
That will deliver 320 trillion operations

352
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:29,279
And it's going towards Autumn Acres of course

353
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,815
In the second half of the year

354
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:33,631
Nice and level 5 Nvidia mean

355
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,167
There will be no need

356
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,191
Gray steering wheel

357
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:38,239
Petal or pedal

358
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,263
Or mirrors

359
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,591
In your self driving car if you choose to implement this

360
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,383
Holy crap

361
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:46,431
I need a mirror in my car

362
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:47,711
How to put makeup on

363
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:50,271
That's what your phone is for selfie mode

364
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:59,999
Can you be able to do that in this car because you won't have your hands on the wheel or anything just hold the phone up and put your makeup on

365
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:02,559
Give me an extra five minutes

366
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:05,631
How far away

367
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:09,215
They're saying second half of 2018

368
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,567
Here's what it says

369
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:23,551
Starting the second half of 2018

370
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:26,623
2019

371
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:31,487
The chip is just the beginning

372
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,047
Testing

373
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:36,095
But

374
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,911
Alright listening from excitement

375
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:40,703
Clarification

376
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,263
Weeks ago

377
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,287
We were talking about

378
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,055
Vehicle

379
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:48,639
Two vehicle vehicle infrastructure AKA

380
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:49,919
Vehicle to

381
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:51,967
And

382
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,271
We're talking about it

383
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:56,063
I don't remember why but you

384
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:57,599
Sunset Ford

385
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:04,255
Come on I got it I got an email from one of our

386
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:05,279
Smart

387
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,583
Conservators but you're actually all listening

388
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,143
That will call you listeners and

389
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,679
He pointed out

390
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:12,447
That

391
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:14,751
We were a little unclear so let's clear things up

392
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:15,775
He says there are two

393
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:18,079
Competing standards for v2ex

394
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:18,847
That is

395
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:20,639
802. 11p

396
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,175
Standard

397
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:23,455
Dedicated short-range

398
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,223
Communications

399
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:27,039
And that uses the attitude at 11 radio that we

400
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:28,575
Wi-Fi

401
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:30,879
An acellular

402
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:33,439
Cv2x

403
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:34,719
So

404
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,999
The cellular one is it

405
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:36,767
Variant of a

406
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,095
P

407
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,423
Wi-Fi and both of them are going to work in

408
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,191
Inseam

409
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,471
Spectrum

410
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,239
It's the five point

411
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,007
Gigahertz

412
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:47,775
So

413
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:49,823
Basically we're trying to figure out which one

414
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:51,359
And

415
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,383
Ideas

416
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:55,711
How are we going to do the infrastructure the cellular structures are

417
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:57,759
They're so maybe that makes sense

418
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,295
But WiFi

419
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:01,343
Paper license

420
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:03,391
You have to build infrastructure but then you could do it

421
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,159
If you want with it

422
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,695
So I want to say

423
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:08,767
Thank you I don't have permission to say who sent this to me

424
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,047
But thank you

425
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:12,095
Wonderful person who sent this to us in

426
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,119
Clarify this

427
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:14,911
We all know

428
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:16,447
Yeah I have no idea

429
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:22,847
Cv2x

430
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:25,407
Cars are coming with LTE

431
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:27,711
You can make them Wi-Fi hotspots as a result

432
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:29,759
Horsetails have Wi-Fi for that

433
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:38,975
Pick and choose my car based on a stereo

434
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,767
Yeah they're going to have to

435
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:41,535
Figure something

436
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:42,815
Cuz I don't

437
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:43,839
Drivers are not going to

438
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:48,447
Alright let's move on to my thoughts on

439
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:50,495
August Smart Lock

440
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:51,263
That has

441
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,055
Z-Wave

442
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,103
Doorbell

443
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:57,919
IXL. August Smart Lock with Z-Wave

444
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,455
I've been traveling

445
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,991
Forever I'm traveling right now

446
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,015
It is hard to

447
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,039
Best home devices

448
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:06,367
Actually when you're traveling so it took me awhile to get the August Smart Lock

449
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,391
Installed

450
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:08,927
But

451
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:09,951
I'm happy to say

452
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:11,231
But if you like

453
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:12,767
The book of the August

454
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:15,071
This lock

455
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:16,095
0

456
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,119
Madeline

457
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,143
Yente

458
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,519
So I tested and all those things and it works and it's exciting

459
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:25,823
I don't know what else to say other than

460
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:26,847
Hey

461
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,383
Connect to locked it does a lot of cool

462
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,431
Now it is

463
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:32,223
Technically not a lot

464
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:36,575
It turns the deadbolt door lock stays the same so the install is super easy

465
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:37,599
I have some

466
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:38,623
Some glitches with the sauce

467
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,415
Are partly because I have

468
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,183
Tested song

469
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,463
August devices

470
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:44,255
It is hard for me to figure out

471
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:47,327
What account to put it under I apparently have 15

472
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,607
416 Augustine

473
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:50,143
Mount switches

474
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:51,423
Ridiculous

475
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,959
Hopefully you will not have that

476
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,007
I would think not

477
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:59,103
So how much is this one because it's the new August Smart Lock Pro + connect

478
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:01,407
Yes this is

479
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:02,687
279

480
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,711
But it also

481
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:05,759
A little

482
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:06,783
Bridge

483
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,831
That you plug in that gives you WiFi

484
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:14,207
It is a Bluetooth lock so if you want to do anything

485
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,231
You're going to be

486
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:18,047
I need the bridge to talk to the

487
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,351
A home can't work without the

488
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,887
But if you're buying is like you're getting a

489
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,423
Just don't even want

490
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:24,703
Now

491
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:27,263
They have a lot that is cheaper it is 149

492
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:30,847
I tell you this locked works very well it's Bluetooth and then

493
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:31,871
If you buy the

494
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,151
Connect Bridge

495
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,687
You can add the wifi to it

496
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:35,967
And what it is

497
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:37,759
Very substantial

498
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:39,551
Good lord it's so heavy

499
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:41,855
And boxes to the batteries is real

500
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:43,391
Easy

501
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:45,183
Doorsense which is

502
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:50,815
Basically the ability to censor that you stick on the side of the door and then it

503
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:52,607
Knows if the door

504
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,143
Close all the way

505
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,167
And so

506
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,447
Sometimes if you lock it

507
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:57,983
Door and you're gone

508
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:00,287
It can be locked

509
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,079
Not right

510
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:03,359
So this is how

511
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05,919
Someone asked me if you could see

512
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:07,967
Dorset

513
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,599
I do not see it separately

514
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:17,184
S*** I'm curious though if you installed something like

515
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,232
Homebridge which is a little bit more

516
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,512
Simple

517
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,328
So I don't have her

518
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,608
Homebridge install

519
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:27,424
But I did not see it now

520
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,192
I could not use

521
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:29,728
Motion sensor

522
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,056
And this

523
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:39,456
Smart Lock the $149 one is not something you put over your existing deadbolt practices natural replacement

524
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:44,320
Really interesting I only say that because it looks

525
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:46,112
Bigger it has a bigger faceplate

526
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:48,160
I don't know why it

527
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:50,464
It's the same it doesn't have a deadbolt

528
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,000
Just

529
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:53,792
Mounts over your existing

530
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,072
Watch

531
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,632
It's

532
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:58,656
And it's not that

533
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,424
Traditional

534
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:01,728
August

535
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,776
And then if you like that circle look

536
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,568
You can still have it

537
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,616
And that will be there

538
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:09,920
The whole cat version / $200

539
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:10,944
You're like

540
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,736
I needed to talk to the echo

541
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:16,576
Keewaydin there

542
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:18,112
Lock that is Bluetooth

543
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:21,440
Wi-Fi ready so you still have to buy the bridge remote access

544
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,256
At that point you basically should just

545
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:28,352
That's

546
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:29,120
.

547
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:31,168
Now August also in

548
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:32,704
Doorbell

549
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:35,520
I bought the August doorbell

550
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:36,288
I hated it

551
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,336
It was the worst purchase I think I've ever

552
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:40,896
Cuz I have

553
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,200
After first and second worst

554
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:47,808
Bro

555
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:48,832
Couple Improvement

556
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:50,624
It now has

557
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,904
A light on it

558
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:55,744
Prior to this they actually did not have a light that you best in low light

559
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,512
Gamer setup

560
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:57,792
What if there was no light

561
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,584
You can see who is at your door

562
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,120
Which my husband would like

563
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:01,888
Dear killer

564
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,424
It wouldn't affect

565
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,448
Street lights

566
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,472
Your house you probably

567
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:09,568
But this has a flood light

568
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:12,640
It's very bright color HD video

569
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:13,408
In the dark

570
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:14,176
Yay

571
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:15,968
Here's where we get to the park

572
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:18,272
I have installed

573
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:20,320
Actually a dozen doorbells

574
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,856
House and I was

575
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:22,624
Because

576
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,672
The original August so terrible

577
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:27,488
And then I open this and I was hoping just to kind of

578
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:28,768
Slip it back on

579
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:29,792
Mounting plate

580
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:33,120
Different

581
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:34,144
Make it more reliable

582
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:34,912
And

583
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:37,728
So I was like okay so I took it off and then I realized

584
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:38,752
Schools on the mount

585
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,032
We're different

586
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:43,616
So I had to drill two new holes to install this thing

587
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:44,640
My house

588
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:45,664
And at that point

589
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,944
I was just build with

590
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,528
Wish I could I get I get the most people

591
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:51,296
Probably

592
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,320
What would be the first

593
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,344
Doorbell

594
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,112
Camera

595
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:55,648
So this is your fruit so

596
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:58,208
If you want to upgrade from the original August

597
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:00,768
I'm just warning you that you're just going to have to

598
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,048
Bust out your drill again

599
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:03,328
Put the holes in it

600
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,352
Difference

601
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:06,656
Existing holes are hidden

602
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:08,704
But I still hate the fact that my

603
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:10,496
Looks like Swiss cheese

604
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:13,056
Can I have two dispatching

605
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:14,336
But that's me

606
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:15,360
That's not everybody

607
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:17,408
Unless you try out a lot of doorbells

608
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:22,528
So the doorbell works much better

609
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:23,296
It is

610
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,064
Probably

611
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,648
I only tested it a little bit before I left so I want to do some more

612
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:29,952
Is way more responsive

613
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,232
Faster

614
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:33,024
Quite a bit of

615
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:35,584
So sometimes there was a little

616
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,168
Consistency it was about the same as what I felt with the original ring

617
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:40,960
The ring Pro is actually better

618
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:43,520
And I think the ring Pro is probably a better

619
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:45,056
Doorbell to this

620
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:47,616
And both of them have a subscription fee

621
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:49,408
So I kind of wood error

622
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:50,688
Preside

623
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,736
Unless you just like the look

624
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:53,504
This one

625
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:56,064
Go for it cuz it is so unique looking

626
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:57,344
College Square

627
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:01,696
That is my

628
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:02,464
August

629
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:05,024
I'm still very bitter about it

630
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:11,936
Yes they say there's one in her door just like I don't want Bridges and hubs in my house

631
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:12,704
There we go

632
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:13,728
So

633
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:16,032
Does a little gremlin

634
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:21,152
You can reach it and please do call us

635
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:23,200
What's your question

636
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:24,224
But

637
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:25,248
You make the app

638
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,296
Call Leslie and play it on

639
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:30,368
The podcast so you can call us at 5 1/2

640
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,648

641

7:40

642
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:33,440
Toopoor

643
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:35,232
And leave

644
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,256
Your question

645
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,536
This week's question

646
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:38,304
Comes from

647
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:39,328
Sally

648
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:43,936
Hi my name is Sally and I have a question about using my Sonos Play 1

649
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:47,264
With If This Then That app and wondering if there's a way to

650
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,288
Connect with you

651
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:53,152
So that when my August Smart Lock unlock my home my Sonos to turn onto my purse

652
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:57,760
I'd love to find out if there's a way that I can link this last piece of technology and with

653
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:00,320
If this then that internet thing but I have happen

654
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,088
Thank you

655
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,648
Okay Sally I have

656
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:08,000
The bad news is we can't do it

657
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:09,024
What's he want us to do

658
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,048
So

659
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:10,816
List

660
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:11,840
Doesn't work

661
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:12,608
Directly with some

662
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:14,656
That's okay that's okay

663
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:16,192
Cuz we found two

664
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:18,240
Alternatives What alternative

665
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:20,544
It's going to SmartThings that requires a hub

666
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,312
So we were like

667
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:24,640
And SmartThings also requires you to have the August lock with Z-Wave

668
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:26,944
So we kind of just automatically cut that out

669
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,968
Cuz we're not sure if you have

670
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:29,760
Latest August lock

671
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,040
But

672
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:32,832
You don't have to do any of that because

673
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:34,880
You can download a free software app called

674
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:35,648
Do you know me

675
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:36,928
That's why I O

676
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,208
Am I

677
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,744
And that work

678
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,024
With August locks

679
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,304
And it works

680
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,072
Solosis

681
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:46,144
Especially very similar to

682
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,216
Create routine

683
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:52,544
So the same thing just using a different tool

684
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,104
And my favorite part about it is

685
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:56,896
You can actually set

686
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:57,664
Limits

687
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,944
So I went in

688
00:26:59,456 --> 00:26:59,968
Do you know me

689
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:02,784
Started doing this because I was like

690
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,320
Me at every time you unlock

691
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:06,112
Your tour if your Sonos plays

692
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:07,136
Your favorite

693
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,440
You're going to suddenly like the time you come

694
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,464
I'm home at midnight

695
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,024
And your I don't know if you live with people you live with people

696
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:16,864
The time you coming home at midnight it starts Blair and you know Joan Jett or something

697
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:18,400
Your phone is going to be mad at you

698
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:19,168
I know

699
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:20,192
Because this has happened

700
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,752
So what you basically can do is

701
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:25,568
You can say when something happens

702
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:27,360
The August door unlocks

703
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:31,200
Run this action so I had mind saying the kitchen Sonos

704
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:33,504
Take a couple option

705
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,296
And I had to play throwback Thursday

706
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:39,904
So I said only if it's before 10

707
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:40,672
10 p.m.

708
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:43,232
And then you could even also say and only if

709
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:44,000
I'm there

710
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:45,024
In the important

711
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,048
Part about that

712
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:48,864
It will only do it for you based on

713
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,632
Can your phone be

714
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:51,168
They're so

715
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:52,448
Your husband comes home

716
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,216
When you're not home

717
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:53,984
It's not

718
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:55,264
And I don't know

719
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:57,056
Is someone else

720
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:59,616
Sometime I realized

721
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:06,016
And

722
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:06,784
You're not home

723
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:08,832
Which I think is

724
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:14,464
Customizable

725
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:15,744
If you live alone

726
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:18,304
Fine but I always find it

727
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:20,352
Really fails

728
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:22,144
When you start adding other people in

729
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:24,448
So I'm always looking

730
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:27,776
Welcome to my world

731
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:28,544
Is it

732
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,824
Goalie challenge

733
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:32,384
It's just me

734
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:36,224
So Sally that is the option that we found

735
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,784
Best for what you were

736
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:42,624
Police calls to go out to buy Oliver any like that

737
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:43,648
So

738
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:44,672
We wish you luck

739
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:48,256
And you know me I like it because

740
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:50,048
All my Sonos is Mew

741
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:50,816
Automatically

742
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:52,096
Which is super cool

743
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:53,632
Cuz then I can listen to music

744
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:54,400
While I'm working

745
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:56,192
Phone calls

746
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:58,752
That's like my favorite thing

747
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:00,800
And it doesn't right off the

748
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:04,384
What feels like

749
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,944
Good stopping place for this section

750
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:07,712

755
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:17,952
Talking about

756
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:19,488
Adding Bluetooth

757
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,768

00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,544
Breaking into the Internet of Things podcast with a message from our sponsor

00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:38,944
This week sponsor is Qualcomm and once again I have Raj talluri here he is the SVP

761
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,480
And GM of iot

762
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:44,832
We talked a lot about cameras when we talk about the internet

763
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:46,880
Why is it so important

764
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:48,928
Or such a good opportune

765
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,024
The cameras are becoming an increasingly important part of

766
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:53,792
Different diets

767
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:56,096
Because now the camera

768
00:29:56,352 --> 00:30:01,216
To do a lot of interesting features that help consumers like facial recognition objective

769
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:02,496
Malaysian people

770
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:05,568
So you are not going to be seeing cameras

771
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:06,848
Things like

772
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:10,688
Spend a tell you your pie is baked or not end security cable TV

773
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:11,712
Cameras that I

774
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:14,272
Actually you can take out your house and some strangers come

775
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:16,064
And also 360 degree cameras

776
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,368
Where are you now able to record a concert

777
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:21,952
And send it back though someone was not in the concert

778
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:22,720
Can watch

779
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:24,256
Aviara

780
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:27,840
Awesome cool, is well-known for smartphone

781
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:31,168
So how applicable is the phone camera

782
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:31,936
Back in the intern

783
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:39,104
Smartphone cameras really fantastic now they've done a lot of work in making these cameras better and better

784
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:41,152
Most people now just take the

785
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:42,176
Pictures of this month

786
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:46,016
And I really a great source of camera animation

787
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:47,552
Dab dab sensing

788
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:48,832
Multiple cameras

789
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:50,624
Ultra HD recording and so on

790
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,952
Sadistic Knology is actually very applicable to iot

791
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:55,488
Because we're not able to

792
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:57,536
Use the smartphone camera gorgeous

793
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:59,840
You actually got to work this kind of

794
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:00,608
Innovations

795
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:01,888
Into lots of other cameras

796
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:04,448
Example into home monitor

797
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:05,472
Security cameras

798
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:06,496
Action camera

799
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:07,520
Wearable camera

800
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,568
The beijinger technology applies

801
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:14,176
Sue Qualcomm customers they're just putting smartphone as Oh Sees into these cameras

802
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:16,992
What is one more than that what we do now is

803
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:19,040
To take the technology that we have developed

804
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:21,344
Smartphone camera button customized

805
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,880
For the various iot applique

806
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:24,160
So for example

807
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:25,952
The security cameras require

808
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:32,352
Start the amount of low light performance because these cameras installed where you know the light can go down to like one lumen

809
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:34,400
Until then you'll have to use things like infrared

810
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:36,960
So we are doing a lot of modifications

811
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:38,496
And a lot of innovation

812
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:44,384
Top of a camera technology that we built in phone space to make them more applicable to this kind of tired

813
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:46,688
So what's out there that

814
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:47,712
Currently using

815
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:48,480
Call contact

816
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:52,320
So the new nest camera you just said welcome technology

817
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:56,928
In that has built-in smartphone camera adapter to home security cameras

818
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:58,208
Rico recently

819
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:00,256
Introduce a typha a newt

820
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:01,024
Eataly

821
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,560
360 degree camera

822
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:04,096
The fuses are snapdragons

823
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,376
625 processor

824
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,656
But this is actually at 3

825
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:07,680
60 degree camera

826
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:08,960
Peacocks in 4k

827
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:13,056
Another example of how we were able to adapt and modify the Snapdragon

828
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:15,616
Camera technology for the consumer 360

829
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,920
That is an awesome camera

830
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:21,760
So we're can listeners learn more and get started using Qualcomm

831
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:22,528
Products for camera

832
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,856
Ulysses can go to qualcomm.com iot

833
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:27,392
And look for the camera section

834
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:28,160
It's a lot of

835
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:28,928
Information

836
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:35,328
About technology and diet

837
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:45,312
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your house Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest is Tony

838
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:48,128
CPL who is the CEO of vitamin

839
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:50,176
Hi Tony how are you doing today

840
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:52,480
I'm doing great Stacy nice to be here with you

841
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:56,064
Man I am super excited one because I love my Vitamix

842
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,856
Everyday I use it into

843
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:59,392
Because if I can make it smarter

844
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:04,000
I feel like I might be a healthier better person so let's talk about what you guys are doing to make Vitamix

845
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:09,120
Grout Stacy we're very excited because the first of the year we launched a new

846
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:11,936
Platform of products called the ascent series

847
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:16,544
And this new Ascent series really redefines hype

848
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,568
Performance blending

849
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,104
Form and Function

850
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,432
So for a long time the Aesthetics of our blender

851
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:24,480
People would say it's not that aesthetic

852
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:26,016
Replacing so we did it

853
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:29,088
Total redesign of the product and it has new

854
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:31,648
Euro curvilinear lines

855
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:33,952
And very high-tech

856
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:36,512
Aesthetics that people would be very proud to

857
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:39,840
Kitchen counter think of it as kitchen candy if you

858
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:44,960
The more exciting to that is the way this new technology integrates not just the

859
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:46,752
The form but with the new function

860
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:48,288
And it's a query

861
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:50,848
Invented our whole Vitamix platformer

862
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:55,456
Historic operating system within our blunder was a singular operating system

863
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:57,760
And now the new system has five different

864
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:01,088
Operating systems like

865
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:02,880
Actual software or like things

866
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:03,648
It does help me

867
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:10,304
Yes it actual software that's system that's kind of controlling how the motor runs a system that is controlling

868
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,864
Doing the program's system that stalking

869
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,144
From the base to the

870
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:14,912
The container

871
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:17,216
Assistant it stalking for the unit

872
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:18,240
2 apps

873
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:19,776
In a system around security

874
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:21,824
Because we wouldn't want anyone to hack our blender

875
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:22,592
By the way

876
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:25,408
That's true cuz sometimes I reach in there and that would be

877
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:29,248
Okay so the blender is connected

878
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:30,784
To the internet and to your

879
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:37,440
Just let me clarify little bit so we have a number of new technological advances that are part of the redefinition of the

880
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,720
The function of the unit

881
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:43,328
The first one that I'll highlight is the use of near field communication

882
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,352
Can NFC

883
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:47,936
Which is all around detecting the container

884
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:50,240
And so the new line of products

885
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:51,776
You can run an 8 oz

886
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:52,544
A 20 oz

887
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:58,944
48 oz a 64 Oz and even some new things in the future and the unit will automatically sense

888
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,784
Do near field communication the blender base what is on it

889
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,576
8 oz 20 oz 40 an ounce

890
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:06,112
And it will reprogram

891
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:07,648
It's also all the programs

892
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:10,464
Operate with that appropriate size container

893
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,768
Got it okay so the recipes and everything

894
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:13,792
Can then be adapt

895
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,120
That's exactly right so for example you wouldn't

896
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:19,936
Want to make soup in an 8 oz container might

897
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:21,472
Not be a safe thing to do so

898
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:24,032
Will limit the recipes that can be done in the 8 oz

899
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:27,360
Sounds like wise if you're doing a 40 an ounce or 64 Oz

900
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:28,640
The way that programmed

901
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:29,664
Develops in terms of it

902
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,944
It's ramp and speed

903
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:31,968
Induration

904
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:33,248
Will be different than it is

905
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:34,016
It is 60

906
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:38,368
All right so let's talk about what connectivity enables you to do

907
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:39,392
As a company both

908
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:42,976
Consumer services and then also as somebody who makes

909
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:44,000
Really high powered

910
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:47,584
Crazy blenders so just to talk a little more about that connectivity

911
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:52,960
Each of our units in addition to having NFC or near field communication on board

912
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:54,240
They also have Bluetooth

913
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:57,568
And this enables the blender to work in conjunction with the

914
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:04,224
So currently we have an app called the Vitamix perfect scale which is a scale that can detect which container

915
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,784
It comes with an app that has over 500 recipe

916
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,344
And once you put the container on the scale

917
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,624
Zero's out

918
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,672
The container and now you can build a recipe

919
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:13,952
With no measuring tool

920
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:16,512
And it will automatically take

921
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:18,304
That recipe and

922
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,632
Send a program to the blender that's appropriate for that recipe

923
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:22,912
That's what we've been doing since

924
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:25,728
The first of the year we're about to launch our new app

925
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:28,288
It's going to be with our new platform

926
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:29,056
The sensor

927
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:31,872
And this new app comes with 17

928
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:32,640
Program

929
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:35,200
So if you have any unit that has no programs like

930
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:39,040
Peanut butter or frozen dessert or soup or one of the big favorites

931
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:42,624
That everyone has self cleaning it will automatically take that you

932
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,160
And send that program

933
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:45,440
To the blender this is

934
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:48,000
What will help people be much more successful

935
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:49,536
The app also includes

936
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:51,328
500 recipes

937
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,864
And you can scale the rest

938
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:56,192
Recipes either by volume or by calories

939
00:36:56,704 --> 00:37:02,080
Show picture of your finger going up and down kind of scaling recipe Sally 120 ounces I really don't want 32

940
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:08,480
It will on the Fly we can't calculate all the nutritional information and display it for you or send it to your nutrition

941
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:10,528
No app and then it will recalculate

942
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,320
The program to blend

943
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:13,344
Tencent

944
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,368
The unique

945
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:16,160
Program for what you just caliber

946
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:17,952
To the blender and blend it

947
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:23,584
Awesome so it also sends that you mentioned something that was really exciting to me that it sent it to the lake my nutritional accounting

948
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:25,632
Is that so you guys are working

949
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:27,936
With everyone or is that like an open standard Zephyr

950
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:33,824
Yes we have an Open Standards effort that connects to a number of different apps right now but we're open to connect with anyone

951
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:40,480
And we are doing that now in addition the app includes meal plans so you can create meal plans for yourself it'll create

952
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:46,368
Create shopping list and probably in the not too near future will generate your grocery order and maybe even placed

953
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:50,976
Very exciting and ambitious so how does all of this connectivity

954
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:53,536
And Technology bit into the Vitamix

955
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,840
Vitamix is purple

956
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:57,120
Is 2

957
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:57,888
Liberate

958
00:37:58,144 --> 00:37:58,912
And nourish

959
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:00,448
Your zest for life

960
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:05,312
So the liberate part is really to reinvent the way you currently prepare food and beverage

961
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:08,640
And change the way you do it make it much easier and faster

962
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:11,712
The nearest part is really we're interested in making you high

963
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:13,248
And your zest

964
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:19,648
Your life is our customers they live with gusto and with that what we want to do is help them achieve

965
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:20,416
Their goals

966
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:22,208
If you won't think about their in the process

967
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,744
Exploration in

968
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,768
Transformation

969
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:27,584
And so we consider ourselves a transformational

970
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:30,656
We want to help people get to where they want to go

971
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:31,680
We want to make them

972
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:32,960
A better me if you

973
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:39,616
Whatever that might be for some it might be a mom who really wants to give her children the most nutritional diet that Sheikh

974
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:40,640
A healthy snack

975
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:46,016
For others it might be a high-performance athlete that wants to reach his Peak Performance or her Peak

976
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:48,832
Performance Brothers they might be a foodie and they want to

977
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:49,600
Create

978
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:50,368
Dish

979
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:54,464
That will really impress their friends when they entertain on a Friday or Saturday night

980
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,256
And so we build track

981
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:58,560
Within our app within

982
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:01,376
The way we map the customer Journey

983
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:03,168
To help people be successful

984
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:07,008
And as we go forward as a company it's all about being intuitive

985
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,800
What do we need to do

986
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:10,592
Help people reach their goal

987
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:13,408
We don't have to be intuitive cuz you're going to get a lot of

988
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:19,808
Data so let's talk about how you guys want to use that data to build better products but also maybe I don't know this

989
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:23,136
I had my blender forever and it's never broken down knock on something

990
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:25,184
So what else does that do for

991
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:27,232
So is it company

992
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:29,792
We pay a lot of attention to what

993
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:35,168
Our customers do both here and around the world we sell our products and 140 different countries

994
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,960
For example we track

995
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:39,776
Blender usage in 9 countries every month

996
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:44,384
Both what people make in home away from and what ingredients they use how often

997
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,920
And what they buy away from

998
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:47,456
And where they buy it

999
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:48,736
And what do they buy what

1000
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:52,320
The commercial side wework the largest chains in the world

1001
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:53,088
And so

1002
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:56,416
We're constantly bringing them ideas on menu creation

1003
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:57,184
So

1004
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,208
When we know that

1005
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:00,256
New ingredients are popping up

1006
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:01,280
Buy turmeric

1007
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:02,816
Caffeine

1008
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:05,120
Our customers are typically early adapter

1009
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:07,424
And so when they start putting these things in

1010
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,960
And we can bring these ideas

1011
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:11,264
To the major chains and say look this is where

1012
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,544
Menus are going

1013
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:18,944
Likewise for recipe development for the household we start developing recipes around what we are seeing people use

1014
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,224
With regard to Ingrid

1015
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:22,784
We're garnering a lot of information

1016
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,064
2 hour Vitamix

1017
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:30,464
Perfect Scale app where we Now understand what's actually happening during the day how often people are

1018
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,488
Making a smoothie

1019
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,512
What day park

1020
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:33,792
Soups

1021
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:35,072
Frozen desserts

1022
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:36,608
And it's very insightful

1023
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:39,424
How to know what people are making what ingredients are using

1024
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,496
What day Parts they're doing and we use that to influence

1025
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:43,776
What we created

1026
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:45,824
In terms of the experience within the app

1027
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:47,104
And the recipes.

1028
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:49,152
Could you sell that data I would

1029
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:52,224
Like if I were like Campbell's I would be really interested in like

1030
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,272
What's the trend in healthy soups

1031
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:55,296
So I can make some

1032
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:59,904
I suppose that's possible that's not really our aspiration we do it primarily just

1033
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:04,000
Insights in terms of the macro Trends and where things are going

1034
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:10,144
We don't even have the ability to look at it on an individual basis we look at it in macro terms

1035
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,704
And we look at the trends and then we use those

1036
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,496
To direct kind of where we go.

1037
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:20,896
Directions a lot of people talk about the monetization of data I'm not sure anybody is actually doing it and it's

1038
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:22,688
It's not something that's a high priority for

1039
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:24,736
Building a connected product

1040
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:25,760
Can be super dangerous

1041
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:26,784
Because there's a

1042
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:27,808
Security risk

1043
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:29,600
But there's also this

1044
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:31,392
Does the customer really want

1045
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:34,464
That's so how did you guys approach the idea of bringing

1046
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:35,744
Intelligence into

1047
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,768
Something that work really well

1048
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,096
We have a very robust business insights team

1049
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:45,984
And they do various types of qualitative and quantitative research as well as ethnography

1050
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,312
Epic research so we spent a lot of time in people's homes

1051
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:53,407
We spent a lot of times with shafts both in fine restaurants in large chain

1052
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:56,479
And we really understand how they use the prop

1053
00:41:56,991 --> 00:42:00,063
And then we create our controls we can

1054
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:05,695
Create are apps the whole experience around the way people really use the product and what's most of

1055
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:07,487
All right and

1056
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:09,023
One of the challenges of building a

1057
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:10,047
Product is

1058
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:12,607
Suddenly you got this thing that might last for

1059
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:16,191
7 years or 10 years out on someone's counter that's going to constantly need to be

1060
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:17,215
Updated

1061
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:18,239
Costs associated with

1062
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:20,031
How did you guys think about

1063
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:23,871
How to price it and how to think about that bring that aspect into your business

1064
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:30,271
I'm glad you asked that because Vitamix typically Vitamix owners consider their blender Vitamix blender is

1065
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:36,671
Asian heirloom that they're going to pass on from generation to generation and so we spent a lot of time thinking about that and that was one of them

1066
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:40,255
Main reasons why we put Bluetooth technology into are Prada

1067
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:42,047
So that in the future

1068
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:46,143
I downloaded Vitamix app that the most current APP can actually update

1069
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:48,447
Your blender just like a Tesla can be

1070
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:55,359
And so that's the infrastructure that we put in place is one of the operating systems that I talked about earlier and one that we're copping

1071
00:42:55,615 --> 00:43:00,223
Didn't that are Vitamix owners you know will well into the future still have that heirloom quality

1072
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:04,319
An heirloom type of perspective about a product and it will be able to be up to

1073
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:09,951
Awesome alright Tony thanks so much was really nice having this opportunity to chat with you

1074
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:16,607
