8
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:23,808
I think yes

9
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:26,624
This is the Stacy and Kevin show this week

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,904
Because otherwise

11
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:30,976
There's just no room we've got so much stuff

12
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:33,792

13
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:34,560

Are you guys coming up

16
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:40,704
We are going to talk about

17
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:41,984
Wow

18
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:46,848
Google did a bunch of news things for the Internet of Things We

19
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,152
They got partners for Google home

20
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:54,784
We talked about Cortana getting an SDK because that could be used for iot and we're going to do a little

21
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,624
Quick dive into Amazon's AI as a service and how it might

22
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:00,160
Compared to Google Assistant

23
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:01,184
Then

24
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,720
Where can I get an ad break from

25
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:04,512
Our sponsor Samsung

26
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:06,816
And we're going to go in the news cuz we got a new

27
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:12,448
Ble Hub that's Bluetooth hub for you guys we've got some homekit sensors which is a pretty new thing

28
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,240
We got zigbee over

29
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:15,008
Thread

30
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:17,312
Industrial news from GE

31
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:19,104
Saint Cloud news from Ala

32
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:22,688
Maybe some government news and we've got some self-driving car stuff

33
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,248
I'm out of breath already

34
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:28,064
Me too I didn't even say anything

35
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,344
I know just listening

36
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,368
Nexen tires

37
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:34,976
So before we get into all that let's take a word from our sponsor this week

38
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:41,376
Our sponsor this week is skybell have you ever wondered who's at your front door when you're at work or what

39
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:47,776
What a package arrives or when your kids get home the skybell video doorbell lets you see who's at your door

40
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:54,176
Or from your smartphone replaces your current doorbell and when a visitor presses the button that sends an alert with live

41
00:01:54,432 --> 00:02:00,576
Video so you can see hear and speak to the person at your door I love this doorbell I review doorbells for the

42
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:06,976
The Wirecutter and I will say skybell HD was my top pick and because I love

43
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:13,376
Love all of you guys so much and because the CEO skybell loves you we're giving iot podcast blisters

44
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:17,984
Discount you get $50 off using the code Stacy

45
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:24,384
This code is good through Christmas day so by now or don't but I think you should by now if

46
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,688
Looking for a video doorbell cuz it is great

47
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:27,712
Now

48
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:28,992
Back

49
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,016
2 hour show

50
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:36,928
Where Do We Begin actually we should probably Begin by me saying that I do work for Google as a consultant

51
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:43,584
And I have nothing to do with their IRT efforts and the only mention that because we're going to be talking a lot about the Rio 2 efforts

52
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,888
Yes let's just get started with Google

53
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,168
Because

54
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:49,984
By golly they did two pieces of news so

55
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,800
We talked about it a little bit last week with

56
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:55,104
Google opening up its SDK

57
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,128
4

58
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,920
Axel home

59
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,552
Is what it's called to the program's actions on Google and it allows you to

60
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,600
Build stuff for Google home

61
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:09,440
You're kind of like the skills for the echo

62
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,744
But a little bit different

63
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,352
So in this is worth noting so would you build

64
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,656
We're going to have to come up with some terminology

65
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:20,960
Hero it's remember how we had to do scene 2

66
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:22,240
Recipes at bows at all

67
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,568
So guys skills are for the Amazon Echo

68
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,592
Ecosystem

69
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:28,896
And Google calls them

70
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,688
Actions actions

71
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:33,248
It's okay because I think

72
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:38,624
If I read correctly it's actions and conversations are the two things you can do in a conversation somewhere like

73
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,184
Informational chatbots that you can add to

74
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,464
The Google Assistant

75
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,536
But actions are yes very much like skills

76
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:51,936
So when you do the conversations what happens is you enable this conversation and then and entirely

77
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:54,240
Play new entity pops up in your Google home

78
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,776
So it no longer sounds like

79
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,824
Google home voice it is now

80
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,104
Whatever voice

81
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,408
Conversation company has chosen

82
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,456
Kind of interesting

83
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:05,760
So if you're talking to WebMD you make it

84
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,296
Eye Doctor Li voice

85
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:09,600
What a doctor referral

86
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,392
I like I bet it'll be male

87
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:16,000
Pyruvates I write prescriptions very sloppily how can I help you today

88
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,351
12 what the brand thinks is it

89
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,679
So that'll be interesting and then the actions

90
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:26,495
No here's a question and I don't know if

91
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:28,799
I could not parse this together so

92
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:33,407
We're going to link to the other big news which actually happened on Tuesday

93
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,479
This week which was Google announced

94
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:39,295
That they changed their Brillo

95
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,599
Tiny device OS that is not actually that

96
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:42,879
2

97
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:46,719
Google things is now it's called and it's out of developer preview

98
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:48,767
And they also announced

99
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,047
Weave is avail

100
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:54,143
And we've is their kind of operating system

101
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,167
I guess it's how we should

102
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:58,751
I would say Android things is the operating system

103
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:02,591
You're right and rude things is the operating system and its 4

104
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:06,431
You know it's actually not for sensors that's for slightly bigger things

105
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,479
Communication

106
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:15,647
Right right there that's the one that tells what devices what devices can do what I think my guess it's ask

107
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:19,487
Schema I think Google is technically calling them

108
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:22,047
Oh shoot I forget what it's called now

109
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,583
They used to call it a

110
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:26,143
It's yet

111
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,167
Traits

112
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,703
Traits sound like

113
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,983
If you have a lightbulb

114
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,519
The trade can be

115
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,543
On off

116
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,079
Right right song

117
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:40,479
Sprite out of power switch component of a dimmer component the trait for dimmer will be brightness and so on so it's

118
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:44,575
More of explaining what device is telling each other what they can do

119
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:48,159
So this is going to compete directly with iotivity

120
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:53,023
Because that is also device Discovery Communications now they

121
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:53,791
They call it a protocol

122
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:54,815
But

123
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:59,935
Whatever it it also gives the the characteristics are the traits of a device

124
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:02,751
Much like all joined it now alljoy did come in

125
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:05,311
And converge with iotivity

126
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,079
So

127
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:07,615
That's

128
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:08,383
That

129
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,711
When we talk about weave that's who you should

130
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,479
Compare it to

131
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,807
And there's also Nest weave

132
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,855
So is part of the Google

133
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:24,767
And we talked about that before and we wondered why are there two weaves in in Google and

134
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:28,607
But I'd say that you said

135
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,167
What's going to happen is

136
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,959
Google's weave and Nest weave

137
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:36,799
Will converge and there will be more information about that

138
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:40,895
Coming out in 2017 according to a Google spokesperson

139
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:45,247
So that's good news that is good news so that means basically

140
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,015
With

141
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:48,063
All of this iot news

142
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,111
Things that are using weave

143
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:53,951
Will speak to the Google ecosystem including Google

144
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:54,719
Home

145
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:55,999
And they

146
00:06:56,255 --> 00:07:01,119
Google assistant on the pixel phones yes so now you can control your nest on the

147
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:02,399
Actually

148
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:06,751
Good but the other implications of this are

149
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:10,847
That there are a couple of devices that Google said already

150
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:11,615
Support

151
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:15,967
We are already using weave and those devices include products from Honeywell

152
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:16,991
Wink

153
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,271
Tp-link

154
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,551
And falcon

155
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,087
Which is why

156
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:23,647
We also heard on Tuesday that WeMo

157
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:25,183
Is going to work with Google home

158
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,719
So

159
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:27,743
Your

160
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:28,511
That's

161
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,303
Well I'll let you do the butt first

162
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,095
But it's not available yet

163
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,375
Is coming soon

164
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,399
Yeah but that's okay

165
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,423
Oh I will

166
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:38,239
Reboot your butt with a that's okay because

167
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:42,335
Again I still have not yet bought a Google home is like I bought a Ford

168
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:45,151
Echo have an another. I got two weeks ago

169
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:51,551
Again it's all. What devices these things work with what Partners they have who's supporting what and

170
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:55,391
It's been a little light on the Google home side until now and still is but

171
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,927
At least we got news

172
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:59,487
But here's what's coming and that makes me happy

173
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:02,047
And yes and I got confirmation from wink

174
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,583
That a wink version

175
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,863
Are weak support

176
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:05,631
Hyundai

177
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:06,911
Google home

178
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,447
Is also coming

179
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,727
But I don't have any PA

180
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:14,335
So we can probably expect the tp-link outlets those are cute

181
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,103
People love them

182
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:19,711
And Honeywell like There lyric their water sensor there

183
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,479
TV

184
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:26,623
I don't remember the I think it's the T5 thermostat that's slightly cheaper than the lyrics

185
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:29,695
Lifx bulbs First Alert

186
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,231
Smoke detectors as well

187
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:32,511
Yes

188
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,791
Should be

189
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,839
Coming and I will say

190
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,887
Kevin you didn't buy an echo

191
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,447
So I bought my echo December 2014

192
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:42,751
$100

193
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,031
We just watched something

194
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:44,799
If you want it

195
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,871
It just came out in November I remember that

196
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,199
USA versus I'm passing on home

197
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:54,527
But they didn't actually announce the Smart Home

198
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:57,343
Features or capabilities until March of 2015

199
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,135
That is correct also

200
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,415
And that's when I bought my

201
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,767
They took a little time

202
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:07,071
We're going to let we're going to give Google home the same time

203
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:08,863
That's fair

204
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,399
I give them

205
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:13,727
Them being Amazon more leeway here because they

206
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:17,311
I want to say invented the category but say they brought this

207
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:19,871
Type of product to the mainstream masses

208
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:23,711
Monica said he did it first but they brought to a wide range of people

209
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:25,759
First and therefore

210
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:30,623
I'm okay with them adding Partners overtime and obviously cuz I fought for them

211
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:35,999
I'm disappointed some other following competing products that did not have

212
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:38,303
A wide ecosystem available on day one

213
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,375
I agree but

214
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,679
Well they have apparently had to get weave all in one

215
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,751
That's fine

216
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:47,775
I don't know

217
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:52,127
I will say it's kind of overwhelming like if you imagine these things launching

218
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:52,895
With everything

219
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:55,455
It would be too much like people be like

220
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:04,415
I think it first if you were the first one to do that yes but now that they're

221
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:07,231
You know you can go to Home Depot or Lowe's whatever

222
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:10,559
And by connected light bulbs or a hub or whatever

223
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,095
I think it

224
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:18,239
Canopy who's these products work with all of them that are readily available out of the gate at this point in time

225
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:21,311
Not so much in 2014 when vehicle came out I agree with you

226
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,335
But

227
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:25,151
Or maybe I'm just being too optimistic on the market and I don't know

228
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:26,943
You know I think

229
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:28,991
So

230
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,271
Back to Android.

231
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:35,391
No it's worth delving into a lot because I see

232
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:39,487
Three different hardwood products you can use with it and I have one of them so I can't wait

233
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:40,255
So yes

234
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,279
It's going to suck

235
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,047
Support

236
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,327
You can start building with

237
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,863
The Intel Edison

238
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:45,887
Tnxp

239
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:46,655
Tipico

240
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,959
Raspberry Pi 3

241
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,055
Now there was

242
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:56,639
There was I saw on the Google developer Google Plus page

243
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:57,919
Which

244
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,455
Why not go there

245
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:03,295
Someone asking about Arduino and the response was that that just didn't

246
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:04,575
It wasn't a robust and

247
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,343
Platform

248
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:11,231
And I know if you guys remember but back when Android things was Brillo it required I think 64

249
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:12,255
64

250
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:15,583
Was it megabytes it was megabytes of memory to run

251
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:17,631
Which is a lie

252
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,167
So

253
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:21,727
It's possible that Arduino is just

254
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:23,775
Yeah

255
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:27,103
The other thing to know and this is something that I had heard about

256
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,639
Confirmed with Google

257
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:31,455
Is that if you want to use Wii

258
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:37,343
You're going to have to use Google's Cloud which means you're going to need an account and you're going to have to use the weave

259
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:41,439
Can we server components

260
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:46,559
Security saying and a control so like when they roll out

261
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:47,327
New traits

262
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,095
Isn't that sort of thing

263
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,655
That's also that all goes through one

264
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,423
Fun places

265
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:52,703
Taylor & Son

266
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:53,727
Location of Android

267
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,007
I see the

268
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,031
Wisdom

269
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,567
Making that

270
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,591
Decision

271
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:02,687
But I can also see people being upset saying what what if I want to use somebody else's cloud

272
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:06,527
I'm sure there will be some grumbles

273
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,807
You're going to have to be by 4

274
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,599
But later on after

275
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,135
Later in the show will talk about

276
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,535
Let's see what else do we need to know about the

277
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,559
List Aquino

278
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,327
So far

279
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:22,911
I don't know that we know much more

280
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,471
America's Best

281
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,495
From Google that's not Kev

282
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:30,335
Actually, that knows what they're talking about

283
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:34,687
Yeah so we don't I don't mean this was just an end developer announcement

284
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:39,807
Developer should say not any consumer announcement or anything to that

285
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:40,831
Extensive

286
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:43,391
I don't know that there's much more we know yet

287
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:47,743
In addition to this news we should also talk about Microsoft

288
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:48,511
Which

289
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:52,351
What no

290
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,911
Got an SDK that

291
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,703
Also on Thursday

292
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:57,727
Which

293
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,775
I think it's actually worth bringing up

294
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:00,799
Because

295
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:03,615
We're all waiting for like what's going to happen with

296
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:06,175
Microsoft in their iot home play

297
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:09,759
And what it looks like is the Cortana SDK

298
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,039
Is going to be

299
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:12,575
That

300
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,343
It's answer

301
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:20,255
Which is you can put Cortana on any device much like Amazon let's they have I'm going to say her name every

302
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,559
Alexa voice services

303
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:24,607
And you can put that on

304
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:25,631
Any number to buy

305
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:32,031
What is Microsoft's early Cortana s2k Partners is going to be Harman Kardon

306
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:36,639
The premium audio manufacturer which incidentally was bought by Samsung

307
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:40,223
Which is really odd which feels really

308
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:43,295
Yeah not that Samsung. Harmon but that

309
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:47,391
Samsung has their own iot play here and yet there

310
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:51,743
An early device partner with Microsoft to and showing off a

311
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:54,559
Audio speaker that you speak to

312
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:55,583
Cortana

313
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:58,655
Just like you would with an echo it's kind of strange

314
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,727
And so I would be curious given

315
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:04,287
Not necessarily.

316
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,311
Given

317
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:08,127
The SDK is now that are out

318
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,151
And the

319
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,687
It supposed to go home

320
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:11,455
So thick

321
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,991
No actions

322
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,783
We got the echo

323
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:15,807
STK

324
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,343
And we got

325
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:18,879
Cortana SDK

326
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:23,231
What is Cortana and Cortana skills kit

327
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:26,559
Cortana skills kit so you can build skills which thank you

328
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:31,935
Cortana for keeping with the skills nomenclature so I don't have to stretch my brain anymore during this show

329
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:35,263
What do we think about all this what are people going to use

330
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,311
Who are we going to talk to Kevin

331
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,639
Book

332
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:41,663
We're going to talk

333
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,711
Hopefully in the future it won't matter

334
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:44,991
Is my hope

335
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:48,063
I remember one of the first articles I wrote about

336
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:50,367
Voice interface is the invisible interface was

337
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,415
It will work because it's

338
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:59,327
Simple it's Universal anybody can use it without cortical learning interface if you know how to ask question

339
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:00,863
Speaker command

340
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,911
You can use this interface

341
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:04,703
Your question though is

342
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:05,983
What about

343
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,031
Multiple interfaces in a sentence

344
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,847
How do we manage that

345
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:14,175
This is some strange coming from me but I think

346
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,967
Microsoft is actually

347
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:19,039
Best suited for this challenge because

348
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,575
Cortana works on

349
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,599
Windows

350
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:25,439
On Android on iOS it works on my Xbox

351
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:27,999
And then they're going to have these additional devices

352
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:30,559
Hopefully through partners with their SDK

353
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:32,351
Souffrant terms of

354
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,887
Of Brett's of that

355
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:35,679
Invisible interface

356
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,471
He might

357
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,751
Beheaded the curfew

358
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,311
And they also downstairs

359
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:45,151
Microsoft translator using their AI skills cuz

360
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,943
Microsoft AI

361
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:48,479
Backend in

362
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:51,295
Speech-to-text in language

363
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,087
NLP

364
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,879
Language recognition all of that stuff

365
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,415
Is

366
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:57,439
Freaking

367
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:59,999
Amazing I mean Google has really good stuff

368
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:03,583
But Microsoft on Tuesday also announced real time

369
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,375
Translation

370
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:09,215
Like between groups of people speaking multiple languages

371
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,239
Is in person

372
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,055
That is insane

373
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,591
That's impressive I mean

374
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:15,871
That's really

375
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:16,895
Amazing

376
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:17,919
So

377
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,479
You may be right

378
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:24,063
Especially if we think about being able to talk and speak to something

379
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,087
Natural

380
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:26,623
Now

381
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,927
Let's throw a curveball in here

382
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:29,951
Because

383
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,231
Amazon

384
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:38,143
It was actually at reinvent at the end of November and then they also this week had a pulled it all together in this Nifty little

385
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,167
Blanco

386
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:44,287
Amazon is actually really trying hard to offer an AI product

387
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,335
For Developers

388
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,103
That

389
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:49,151
Capri train models basically

390
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:54,527
So you can do both custom algorithms and custom models but they also have

391
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,831
Pre tuned stuff for developer

392
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:58,879
And that's all going to be through there

393
00:16:59,391 --> 00:16:59,903
Cloud

394
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:05,535
So now they have these Amazon AI models that you can run on top of Amazon's machine learning

395
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,327
If you guys are like

396
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,863
Head exploded

397
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,655
Just be aware that

398
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:12,959
Basically

399
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:15,775
Is giving developers the ability to use the developer state

400
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:18,079
With Amazon's AI

401
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,615
Algorithms

402
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,895
So you can basically

403
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:26,271
Use your stuff to build new smarter things and you don't have to develop all the AI that like

404
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:29,855
Yeah it seems like the race is on

405
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,135
Or maybe

406
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,023
Come out everybody

407
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:41,887
Everybody wanted to provide a cloud service okay we do that everybody wants to

408
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:44,703
Provide us the case for that cloud okay we all do that now

409
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:45,727
Now everyone's

410
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,263
Provide an AI

411
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,311
For people to use so

412
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:55,711
As you were saying Amazon that I see three different things with your kind of interesting just to break it down a little further they got Amazon

413
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:57,759
Text for natural language processing

414
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:00,063
Forgot Amazon poly which is at X

415
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:02,367
Text to speech service and Amazon rekognition which is

416
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,647
And image service

417
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:04,927
Open the cloud

418
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:07,487
So they're providing all that to developer switch

419
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:08,511
Again a lot of

420
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:12,095
Others do that Google does that Microsoft does that as well so

421
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:16,191
So maybe the race is on is probably the wrong way to say at the races hopefully

422
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,983
Heating up

423
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:20,543
Dot-dot-dot and who is the beneficiary

424
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,567
We are

425
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:25,151
I'm going to play this for you I don't see if I don't know if this is going to work

426
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,175
Let's see if

427
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:28,991
You can hear it but this is Amazon Polly reading quotes

428
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,271
Sufficient

429
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:32,831
Technology is indistinguishable

430
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,647
That was Amazon Polly

431
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:36,927
Just reading

432
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:39,487
So

433
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,279
And she's really good in British

434
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:42,815
I guess that's piss

435
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:43,839
Right

436
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:45,375
Why not

437
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,703
Exit

438
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:49,983
Okay

439
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:50,751
So

440
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:52,287
That's a lot going on

441
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,847
Everybody's got their components

442
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:58,943
If I were to judge today I would say Microsoft is probably the most

443
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,991
Advanced in terms of

444
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:05,855
Speaking back to people and maybe understanding followed by Google maybe they're neck-and-neck

445
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:09,439
Amazon has the biggest ecosystem right now

446
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:11,743
And with their AI stuff there

447
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:13,535
Place to keep that ecosystem

448
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:15,327
Google

449
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,631
Has the best

450
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:22,495
I can't answer that question.

451
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:26,335
I'm like Google who has the best employees

452
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:28,895
Google probably has the best lake

453
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:30,687
Google knows what I'm talking about

454
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:31,967
When I ask it a question

455
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:35,551
So

456
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,319
We'll see

457
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,623
This is big you guys so

458
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:42,207
I'm really excited 2017 is shaping up to be really cool

459
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:44,767
Alright let's take a quick a break

460
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:49,631
And then we're going to come back with more

461
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:56,031
Hey everyone we are taking a break in The Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor this week sponsor is say

462
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:59,615
Samsung Arctic cloud and we have Janine

463
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:04,735
Who is head of developer evangelism for Samsung Arctic Cloud to tell us

464
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:06,783
Samsung artik what is Janine

465
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:13,183
Simple Arctic cloud is an open data exchange platform for the internet of things that provide easy-to-use opening

466
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:19,071
Tools to collect store and Eric on any data from any connected device your cloud service

467
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,607
Transformers

468
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,911
To accelerate device interoperability

469
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:24,447
Enable nudata inside

470
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:26,751
And why is interoperability sew in

471
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:31,103
Predicts will be over 20 billion connected devices by 2000

472
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,895
All of these things

473
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:34,175
We're not meant to work together

474
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:38,271
You know all in your own to be successful

475
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:39,807
Interoperability is critical

476
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:43,903
There was a study done that is shown that interoperability is required

477
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,999
For 40% on average to 60% and some settings

478
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:54,143
Artix headphones the problem of breaking down those silos by allowing for the true interoperability

479
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,679
Between devices in service

480
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:02,591
That sounds like a really powerful platform

481
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,895
What are developers doing with it

482
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:08,223
Incredible with developers are doing using or

483
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,759
Arctic hotspot formed

484
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:13,599
Recently added houses on where they filled out an industrial iot

485
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,367
Solutions

486
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,647
Service iot

487
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,696
So they used to check

488
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:20,256
To Monitor and troubleshoot the machine

489
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:21,792
Enter data Within

490
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:25,632
To Arctic Cloud which stores the data for clearing data from the chatbot

491
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:29,728
Issue with machine such as a high temperature reading

492
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:33,568
An article was created to send a notification

493
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:35,616
To the chat bot to communicate

494
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:37,664
With the operator said something went wrong

495
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:44,064
We also had somebody build a smart City solution which optimizes waste collection and reduces fuel consumption

496
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:44,832
Garbage trucks

497
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:48,672
The sensors are installed in the lead of the garbage container

498
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:52,768
Measure the temperature of the container and the dumpster is full

499
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:56,096
Isn't transmitted article

500
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:58,912
Waste Management Company

501
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:02,240
It's really easy for developers to build an increase in the rate of solution

502
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:06,848
Behind the complexity of iot development

503
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,384
And provide simplicity

504
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:13,504
We provide apis for everything in order to simplify that whole process

505
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:18,368
We have 10 ft kzzu schools in great sample code

506
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,648
Help you get started

507
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:20,928
And your development efforts

508
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:23,488
Awesome what you need where can I find out more

509
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:25,792
Developers can learn more about artist

510
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:32,192
Start using it for free by visiting

511
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:35,008
Order to build out and

512
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:40,640
Innovative iot solution using artificial intelligence

513
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,176
Tik Tok

514
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:43,712
Build wireless network

515
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:50,112
Disconnect low energy object will be doing a demo with crafty I as well as big box

516
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:56,512
Alright we are back and it

517
00:22:56,768 --> 00:23:00,608
Instead of a guest we are still here both Stacy and

518
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:01,376
Kevin

519
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,912
Talking about

520
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:05,472
News we did a big deep dive on

521
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:07,776
Holy cow all the new

522
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:10,336
A iCloud personal assistant

523
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:12,128
Talkin things

524
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:15,456
We should probably come up with a better name for them

525
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:19,808
And now we're going to get into some of the week's news that that we haven't covered yet

526
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:23,392
Such as well just get started with some new products out there in the market

527
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:26,208
Cassia networks has created a

528
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:27,488
Bluetooth

529
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:28,256
Home

530
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,024
Hub

531
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:31,328
And you guys are like

532
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:32,864
Who cares

533
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:36,704
But know this is great because Bluetooth mesh is not great

534
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:40,032
In this Hub actually makes your Bluetooth

535
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:41,056
Go further

536
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:43,104
And supports a lot of

537
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:46,176
So this is good for both home

538
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:50,784
And a lot of people in the industrial world are trying to use Bluetooth to actually because it's already

539
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,600
History of Aquarius

540
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:55,904
Yeah and the short actually the short range of Bluetooth

541
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:59,232
Advantage for them because it's a little bit more secure

542
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:01,536
Like within the factory there like

543
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:03,584
What I like about this and not enough

544
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:04,608
Typical it big

545
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:06,912
I don't say Phantom Bluetooth is I love Bluetooth

546
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:08,448
Very specific things

547
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:11,008
I would not think of it any router but

548
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,080
What I like about this and even though you can do this on Wi-Fi

549
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:16,384
I like Bluetooth for presents

550
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:20,992
Not not like Christmas presents but where I am present

551
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:22,528
You don't want blue

552
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:25,856
That would be cool to the best of both worlds

553
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:28,928
I also like this because right now

554
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:29,952
Bluetooth

555
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:35,328
Things like light switches are sensors it just doesn't make a lot of sense because it just doesn't have the

556
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:36,096
The range

557
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,144
I have in this is going to make this

558
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:44,544
Possible and it should hopefully it will be Bluetooth 5 compatible since they're just lunch again and

559
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:46,848
Bluetooth 5 specs

560
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:49,664
Out so I look forward to seeing this in the real world

561
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:52,224
This is actually an Enterprise version

562
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:55,296
And some of them support power over ethernet

563
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,696
Plug it in have connectivity

564
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:08,352
And you don't actually have to have the cloud Kasia SDK is both on the cloud is and on the rug

565
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:10,656
Router so yeah you can keep

566
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:12,448
Local

567
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,216
Local

568
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:14,240
Disconnect

569
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:15,520
AKA

570
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:21,152
Look all right so I think this is actually really cool product worthwhile

571
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:24,992
The other news in this is big because we didn't talk about her

572
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:27,040
Siri and app

573
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:32,672
The news here is that fibaro which is a maker of really awesome Z-Wave sensors

574
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:35,232
They're making homekit sensors

575
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,256
And

576
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:40,352
This is significant for two reasons one is for borrow is a Z-Wave hub

577
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:43,936
Company so this is the first time they've gone out of Z-Wave

578
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:44,704
What

579
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:46,752
And these are bushes her

580
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:47,520
Yeah

581
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:48,800
Pair Bluetooth

582
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:52,896
The other is that this is going to give some sensors to homekit

583
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:53,664
Which

584
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:54,944
Has been kind of

585
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,480
Left sensor

586
00:25:56,736 --> 00:26:00,320
Focused I guess

587
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:04,672
So fibaro is going to launch a flood sensor

588
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:10,304
For $70 a motion sensor for $70 and a door window sensor for $60

589
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:12,352
They're going to start selling

590
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:13,888
Natsumi

591
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,680
So

592
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:16,960
Yeah

593
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:18,752
Yeah that's good

594
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:25,408
And I'm going to get some you guys cuz I don't know

595
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:29,248
Come in my house I'm building at home kit ecosystem I've got the Elgato sensors

596
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,296
Eve sensors in their

597
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:33,088
Which also Bluetooth

598
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:35,136
And some

599
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:36,416
Lights

600
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,720
Some homekit lights

601
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:39,744
Philips Hue

602
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,280
Device

603
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:43,328
Idevices smart plug

604
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,608
And then I have some

605
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:46,144
Lutron

606
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:48,192
Ellucian hub

607
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,472
Switch mileage

608
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:52,544
If you guys are thinking of doing this

609
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:53,824
Know this

610
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,384
Are your Lutron stuff it only works on

611
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:57,664
One system

612
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,432
Or it like

613
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:01,248
One thing or the other so I'm going to break my Lutron lights for

614
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:03,296
In my husband going to

615
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:04,832
See that's gay

616
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:11,232
Shrugging right now

617
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:16,608
Actually yes it be as if it's not over wife over by so if it's a Directv billing

618
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,888
Z-Wave

619
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:20,448
Or Lutron those only connect to One Network

620
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:21,216
At a time

621
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:22,496
So

622
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:26,336
For the Lutron what I'm going to do is I'm going to have to run it to the Lutron hub

623
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:29,664
Which then I can use the Lutron app on my

624
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:31,456
Android devices

625
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:33,248
Just still control them

626
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:34,272
But I can't type

627
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:37,856
Since

628
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:40,416
Might my husband

629
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,232
You know

630
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:44,512
His life is already missed

631
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:48,608
So okay so that's that we should talk about sleepy

632
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,168
You know why cuz we got like two other pieces

633
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:53,216
Yeah Evergreen thread

634
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:56,288
Zigbee running over the thread protocol

635
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:58,336
Holy cow guys

636
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:00,640
ZTE running over the thread protocol is

637
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:04,992
Real so now Icees they're going to show this off that this is work

638
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:06,528
And for you guys for like

639
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:09,088
Oh my God Stacy you're breaking my brain

640
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:13,952
Protocol is a wireless is a mesh Wireless protocol

641
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:17,792
Much like zigbee and Z-Wave are mesh Wireless protocols

642
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:18,816
Like those

643
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:22,400
Thread has low and doesn't use a lot of energy

644
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:24,192
Unlike those

645
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:27,008
It is IPv6 compatible so it

646
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:28,800
Can go directly out to record

647
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:33,152
The differences when you're thinking of thread

648
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,432
Throw it down at

649
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:35,968
Zigbee and Z-Wave

650
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:39,296
Once Bluetooth has its mesh network will throw Bluetooth mesh in there just

651
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:40,832
But now

652
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:42,624
With zigbee running over 3

653
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:45,184
That means you get the zigbee

654
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,464
Software stack

655
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:52,608
Over the thread protocol in the zigbee software stack has a lot of stuff for lights that's really powerful

656
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,656
For managing huge lighting net

657
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:55,680
Works or big lady

658
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,496
So that's that's why that

659
00:28:59,008 --> 00:28:59,520
Hatteras Sol

660
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:02,336
Probably good for a Industrial

661
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:08,736
An Enterprise has announced that they're going into the Enterprise a couple weeks ago so

662
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:13,600
It also means that anything that supports the red so

663
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:15,648
I kind of think that Google

664
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:18,464
Is going to be a big supporter of thread since it came out of nest

665
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:19,744
And in fact

666
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:21,280
There is a

667
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:23,072
CB radio with a Google WiFi

668
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:25,888
So

669
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,936
I imagine we're going to see

670
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:31,264
Zippy ever thread coming from your Google Wi-Fi routers at some point

671
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:34,336
I Can Only Imagine

672
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:36,384
Can I say otherwise cuz I don't know

673
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,432
But I did get my Wi-Fi

674
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:40,480
Something I'm actually using right now

675
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:41,248
We're going to talk about

676
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:43,552
Stay tuned

677
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:44,320
You guys

678
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,344
Cool

679
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:48,928
What other things do we have

680
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:52,512
There's lots going on all of a sudden so

681
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:55,840
Google self-driving car efforts

682
00:29:56,352 --> 00:30:00,448
Which were part of I guess part of the X lab X division

683
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,056
Are now a separate company under alphabet called waymo

684
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:06,336
I guess so

685
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:09,408
W what's the next letter to be used in alphabet so

686
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:11,200
Waymo is its own

687
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,992
Company under alphabet

688
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,040
And

689
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:17,600
Google is partnering with I want to say

690
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:19,392
Chrysler Fiat

691
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,208
For yeah yeah so

692
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:26,304
This is probably a CES event I suspect we'll see some

693
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,608
Demonstrations of self-driving

694
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:29,888
Minivans

695
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:31,936
Are pacifica's I can't recall which

696
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:34,752
Ephraim Chrysler that will use the Google tech

697
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,544
And

698
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:43,200
Yes it's interesting because a lot of people recently were saying Google shutting down and self-driving car business not like really

699
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:45,760
I wouldn't know cuz I don't I got not on that team

700
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:46,784
But then

701
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,856
No they're not shut down their spinning off to its own company

702
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:51,648
Yes

703
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:53,696
And then Uber

704
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:56,256
Is like

705
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:57,536
What up

706
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:01,632
Yasso

707
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:07,264
I'm very curious what Uber drivers think of this but I'm sure Uber Riders

708
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,032
Will be

709
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:08,800
Intrigued

710
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:11,616
The first self-driving Ubers are

711
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:13,920
Alive and well in San Francisco

712
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:15,712
So this is a very limited

713
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:18,272
Market but yes so it's starting

714
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:21,600
Well today that they were recording a show witches Wednesday

715
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:25,952
You can get a self-driving Uber even matches one if one is available

716
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:29,024
Trying to figure out did they say that it said how many

717
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:31,840
There are how many Ubers but

718
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:36,704
As far as I know

719
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:38,240
I would hope so

720
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:44,640
That would be a problem if something happened you don't say don't say

721
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:47,712
It's a they're spending their self-driving pilot

722
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,088
Williston

723
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:56,160
Depend on Santana local

724
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:58,208
Ordinances and such but

725
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:03,072
Yeah they really don't say anything I'm looking at their blog post right now

726
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:04,096
There is

727
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:04,864
There is one

728
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:07,424
So maybe Uber drivers won't care

729
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:10,752
They have less to do

730
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:11,776
Okay

731
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,848
There's going to be a driver in

732
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:15,616
In the car

733
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:17,152
Yay

734
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:18,944
Cuz I would be kind of nervous and

735
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:21,248
Now the drivers don't have to drive

736
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:22,016
Also

737
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:25,600
Yay so yeah this is this is actually happening

738
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:30,208
You guys and I would not want to drive any self-driving in San Francisco seems like a freaking nightmare

739
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:33,792
Cuz people are running in and out and there's construction everywhere

740
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:41,472
I highly recommend we should link to this video in our shonos because I highly recommend people watched the demonstration of the Uber cell

741
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:42,752
Self-driving car because

742
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:44,544
The poor driver

743
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:49,152
It's just sitting there bored as all get-out looking around out the window

744
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:52,480
I will link to that machete

745
00:32:55,296 --> 00:33:00,672
Yes I'm an Uber car babysitter how can I help you

746
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:03,232
I don't have to keep your eyes on the road

747
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:04,000
I guess I have to be

748
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:05,024
Prepare to take over but

749
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:08,096
That would not be

750
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:11,936
Okay Industrial

751
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:13,984
So we got some clown news here

752
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,520
Ala which is

753
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:18,848
A company that provides a cloud service for

754
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:22,688
Any company that wants to build connected devices basically

755
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:27,040
It works with it's a cloud service that's authenticated and lots of chips you put the chip in your product

756
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:29,600
And it said that you have a cloud back in for all of your

757
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:30,368
Needs

758
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:32,928
Have announced it they are doing

759
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:35,232
The echo skills for people

760
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:37,024
So they will support it

761
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:37,792
They will make

762
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:43,424
All of your stuff you can figure your stuff and then they take those configurations and then they tune it to the echo can

763
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,448
Integrations

764
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:45,728
Presumably

765
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:48,288
Stay I did talk to them there and talks with

766
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:54,432
You know all the other providers so presumably they will tune your stuff to the other providers that handle the fact that

767
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:56,224
Google requires you to have

768
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:57,504
To separate

769
00:33:58,016 --> 00:34:00,576
There is on cloud implementation so

770
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:02,112
This is great news both

771
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:05,440
For companies that are like

772
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:06,464
Complicated

773
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:09,024
It also for the companies that are

774
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:09,792
Like

775
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:14,144
Hey this world is complicated we will do all of the back in nasty stuff for you and

776
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:15,168
YouTube pays money

777
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:16,960
And so this is great

778
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:17,728
Plus

779
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:24,384
I got the ticket from the Ala guys there were like yeah we had to do this because all of our customers were like we don't want an app we need voice

780
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,152
Recognition

781
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:26,176
So

782
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:29,760
I feel like that's kind of a no-brainer but there's another

783
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:31,296
Example of

784
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:33,088
Voice really winning

785
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:36,160
When it comes to the interaction for The Internet of Things

786
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:37,184
We will

787
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:42,560
Other cloud news GE is building industrial networking gear for its

788
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:46,400
Iot industrial iot stuff they're using Cisco and HP gear

789
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:48,448
Basically building gateways

790
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,984
Randa gateways

791
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,032
Sensors that sort of stuff

792
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:53,824
Because you can't

793
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:57,152
You can't get stuff to the predix cloud if you don't give him the hardware

794
00:34:57,664 --> 00:35:02,016
Kind of strange because I know that GE already works with like

795
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:03,296
Gateway's and stuff from

796
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:04,576
Like Intel Dell

797
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:06,112
There's a bunch of like

798
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:06,880
Really

799
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:10,976
Archaic non-computer vendor kind of Gateway providers

800
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:13,792
That have been in the industrial space for a while that

801
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:15,584
LG also works with so

802
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,400
I agree this was kind of strange when

803
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:22,496
When I saw it on the notes and whatnot but then I'm thinking you had the whole products that is

804
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:24,032
Without data

805
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:27,104
It's kind of useless but it needs data

806
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:33,504
So I think they're just trying to remove obstacles to getting at that dated from industrial machines

807
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,784
End-to-end solution that

808
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:36,320
When is right

809
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:39,648
Man you want to talk about Wi-Fi or

810
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,952
I feel like we should just skip ahead to Wi-Fi

811
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:42,720
What do you think

812
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:44,768
Yes that's what we talked about

813
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:47,840
MiFi as I said I got my Google Wi-Fi units

814
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,632
Which cost me to eat

815
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:52,704
129 I think under $29

816
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:53,984
And you already had that

817
00:35:55,008 --> 00:36:01,152
I did I did have the onhub and remember when Google Wi-Fi was announced a lot of people are like my own house

818
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:03,200
Done if you don't know

819
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:07,040
It's actually part of this Google wi-fi system

820
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:10,112
Where can be if you already have an onhub so you can

821
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:11,136
You can actually

822
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:13,440
Create a mesh network with multiple on hubs

823
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:15,488
If you wanted to but that's expensive so

824
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,328
I went the cheaper out and added one Google Wi-Fi to my onhub

825
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:22,144
Ramayanam is downstairs on the first floor

826
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,704
In a two-story town house about 2000 square feet

827
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:31,360
I had Wi-Fi signal issues and obviously speed therefore issues in the backside of the second floor of the house

828
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:37,504
So am I getting what I want to put a Google Wi-Fi on the second floor and see what that does and oh my goodness

829
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,528
Just like

830
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,368
You know when hero or Bloomer many other available Solutions

831
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:43,136
It did the trick

832
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:45,440
Time it was very simple to add

833
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:47,744
Alright to the new Google Wi-Fi app

834
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,304
The old onhub app is now Wi-Fi

835
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,864
Just put branding purposes as I suspect

836
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:59,008
And so I've got this little mesh network of snow 2 nodes and it's working really well

837
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:01,312
Yay

838
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,384
So you really notice the

839
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:05,408
And how did that go

840
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:15,392
You know I did try the Eero and when I got the Wi-Fi and tweeted about it people like

841
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:16,928
Compare the Euro that you tried and so on

842
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:22,560
And I'm not going to compare them I said they both do the job and the reason I'm not doing a strict comparison

843
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:26,400
Is because I tested the Eero 3 pack in my old house

844
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:27,936
Prices

845
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:29,472
And therefore

846
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:31,776
It's not a fair comparison I mean Network

847
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:36,128
Testing you can add variables in and expect a good test

848
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:37,664
Well you can't

849
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,248
YouTube

850
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:44,832
But but it's a totally different environment so you know it's hard for me to say

851
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:48,416
This is better or worse than any Rover example or some other

852
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:50,464
Whatever you want

853
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,792
I don't I can't compare it cuz I've never tested those here in this house

854
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,352
Severe is again

855
00:37:56,864 --> 00:38:02,752
All right well I also in testing Wi-Fi so I talked about these last week these with a plume pods

856
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,592
These are the little WiFi things that there hexagonal

857
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:10,688
Metallic beautiful things that you plug in there's a radio in a network

858
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,272
You plug into it electrical outlet

859
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:17,856
What you could do that

860
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:21,184
When you plug into your

861
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:22,720
So

862
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:23,488
I set it up

863
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:27,072
And then I didn't tell you guys about it last week because it's a

864
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:31,424
It's a learning system so I didn't test it until it has been in a week so it would

865
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:33,216
Learn what it needed to know

866
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,240
So

867
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:36,800
The key here is it's all connected to the cloud

868
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:38,080
And for me

869
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:40,384
I did notice that my Wi-Fi network

870
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,664
Has improved

871
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:43,712
In places that are hard to get to

872
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:46,528
Now the comparison for me is going to be the Eero

873
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,600
Because that's what happening in my house

874
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:53,696
I did notice that the plume Wi-Fi made some less

875
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:55,744
So like my doorbell for example

876
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,280
I have a doorbell in

877
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:59,072
It had okay cover

878
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:01,376
Rich writes my Wi-Fi powered doorbell headache

879
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:04,448
Okay coverage but it has better coverage under the blue

880
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:09,312
And I'm assuming that's because it is found a node that's a little

881
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:10,080
The closer

882
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:12,384
Imagine it's using the note that

883
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,920
It's the same node

884
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:19,296
Is the doorbell the closest spot to my server closet where is which is where I keep my Hubs and such

885
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:20,832
Is right

886
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:22,880
So that's better

887
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:26,464
So that could just be that the self learning and optimization

888
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:31,328
Aspect if the location obviously you're good the location hasn't changed

889
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,352
So

890
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:34,144
It's getting more DVDs

891
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,936
I also will say though

892
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:40,032
The plume has been an exercise in frustration for me personally

893
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,568
Because

894
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,872
They're only there's only one

895
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:45,408
Gigabit Ethernet port

896
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:46,688
On each

897
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:47,456
Little pod

898
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:50,784
The challenge for me

899
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,600
Because I run so many hubs

900
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:55,136
Plugged into

901
00:39:55,648 --> 00:40:00,256
I I run a switch because I have you know my Philips Hue Hub needs access to the internet

902
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:01,024
Right

903
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,560
My SmartThings Hub

904
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:03,584
Needs

905
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,864
Actually that actually at

906
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:05,632
I think as wife

907
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:10,496
I have my SmartThings Hub which may or may not be his wife I cannot recall

908
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:13,312
My switch is

909
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,128
So there are a couple of devices that just

910
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:17,408
Have to be plugged in

911
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:18,688
I also

912
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,736
Plugin my TVs

913
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:22,272
I hardwire

914
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:24,832
And this is because my house is new and I have

915
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:25,856
Ethernet

916
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:26,624
In every room

917
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:29,440
So everything is hard everything that can be

918
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:30,720
Hardwired table lamp

919
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:33,024
Is which is great for like

920
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:34,816
My TV

921
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:37,376
It's bad for the plume

922
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:42,240
Because the pluma can't actually plug anything into it so I kind of broke a lot of things in my house

923
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:43,520
What I installed these

924
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:46,848
Now that doesn't mean you will break a lot of things in your house when you install

925
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:49,920
It just means that if you're using a switch

926
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:50,944
This may not be

927
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,224
The router its it's

928
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,248
You can

929
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:54,016
Set it up

930
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:56,832
There's a way to set it up but it is not the easy

931
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:57,856
Option that

932
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:59,904
Kind of

933
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:04,256
And In fairness to what they are selling what they're selling

934
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:10,912
First and foremost is a simple way to have better wi-fi connectivity throughout your house at

935
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:12,448
Coverage and speed

936
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,288
Right that's that's the main thing that they're selling enter that

937
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,360
I think the plume works from what you described

938
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:21,408
As well as what other reviews I've read

939
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:26,272
It's when you start getting into lots of IRT levels that

940
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:31,648
Many resources are constrained could a lot of only have a single ethernet Jack on what whatever

941
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:33,440
Hardware they have

942
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:35,488
So this is where Kevin and I

943
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:36,256
Spent

944
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:39,584
Because we are we are Kevin and Stacey it was his what

945
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,376
We spent a long time discussing

946
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:42,144
The need for

947
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,424
Terse

948
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:47,264
Even if your goal is to be like this mesh Network to have to get EBT

949
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:50,336
At least two

950
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:51,616
At least have that is an option

951
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:53,919
I mean I'm fine by me

952
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:58,783
40 bucks if you want to add more for like the people who have a couple devices

953
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:00,319
Great but I feel like

954
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:04,671
That could be a losing game because like I continually add devices to my switch

955
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:09,279
Which of Billy don't reproduce the number devices we have

956
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:10,303
Exactly

957
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:12,351
2/4

958
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:13,887
Euro has to

959
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:15,935
Aunt

960
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:17,215
Google

961
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:19,007
Yeah I think it wise to

962
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:24,127
What is 4

963
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:29,759
Well I'm using 1/4 backhaul and then there is another one that I used my TV so I can watch work at you

964
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:34,111
But if you wanted you to put that into instead of a TV

965
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:36,415
Plug your TV into the switch if you

966
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:37,183
Chester

967
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:37,951
That's true

968
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:42,047
It all gets very complicated the more devices you add

969
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:43,839
Yes networking is not easy

970
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:48,191
And I will also say a lot in the last couple of months

971
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:51,007
Thor I've been testing this concept of

972
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:53,055
Secure devices on

973
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:54,335
Like how to secure my network

974
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:57,919
So what I did is I actually put a bunch of devices on my guest net

975
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:01,247
And that's actually worked fairly well

976
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:04,063
But I don't feel like it's any more secure

977
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:10,463
Really it's just harder to get to in the first place and once you're there there's no additional security

978
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:13,535
You know I will throw a bunch of devices that I know don't

979
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:14,303
Need to talk to

980
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:17,887
Thanks but the problem is most of my devices still need to talk to my phone

981
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:20,191
Select my doorbell for example has to

982
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:22,751
My phone and say hey

983
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:24,031
So my phone needs to be on

984
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:27,871
That's where it gets tricky you need it when you need to start worrying about what

985
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:32,479
Network Iran to actually use a device that gets back to the hole at the very beginning of this conversation

986
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:37,343
Which interface we talked to you know here it's now it's which interface are we connecting to

987
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:39,135
For networks we can do something at

988
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:41,695
And that's that's just a barrier that we don't need

989
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:44,767
The guest Network solution

990
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:45,791
Is sucky

991
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:48,095
Just going to lay it out there

992
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:51,167
So the other solution is to create

993
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:54,239
A completely separate Network it only do

994
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:56,543
Certain things on it

995
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:59,615
And I did that and that worked well but it was kind of

996
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:00,383
Also

997
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:01,663
Silly

998
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:03,455
So everything else

999
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:06,271
Lives 90% of the time on my main

1000
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:07,039
Network

1001
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:12,415
If I was doing banking or anything that required extra security light paying for stuff

1002
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:14,719
Play with switch over to

1003
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:16,511
Decorticate securenet

1004
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:20,863
Very little fun

1005
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:21,631
In excitement

1006
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:24,447
People people are not going to want to do that

1007
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:28,543
It makes me wonder is there an opportunity for router makers here to

1008
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:34,943
Beef things up and really really start integrating internet of things into their products with a better

1009
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:36,479
We should probably think

1010
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:37,503
First about

1011
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:38,271
Making

1012
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:40,575
Batters a little bit more secure in the first place

1013
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:42,879
Start adding the security

1014
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:49,279
Super example there was just a story in ARS Technica that matters that are blue

1015
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:50,303
Turbo to a hack

1016
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:51,583
Jealous people take

1017
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:53,119
Spices

1018
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:53,887
And this is

1019
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:59,263
This is older router so the r7000 r6400 r8000

1020
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:01,567
And some others

1021
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:05,919
Tibetan flute a link to the story so you guys can have it

1022
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:06,943
Are also

1023
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:07,711
Endanger

1024
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:09,503
That's just

1025
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:11,039
Sample of right now

1026
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:12,831
Actually let's just say it

1027
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:14,367
Buy someone you love a router

1028
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:17,439
If you have another router in like a year

1029
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:19,231
Go buy a router

1030
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:23,839
And I would say by one of the more modern routers that allow over-the-air updates

1031
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:27,423
That actually means a mesh Network in most times I actually

1032
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:30,751
Kind of had a conversation over Twitter with Netgear asking about

1033
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:32,543
Is there Nighthawk routers Witcher

1034
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:37,407
Freaking awesome were updatable over-the-air and they're like no you got to do it over the land

1035
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:38,431
But at least they are up

1036
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:40,223
There's a wreck

1037
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:40,991
Addiction

1038
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:44,575
That's a lot of news so we've got Wi-Fi

1039
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:45,343
We've got

1040
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:51,231
Many many new products we've got the race heating up between Google and Amazon and Microsoft

1041
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:53,023
Wechat protocols

1042
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:54,815
We have protocols we got it all this week

1043
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:55,839
Test

1044
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:57,375
All right we will be back

1045
00:45:57,631 --> 00:46:01,471
The following week we're going to do our podcast a little bit early because of

1046
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:04,543
We didn't want to put it out on the day before Christmas Eve

1047
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:08,639
You'll probably see your podcast show up a little extra early but

1048
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:09,663
Enjoy it

1049
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:11,967
Kevin I will talk about exciting things

1050
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:13,247
Do you have a lovely guest for you

1051
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:14,783
It will actually be

1052
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:18,623
My husband he's going to talk and give a real person's perspective

1053
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:23,999
You can play it for your significant other when they open their presents under the Christmas tree and they're like

1054
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:25,791
Oh my God why did you give me a connected

1055
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:27,839
Garage door repair

1056
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,423
Thanks you guys for listening and

1057
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:38,079
We will see you next week by well that's it for this week's show thank you so much for listening

1058
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:44,479
And we'll see you again next week on the Internet of Things podcast and if you don't get enough iot
