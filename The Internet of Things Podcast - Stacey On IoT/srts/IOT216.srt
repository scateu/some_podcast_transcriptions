/ NTT

62
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,600
Actually sounds pretty cool I would totally get a dongle all right

63
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:35,392
Let's move on

64
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:36,416
To this way

65
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:38,208
Freak Show Kevin

66
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:40,768
I feel like we've got to do a little bit of recap

67
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,048
So

68
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:44,352
We spent a long time talking

69
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:48,192
About Google because last week Google announced it

70
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:50,496
It did really announcer put up a blood

71
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:53,312
It said it was going to kill its works with nest

72
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:56,640
So we don't last week with a lot of the Rama

73
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,408
Vacations

74
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:59,712
In the biggest ramification

75
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:02,528
To sum it up is if you have a nest device

76
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,064
Nest devices used to talk

77
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:06,880
On their own out other devices

78
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,928
Nest devices will talk to the

79
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:09,952
Google home hub

80
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:11,488
And Google home

81
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,768
And

82
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:14,048
Which has been rebranded

83
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,072
Tattoo yes

84
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,632
Which has a new name

85
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,168
Turn up Nest homes

86
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,520
There's the nest home hub there's the old Google how there's the Google

87
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:24,288
Mini

88
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,872
That's the weird thing summer rebranded summer not but regardless yes

89
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:30,432
Rabbit aggression is going away

90
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:35,296
Yes and so basically you're messed up when I talk to Google home devices

91
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,832
And then all of your other devices will

92
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,112
Google home

93
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:40,416
So basically there's a middle man in the middle

94
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:42,976
Which is where those metal bands like to hang out

95
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,512
People were really upset

96
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:47,840
It breaks a lot of functionality of all of your existing

97
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:48,608
Google

98
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:49,632
Integrations in route

99
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:50,656
Teen service

100
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:52,704
WeChat

101
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,240
Third-party services such as

102
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:56,544
Yonomi stringify

103
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,848
Those if you have routines for your nest

104
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:00,128
Those will not work

105
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,408
Wendy

106
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:04,480
Integration shuts down which I believe is planned for August 3rd

107
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,248
First

108
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,528
Yes the end of August

109
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:11,136
And starting the middle of June Google's going to let you know that you can migrate Your Nest account

110
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:11,904
To the Google home

111
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,696
You should not do that

112
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:14,464
Until

113
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:17,024
You know that your other Integrations arson

114
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,303
That's why

115
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:22,143
Okay or other advice is we've gotten a lot of questions

116
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:25,727
People are like this is terrible I'm so mad what other devices

117
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:32,383
So we wanted to run down we mentioned the Honeywell thermostats the T5 is an excellent thermostat Honeywell actually just put

118
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,407
39 + 2

119
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,431
T10 thermostat

120
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,967
Those play with gift

121
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:36,991
With Google

122
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:40,063
With homekit in many cases and

123
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,087
Also with

124
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,111
Amazon

125
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,391
Ecobee

126
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:45,695
Is another thermostat brand that works with

127
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:47,231
A lot of other things

128
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:51,583
And I would be a little cautious there because Amazon did from them out of the

129
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:53,631
But

130
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,655
They are an independent

131
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:55,423
Canadian Cup

132
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,959
So and we loved

133
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:58,495
Are the doorbell front

134
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,519
August

135
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:03,103
I hated their first doorbell their second doorbell I haven't tried yet because I

136
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,383
In the middle of moving

137
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:07,455
But they do have a doorbell out it works with

138
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,991
Other ecosystem

139
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:13,855
Arlo is announcing a doorbell that actually looks just like the nest hello so I don't know if

140
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,415
Bee Hardware inside will be as good

141
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:17,695
And then let's see

142
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,463
Cameras

143
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:20,255
Are Lumix cameras if you can

144
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,535
You could go all in on Arlo

145
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,071
Given this news

146
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,119
And Arlo does actually have

147
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,655
Gud madhumeh integration

148
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:27,679
And that shows you

149
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,727
Your Arlo cameras on

150
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:32,031
Madam a device with a display

151
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:35,359
Let's see what other things would we want to know about

152
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,127
Smoke detector

153
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:39,199
I can't really in good conscience recommend the First Alert

154
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:41,247
Is it so expensive but it is a connected smoke

155
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,015
Detector

156
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:44,831
I will say that if you are

157
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,391
Maybe doing the Google Amazon route

158
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,951
Amazon did just this week and I'm scarred

159
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:55,327
Which is an interesting way to start getting remote notifications from your smoke detector

160
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:56,863
Because guard

161
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,399
When you leave your house

162
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:01,471
You basically turn this functionality on your Amazon

163
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:04,287
Echo it will listen for both glass breaking

164
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,335
Amazon of a smoke alarm or a

165
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,359
Carbon monoxide

166
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:10,943
And that will just send a notification to

167
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:14,015
The account owner's phone

168
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:16,063
Just some people are aware

169
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,135
You're going to get a text message we need an in-app notification

170
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:21,439
It doesn't go to the whole family

171
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,975
Just that one individual

172
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:25,023
It will however send an alert

173
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:25,791
2

174
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:26,559
You

175
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:32,191
Thruway monitored security service or will send an alert to your monitored security service if you're using the ring

176
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:34,751
Security service or ADT Security services

177
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,567
So you can actually elect

178
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:42,175
To turn on guard and have it send those notifications to your Professional Security firm

179
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,199
If you have

180
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,223
If not

181
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,271
Send it to you via in-app notification

182
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:49,599
At least notifying notification option theory is

183
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:53,183
But it's a free service that you did just because you happen to buy an echo

184
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:53,951
So you know

185
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,255
Always options

186
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:59,071
Those are for people who are not happy with the situation

187
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:02,143
And want to move away from Google ecosystem I presume

188
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,423
Yes

189
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:07,519
And I will say I don't I mean our audience cues very heavily towards

190
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:09,055
DIY I will say most

191
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,591
People I bet there's actually

192
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,407
Very large contingent of people who are going to get emails from Google

193
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:15,199
Rather nasty stuff in there to be like

194
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:16,735
What Google owns what

195
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:17,503
Best

196
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:20,063
What do I do I think there's going to be a lot of

197
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,903
Because most people are not that wired

198
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,463
Write my point was

199
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:29,279
You want you could choose to just completely

200
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:31,327
Change your whole smart speaker to ecosystem

201
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:35,423
Keep in mind that while Google has shut down works with nest

202
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:36,959
When will be shutting down

203
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:39,263
They will be working with

204
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:42,079
A limited number of integration partners

205
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,615
Going forward

206
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:46,175
An Amazon is a perfect example.

207
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:48,223
Working with Amazon to keep

208
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:49,503
Ness

209
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,039
Working with the

210
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:53,087
Amazon Echo products

211
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,111
So

212
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,439
It may turn out that over the next couple months as that

213
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:59,487
Horse of that program wines down

214
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:03,839
The third-party services you use may come on board with the new

215
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,375
System service

216
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:06,399
My point is

217
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:09,471
Don't trash all your smart speakers today if your on Google

218
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,007
You may want to wait and see what have

219
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,823
Indeed or all your smart devices

220
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,103
Better made by

221
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,639
So those are some

222
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:18,175
Lovely options out there

223
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,199
For you on the nest

224
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:21,247
Front let's talk about

225
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,527
Temperature

226
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,575
Google Assistant appearing on a new device

227
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:30,207
Oh yeah and with only waited I think 19 months for Sonos to get this integration

228
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:33,279
Hotel of elephants

229
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,303
So you know

230
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:37,375
Trixie I don't know I'll look that up after the show

231
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,399
But yes

232
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:42,239
It is available for me it became available earlier this week

233
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:45,055
When they announced that they said that software update would be required

234
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:47,615
And I got the software update I have a pair of

235
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:49,151
Are Sonos one speakers

236
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:50,943
Right here in my home office in fact

237
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:52,735
The setup

238
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,295
Typical of any

239
00:08:55,551 --> 00:09:00,415
Third-party hardware setup with Google Assistant can I get bounced around from the device

240
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:05,535
App to the Google assistant app back and forth and whatnot so I'm kind of used to it but I don't like it

241
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:09,375
But once you get that done it works perfectly fine I tested it

242
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:11,935
With a bunch of my Smart Home Products

243
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,983
Any other Google Assistant

244
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,519
Google home device in my house

245
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:19,103
There are a few limitations

246
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,895
Processor third party

247
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:21,919
Device

248
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,199
Namely

249
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:26,271
If you use the Google homes that you have

250
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:29,343
To make or receive calls well that's not going to work here

251
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,879
Additionally

252
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,415
There are fewer

253
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:35,487
Music services that Google Assistant works with

254
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,511
Compared to

255
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:39,071
Madame a and I say that because the Sonos

256
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,375
Speakers got madhumeh integration

257
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:42,655
A while ago

258
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,191
Well over a year ago

259
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:47,263
And there are more music Services you can't control their

260
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,311
So that's another limitation

261
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,103
But other than that

262
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,383
I'm pretty happy with it

263
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:55,711
I guess I'm wondering why I need a Google home hub in front of me

264
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:58,271
And Google Assistant power

265
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:00,575
Sonos devices next to me now

266
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:01,599
So

267
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,647
I'm not sure what I'm going to do

268
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,695
Kevin you're going to keep everything so you can

269
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:06,719
Contest all the news

270
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:07,487
Latest greatest

271
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:12,095
So I'm going to keep everything so I can test the latest and greatest

272
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,887
Yes

273
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:17,471
I see I want put the Google home hub here because I can say hey

274
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:21,055
G show my front door when somebody is at the front door

275
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:24,127
I can't do that with a Sonos speaker says they have no screen off

276
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:24,895
Play Soho

277
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:27,967
Yeah I guess I'll keep both right now the home hub is muted

278
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,759
And the speakers are

279
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:30,783
Not but

280
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:33,599
We'll see

281
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,415
I wait long time for unhappy with us

282
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,999
And I didn't realize this but

283
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:42,303
Play no doubt you can get this on the Sonos beam

284
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,071
As well

285
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,863
II was about

286
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,655
I'm looking at one of those because

287
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:49,727
As part of my boob I will lose my surround sound that was built

288
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:50,751
My house

289
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:54,079
I now need one of those things that hangs above

290
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:54,847
TV

291
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:57,407
S7 work with my digital assist

292
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:03,295
All right so we've talked about a lot of digital assistant news one little other thing

293
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:05,087
Amazon we can talk of this last week

294
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,903
Sunset and sunrise

295
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:08,927
Notifications

296
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,719
So now you can use

297
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,743
That is a

298
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,511
A trigger when they

299
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:13,535
Routine

300
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,303
And

301
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,863
Google smart displays and now get

302
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:17,631
Their own

303
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:18,655
Routine button

304
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,703
Which I don't know if you want to talk

305
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:24,543
I would love to because again I have the Google home

306
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,407
It's not that exciting literally if you swipe down

307
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:31,199
On a Google home

308
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:31,967
Smart

309
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:32,991
Display

310
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:36,319
Where it normally would have no hear cure lights

311
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,599
Lights media

312
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:39,647
Broadcast MSS cameras Etc

313
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:40,671
There's a new button

314
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,695
Access routines

315
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,231
And if I tap it

316
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:45,791
I can see the names of my routines

317
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,679
Basically it's a way to quietly run any routine

318
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,215
Excellent

319
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:53,983
Okay

320
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,519
Yay routine

321
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:58,335
I'm not looking forward to having to set all of us up

322
00:11:59,359 --> 00:11:59,871
But

323
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:02,175
It'll be a fun story a learning experience

324
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:06,271
Alright let's move away from the digital assistant world for just a little while

325
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,551
And talk about

326
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,343
The NB iot

327
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:11,647
SeaWorld last week we talked about

328
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,951
AT&T launching NB iot

329
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,231
Yay

330
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:18,047
Not to be outdone this week at iot world

331
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,327
Verizon announced

332
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,351
Their own

333
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,143
Nb-iot

334
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:25,471
Which puts the US now where Europe is

335
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:27,263
In the US the carriers

336
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,543
Sprint first with LTE

337
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,079
Cat 1M

338
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,615
Which has more bandwidth

339
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:34,175
But it isn't as battery efficient

340
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:37,503
Is it cost more so people were not thrilled

341
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:41,087
And now they're all like oh we made a mistake everybody wants nb-iot

342
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:45,183
So Verizon's network is now available over 92% of the US

343
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,207
Population

344
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,767
Control America

345
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,863
And NB iot just as a quick reminder is cellular

346
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,911
Very small data

347
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,191
Very tiny

348
00:12:57,215 --> 00:13:02,335
And Verizon standard and big price plan is going to be

349
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:04,383
$1 monthly access fee

350
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,663
Her device

351
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:08,223
Very different than AT&T

352
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:08,991
Which is like

353
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,551
Here's $5

354
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,319
Her device

355
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,111
So

356
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:16,415
Verizon were already looking at $12

357
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,183
Per year

358
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,207
And

359
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,487
AT&T didn't really talk

360
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,815
That also I should tell you it was a starting

361
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:26,911
Well I can look at the consumer side of things I'm like I'm not paying for it but

362
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:30,239
Obviously if you are a business that's rolling out thousands and thousands of

363
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:34,335
Cellular connected devices for sensors and such that's going to add up quick

364
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,359
Avesis

365
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:42,015
Yeah there's a consumer you might see this like you might buy at a smoke detector for example that has an NB iot sensor

366
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:46,367
Granite not really care about it'll configure automatically to the network when you download your a porter

367
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,135
Turn it on

368
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:49,951
And what it will do is if anything happen

369
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:52,511
Like smoke is detected will send a signal that

370
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:54,047
Will either text you or give you

371
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,327
A notification

372
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,119
And that sort of thing

373
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:59,935
Will probably just be built into the

374
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,215
What device is my

375
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:04,031
Probably I would agree to be honest

376
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:08,895
I think I would want to see that in certain centers as a backup system because if my home internet is out

377
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,687
Whenever I get the notification

378
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:16,319
Your security alarm may be a flood leak detector

379
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:21,695
In a smart city they're looking at using mbit for temperature sensors maybe for

380
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:24,255
Bridge maintenance type of sensors.

381
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,815
So

382
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,351
Parking meters

383
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:30,911
Is there a transaction oriented that's a batter

384
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:35,263
It could be like yes someone is parked here right now

385
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,031
But I don't

386
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,615
Actually sending

387
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:40,895
Yep make sense

388
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,431
So

389
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:45,247
That is the Verizon NB iot Network

390
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:47,295
AT&T he retired SeaWorld

391
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:49,087
Not to be outdone by Verizon

392
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,879
Launched a

393
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:52,671
$1000000 collaboration

394
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,951
With the city of San Jose

395
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:56,255
Really this is mostly technical

396
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:59,839
And San Jose saying sure you could play

397
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:02,399
Play on our Network for Smart City stuff

398
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:05,727
So what they're doing is they're adding smart lighting

399
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:12,127
Controllers and lights to 14 Parks across San Jose so this is go + 100 + 1

400
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,151
Wi-Fi extenders

401
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,431
Yay

402
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,455
And

403
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:19,295
What they called digital infrastructure notes that will help improve Public Safety

404
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:25,183
Digital infrastructure is AT&T schedule for a piece of Hardware that you install online

405
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,463
A Lamppost or something

406
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,231
Like that

407
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:29,279
And it's designed for

408
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,303
The Smart City

409
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:32,351
And people can use that data

410
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:33,631
Pull the data from it

411
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,679
Lovely apps

412
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:37,727
Muttley

413
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,031
Plus AT&T is going to give Sam

414
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:40,799
San Jose to

415
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:41,567
$2,000

416
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:43,103
I assume so they could

417
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:43,871
Use this as

418
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,151
Case study

419
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,175
Press release

420
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:47,455
So

421
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:49,759
Go San Jose get it get it

422
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,295
All right

423
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:54,367
We also have in City News San Francisco

424
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:55,647
Band

425
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:58,719
Facial recognition is the first city in the US to do so

426
00:15:59,231 --> 00:15:59,743
Ironic

427
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:00,767
Given the

428
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:03,583
A technical document of the people or maybe it's not ironic there's like

429
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,351
Yeah

430
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:07,935
The stuff is Daisy and or William as all get-out

431
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:08,703
So

432
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:11,007
Let's talk about this Kevin what has happened

433
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:14,591
Yeah so this is a new

434
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:17,407
He said a ban on facial recognition technology

435
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,711
But the devil's kind of in the details

436
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:21,247
Always hatin

437
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:22,783
Yeah yeah

438
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,319
When I first saw it on like

439
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,855
So nobody

440
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,647
Anywhere within the confines of

441
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:28,671
The city of

442
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:31,231
San Francisco will be able to use facial recognition

443
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,791
But that's not true it's the city itself

444
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:34,815
Basically if

445
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:37,375
City agencies would have to get approval to get

446
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:41,983
Surveillance devices in such an edit includes police body cameras license plate readers

447
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:42,751
Etc

448
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:45,311
They can continue use what they already have expenses

449
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,335
Sleeper new stuff

450
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:47,871
Private entities

451
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:48,895
Are not banned

452
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:49,919
Just to be clear

453
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,479
If you walking

454
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:53,759
Their private

455
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,807
Cuz they're private entities exactly

456
00:16:56,319 --> 00:17:00,415
If you're walking around the Streets of San Francisco going forward you know you shouldn't

457
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:01,695
After really worried

458
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:03,743
About facial recognition in use

459
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:07,583
Other than maybe again private entities that are monitoring

460
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:10,143
I just walking past their front doors and such

461
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:14,495
Retailers use it inside their stores

462
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,263
2

463
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,543
Check for shoplifters

464
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,591
They have an own database of shoplifters and

465
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,615
If you get in there yet

466
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,151
Escorted out

467
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,943
Even things like Amazon go

468
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:23,711
I

469
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,991
Actually do they use facial

470
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:25,759
Ignition node

471
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,087
They use the app on your

472
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:31,135
Right

473
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,159
Mission to know what you buy

474
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:34,975
I'm not on the shoplifters database output

475
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,255
In the casinos

476
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,023
A little sketchy

477
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:38,303
Anyway

478
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:42,143
Are you dating the blackjack tables I'm like tell me where Kevin

479
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:45,727
Okay

480
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:46,751
The main reason

481
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:50,591
For that is something we talked about before these facial recognition systems

482
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:52,895
Are pretty much heavily biased

483
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,687
Against people of color

484
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:57,247
They're not accurate and then that

485
00:17:57,503 --> 00:18:00,319
Has led to some very valid concerns about

486
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:04,159
Being I don't know people database for not doing anything just

487
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:04,927
Because

488
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:05,695
System

489
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:06,463
Can't detect

490
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:08,255
Your skin color properly

491
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:09,791
It's a it's a

492
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:10,815
Anyway

493
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,095
That's what's happening

494
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:14,399
I'm not against this I'll be honest

495
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:16,447
Alright let's move on to

496
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:23,103
So little bit of industrial news here we're going to talk about Lenovo they have introduced a new iot Gateway for the edge

497
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,383
Which combines menu

498
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:26,687
The hot exciting words that we talked about today at 8

499
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:28,223
Industrial iot

500
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:28,991
We got a

501
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:29,759
Wechat Gateway

502
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,039
We've got

503
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:34,111
We don't have a IR blaster

504
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,135
So

505
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:36,927
What is exciting about this

506
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,207
Anyting

507
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:39,487
Just new hardware

508
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:41,535
Hardware Ace

509
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:45,631
Kind of PC base I cannot with two small pc-based systems

510
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:48,959
Republic Bank Center Nano m90np

511
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:51,775
And also the M90 and iot

512
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,823
31

513
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:56,383
It's a small I guess I call it a brick

514
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,919
Runs on Intel processors

515
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:02,271
You can use Lenovo software on it or you can use Microsoft software on it if you'd like

516
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:06,879
I'm just basically more like an industrial Gateway

517
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:08,671
Know that whatever was getting into

518
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,975
Course that's where all the money is

519
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:16,863
Wasn't considering the price is going to list for $539

520
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,143
Damaged shipping

521
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:20,959
Equitation is August

522
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:25,311
Yes indeed in their time back into Microsoft's cloud

523
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,079
So

524
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:26,847
Diesel

525
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,639
Optimized for that nut

526
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:30,943
Two other things

527
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,735
But ye

528
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,527
Making the industrial iot

529
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,319
That's actually a huge theme

530
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,111
And we've been seeing

531
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,135
So yes I'm still sick

532
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,159
Iot world

533
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:45,279
We could have started approaching the Enterprise and Industrial iot with this perrytech Folk

534
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:51,167
Perspective which was like a jeweler will help you like to all the pieces together

535
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,471
And everyone was like we do not want that

536
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:57,055
We want you to build us a natural solution because we do not want a thing

537
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:57,823
Take that hard about

538
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,103
And so

539
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,127
That is

540
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:03,455
Happening you're still getting a more modular approach where you can buy a certain

541
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,223
Hardware in the

542
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:06,015
Match it to your cloud

543
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:10,111
But we are seeing lots of Si systems integrators at other company

544
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:10,879
He's coming in in

545
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:14,975
And basically hand-holding people through that process because it's still hard

546
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:19,071
And I don't think we're entirely there yet we're going to have some silos

547
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:22,143
Built up here in the next couple of years that will take

548
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:24,447
I don't know a few more years and more maturity

549
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,215
The breakdown

550
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:27,007
So that's where we are

551
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:30,335
Big picture that's the big Trend kind of thing I'm seeing here

552
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,103
And

553
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:33,151
Little bits of news that we forgot about

554
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:35,199
There's a rumor out there that ring

555
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:39,295
Has now finally been certified in a developer platform somewhere with

556
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:40,319
Apple homekit

557
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:43,135
This is something that's been promised since 2016

558
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,159
People that ring doorbells

559
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:45,183
Really want this to work

560
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:47,743
And I'm a little surprised by this

561
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,023
Really

562
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:51,071
Yes all I know was promised

563
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:54,399
But that was before Amazon bought ring

564
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,447
Yes but

565
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:59,519
They promised even after they bought it

566
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:04,895
That was one of the first questions we had in this actually all this ties into something that we didn't really talk about

567
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:06,175
We probably should have

568
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:09,503
Which is this idea that when you buy these products

569
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:13,599
You're not only buying a promise like Rings promise that it will one day work with homekit

570
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,159
What's the buy a promise that the device will stay

571
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,184
Functionally

572
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,208
The same

573
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:20,256
And that does not seem to be

574
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,280
Actually playing out

575
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:23,328
As we saw with the Google works with nest

576
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:25,376
As I saw actually

577
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:30,240
And everyone else all with the wise sensors and the changing of the privacy policy earlier

578
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:32,288
This month in preparation for the launch of it

579
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,824
Sense system

580
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:36,640
I wrote about this actually in the newsletter

581
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:38,176
This isn't a new topic

582
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,712
Because we

583
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,784
But it's this idea that all of your Hardware is now

584
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:45,344
I don't know how to feel about

585
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,392
Because there are clear advantage

586
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,720
Right and we've been through this with

587
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:51,744
The Kindle

588
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,352
Where you purchase a book on your Kindle you understand that you're buying basically

589
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:57,632
DRM protect

590
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:00,704
I could piece of work that may get pulled or changed and

591
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,496
Amazon will do the right thing

592
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:03,264
What you know

593
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,800
Give you money back and all that sort

594
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,360
But it's still not the same as owning

595
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,200
Write a book stores not going to come back to your house and take the book

596
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:16,064
Away from you that you purchase where is Amazon actually did do that at one point in time barrier Leon

597
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:20,416
I forget what what book it was on the Kindle the 1980s

598
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,464
That's how ironic

599
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:24,512
Help itching

600
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,816
Great example

601
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:29,120
Yes

602
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:30,656
Gold-plated I already there

603
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:32,448
Yes and so

604
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,216
I think

605
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:35,776
We have to get used to this with

606
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,056
Scented products

607
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:39,616
I think if we're going to buy them we have to recognize a

608
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:40,640
Set this is the new car

609
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:43,968
But I don't think we should just Advocate Oliver

610
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:46,528
So I think there should be some

611
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:48,320
Better Behavior

612
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,088
Around

613
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,624
If you're going to revoke us

614
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,904
Feature that is a

615
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:52,672
Definite

616
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:53,696
Downer

617
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:54,464
Customer

618
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,744
You should do it

619
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,768
A sugary treat

620
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:59,328
So not just a carrot mistake you should

621
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,352
You should give like

622
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,888
Ice cream sandwich

623
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:02,912
And

624
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:07,008
If you're going to revoke a future I think you need to offer something pretty substantial

625
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:10,080
I also think that if you're going to change

626
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:11,360
Change the privacy policy

627
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:13,920
I don't know Kevin is probably unrealistic that you

628
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:16,736
The challenge with the wise privacy policy

629
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:17,504
Sea change

630
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:21,600
You're like if you keep using this device you will agree to this change

631
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:26,208
If I had spent $600 on

632
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:27,744
Device

633
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:30,048
What am I going to do

634
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:33,120
I'm not going to throw away my $600

635
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:35,936
Right that's the thing I mean

636
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:38,752
Physical physical harder at that point

637
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,544
Yeah with these companies

638
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,848
Consider refunding your

639
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:45,664
Purchase pricing if you turn the product back in

640
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,432
They won't

641
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:50,016
I would love to see them do that because it would kind of force them to

642
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:51,552
Really hard

643
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:53,856
Evaluate if they're ever going to change.

644
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:57,440
Physical

645
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:00,000
Hardware return and refund policy

646
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:02,560
They're not likely going to

647
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:03,584
Change their price

648
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:06,400
Or they might

649
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,424
Because laws change

650
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:09,216
Acquisitions happen

651
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:12,288
They're actually very legitimate business reasons or

652
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,056
Legal reason

653
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:14,080
How to change your privacy

654
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:20,480
This is a good example it didn't fit the mini Marcus had a new product line with new features coming

655
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:22,528
And those features happen to work

656
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:23,296
The camera

657
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:24,320
So

658
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:27,136
I think transparency is the first thing

659
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:28,160
I think

660
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:30,976
Maybe it is a probation or maybe it is a coupe

661
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:33,536
So hard

662
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:36,608
If any of you guys have brilliant ideas send them to us this is

663
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:38,912
This is an area I'd like to explore a lot more

664
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:40,192
Because this isn't a problem

665
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:40,960
It's going to go away

666
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:42,240
And

667
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:44,032
We've probably only get worse to be honest

668
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,056
Yes

669
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:48,384
Thank you Kevin for that at dystopian

670
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,664
Cynical world view

671
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,200
Nevertheless.

672
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:53,248
All right my little

673
00:24:54,784 --> 00:25:00,416
Find a little bit of news for you the this is for people

674
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,208
Pacquiao

675
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,024
The Wi-Fi Alliance has now extended it

676
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,072
Wi-Fi certified Home Design program

677
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,120
For single-family

678
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:09,888
Homes

679
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:11,680
Multi-family units and

680
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:12,448
Apartments

681
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,288
So basically everybody living in an apartment kind of

682
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,336
Just don't wear the smart home the smart

683
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:20,640
Homes

684
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:21,920
For wild it had this program

685
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:23,456
It's a way to design

686
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,480
Wi-Fi

687
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:25,504
Part of the

688
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:30,112
This means it's going to have awesome coverage everywhere in the home

689
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,392
And

690
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,928
They've got all kinds of

691
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:33,696
Tools

692
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:38,048
Ways to make this happen and it's something that the homebuilder does or the apartment

693
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:43,168
So if you are moving into a place that has Wi-Fi certified home design

694
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:43,936
It means

695
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:45,472
You're going to get a network connectivity

696
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:46,752
Attic

697
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:47,520
Forever Young

698
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:53,408
This is very forward-looking at the Wi-Fi Alliance I don't think many of us care about it as much today but

699
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:55,456
I think it's great that they're building this in

700
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:56,992
And also

701
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,064
Huge props to them for building their standard into

702
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,088
Episcopal homes

703
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:01,856
Yeah

704
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:04,928
Lennar is headed

705

Which that's a big deal in our bills

708
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,400
Ginormous

And Pennsylvania

712
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,080
Yeah

713
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:24,640
And speaking of Wi-Fi

714
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:25,664
Kevin

715
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,456

753
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:43,232
Or more likely than normal

754
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:46,048
Plus we are planning on doing any questions only

755
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:47,840
Episode very soon so

756
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:49,376
Cinnamon because otherwise

757
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:51,168
It's going to be a very very short

758
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,496
Already that is 5 1/2

759
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:56,544
623-7424

760
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,104
And let's get to this week's question which is from

761
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:01,920
Istation

762
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:03,200
My name is Jeff

763
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:04,992
What's on the show

764
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:07,296
Quick question regarding

765
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:08,576
System

766
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:10,880
Purchase the Google Wi-Fi mesh

767
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:13,184
I like it the only question I have is

768
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:17,024
My other competitors make one

769
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:19,584
Buckmore Wi-Fi

770
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:21,120
My backyard

771
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:22,912
Is there a way to hook up an X

772
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,192
To it

773
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:26,496
If not you have a different solution that would be

774
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,568
Island Pacific Market shell in Ark

775
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:32,384
Okay Jeff

776
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:33,920
We have

777
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:34,688
An answer for you

778
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:35,712
Which is

779
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:37,504
Good thing

780
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,552
And a really pricey thing

781
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:42,880
So you were not

782
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:46,720
Google Wi-Fi does not make an outdoor extender

783
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:47,488
But

784
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:48,512
Netgear orbi

785
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:49,536
Does

786
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:52,608
And when did be cool Kevin if he could just like

787
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:59,264
Put that extender in there and it would use that cool Wi-Fi mesh technology we talked about a year ago that was a standard

788
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:05,408
Would be so cool if it used ezmatch but it doesn't so you can

789
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:06,176
Because

790
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:08,992
Without the ezmatch standard implemented

791
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:12,064
You can only stand a mesh network with the

792
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,344
Same brand

793
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,392
That you have today in your home

794
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:18,464
What a bummer which is why we said this is kind of

795
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,232
Sake

796
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,024
Inexpensive because

797
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:26,144
If you buy the Netgear orbi one which obviously will not work there wi-fi your Google Wi-Fi

798
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,728
Just the outdoor extender is $350

799
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:35,616
You also have to replace your tire in home Mesh networking system with orbi gear

800
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:38,688
And the router alone is $150 I think

801
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:40,224
I think it's 200

802
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:42,784
IS 250

803
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:46,880
Yeah so you're looking at like $600 just to extend

804
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:49,440
Tier outdoor so unfortunately

805
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:52,000
It's your money if you were my money and my

806
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:52,768
Use case

807
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:53,792
I don't use

808
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:55,584
Outdoor WiFi that much

809
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:57,376
And when I do

810
00:29:57,632 --> 00:30:01,728
I actually have a Google wifi unit close to the back of the house so

811
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:03,264
Niacinamide deck Outdoors

812
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,800
I get a decent signal

813
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:07,872
Do you have to go property or you don't have a

814
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:09,408
Access point near me

815
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,968
You're Outdoors we're going to use your Wi-Fi

816
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:12,992
Maybe this works

817
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:13,760
$600

818
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:18,368
That's that's not a primary use case for me is another way of saying that I would not

819
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,160
You may want to

820
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:25,024
Yeah it really depends on your setup if you're going to do the indoor to Outdoor Connection

821
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:27,328
You know setting it up near a window will help

822
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:31,168
Help your signal light stand a little bit in the home that you just sold

823
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,704
Stacy you had

824
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,728
Roof deck

825
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:38,848
I did and I had actually I put an Eero Beacon cuz I had a covered area in the room

826
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:44,736
But and here's the here's the caveat with that I had an Eero Beacon that I plugged in under there that would

827
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:45,760
Be protective for the weather

828
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:48,832
What day did not think about was that it is not protected

829
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:49,856
Sheet

830
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:50,624
Texas Sun

831
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,160
And we get up to 100

832
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,184
1200

833
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:54,208
10 Degrees apus

834
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:54,976
Cabinet

835
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:55,744
And

836
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,024
Tequipment couldn't handle

837
00:30:57,792 --> 00:31:00,864
So you don't just have to depend on where you live you don't just have to

838
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,168
To protect from the elements you have to protect from

839
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:05,216
Cold temperature extremes

840
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:06,496
So

841
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:07,520
Keep that in mind

842
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:11,616
The other thing I would say to you is I actually tried out the orbit gear

843
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:13,920
It is very powerful I have

844
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:16,224
Three of the traditional arrows in my house

845
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:17,504
And

846
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,784
One Beacon and that is

847
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,064
More than sufficient

848
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:26,208
But two of the Orbeez so the Domaine orbea then one satellite orbi

849
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:27,488
Covered my entire

850
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:29,536
So you may find

851
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:31,328
That the outdoor orbi

852
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,376
And1 indoor orbi

853
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:34,912
Works for you

854
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,752
So keep that in my you may not need like as many Google Wi-Fi

855
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,056
All right

856
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:41,824
Will Jeff

857
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:46,432
I hope that answers your question I ever curious if you have a $350 outdoor extender

858
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:47,456
Use case

859
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:49,504
You're like yes it is totally worth it

860
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:54,624
All right that is included

861
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:55,648

And

869
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:15,104
What is going to take to get insurance companies to help pay for our smart home devices in why we met

870
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:22,272
Hey everyone we are taking a quick break from The Internet of Things podcast for a message from Mars

871
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:26,112
Sponsor sponsor is Dell Technologies and I have

872
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:29,440
Mimi spear who is a VP of the edge

873
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:30,720

Y'all launched pulse.

875
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:35,584
Control center

876
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,120
2.

877
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:39,680
Can you tell us a little bit more about

878
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:40,704
The news

879
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:42,752
So we just announced

880
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:45,056
Call Coyote Center

881
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:47,872
Fast and now we have both gas and on-prem

882
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:55,040
Dissolution is those for the it organization and ot to have complete disability

883
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:00,416
Advices

884
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:01,440
Edge computing

885
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:02,720
Unconnected Center

886
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:09,120
This allows them to onboard their devices

887
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:14,496
And have security across the device the data the application and the network

888
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:18,848
Excellent so how does this fit into Dell Technologies and VMware

889
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:20,384
Iot and Edge

890
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:24,992
We are developing an entire digital Foundation

891
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:31,392
It is a natural extension to what we are doing across multi-cloud

892
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:34,976
Ignition system

893
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:36,256
Which are gateways

894
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:38,048
Vices and Spencer

895
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:44,448
And that's what profile tri-center fits in then we all last week

896
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:45,472
Which is really

897
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:50,336
Jennifer classic BMW

898
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:52,640
Closer to where the things reside

899
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:56,992
So that when you wanted you cuz she's learning and Ai and you want to have real

900
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:59,808
Decision making

901
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,112
Car or in a retail store

902
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:04,416
You now can do the processing at the edge

903
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:09,280
And this is a full-service provided by VMware with Dell Hardware

904
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,560
And we managed

905
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:15,424
So that you can have it for your followers and delete

906
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,192
Branches

907
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:22,592
What's Factory and then we got to manage the crazy

908
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:25,152
All of your different types of network protocols

How you connect your wide area network

911
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:32,320
Software-defined Network

912
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:33,344
So why should I

00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,624
Customer shoes

914

Reasons for cuts

918
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:43,328
The first is BR extending our digital Foundation

Guaranteed intrinsic security across their data

926
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:07,904

00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:58,080
And Gray Station thanks for having me

939
00:35:58,336 --> 00:36:02,944
Oh I am super excited for a couple reasons one we're going to talk a lot about intertek

940
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:07,040
So why insurance companies what they can do and get out of SmartThings

941
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:12,416
But two were also going to get an update on spin which is company I've been following for a while

942
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:14,208
Why don't you start

943
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:15,744
By telling us

944
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,072
A little bit about thin what it is what has just happened

945
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:24,192
Truciciel we have an intelligent water monitoring device

946
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:25,216
So what that is

947
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:27,776
The sensor that attaches to the main water line

948
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:34,432
And it measures three different things that measures the temperature at the point of installation measures how much flow is going through the

949
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:35,968
How much water using

950
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:37,504
I mean also measure pressure

951
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:43,904
Which will get into a little bit later on but what that allows it to do is to be able to understand how much water you're using

952
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:44,672
How your use

953
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:47,744
Senior water and if there's any leaks or anything that normal

954
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:53,376
So meaning when you we can tell you when you take a shower how long your shower is how much water

955
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,680
And we can tell you the difference between

956
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:56,448
A shower

957
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:58,240
A toilet a week

958
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:01,312
And we have the ability to turn off your water a remotely

959
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:05,152
You're on vacation and you get a call and it says Waters come

960
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,432
Feeling I don't know what

961
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:08,736
You do what you can just pull out your phone press a button

962
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:10,016
Turn the water off

963
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:11,552
Are you can automatically have

964
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:13,344
Turn the water off for you

965
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,112
Awesome

966
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:16,416
Yes it's going to be exciting music

967
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:17,696
We had it

968
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:18,976
The last we spoke

969
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:21,792
What's the 4 CS of last year the company

970
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:23,072
Stop a sound in 20

971
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:25,632
With over 10 years of

972
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:26,656
History and research

973
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:27,936
That started back

974
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:29,216
In 2009

975
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:30,240
The University of

976
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:32,288
3 commercially founded the company

977
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:35,104
2016 started selling a product in April

978
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:38,176
2018 and then last week

979
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:40,480
Anuel funding of $12

980
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:42,272
37

981
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:45,344
Awesome and what are you guys going to do

982
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,624
Latest round of

983
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:51,744
Two parties for Global expansion so we have Pilots running a multiple continents

984
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,024
This is really exciting

985
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,584
And then also on the product development and

986
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,376
Enhancement and in growing the team

987
00:37:57,632 --> 00:38:02,752
Great so let's get into this idea of the smart home and how a device like this fits into

988
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:06,848
And you actually come from the insurance world you were at Farmers Insurance correct

989
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,384
That's right I was there for

990
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:10,688
Show all different parts

991
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:14,272
From forecasting the chief of staff to last week I was head of innovation

992
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:15,552
So connected home

993
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:16,832
Is very important

994
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:18,624
Send it

995
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:20,928
Industry-first living insurance

996
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:23,232
Related to the Harlem exit Smart Home

997
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:24,256
Waterlox

998
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:25,280
Severely import

999
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,304
Aspect

1000
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:28,352
The second most frequent claim that is

1001
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:30,400
Is files and over 10 billion of

1002
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:35,008
Cleans annually and so understanding water loss and having be able to

1003
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:39,104
To prevent it was really important and then looking at the car companies I was really impressed with

1004
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,408
Send when they were first in beta stage

1005
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,456
I meant rather progressions

1006
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:46,272
Constantly stayed in touch with them and and was very

1007
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:49,088
Continue to be impressed and I joined them last year

1008
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,392
Awesome and I can tell you as a as a

1009
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:52,160
Customer

1010
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:58,816
I was with farmers and I believe you guys processed at least two water claims from miso

1011
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,168
What happens it happens it's kind of crazy

1012
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:07,008
It's at 2% of all homeowners so when out of 50 will have a water

1013
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:07,776
Steam every year

1014
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:10,592
And so when you start to look at that with the average cost

1015
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,384
$9,600

1016
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:16,992
Repair that home and then also average time out of that home 90 days

1017
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:20,832
You really want to limit not only from a loft bed for a month

1018
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:25,184
Perspective but also in the homeowner side and having to deal with contractors and

1019
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,024
Special mold issues is an interesting out of your home we can prevent that

1020
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,096
That's an amazing thing and that's before

1021
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:34,912
So let's talk about this cuz the phone device

1022
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:36,960
It's 699 which is in

1023
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:40,800
Insanely expensive thinking about how much a water Insurance claim cost

1024
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,080
What is also

1025
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:44,384
Pretty expensive when you think that most

1026
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,432
American households can't handle

1027
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:47,968
Unexpected expensive forehead

1028
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:49,760
This is a lot of money

1029
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:51,040
And so

1030
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:53,600
When we look at buying something like this

1031
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:54,368
Do you think

1032
00:39:54,624 --> 00:40:00,768
It's going to be the end consumer who puts this on their home or you trying to get insurance companies to pay for part of the

1033
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:03,328
How do we get this in people's homes

1034
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:07,424
Yeah great question I think it's a mix of all I think that

1035
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:12,800
When you first start you'll have first movers which will be those that really want the tech gadgets and really

1036
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:15,360
To be on The Cutting Edge and bleeding

1037
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:21,760
In technology and that's what we're seeing also from an insurance perspective it absolutely mitigates losses

1038
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:24,320
Progressive carriers it is something

1039
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:25,856
I bet they're looking at

1040
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:29,952
I think that it comes into the cost and the amount of profit that in

1041
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:34,816
Miniature house on a homeowner policy and then also there are some legal ramifications

1042
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:41,216
Rebating and indifferent things that make it a bit more challenging but from certainly from a lost perspective having

1043
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:43,520
These types of devices installed in the home

1044
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:45,568
Is a material at dating

1045
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:46,592
For the insurance

1046
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:50,432
So what that translates to is having the consumer who buys it

1047
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:51,456
Not only

1048
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:56,576
Installing it but also earning discounts on their insurance so most carriers will offer between

1049
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:57,344
5 + 10

1050
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,416
Percent off of their insurance premium for having one of these devices

1051
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:05,024
Stop doing that in the near-term I think that you'll see more of the discounts happening

1052
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,048
And then Isaac

1053
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:07,072
Continues to Progressive

1054
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:09,120
Become more normal then you're gonna

1055
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:11,936
Start to see it embedded in new bills and

1056
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:13,984
Construction and then also retrofit

1057
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:21,664
And in like new bills and constructions is that going to be something that the builders do as a competitive advantage

1058
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,944
Is that going to be something that

1059
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,016
Insurors I can be like yeah we need this in this neighborhood

1060
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:27,552
How does that start to happen

1061
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:31,904
But I think it'll start with Builders I mix of Builders and utilities

1062
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,488
So when we when the company was founded it looked at

1063
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:41,632
3 million macro-trends that were happening one being increasing population the other being changes in

1064
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:42,400
Inclimate

1065
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:43,680
And water being a dick

1066
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:50,080
Feeding resource in the third being aging infrastructure both at the municipality level and then also at the house

1067
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:50,848
Home level

1068
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:53,151
And so as we start to see water

1069
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:57,503
Continue to be stressed over the years I think it's going to become more and more important

1070
00:41:57,759 --> 00:42:01,087
To be able to limit that will rather understand water used

1071
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:02,623
And prevent leaks from happening

1072
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:03,903
And so

1073
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:05,951
As we think about it that happen

1074
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:12,351
Search for Builders and increasing what is really a smart home and how do you provide benefits back to the customer

1075
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:15,167
Lowe's on the experience and also on the cost-saving side

1076
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:17,727
What's switch back to the insurance world

1077
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:19,775
Because there is so much there

1078
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:20,543
And

1079
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:24,895
Honestly I'm a little disappointed I thought I'd be seeing a lot more

1080
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:26,687
Insurance participation

1081
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:29,247
On the water leakage side on the security side

1082
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:33,855
You like a basically get a 5 to 10% discount

1083
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:34,623
On

1084
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:36,927
One option so if I have a

1085
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:38,207
Ismartalarm system

1086
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:39,743
Attic fan really doesn't help me

1087
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:41,023
Because I don't get an additional

1088
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:41,791
Discount

1089
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:43,839
And I don't see much

1090
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:46,143
You know other than a few co-marketing agreement

1091
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:48,703
I don't see much from the insurance forms

1092
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:49,983
Pushing this so I'm

1093
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:51,519
I'm really curious like

1094
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:53,311
Why this hasn't gone

1095
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:54,847
Farther faster

1096
00:42:56,383 --> 00:43:01,247
Yeah I mean I think that's from an insurance perspective there are a couple of things that make it a little bit more challenging

1097
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:03,039
Or just rather areas by

1098
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:04,319
Need to be looked at

1099
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:05,599
And Revisited

1100
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:08,671
How something like this can be embedded into a carrier

1101
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:09,695
When is the car

1102
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:10,719
The Coffee Bean

1103
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:12,255
Several hundred dollars that can be

1104
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:14,815
You challenging Furniture because inter-process

1105
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:16,607
Other percentages are not

1106
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:19,679
What you would think of a normal technology company you know it's

1107
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:20,447
It sucks

1108
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:22,239
Percent is so in some years

1109
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:23,775
It can be very very thin

1110
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:27,359
And so when you're looking at an average policy of $1,000

1111
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:28,895
Any device has several hundred

1112
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:29,919
The cost

1113
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:33,247
Justification doesn't make sense to make sense over 10 years

1114
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:35,295
But those carriers are not sure how long this

1115
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:37,087
Consumers are going to stay in the retention

1116
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:38,111
Which one aspect

1117
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:39,903
The second is that

1118
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,439
There's also rebating laws

1119
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:48,095
Which limit how much an insurer can provide to a customer for free so that they giving them a device

1120
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:51,935
Because in many states that maximum is up to $25 per year

1121
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:54,239
So that's a bit very small

1122
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:57,567
The minimum amount and thirdly it sounded deicide

1123
00:43:57,823 --> 00:44:00,383
ISO general insurers of risk-averse company

1124
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:02,175
And they want to validate

1125
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:03,199
That an increase

1126
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:04,991
Discount is warranted

1127
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:09,087
And how they would do that is on average they look for a thousand coins

1128
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:12,927
But if you think about that a new technology

1129
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:13,951
It's going to take decades

1130
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:15,231
To be able to validate

1131
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:19,839
ISO a progressive carrier it's going to be one that is going to look at the indication

1132
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:23,167
Who sang if I can turn the water off in someone's house

1133
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:24,959
What's when an incident happens

1134
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:25,983
Before that happened

1135
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:31,359
That's going to be materials bathing that's going to be 75 90% reduction in the water lost cause

1136
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,407
And so that's where

1137
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:36,991
You know we're working with great partners and in doing

1138
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:38,527
In discussions of

1139
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:39,807
Of how we can

1140
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:43,135
Strengthen what the carrier could do from A Loss Prevention side

1141
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:49,535
That makes sense now what about some of the legal implications or the liability implications

1142
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:52,095
Associated with like remotely turning off the water

1143
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:53,631
Or maybe it's

1144
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:54,655
Remotely

1145
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:57,983
Doing something else based on a smart device in the

1146
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:01,055
And I'm trying to come up with a really awesome

1147
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:03,871
Example and I'm really having a hard time but

1148
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:10,271
Like maybe there's a fire in the hole man someone's trying to like cool things down by turning on all the shower heads

1149
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:12,831
And fins like there's a leak

1150
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:14,879
And turns off the water that could be a problem

1151
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:16,415
I know this is a really random

1152
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:17,439
But

1153
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:18,975
Sure that insurance

1154
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:19,743
Companies are thick

1155
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:20,511
Talking about

1156
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:21,279
Liability

1157
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:22,559
Remotely control

1158
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:23,839
Things in people's homes

1159
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:25,631
We haven't gotten concerns

1160
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:26,911
From from that aspect

1161
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:27,935
Find the carrier from the

1162
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:28,703
Consumer yes

1163
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:30,495
Concern on

1164
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:34,591
Am I going to be in the shower and you know his grandma going to be in the shower and the water's going

1165
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:36,639
Turn off I don't want the device to do that

1166
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:38,943
And that's where it gets to be for fan

1167
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:41,503
Two key principles that they fight for us in

1168
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:43,807
Chords to what we do is one is that the

1169
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:44,575
The hardware

1170
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:45,855
The solid Construction

1171
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:51,999
Is it something that it's not just your main water line so we want something that's very durable and is maintenance-free for the?

1172
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:57,119
And into is on a dating site so really important to be able to understand the difference between

1173
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:58,143
A shower

1174
00:45:58,399 --> 00:45:59,935
A regular shower and a leak

1175
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:01,471
A pipe is burst

1176
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:03,007
And so then I tried technology

1177
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:06,335
Play where we are not only just measuring flow switch

1178
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:08,127
Next one meter

1179
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:09,663
But we also measure

1180
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:10,431
Pressure

1181
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:12,735
And so every device but every picture that you

1182
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:15,039
Having your house as a different signature

1183
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:18,111
If you can imagine when a toilet flapper goes up and it goes down

1184
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:18,879
Steph Curry

1185
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:19,647
A wave

1186
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:21,695
Pattern in your water in your pipe

1187
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:23,231
And I can tell us the difference

1188
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:24,511
Search between a toilet

1189
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:26,047
Extinct a faucet

1190
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:26,815
Analy

1191
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:28,095
And so

1192
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:30,143
Always we put this in the hands of the

1193
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:35,263
Consumer where we don't automatically fin would never automatically turn off your system your home

1194
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:37,567
This is not something that you have passed

1195
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:38,335
To you

1196
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:41,407
Auto shut-off capabilities enabled by the homeowner

1197
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:44,223
And then also when there is an alert

1198
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:45,759
The consumer does receive

1199
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:47,551
Is a text message and a push notification

1200
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:49,855
Navigation before the water is shut off as well

1201
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:52,671
And then once the water shut off there's also notification

1202
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:54,975
We are very respectful of what

1203
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:56,255
Customer wants to do

1204
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:59,583
And also in informing them of what has happened

1205
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:02,143
And what they may want to do as an extra

1206
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:03,935
Got it

1207
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:04,703
Okay

1208
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:08,799
Let's talk about the insurance landscape from the perspective of

1209
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:11,871
Data and new entrants into the market

1210
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:14,431
Because when I see those Accenture Deloitte

1211
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:15,455
Intertek

1212
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:20,063
Reports that constantly harping on the fact that Google or Amazon

1213
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:22,111
Come in with their smart home data

1214
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:24,671
And basically offer competitive products

1215
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:27,743
And I'm very curious from someone at a startup

1216
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:30,559
And from someone who's worked in the insurance business

1217
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:35,935
How do you view this idea of the big tech companies using all the data that they have to come into this Ma

1218
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:38,239
I think there's a real advantage

1219
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:45,663
It's two things one is that the insurance industry in and of itself is not a high-margin business so that's one of the challenges

1220
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:47,967
Weather attack on

1221
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:48,991
When you want to

1222
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:51,039
Go into it themselves or not

1223
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:51,807
To be crushed

1224
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:54,111
Is there room for disruption absolute

1225
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:57,439
And that's what you're seeing with new startups where they're just really

1226
00:47:57,695 --> 00:47:58,463
Changing the process

1227
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:02,047
Instead of having something a policy being written taking

1228
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:08,447
You you're signing up for a policy and in a legacy some that might take 30 minutes a new startup is doing that in 3 minutes

1229
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:09,215
5 minutes

1230
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:14,079
How are they doing that they're taking advantage of a lot of data that exist and they're also using

1231
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:20,479
Other data sources to be able to validate what that loss ratio is if we just think about it

1232
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:25,599
That is going to spend 699 on a water detection on a water shut-off device is offend

1233
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:28,671
I'm installing it in the house is a customer that on

1234
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:29,951
Their first blush

1235
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:36,607
There a customer that cares about their house they don't want to have damaged their more engage this is an indicator of a better policy

1236
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:39,167
Older than your average book of business

1237
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:44,287
And so these kinds of things are indicators for what a carrier could look at in the

1238
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:47,103
Future and certainly by having the data

1239
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:49,663
A purchasing behavior of understanding

1240
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:55,295
Alerts of understanding what types of devices they have changes the risk profile potentially

1241
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:58,623
And so I think that's a company that has the most data will win

1242
00:48:58,879 --> 00:49:00,671
The company that knows how to use that data

1243
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:01,695
Will be the winner

1244
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:06,815
And what about our current legislation around privacy and data use

1245
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:12,447
People are very concerned about how insurers may take their data and charge them more

1246
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:14,239
Or less based on new facts

1247
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:15,519
Basically

1248
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:17,055
Honestly that's what insurance

1249
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:18,079
What's is its

1250
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:20,127
If you would behave in a risky manner

1251
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:20,895
You should

1252
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:21,919
Pay extra for it

1253
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:23,455
But people are like

1254
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:26,015
I used to know how insurance Price there in

1255
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:29,087
Prince now I'm like oh they have so many more options

1256
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:33,183
I guess how do you think about that and how that may change the relationship

1257
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:34,975
Laws that are out there

1258
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:36,511
Ice cream bed

1259
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:38,303
Data absolutely

1260
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:40,863
Is very important than privacy is data

1261
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:45,471
Are we take very seriously it's been a couple of things important

1262
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:49,311
Carrier one is that the data needs to be accurate and consistent

1263
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:50,335
Across the devices

1264
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:51,615
So that's where the

1265
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:52,383
Hardware

1266
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:58,271
Discussion becomes important because the accuracy between one device and another device should be very similar

1267
00:49:58,527 --> 00:50:02,111
So that you understand that your data set is producing the right kind of data

1268
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:02,879
Inside

1269
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:04,671
To be able to Warrant a result

1270
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:06,719
So once you get those thousand

1271
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:07,487
Clean

1272
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:09,791
Then I can use that from an Actuarial perspective

1273
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:13,119
So let's work they want to start using that data

1274
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:19,519
Potentially and also to be able to understand okay how much of a loss difference is there if someone has one of these.

1275
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:21,567
Spices do they ever file a claim

1276
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:23,359
Do they file other claims

1277
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:27,967
Is water an indication of the riskiness of that household other inside statue

1278
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:28,735
Wicked Game

1279
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:32,319
No you'd have to insure has to get that data from a cut

1280
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:35,135
And it can only get that with consent for the cusp

1281
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:39,487
And so in order to get consent from the customer the customer has to

1282
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:41,279
See the value that they Co

1283
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:42,815
Is worthwhile

1284
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:48,703
For the data that they're giving out they might they will who's ever going to do that though it's similar to when you first started seeing telematics

1285
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:55,103
So this is when and Progressive was the first to do this to their program stop shop where you put a little OBD device it's been on

1286
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:57,407
Onboard diagnostic device

1287
00:50:57,663 --> 00:50:59,199
Provided Data Insights on how the

1288
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:01,247
And they received it this

1289
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:06,367
Count in any industry moved into that we're now most carriers have some sort of telematics program

1290
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:09,183
And what they do is they will offer a discount

1291
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:15,583
And it is based on sharing the data so what you could see is that in the future now you're just receiving a blind

1292
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:20,703
Discount on having one of these devices but in the future could be that you would receive a tiered discount

1293
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:21,983
Perhaps higher

1294
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:23,007
Significantly higher

1295
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:24,543
By providing that data

1296
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:26,591
And so for some consumers then that's

1297
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:29,663
Going to be the triggers what they'll say you know what I'm I'm a good rest

1298
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:31,199
And I should not be paying

1299
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:31,967
This much

1300
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:35,039
Premium because I'm off setting someone who's a bad risk

1301
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:40,671
And I'm a good rest so then I want the discount and I'm okay to share that data and I think that's where you're going to start

1302
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:41,695
To see that s***

1303
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:44,255
We're consumers are going to be okay with sharing

1304
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:45,535
Yeah I can see it

1305
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:48,607
You know it might be really interesting if I purchased a fin

1306
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:51,423
And if I could say to myself

1307
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:57,823
Well I own this data and now I can offer that data through any sort of API ports to my

1308
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:59,615
Insurance Company

1309
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:01,663
And they will provide me possibly it

1310
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:07,039
Tell her they will be like yes we will fight for your business I would love to see them did for my business based on my

1311
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:08,575
My device data from

1312
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:10,367
Is that crazy

1313
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:11,903
No I think that's

1314
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:12,927
Exactly where it needs

1315
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:16,255
To go I think that you're you're the perfect example you have

1316
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:17,279
You have so many

1317
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:18,815
Devices but you're very connect

1318
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:20,607
Is your ear connected to your home

1319
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:22,655
Tuesday that's coming into your home

1320
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:27,263
Which means that you are much much better risk for loss is not to happen in Euro

1321
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:28,799
Because you're so connect

1322
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:34,431
And because of that and because you've invested in your home and you put these devices in and you're monitoring them

1323
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:35,711
Because you're a better risk

1324
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:37,247
You should learn better this

1325
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:40,575
Until I seen that what you're going to start to see carriers

1326
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:42,879
So what's going to happen

1327
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:46,719
And when you look at some carriers were there 50% Auto V

1328
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:47,487
80% home

1329
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:49,535
And you look way down the road

1330
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:51,839
Shorter some say longer

1331
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:53,631
Whenever it is it will happen

1332
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:54,911
When it's on his cars

1333
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:55,679
Come into play

1334
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:57,215
The personalized

1335
00:52:57,471 --> 00:53:00,031
Auto premium as it is today goes away

1336
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:05,919
That becomes a commercial policy the risk profile changes because now it's more product liability

1337
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:08,735
So that premium has to be replaced with something

1338
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:10,271
What is that something

1339
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:15,647
You know that the home that's going to continue to be there and you're going to continue to have these smart devices

1340
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:16,671
And more and more data

1341
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:17,439
Soap

1342
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:18,975
Where Progressive carriers

1343
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:19,743
Are looking

1344
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:22,303
Is to be not only there when

1345
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:25,375
Claim happened and be there at the back end

1346
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:26,655
To repair the home

1347
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:29,471
But they're looking at how did they come in in the front end

1348
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:31,007
Mdproactive

1349
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:31,775
And health Act

1350
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:34,079
Consumer before that clean even happen

1351
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:37,663
And create a halo effect in just shifting but dynamic

1352
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:39,711
A between an insurer and a consumer

1353
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:42,015
Awesome I will look forward to that day

1354
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:48,671
I think it's coming I think that there are some carriers that are really looking at it I think also the challenge with some Legacy

1355
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:55,071
Companies is that they have very large books of business so in order to put one of these devices and then every one of those days

1356
00:53:55,327 --> 00:53:55,839
Nursing home

1357
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:57,631
Is a massive Capital dream

1358
00:53:57,887 --> 00:54:02,495
And so some of the startups they have a real Advantage by being able to

1359
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:05,567
Implement this new technology as their book Rose

1360
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:07,615
Because the benefits are not

1361
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:12,223
Not necessarily in your 1-year to it's in your 3 for pain

1362
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:15,295
And so that's where you start to really see the benefits ended

1363
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:19,647
Going to be a material Improvement for the book of business and their loss ratios for sure

1364
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:23,231
Excellent all right we'll Muriel I feel smarter both about

1365
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:25,279
What's going on with Finn and

1366
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:29,631
How I might get to a better Insurance World thanks to all of my smart room Gadget
