Chauffeur

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:23,552
Today

7
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:25,600
Astonishing because we're going to talk about

8
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:26,624
Amazon

9
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:29,440
Finally answering some questions about

10
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:30,976
What it does with your

11
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:32,000
Voice

12
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:33,024
Data

13
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:36,608
Plus we are going to be talking about another smart home platform

14
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:37,376
Data leak

15
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:38,400
We got

16
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:42,496
D-Link settlement with the FTC over at security failures

17
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:44,032
We've got a hat

18
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:45,056
Smart Home

19
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:46,592
It might be

20
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,664
Put in lots of apartment buildings around the country

21
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:54,272
We got some news about hpe and its plan to

22
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,344
Continue its own digital transformation

23
00:00:58,112 --> 00:00:59,904
Kevin tried out some new software

24
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,184
Could replace if

25
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,208
Or could it

26
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:05,280
And we got lots of little updates on

27
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:08,608
Products and stuff you probably use

28
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:09,632
Plus

29
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:10,656
We have

30
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:15,008
Andy Lowery the CEO of real whereas Our Guest on the show this week

31
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,800
Realwear just raised

32
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:18,336
80 million dollars

33
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:22,688
I will talk to him about using heads-up displays in industrial settings

34
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:24,480
Why

35
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:26,016
That's taking so long

36
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:32,416
So we're going to talk about this plus hear from our sponsor Dell Technologies

37
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:33,952
But before we get to that

38
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,768
Let's hear from another one of our sponsors

39
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:39,328
This week sponsor is a pharaoh

40
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,656
Are you doing multiple iot projects that work

41
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:49,056
Well together is there a single app that strengthens your brand this is really tough stuff and it requires

42
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:55,456
The right platform but with a pharaoh Kenmore launch 42 smart Appliance models in just two years

43
00:01:55,712 --> 00:02:01,856
Anna Farrell customers realized as much as an 80% reduction in time to Market

44
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:08,256
99% pure support calls and 10x higher activation rates plus they can reuse

45
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:12,608
Is 90% of their work from one project to the next so

46
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:16,960
If you're looking to do multiple iot projects or just one pic of pharaoh

47
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:23,360
Just like Kenmore Mitsubishi ufj group and dealing did and you can beat your carpet

48
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:28,480
Addition with a solution that your team loves to build on and your customers love to use

49
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:32,320
Learn more at a pharaoh. IO

50
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:35,392
Okay Kevin

51
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:39,232
Big news on the Privacy front this week

52
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:42,560
We've called privacy friend are we just call it the Madame de France

53
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:46,400
Email specific to matamata but it is

54
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,680
Privacy so

55
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:54,592
Here's the deal cuz there's a lot happening here and there's a lot of concern and I would say these are legitimate

56
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:55,360
Questions

57
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,384
So what has happened

58
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,152
It is

59
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,992
Journalist discovered a while back that the Amazon Echo

60
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:03,296
A couple things when we all

61
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,320
No

62
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:06,624
Listings for Wake word and then when it hears that way

63
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,160
Wake word it records

64
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,440
What you say

65
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,232
So it can actually

66
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,608
Complete the command and Amazon keeps the transcript and the actual utterance

67
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,400
A couple weeks back what

68
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,936
People discovered is that

69
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:22,240
There were call centers of people who

70
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:25,568
Took the actual utterances and annotated them

71
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:27,104
Check them against Amazon

72
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:27,872
Actions

73
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:30,176
And I did that because that's its quality

74
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,200
Basically

75
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,248
But people were kind of up in arms

76
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,552
In general

77
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:38,880
People are very concerned about having a microphone

78
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,416
Their house and I guess

79
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:42,720
That's kind of how we got to hear so

80
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:45,280
Delaware senator

81
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,072
Sent a letter to Amazon

82
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:47,840
On asking

83
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:52,448
About how long it kept voice recording what to do with transcripts and all of the

84
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:54,240
Data it gets used to

85
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:55,264
So

86
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,544
That's okay right

87
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,592
So the Senators like hey

88
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:00,384
We need more information

89
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,432
And this week Amazon Center

90
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,480
Some people are really

91
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:07,040
Tweaker taking kind of the wrong message

92
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,392
Amazon basically says

93
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,440
Did they're going to retain

94
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:16,000
Customers voice recordings and transcripts

95
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,536
Until you choose to delete them

96
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,839
If you delete

97
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:23,935
It's going to make every effort to delete the voice recordings

98
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:26,495
And the transcripts themselves

99
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,311
But

100
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,359
Metadata

101
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:33,663
What was learned from

102
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:37,503
Voice recording some such as particular actions or skills

103
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,855
That information is not really scrub ignores any information

104
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:44,671
That is so cute

105
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:45,695
Exactly

106
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:48,255
And nor is any sort of

107
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:51,327
If you have a recurring thing or there's transactions associated

108
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,399
Stick around

109
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,167
Because it

110
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,447
Peter has to have something

111
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:01,567
If you tell it to set your alarm at such-and-such time everyday it can't

112
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,103
Remove the data

113
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:05,407
Because would not know when

114
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,431
Tomorrow 2

115
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:09,503
So there a couple things

116
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:10,783
It is really in

117
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,063
In

118
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:12,831
I think

119
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:15,647
We should stop having the same conversation about

120
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:18,975
Privacy in these homes like as a binary thing

121
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,023
It's either there or it isn't there

122
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:24,607
I think we should start having more conducive conversations about

123
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:28,191
How did make sure this data if people are going to use it

124
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,983
Stays out of the hams

125
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:30,751
People

126
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:31,775
And is used for

127
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:36,639
Sound or is not tied individual

128
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:37,663
So

129
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:38,687
That's that's

130
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:41,503
So I think there's a couple things that you

131
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,271
Amazon

132
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,575
And Google actually already does

133
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:45,855
So

134
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:52,255
The Senators asked if Amazon takes any measure to anonymizer Identity and other information in relation to

135
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,279
Transcripts

136
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,327
And the answer appears to

137
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,167
Yeah

138
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:01,983
It partly because some of this means to be associated

139
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,263
You know if

140
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:06,079
If I'm telling Amazon to do something on my account

141
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,615
It makes sense that

142
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:08,895
It has to be associated

143
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:11,711
Because I'm buying something from Whole Foods

144
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:13,503
Amazon needs to know where to send it in

145
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,295
That's so that's never going to be

146
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:18,879
Google for example takes utterances

147
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:23,487
The actual voice commands and they run their vocal distortion

148
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:24,767
Through it so

149
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:27,071
They still get the benefit

150
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,607
Having the ability to like

151
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,887
Check their work

152
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:30,655
As it were

153
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:31,423
Are there AI

154
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,983
They can do annotations on

155
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,007
Peoples voices

156
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:35,775
They can make sure that

157
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,823
Command actually

158
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,359
Did what it was supposed to do

159
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:41,919
They can do all of that without actually knowing

160
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,199
You are meeting

161
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:46,015
And I'm glad you brought that up because if anybody

162
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:49,087
Hasn't already done if you can go into 2

163
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,903
And listen to go through the history and listen to

164
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:54,207
What matinee actually her

165
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,999
You will hear your own voice obviously

166
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,303
There is a

167
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:02,911
A mechanism to report to the matinee do what you requested or did she not

168
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,959
Sao innocence you can help

169
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:06,495
Train mad about yourself

170
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:09,311
And you wouldn't be able to do that obviously without

171
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,335
Having that

172
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:12,127
Transcription history available

173
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:13,663
Exactly

174
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,455
So I think first off

175
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:18,015
To anonymize people's voices problem

176
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:19,807
Privacy protection

177
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:24,415
The other thing I would say is some of these recurring commands

178
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,975
They could probably live locally on the

179
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:27,743
Edifice

180
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,023
And

181
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,047
I imagined

182
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:32,607
Google I mean Google is working very hard

183
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:33,887
Hartford local control

184
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:35,679
And

185
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,727
Being able to say

186
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:38,495
Hey

187
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:40,287
Keep my recurring alarm

188
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,055
Here

189
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:43,103
That's great

190
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:45,919
Take rate you get if you get the benefit of having

191
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:46,687
Some of that

192
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:47,967
Madame a features

193
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:49,759
Without worrying that you know

194
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,039
Everybody knows

195
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,575
5 in the morning

196
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:54,111
Or whatever time you wake up

197
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:56,927
That's another thing that I think would be

198
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:01,535
Very proactive and then the other thing is with skills

199
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:06,911
I think wouldn't download a skill you should see what data they're trying to get

200
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:08,191
Were able to get

201
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,239
From a transaction

202
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,031
And

203
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:18,175
You should be able to read their privacy policies and hopefully there are easy to understand and not like

204
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,967
16 pages of legalese

205
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:21,759
Those are just some thoughts that I think

206
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,039
I think we need to move

207
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,575
Forward from

208
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,879
This is Carrie there's a microphone in my house

209
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:29,183
Hey if there's a microphone in my house

210
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,487
What are the steps the concrete steps

211
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:32,767
That should be taken

212
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,327
And maybe should be should be regulated

213
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,375
Will protect

214
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:40,703
Glitter

215
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,359
There's a lot of cars here which I think

216
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:50,175
I think we had all the high points in the important things

217
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,967
I still have an open question

218
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:53,247
In that

219
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:58,111
Unresponsive says we design Echo devices at matamata to use on device

220
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:01,439
Keywordspy technology

221
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:04,255
To detect when a customer intends to interact with

222
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,279
Anime

223
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,303
And

224
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:10,655
It's interesting that they didn't say hotword or something to that effect

225
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,935
Is there anything

226
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,983
Other than the Wake word

227
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,007
Part of that guy

228
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,287
Keyword spotting

229
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,591
That's a question I would ask as a follow-up

230
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:23,711
That is a good follow-up cuz I know sometimes I can think of a perfect use case right

231
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:26,527
We are sitting around our dinner table and we're arguing over you

232
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,295
You know something silly

233
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,599
One of us will be like

234
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,391
Let's take it to

235
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:33,439
And then be like

236
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:36,767
Who was the 42nd president

237
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,839
And will get a response

238
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:43,679
When we say things like let's take it to Amazon or maybe put it on the grocery list

239
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:44,959
Or whatever

240
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,239
I could see

241
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:47,775
I don't know what the

242
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:50,847
Shooting action is in my brain I'm the metaphor is like

243
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,127
You like oh

244
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,919
Maybe I should pay closer attention

245
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:54,687
Is it my name

246
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:55,967
Yes it is

247
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,343
The only other thing in his letter that thank you

248
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,903
Explained very clearly

249
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:04,927
How

250
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:05,951
Madam

251
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,487
Works which is

252
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,535
It listens for awake

253
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,839
When it hears that wake word

254
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:12,863
It turns on

255
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,655
And open some microphone

256
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:17,471
To take in the voice command that you're going to say

257
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,007
When you stop speaking

258
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,543
It turns that off

259
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:23,103
It sends only that chunk of command

260
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,127
2

261
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,151
Amazon

262
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,687
Adoption

263
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:27,711
And

264
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:30,783
So many people are concerned that it is always listening

265
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:36,415
And they're they're just not sure it like Amazon can talk till it's blue in the face and explain this

266
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,695
But people are still free

267
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:39,999
So

268
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:42,559
I wish they would have addressed the weird laughing issues

269
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:45,375
What exactly is happening with

270
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:48,447
You know one in the house has said anything related to

271
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,727
Matinee at all

272
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,007
And yet it still wakes up

273
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,799
Or we heard

274
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:55,359
Jerry edge cases something like

275
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:59,199
2 hours of non-stop recording was actually captured

276
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:02,271
I remember that happened was reported about a year ago

277
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:04,575
I think it's with the right Edge case

278
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:09,439
There was some also there were some questions about 5 because

279
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,487
Natchez

280
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:15,071
You said the Wake words matter I use you say something

281
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:22,239
And then make it responsible action happens and then you take another action without saying awake or tinnitus continue to listen

282
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,103
They were clear in the letter and it has been clear from day one that follow-up mode

283
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:29,407
Conversation would you rather call that way

284
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,687
Has to be

285
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,223
Enable by the customer

286
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,759
So it's not on by default

287
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,343
The point here is

288
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:40,671
I feel like we should have more transparency there always computer

289
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,439
People who are like

290
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:44,511
This is how these things were

291
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:50,911
Work and could Amazon be better yes I think they should take a page from Google right now if you are more privacy-conscious you may want to pick

292
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,447
OK Google smart assistant

293
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,007
So we'll see

294
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,031
Hopefully Amazon

295
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,823
Guess what the program

296
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,103
I guess I don't know

297
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:01,663
E-services on whoever Mason

298
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:05,759
Whether it's Samsung Bixby or the other two that we just talked about

299
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:08,319
They're always evolving and frankly

300
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:12,415
If you're going to use one of these devices

301
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:15,743
Yes you are putting microphone in your house and you know that

302
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:18,303
If you're not comfortable with that actually don't do it

303
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,119
If you're comfortable enough with the way they

304
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:24,703
Transcriptions and data are handled again

305
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:25,983
If you're not

306
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:28,031
Against don't put one of these in your house

307
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:29,567
Exactly

308
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:30,591
All right

309
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:34,175
Let's talk about other security issues because they are out there

310
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,223
A company called orvibo

311
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:37,247
Has

312
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,015
Apparently

313
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,295
Not been awesome

314
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:42,367
They left their database

315
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,159
Open it is a smart home

316
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,183
Products maker

317
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:45,951
They make

318
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,743
Cheap outlets in

319
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:52,607
And other stuff like a smart plug Wi-Fi outlet for 7 Bucks

320
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,375
Amazon

321
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,399
Which

322
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,935
Vici sounds good

323
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:58,751
But

324
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:02,847
Except they're based in Shenzhen China

325
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:04,127
Which nut

326
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,687
My soul is a problem however

327
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:13,343
They had over two billion logs in their database that was wide open

328
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:17,695
Usernames emails addresses and passwords

329
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,463
And

330
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:21,023
Your precise location

331
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:25,119
Yeah this has stuff from

332
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,143
Around the world

333
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:29,471
I found this is a company called vpnmentor

334
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:32,031
And they said they contacted

335
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:35,359
Orvibo via email on June 16th they didn't hear

336
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,639
Anything from them

337
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,943
So they tweeted the company and

338
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:43,039
It was left open until at least July 2nd

339
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,063
So

340
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,087
Yay

341
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:48,159
3 weeks from the time they are notified

342
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,207
And apparently

343
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,999
It doesn't sound like

344
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:55,071
Actually responded they just closed it and the

345
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:56,607
Recaptcha

346
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:02,495
This is something that like when we talked about

347
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:08,127
Recommended devices for people cuz we get tons of questions about what's the best device during this this mess you know

348
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:10,943
We tend to stick with

349
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,247
More well-known brands

350
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,527
Anime

351
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:17,087
And they are more expensive that is correct

352
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:19,135
Now that doesn't mean

353
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,671
Just because

354
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,463
It's a well-known Brand X

355
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:24,767
Insecure

356
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,047
What time is it

357
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:30,399
Give me well but the minute we didn't had questions or people were like hey I

358
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:35,519
When the wise cancerous came out today

359
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:39,103
It's not always knowing where this data is stored in cap so

360
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:42,943
It's not always easy for us to find out it's certainly not easy for anyone to find out

361
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:46,527
You got to pay attention to that though if you can

362
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:47,807
And yes

363
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,855
And that's why we say brands

364
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:56,767
And I also do recommend that you look for a companies that have a history of responding to security incidences

365
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,815
Buy response I don't mean soothe

366
00:14:59,071 --> 00:14:59,839
Hacker I mean

367
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:00,863
Hey

368
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,167
Do they issue a patch today

369
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:07,007
Engaged Community to that talk to their customer base about it

370
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,055
So those are those are other thing

371
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:12,639
That you should look for when you're buying action

372
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:16,223
You may not mind but you know I certainly don't

373
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,015
My my family name

374
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,551
My Wi-Fi password

375
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,599
My device password

376
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,135
And

377
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:25,183
My address

378
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,999
If you know that I turn on my light

379
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:29,791
But otherwise

380
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:32,863
Direct Security news

381
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,399
D-Link has settled

382
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,423
Lawsuit

383
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,727
That was filed two years ago by the FTC

384
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:42,079
CC file this lawsuit

385
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:44,639
Were advertised as secure but they were

386
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:45,663
Not

387
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,431
Secure

388
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:48,735
And it was over the security of their routers and IP

389
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:53,087
The FTC was like look you guys stored passwords on your app and play

390
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:56,671
Plaintext used hard-coded login credentials this is a

391
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:57,439
A big No-No

392
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:02,303
That was actually hard-coded login credentials were one of the issues behind the bar Ibotta

393
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:03,583
Back in 2016

394
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,631
So all the way back in

395
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:06,911
Well I guess it was

396
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:07,935
2016

397
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:10,751
We were like really hard could have passwords you guys that's weird

398
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,799
That means your password is

399
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:15,871
It's stored in the device which is not a good

400
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,431
It's like taping your key to the underside of your

401
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,711
I know people do it

402
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:20,991
It's not secure

403
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,575
The FCC said

404
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,623
The company was

405
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,647
Negligent

406
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:30,975
Basically

407
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:31,999
In the court was like

408
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:33,279
No

409
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:36,095
You didn't say this enough proof FTC

410
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:39,423
What combat

411
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:43,263
D-Link is basically by settling

412
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,055
Is probably

413
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:45,823
Okay

414
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:50,431
Yeah we did have V6 which it did and those are not best practices today

415
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:53,247
Today admitted argument that back in 2018

416
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:56,063
14 when they were building these devices these were fine

417
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:56,831
Probably

418
00:16:59,135 --> 00:16:59,903
But we didn't know

419
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:02,463
Basically it's like we didn't know

420
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,743
Now it's clearly problem

421
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:09,887
What they're going to do with the settlement is D-Link is going to implement a comprehensive software security program

422
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:13,727
Vulnerability testing

423
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:16,287
And monitoring of its products to address

424
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,127
It will also issue automatic security updates

425
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,919
And it will begin accepting

426
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:22,687
Vulnerability

427
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:25,503
Basic math practice

428
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:31,647
Just consider these are all things that we always have her eggs

429
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,927
I think the bigger

430
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:34,207
Then use that

431
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:38,559
Requires a D-Link has to

432
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,607
Have an independent

433
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:42,911
Assessment of its software security program

434
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:48,799
Once a year for 10 years

435
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:52,895
Hey

436
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:56,991
D-Link is the way to go for the next few years they've got

437
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:57,759
This

438
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,039
Partial review

439
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:02,623
Check it out their stuff a lot of companies actually hire

440
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:05,183
Impartial reviewers to security test their stuff so

441
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,207
This is not

442
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:06,975
No but

443
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:09,279
Does this feel like the bare minimum

444
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:12,095
Yes but at least we're establishing a Baseline

445
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:18,239
In some we don't have any laws protecting us but with the FTC in this case we've actually establish someone

446
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,007
Baseline

447
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:21,311
And actually that

448
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:25,151
Bring some to a question I was going to ask you when I took a look at this

449
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:28,991
Because I got the same impression here's a baseline could it be a

450
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:31,807
A model for a particular law

451
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:34,111
Or will the FTC do you think just keep

452
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:40,255
Going after companies in this way which would kind of stink of this point

453
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,863
Is this a good starting

454
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,399
I think so and

455
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:50,751
I would also say it should not have to be as long of a process because

456
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:54,079
Court case dismissed the original one

457
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:56,127
But now they have this president

458
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,455
One conservative company

459
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:00,479
Could go

460
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:02,527
Will see this and be like you

461
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:04,831
These are not

462
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,111
Probably 90%

463
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:06,879
Hopefully they're good

464
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:07,903
At least 90%

465
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:09,183
And then

466
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,975
The FTC can say

467
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:13,279
Great here's this implemented

468
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:16,095
Do it and the company be like okay sure

469
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:17,631
I think we will get

470
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:18,399
Again

471
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,167
In trouble

472
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,775
Is with companies that are not really concerned about pleasing the FTC

473
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,055
D-Link is based

474
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,079
Sharon Leal

475
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:27,103
Steak-Out

476
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,127
Millions of custom

477
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:31,967
When we talked about like some random Fly by Night

478
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:32,735
We're just

479
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:33,503
Quit

480
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:34,271
Quick-hit

481
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:35,295
Product

482
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:39,391
Maybe like the smartplug we're just talking about the or Vevo

483
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,159
Stuff

484
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,695
Those companies Medicare

485
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:43,743
The SEC might go after them and they'll be like

486
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,071
No

487
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,351
So

488
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:52,959
I think it'll be good for conscientious companies I think it's kind of the bare minimum but

489
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:55,519
Yay we have a bare minimum and it should be easier

490
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:56,543
The next time

491
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,335
Baby steps

492
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:00,639
So speaking of hard-coded passwords

493
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:03,455
Security researchers have

494
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,223
Discovered

495
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:06,015
That the zapato hub

496
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:10,111
Which is actually a hub people have asked us about I have actually played with it it's

497
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:10,879
Github

498
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,159
Except maybe it's not

499
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:12,927
So

500
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:15,999
Security researchers have discovered that

501
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:19,839
It has her good passwords inside and they could

502
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:22,399
Extract those passwords

503
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,679
And

504
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:25,215
Get access

505
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:25,983
2

506
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,007
The Hub Lincoln

507
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:29,567
But

508
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:33,663
Yeah and I believe the Potter has a an updated

509
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:37,503
Actual aptitude Hardware or throwing out a different hub

510
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:40,319
For multi-tenant properties which is

511
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:41,599
Where this is

512
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:44,159
Yes

513
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:46,719
The reason these guys started hacking it

514
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:47,487
Is because

515
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:48,255
Cuz

516
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:51,583
One of their fellow hackers had and we talked about this on the show

517
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:52,863
Was

518
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,399
Notified by her

519
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,167
Apartments

520
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,703
That they were

521
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:58,495
Transitioning to a

522
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,031
Smart apartment building

523
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,311
Connected lock

524
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:04,895
The security researcher was like I do not want this

525
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:09,503
But was unclear if she had the ability to say no as a tenant

526
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:10,783
And

527
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:11,807
That'll

528
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:14,367
That kerfuffle died down I believe to

529
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:18,720
Most people satisfaction we also saw a different company

530
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:22,048
It was doing automated lock smart locks in the park

531
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:22,816
Building

532
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:26,912
The tenants actually sue the landlord who is trying to put the smart locks in

533
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:29,216
And demanded a physical key

534
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:30,496
So

535
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:31,776
The bottom line

536
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:32,800
Is

537
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:35,872
This is still an unclear area

538
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:36,640
Dessert

539
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:39,200
Maybe not secure spin tested

540
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,992
Is is better for a problem

541
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,552
And the company is smart rent

542
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:46,368
And you may have heard of them because last week they raised

543
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:48,160
32 million dollars

544
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,184
So

545
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,232
What are we saying here

546
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,024
Security is not

547
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,072
It's not at a place where you should be like

548
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,096
Complacent yet

549
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:57,376
Isis

550
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,912
Being sad

551
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:00,960
People can break into non-smart

552
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:02,496
Princess well it's just

553
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:07,616
It's a little bit more difficult I feel more more okay with a Smart Lock in my single family home

554
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:09,152
Because

555
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,480
If someone really wants to get in they can break a window they can

556
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:14,016
Pick a lock it's not

557
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:15,040
That hard

558
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:17,344
In an apartment complex though

559
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,952
Having this sort of vulnerability opens a bunch of locks at once which makes it a Richard

560
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:25,024
And I would also say

561
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:25,792
If your

562
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:26,816
For example

563
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:28,352
Potential high-risk

564
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:30,656
If you have a high risk profile for hackers

565
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:31,424
Like that

566
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:33,984
Then you can actually bolster

567
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:34,752
Your

568
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:36,288
Normal dachshund

569
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,312
Could be easily hack

570
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,592
With a lot more stuff

571
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,664
Things that would make it harder

572
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:42,688
So

573
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:45,760
Okay so

574
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,552
Ascot a lot of bad

575
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:49,856
Amazon news

576
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,392
It's good that we got

577
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,672
More clarity here

578
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:54,720
I'm not surprised by any of it

579
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:57,024
I do think it's being made out to be a little bit

580
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:58,560
More traumatic

581
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,328
And it really is

582
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:02,912
And I think that's because of how you started this this whole

583
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:04,960
Podcast in conversation

584
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:08,288
It's not a binary thing privacy around privacy right

585
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:10,848
It still is

586
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,408
Wow subtlety

587
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:14,688
It's the death of us

588
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:18,528
Hey what's talk about Enterprise iot

589
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:20,576
Hpe hpe

590
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:22,880
Is HP Enterprises it is the

591
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:24,416
Server in

592
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:25,952
All kinds of other stuff

593
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,792
HP they've got server software

594
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:31,072
Cloud computing

595
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:31,840
Crazy stuff

596
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:33,376
They

597
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:35,936
Hyatt we should have done this last week but we did not

598
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:37,472
Basically

599
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:39,520
Hpe wants to

600
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:41,056
Deliver their entire

601
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:42,848
Portfolio as a service by

602
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:45,408
What

603
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:46,432
Heck

604
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:47,456
That mean

605
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:52,320
Basically this is interesting because

606
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:56,160
In the industrial iot in Enterprise iot

607
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:57,952
We talked a lot about this

608
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:59,744
Concept of digital transformation

609
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:05,888
The idea is once you have a lot of data about your products about how people are using your products

610
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:09,984
You can turn something from a capex expense into an object's expense

611
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:10,752
Just cool

612
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:14,592
And you can deliver all kinds of crazy things like

613
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:16,128
Steam traps or

614
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,920
Elevators or

615
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,016
Palace deliver Services service because that's what Amazon

616
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:23,296
Web services is

617
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:25,344
But hpe witch

618
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:27,392
Bill's of physical Hardware

619
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:28,416
I was like huh

620
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:29,696
That's kind of crazy

621
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:32,000
They're still going to provide Hardware

622
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:33,280
And

623
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:34,304
Their software

624
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:36,352
So you could still buy it out

625
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:38,144
But if you want

626
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:41,216
You can also buy a service after 20

627
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:43,776
I thought that was really

628
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:48,896
They're really pushing forward with what everybody else is trying

629
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:50,688
And

630
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:51,456
I don't know

631
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:52,224
What do you think

632
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:57,600
Microsoft Word example don't really

633
00:24:57,856 --> 00:25:02,720
Bill much hard when I do did you some like that the service product line and whatnot

634
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:10,144
They have Services Azure and everything have in-house where is HP

635
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:16,032
Traditionally been a hardware

636
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,056
You're so

637
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:18,592
They integrate software

638
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:21,920
Datacenter in a box

639
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:25,504
But maybe you don't want

640
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:30,368
To buy their boxes because it's cheaper for you to host their services on another cloud

641
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:34,976
Yeah they have spacing expanded and new Partnerships with cyrusone

642
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:37,280
Acronym and

643
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,048
Google Cloud

644
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:39,328
So

645
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:42,912
HP Services you don't have to buy hpe

646
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:44,192
Software Hardware

647
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:45,984
You could have it posted on

648
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:49,312
Yeah I thought this was kind of cool

649
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:54,944
For the Enterprise people cuz these are the kind of big efforts that we talked about a lot with our guests and

650
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,576
Harbor Freight

651
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:04,416
You just rather have everybody else matters at McLeod

652
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,440
Personal

653
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:07,232
We're seeing a shift to like the

654
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:09,280
Economy right so this is basically

655
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:12,864
Instead of capex instead of buying something big once

656
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,912
An amortizing IT overtime

657
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,192
Depreciating it

658
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:16,960
Every time

659
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:18,752
You just

660
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:23,872
Like Me by Rent the Runway instead of doing my clothes are by my clothes

661
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:24,896
Which by the way

662
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:28,224
Okay

663
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,040
Let's talk about something that you tried out this week

664
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:37,696
I tried something I was a piece of software for Android or iOS

665
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:41,280
Runs in the cloud but you can even ask for it

666
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:43,072
There's no web interface for it

667
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:45,632
Any

668
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:47,168
Touts itself

669
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,472
Like a potential replacement

670
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:51,008
Competitor to

671
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,824
If this then that or stringify or

672
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:55,360
Any one of the other

673
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:59,456
Integration type services to make your smart home more degraded

674
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,224
And

675
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:02,784
I guess the best way to say this is

676
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,088
It's good at what it does

677
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:06,112
Becca has some

678
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:07,392
Benefits over

679
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:08,928
If this then that person

680
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,464
But it doesn't

681
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:15,328
Do much yet and that's because there are not a ton of integration

682
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:19,168
I dug around it turns out this product on 27

683
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:22,752
And it's an amsterdam-based company

684
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:25,824
They created a I believe it's a smart thermostat

685
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,104
34 years ago

686
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,920
And they decided to make this over snow app and

687
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:34,784
Start to integrate other services not just with their thermostat but with everything

688
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:38,624
But when you look at the channels for example such as

689
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,416
Integrates with

690
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:41,952
They're just

691
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:45,024
Aren't nearly enough messages on here

692
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:50,912
Are you can do notifications you can interview with Twitter cryptocurrency

693
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:53,728
It does work with home connect Honeywell lyric

694
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,544
Trust Smart Home lifx

695
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:58,848
Tune which is the

696
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:01,920
Smart thermostat that kick this project off

697
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:06,528
Netatmo and it's some other names I just not familiar with like Yuki and

698
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,064
Something is on there

699
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,112
I do know that masonis is on there

700
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:11,392
But

701
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,672
Acardia

702
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,208
Quick and

703
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:15,232
Quick yuan

704
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:17,536
I don't know what that is crownstone

705
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:19,328
Zelig

706
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,912
I would say so

707
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:25,472
In Europe perhaps this is a good

708
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:26,752
Option for you to look at

709
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:29,824
Here in the US I don't find a compelling enough

710
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,128
My testing showed pretty good

711
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:38,016
I couldn't present will get up with any things on my wink hub

712
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:43,392
Can I get you anything that might be on a smartphone side because that's not supported either

713
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:48,512
And I can do with it

714
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:53,120
I can send text messages with I could have any notifications when something happen

715
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:54,912
And even though

716
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:59,008
Google home and Manet integration is kind of weird

717
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:01,056
You have to create

718
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:03,104
A virtual button

719
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:06,688
Can you connect that to your voice assistant and then you

720
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,248
Put a trigger with a collect rig

721
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:12,832
On the button so that tiny that you can create his virtual buttons for

722
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:15,904
Trig's because their whole approach is protease triggers that

723
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:20,512
When this happens what happens next if this then that

724
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,048
It's just weird

725
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,072
So

726
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:24,864
What does it do better than

727
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:25,888
After what

728
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:27,936
UE mentioned that they does something saved

729
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,984
I'm so glad you asked

730
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,592
You could have multiple when things multiple triggers

731
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:41,248
So yeah so you could say if this happens and that happened and this happen

732
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,040
Only this time of day

733
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:44,320
Then do that

734
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:47,392
Got it so that's actually more powerful

735
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:49,952
That that's more like a smart things are stringify effort

736
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:51,232
Correct

737
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:55,328
Correct and it's far easier to use stringify array SmartThings

738
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,376
But again the problem is

739
00:29:57,632 --> 00:30:00,192
For me and probably I think for both of you asked

740
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:05,312
You want to look at the channels that are offered to see what you can do or rather what you cannot do

741
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:08,128
I have no reason to replace anything with this

742
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:12,224
Right now I'm not saying it's a bad product I'm saying it needs to mature

743
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:13,760
Okay

744
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:19,392
Hey what's talk about some tiny little updates that are fun to do so Kevin you want to kick ass off with

745
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:20,416
Chamberlain

746
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:23,744
Yes Google Assistant

747
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,792
And if this then that integration

748
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:27,328
You can get it for

749
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:29,376
Free for a limited

750
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:30,144
Time

751
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:37,824
Wilt Chamberlain start

752
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,104
Charging

753
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,664
For the microservices on if this then that

754
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,736
So does costume the nominal fee right now

755
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:49,344
But for one year you can actually get for free

756
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,392
All right and I will tell you that

757
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:52,928
I love my MyQ

758
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:53,696
It's great

759
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:55,744
It's one of the one devices that I'd want to

760
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,280
Replace here in this house

761
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:58,048
Lucia

762
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,096
They updated their

763
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:04,192
Hub and so now instead of $50 which was the last limit

764
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:08,032
Did not let you control 75 bulbs or switches are whatever you

765
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,568
April 75

766
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:10,848
So

767
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:13,408
This is great for people with lots of

768
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:15,200
I guess lots of house

769
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,552
Is the lack of lamb

770
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:25,440
That doesn't require any new hardware

771
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:28,512
If you only have 50 now you can go buy 25 more

772
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,584
Do you need a new bridge or no

773
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:40,800
Speaking of balls and speaking of I was actually excited to see

774
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:48,736
Is currently the owner of Philips Hue

775
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:49,760
And

776
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:52,576
Philips Hue bulbs

777
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:59,232
Yes well I never really invested in the Philips Hue bulb

778
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:01,024
And you need that

779
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:08,192
Philips Hue now makes balls with

780
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,520
So you can get Philips Hue bulbs

781
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:13,568
White tunable white and

782
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:14,336
Color

783
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:17,664
With Bluetooth and no Philips Hue Bridge needed

784
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:21,248
I am curious what you need

785
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:22,784
Is there some things

786
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:26,112
I think you will need and I'm serious actually to test this out

787
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:27,136
Because

788
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:29,952
The last time I tested Bluetooth bulbs

789
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,232
Well

790
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:33,024
The first time I tested them I hated them because

791
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,304
Cuz my house was bigger than

792
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:38,400
The range and then the second time I was trying still with

793
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:41,216
Awesome so I can't wait to see if this means blue

794
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:41,984
Bluetooth mask

795
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:42,752
Actually

796
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:43,520
More useful

797
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:45,824
Set temperature to 8

798
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:50,944
All right

799
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,992
Is he Bluetooth

800
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:53,760
Okay

801
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:55,040
And find a little bit

802
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:59,648
SmartThings they have updated the app and you can now integrate

803
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:00,928
A hub connected

804
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:04,256
Device so this is any sort of

805
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:05,024
Connects through

806
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,560
SmartThings compatible

807
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:08,096
Rather still like your weight

808
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:08,864
And

809
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,424
It will use the SmartThings Cloud execute those

810
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:14,752
So now you can have your hubs talk to your other hubs

811
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:15,776
It's great

812
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:19,104
But it's all in the cloud and I want local

813
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:19,872
Alright well

814
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:21,920
This isn't for you you don't even want

815
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:22,688
But

816
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:25,248
If I can open if you do want hugs

817
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,016
Good news

818
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:29,088
All right now I think it's time for

819
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:31,648
Two things one the voicemail but also

820
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:34,208
Shoes

821
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:35,488
Winner

822
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:39,840
All right and they win a wise

823
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:40,608
Sensor

824
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:41,888
So

825
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:44,448
Very exciting and our winner is

826
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:47,520
We heard from him last week this is Bobby

827
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:48,288
Do asses smell

828
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:50,592
Congratulations

829
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:51,872
Yay

830
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,200
You know that's two months in a row that we've had the last

831
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:55,968
Caller

832
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,528
Actually win and the funny thing is

833
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:00,320
We actually

834
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:03,136
And then ask

835
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:06,720
The Google assistant pick a random number from 1 to the number

836
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:12,096
Kind of weird but that's how it work out

837
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:17,216
So yes it's it is random for any of you

838
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:17,984
Are you guys were like

839
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:20,032

Let's hear from

864
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,072
Larry

865
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:19,680
Hi this is Larry Reed still free to use

866
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:20,960
The message on the air

867
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:24,800
And I moved in together and

868
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:26,592
I switched everything

869
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:27,872
Over

870
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:28,896
Plum

871
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:31,200
My Amazon Echo

872
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:32,736
Google

873
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:34,272
What have you

874
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:36,320
My account

875
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:38,880
But I'm wondering

876
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:41,184
Should he have a loan account

877
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,976
And it's just her and I

878
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,352
Read this. The tile system

879
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:50,144
And I just added her

880
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:52,192
Under one account

881
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:55,520
That's the question

882
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:57,056
Kristoff

883
00:35:57,312 --> 00:36:00,640
Congratulations for a big step in your relationship

884
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:02,944
There's a couple ways to answer this one is

885
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,224
By no means

886
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:08,576
No means at all due to accounts because you will end up doubling up on all of your stuff

887
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:10,112
I have tried this it

888
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:12,416
Not good

889
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:13,952
Amazon will think you have

890
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:15,232
Two lights

891
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:16,768
When you really only have one

892
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,560
And state gets messed up

893
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:19,840
It doesn't work just don't

894
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:21,376
Now

895
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:26,752
If it's already under your name and you don't want to mess with anything just keep it there and she can still do the commands of that sort of thing

896
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:29,056
This is for Madame a household

897
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:30,336
And then

898
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:32,128
The other option though

899
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:34,432
In their pros and cons to this

900
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:37,248
Is creating an email app

901
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:38,528
Your house

902
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:39,808
So

903
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:41,856
Have a house account

904
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:44,160
That you tie into your

905
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:44,928
Madam

906
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:47,232
The advantages are things like

907
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:51,840
I don't know if you Spotify but certain certain things that have limits associated with them

908
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:53,376
Well now

909
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:54,144
Be associated

910
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,448
The downside

911
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:57,216
Is

912
00:36:57,472 --> 00:37:00,544
I don't remember how many adults you can have in a household

913
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:03,104
And you want your house email

914
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,128
An account to be

915
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:04,896
An adult

916
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:07,712
Then you may not be able to add your girlfriend to your car

917
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:11,808
Might be awesome for her cuz she could like order things on

918
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:12,576
Your account

919
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:16,928
So we'd have to check that but

920
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:19,744
The challenge if you don't do that is

921
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,024
Location stuff

922
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,328
Will still work but things like ordering

923
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,888
If you order stuff from Amazon it will

924
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:28,960
That's taking your relationship to a whole new level.

925
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:35,872
I do have a question only because you have multiple devices in multiple family members

926
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:37,920
Would you recommend

927
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:41,504
In either platform golang with like a voice match as well

928
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,272
No

929
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,064
I thought you might not

930
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,344
I hate the voice match

931
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,368
It doesn't work well for us

932
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:53,280
Because you also mentioned and you said you might be switching

933
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,352
Situation

934
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:03,776
Don't do voice match at all if you do Google home you can each have your separate accounts and tie them to one

935
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:05,824
Google device

936
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:10,176
At that actually solve the problem because you're going to have that individual

937
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:13,248
Accounts and data all tied into one platform

938
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:19,648
Voice match has to work a hundred percent or you're going to be miserable

939
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:25,024
Brightside my family refuses to be trained so I can't speak to it either

940
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,048
So there's your

941
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:29,888
You could always try the voice match if it doesn't work

942
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,192
Hopefully

943
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:33,728
That helps Larry and

944
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:34,496
Now

945
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:35,776
It is time

946
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:37,312
To say goodbye to Kevin

947
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:38,592
And say hello

948
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:39,872
Guest

949
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:45,760
Our guests coming up after the break is Andy Lowry who is the CEO of real where they make a

950
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:47,552
Connected

951
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:49,600
Head-mounted display

952
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:51,904
It is a voice-controlled for industrial settings

953
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:55,744
It's pretty cool and they just raised 80 million dollars which

954
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,536
It's kind of a lot so he's going to talk about

955
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:59,072
Why people use these

956
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,144
Some use cases and what they're going to do with it

957
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:06,752
For this

958
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:13,152
Hey everyone we are taking a quick break from The Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor this

959
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:19,552
Sponsor is Dell Technologies and I have Jason Sheppard who is CTO of iot in

960
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:22,368
Edge at Dell Technologies here to talk to us

961
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:23,136
So json

962
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:27,232
Last week we talked about edgex Foundry and how that's going

963
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:29,536
This week let's talk about your

964
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:34,144
Scaling to the grey Lyndell strategy what is Dells as strategy

965
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:36,448
And how does it relate to Edge X Foundry

966
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:39,008
Yeah so basically the strategy was

967
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:45,408
Get an architecture that works for the edge out in the open crate open interoperability through that collaboration and then attached

968
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:46,688
Best commercial value add to it

969
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:51,808
Where infrastructure provider we bring Partners in for their domain expertise and we wanted that edge X

970
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:54,368
API that's developed through that collaboration

971
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:57,952
Value-add not only from ourselves but also partners

972
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:04,096
So this openedge stack is taking VMware pulse iot Center as a device management platform

973
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:06,400
Bison application

974
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:07,680
Are Photon OS

975
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:12,032
Which is a Linux variant running containers you can use any what you want but that Jack's that looks rating

976
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:13,824
Experience with a tough course Ajax

977
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:14,592
Is part of that

978
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:16,384
Where you get the benefit of

979
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:20,992
Consistent security and Management Open API driven by The Edge X Eco cyst

980
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:27,648
And then you were choices application stack so it's developer you can get get started really quickly and easily build on something that scale

981
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:30,976
But not get locked into any given platform which is currently this

982
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:37,376
The case with many of the platforms that are creating their own apis are on sdks who kept to get connected to their ass if they want to

983
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:39,424
Milwaukee went early and we're getting people choice

984
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:40,704
Okay and

985
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:47,104
Get our conversations around this you keep talking about scaling to the Grail and data monetization

986
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:48,640
Around the edge

987
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:50,176
What do you mean by that

988
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:53,248
Yes it's going to look really nice talk about that

989
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:56,832
My stuff online it's really about this notion of pervasive

990
00:40:57,088 --> 00:41:00,416
Steering or monetization especially on your terms

991
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:02,208
Of data which is the obvious one

992
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:02,976
Resource

993
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:04,768
Compute storage networking

994
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:06,816
Rideshares anything consumable

995
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:08,096
Knowledge

996
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:10,144
Feeling like that sharing selling

997
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:10,912
Across

998
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:11,936
Complete strangers

999
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:13,984
I've never built a relationship with you

1000
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:18,592
Able to sell you something in the way you do that is he build pervasive Truss

1001
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:20,128
I need to get to the base of trust

1002
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:24,480
You cannot have any single entity on the trucks he was in a water system system

1003
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:27,040
Public and private domains Etc and sew

1004
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:29,856
To get to the Grail you need technology to help

1005
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:31,392
And you need an open Edge

1006
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:37,536
This is why you know we're investing heavily here and then that enables you it's me sound far-fetched as notion of pervasive

1007
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:39,840
Date of motivation but also the only

1008
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:41,376
Pastor is it open

1009
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:47,776
Edge and so the scale of the Grail is starting out with a simple use case just get going

1010
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,080
Towards that ultimate goal

1011
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:54,943
That's right Jason so where can we go to find out more about Dell Technologies

1012
00:41:55,711 --> 00:42:01,855
Dell Technologies. Com coyote is a good starting point and then there's been some banks offer their took over more

1013
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:08,255
Hey every

1014
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:13,631
I would welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest

1015
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:16,703
Is Andy Lowry who is the CEO of

1016
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:19,263
Hi Andy how are you doing

1017
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,055
Good Stacy

1018
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:26,175
Man I am super excited to have you here about to talk about something

1019
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:31,807
Oh I don't know if I've been skeptical but we're about to talk about using AR in

1020
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:35,391
The workplace in the Enterprise all the way from manufacturing to

1021
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:39,231
Back in warehouses even two people riding around an ambulance

1022
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:41,535
So there's a lot of stuff here first off

1023
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:44,863
And let's talk about what it is the real where does

1024
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:47,935
Our mission here at real where is

1025
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:48,959
Train

1026
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:52,031
Skilled industrial workers

1027
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:53,567
We provide knowledge

1028
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:56,895
And what I mean by that is there's tons of data

1029
00:42:57,407 --> 00:43:00,223
Out there in Cloud

1030
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:04,063
What we do is we provide class

1031
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:05,599
Hardware

1032
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:10,463
Wearable computer heads up display computer that's a Android driven

1033
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:11,231
Tablet

1034
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:13,023
But it's shaped in a way that

1035
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:17,631
Baseball caps that you can wear it hands-free

1036
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:21,471
And you communicate and control the system using your voice

1037
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:23,263
Particular voice

1038
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:25,567
That allows this hands-free control

1039
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:29,663
How's the computer that you're wearing is done and very very high noise

1040
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:30,431
Environment

1041
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:32,479
100 decibels you can barely

1042
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:33,247
Kill yourself

1043
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:34,015
Ekans

1044
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:40,415
You can still control the system much better than most people's opinion

1045
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:41,695
Home system

1046
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:46,047
The device itself if I were to give you an elevator pitch were in an elevator going up

1047
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:47,071
New York Tire

1048
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:48,607
Taking only a few floors

1049
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:49,887
The simplest way

1050
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:52,447
The pictures is that it's an Android tablet

1051
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:53,983
So start with that

1052
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:55,007
It's got Wi-Fi

1053
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:57,823
Bluetooth has got a nice Qualcomm processor

1054
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,895
Has a little micro display that looks like a heads-up display

1055
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:02,175
Which one dude

1056
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:04,223
Looks about like a 7-inch tablet

1057
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:05,247
Held at arm's length

1058
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:06,527
Then you have a voice

1059
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:10,879
System that uses a little bit of gestures like your head moving left and right

1060
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:11,647
Keep scrolling

1061
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:14,975
White things like that as a secondary input modality

1062
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:17,279
The primary modality is just voice

1063
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:18,047
And so

1064
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:21,887
Where a lot of systems out there today have swipes or gestures

1065
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:24,447
Halloween people are familiar with the hololens

1066
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:26,751
Types of gestures there this blue man

1067
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:27,775
Poke drag

1068
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:29,823
What we do is we do

1069
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:31,871
All of the heads-up display database

1070
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:34,687
And that's just in a very big differentiator

1071
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:35,967
Compared to a lot of the other

1072
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:37,759
Systems that are out there

1073
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:40,063
Something a little bit more Blended

1074
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:42,879
Okay so

1075
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:45,183
We figured out what it is you guys do

1076
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:50,303
Where does it make sense what are the use cases that people are predominantly choosing

1077
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:51,839
Your system for

1078
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:54,655
What are the simplest ways

1079
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:56,703
Disfigured stats at at the beginning

1080
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:58,751
A lot of people talk about

1081
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:00,543
Digitizing iot

1082
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:02,335
Industrial iot

1083
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:05,151
And what we see him on the home side is

1084
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:09,503
You know a lot of sort of fragmented but ever-growing iot Solutions

1085
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:10,783
Smart refrigerator

1086
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:12,063
Stove mr.

1087
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:13,599
On our side of the fence

1088
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:14,623
Coyote takes

1089
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:16,415
Extra step

1090
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:19,743
And I tell a lot of folks that worked at Raytheon as a chief engineer

1091
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:22,303
And iPhones came out in Circa 08

1092
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:24,095
Raytheon didn't allow an iPhone

1093
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:29,215
And the reason was all the stuff we're dealing with now in the iot

1094
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:31,007
I said stuff like security

1095
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:32,799
Safety ergonomics

1096
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:34,847
Stability stability of the software

1097
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:40,991
Need to check the block on

1098
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:41,759
Actually

1099
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:43,551
Moving towards an acquisition or

1100
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:45,343
I'm more significant roll out

1101
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:49,695
Consumers on the other side new Gadget comes out they want to see the latest

1102
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:51,743
Greatest to go to the Best Buy that buy it

1103
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,279
Integrated math Sawdust

1104
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:57,631
Show in general what we're doing is taking those same digital stuff

1105
00:45:57,887 --> 00:45:58,911
FaceTime Netflix

1106
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:01,215
Applying it to the industrial sector

1107
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:05,823
What we're doing it a way that conforms to all the industry

1108
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:07,615
That's about losing data.

1109
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:10,687
Sure has to be 6 war in all of these different things

1110
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:13,247
And what about the use cases for these head-mounted

1111
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:14,527
Displays in general

1112
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:18,879
Now if you're asking specifically what it when they get out there and they get the

1113
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:20,159
All connected

1114
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:22,719
What is it doing with these HMT

1115
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:24,767
Well apart from doing

1116
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:26,303
Capturing video and all that stuff

1117
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:27,327
Which was

1118
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:30,143
Stop sort of the elements of the digitization

1119
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:33,215
Revolution that we need we need videos we need content

1120
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:34,239
Get stuffed

1121
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:36,031
Put into these systems that aren't

1122
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:40,383
A pieces of paper and write written down notes Wheatley the actual digital content

1123
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:42,175
So it's a great machine

1124
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:48,831
Cuz you can wear it and can move the boom arm out of the way with no display just where is a GoPro on your heart

1125
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:52,159
And everything you were doing you could capture all day long work

1126
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:56,767
If you're in the warehouse you might have a baseball cap on you can capture your activity

1127
00:46:57,023 --> 00:47:01,631
And then those films can be basically slice two dice and they little YouTube videos on

1128
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:03,679
How to do things inside the factory

1129
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:05,727
Barbie on the concert

1130
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:07,007
Three major classes

1131
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:08,031
Software

1132
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:11,103
That get deployed the first is collaboration software

1133
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:13,151
Her folks are talking to each other

1134
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:13,919
Come up remotes

1135
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:19,807
Before maybe someone would call a headquarters and use your telephone to just get a voice

1136
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:21,599
Walkthrough on how to fix something

1137
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:23,647
Now with the today's text it's not

1138
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:24,927
I required to have only

1139
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:26,975
You can actually do video and voice

1140
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:29,279
So with video and voice will you

1141
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:32,095
You're sharing a screen and your doing this hands-free

1142
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:36,191
You're able to talk to the person coach the person but then show the person

1143
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:38,495
In the real world what were talking about

1144
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:40,287
That you need to go do so maybe

1145
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:41,567
Switch the switch off

1146
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:43,615
Pekin Circle that switch with his lap

1147
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:45,407
On his laptop with his Mouse

1148
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:47,711
And see that switch from your camera

1149
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:49,503
And then apply those to your circles

1150
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:51,807
Huron your little screen

1151
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:54,111
And then the third category

1152
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:58,975
Is the category of human machine interface and this has to do with the data visualization but it also

1153
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:03,839
You can think of Rockwell Collins Mitsubishi ABB Emerson

1154
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:05,631
A number of folks are have

1155
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:08,191
Iot systems that basically have

1156
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:12,799
Giving machine interface in

1157
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:15,871
Control things and push buttons and do that sort of stuff

1158
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:19,967
Well in our system you can take that software put it on our computer

1159
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:22,783
Now you can roll over on the plant in summer

1160
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:24,319
500 yards away

1161
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:27,903
The machine that has an alarm or or overheats and you can

1162
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:29,183
Pull up that data

1163
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:30,719
Control the machine from

1164
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:32,767
500 meters away in in

1165
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:36,863
All of these things have been

1166
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:40,191
Really powerful from an Roi perspective Soak City

1167
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:41,215
Come back to me and say

1168
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:45,567
Charlotte like BMW came back inside a 75% reduction

1169
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:49,663
In time to fix things and then all that and so there's no question

1170
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:50,943
Return on investment

1171
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:56,575
I believe I have actually played with your glasses I believe I tried them on an Emerson user event

1172
00:48:57,087 --> 00:48:57,599
One point in time

1173
00:48:57,855 --> 00:48:59,135
I'm so now I'm like oh

1174
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:00,159
I think I found this

1175
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:06,815
There are actual practical use cases you mentioned that BMW is seeing a 75% increase in productivity

1176
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:08,351
Using this system

1177
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:09,375
But

1178
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:10,655
Why is it everybody used

1179
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:12,959
Well it's just the time

1180
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:14,495
I think it takes really to get

1181
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:15,775
The Enterprise

1182
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:16,543
Shillings

1183
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:17,823
Face picture

1184
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:19,615
Unstable enough with the

1185
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:22,431
Device the technology and then the ecosystem

1186
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:23,455
Support around

1187
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:30,111
Specifically in the security Dimension you've got a lot of corporate forms and devices they absolutely have

1188
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:30,879
Have to be encrypted

1189
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:34,207
You can't take us with a backend API and have

1190
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:38,559
Unencrypted data going from sap to a device I cars

1191
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:40,351
It's absolutely has to have the rights

1192
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:46,495
Deploy something to your folks that hopefully makes them work faster

1193
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:51,871
It just doesn't work it just can't do that everything has to

1194
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:53,919
Start with safety in today's day and age

1195
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:57,503
And then finish with a higher productivity so safeties II

1196
00:49:57,759 --> 00:49:58,527
7/3 is

1197
00:49:59,039 --> 00:49:59,551
Just the

1198
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:01,855
Stability and and what I mean by that is

1199
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:03,647
When we get into the deployments at

1200
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:07,999
Scale we're not talking about this

1201
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:08,767
200 South

1202
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:12,351
What are you talkin about that amount of scale and investment

1203
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:16,191
Companies like Mitsubishi Electric Japanese company wants to see

1204
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:19,263
Stability in space and stability

1205
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:21,823
To ensure that the support will be there for

1206
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:23,103
Perpetuity

1207
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:26,943
So let's talk about some of the use cases you got here

1208
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:31,551
Such as in remote guidance you were telling me a little bit about some of the medical use cases

1209
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:32,831
What are people doing

1210
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:35,647
Those are the type of use cases that get me

1211
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:37,695
Excited due to the impact

1212
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:41,023
We've got a couple different case

1213
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:46,655
The Radio podcast show people are listening to imagine

1214
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:48,447
The first thing we're talking about here

1215
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:50,751
What were literally talking about

1216
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:54,335
I think those people know what that is where you have

1217
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:59,199
The video and the voice in your kind of at the same time collaborating what we're doing this from

1218
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:00,735
Perspective the eyes out

1219
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:01,759
Versus Two-Face

1220
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:05,087
Are cameras focused out into the world

1221
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:07,391
So can see through your eyes basic

1222
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:08,159
What you're looking

1223
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:10,463
Join the case of EMTs

1224
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:14,303
In both the countries of Finland and Norway

1225
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:16,351
Deploy into the axle ambulance

1226
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:23,519
What they do is they come across the young boy who might have fallen down and has a very nasty abrasion

1227
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:29,919
They actually use the HMT as they're treating the person insult you where they find of young man

1228
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:32,735
Wasps they have an H

1229
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:37,087
What the hmt-1 is doing this through cellular Networks

1230
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:38,879
Screen Rant video

1231
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:39,903
Back to the emerge

1232
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:42,207
To see Rome. They're going to go to next

1233
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:47,071
And showing these doctors what exactly is going on without the EMT having

1234
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:47,839
Pause

1235
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:48,863
Stop to do anything

1236
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:49,887
MTC

1237
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:53,471
Turn out the resuscitative types of medical procedures

1238
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:55,775
And at the same time the doctors and nurses

1239
00:51:57,567 --> 00:51:59,359
They can prepare that

1240
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:00,639
Arrival they can

1241
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:02,687
Get the right beds the right doctors

1242
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:05,503
Wright Medical Equipment ready and prepared

1243
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:06,527
And then

1244
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:07,551
Precious minutes

1245
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:08,831
But that can save

1246
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:11,903
Okay well there's a lot going on there

1247
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:13,951
Hair sew-in something like that

1248
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:16,255
There's so many questions that start with the technical question

1249
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:19,839
This seems like one of those oh my gosh 5G use cases

1250
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:21,119
We don't actually have five

1251
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:30,079
Is this like an LTE network or how does this work in practice from a network level and even from Abyss

1252
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:31,359
Who pays for these

1253
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:38,783
That a great questions and there's lots of answers to it cuz it depends a little bit

1254
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:43,903
I even have the issues in the US because EMTs are often insured by a different insurance

1255
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:46,207
Hospitals are in feathers

1256
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:52,607
Conflict in the business you know he say hey let's just do what's best for patients but then you always run up against business challenge

1257
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:53,631
From time to time

1258
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:58,495
I guess from a technology point of view you're right you've nailed it when you focus

1259
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:01,823
Connectivity is what makes us

1260
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:05,407
First of all it is not an LTE

1261
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:09,247
Riven Android tablet it is a wifi-only

1262
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:14,879
So if we do go to LTE we connect via hotspot so Verizon has a hotspot and a number of other

1263
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:18,463
Companies Huawei has one that we actually connect to

1264
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:19,743
Basically that then

1265
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:26,143
Kansas off into the cellular network mostly for Jeeps

1266
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:29,215
Chihuahua and stuff for doing the local to an actual

1267
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:31,519
Facility that they've begun to sort of

1268
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:33,823
Experiment with

1269
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:34,847
White area coverage

1270
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:36,383
5G that's not here yet

1271
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:38,687
And as we're looking at why they recover

1272
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:39,711
Certified G

1273
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:41,247
This frequency spectrum is

1274
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:42,271
Is all over the place

1275
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:45,087
Depending on where you are from a geography point of view

1276
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:47,647
Until we do have plans to continue

1277
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:49,183
The modularity approach

1278
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:54,559
Because our customers are so global

1279
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:56,863
IGN China versus 5G in the US

1280
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:59,423
That's kind of Honor roadmap

1281
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:04,287
For future products and everything else will come out about the time 5G starts to gain momentum

1282
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:10,431
So you guys recently raised 80 million in debt and equity and that is a lot of

1283
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:11,199
Money

1284
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:12,991
What are you guys going to do

1285
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:17,599
Two major areas of frost one is around getting these

1286
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:18,367
Deployments

1287
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:20,159
Be a little bit more

1288
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:22,719
Easy to do and and what I mean by that is

1289
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:23,999
Water solution

1290
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:26,303
Weird

1291
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:30,399
The moving towards sort of a real where is a service model where we'll bundle

1292
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:34,495
Things together into kind of a single offering and then just drop it in

1293
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:37,823
Install a train and then leave and and that sort of

1294
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:40,895
Motions different than today's motion where a lot of it is

1295
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:43,711
Hey do a trade study on the hardware do a trade study on the soft

1296
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:51,391
ZR1 price per user per month for everything installation Hardware shopper

1297
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:54,463
On the tailor that is basically and

1298
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:55,743
Expansion of Versailles

1299
00:54:57,023 --> 00:55:03,167
Especially when it comes to the installation folks in the training folks in the technical folks sets

1300
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:05,727
But nevertheless can help deploy

1301
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:08,799
And then the second area is around research and development

1302
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:09,823
Mostly developed

1303
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:12,895
We got two classes of products

1304
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:14,175
Schlitterbahn

1305
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:19,295
The bounding edges of where we sit in the ecosystem and and industries

1306
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:20,831
I want is the hololens which

1307
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:23,903
Isaiah stereoscopic system

1308
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:24,671
Ideas

1309
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:28,511
Towards products that may make immersive AR a little bit more

1310
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:31,071
Easy to do so there's a better way to do that

1311
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:34,143
And still keep it safe than the way we're doing it today

1312
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:40,287
I am we got a work-in-progress right now that will take away eventually to something that looks more

1313
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:43,615
Like immersive AR or something that would be able to

1314
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:45,919
Soda compared immersive AR

1315
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:47,711
And then on the other end of the steps

1316
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:50,783
We have folks like Google Glass and a whole bunch of

1317
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:53,855
Chinese competitors in the same sort of will

1318
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:57,951
Sugar is in need for lighter-weight indoor systems as well

1319
00:55:58,207 --> 00:56:04,351
There's a couple different ways or else we can go to market looking at lightweight systems but basically I have those from a

1320
00:56:04,607 --> 00:56:06,143
Hardware perspective in my bullseye

1321
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:08,447
And then from a software perspective it's all about the

1322
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:12,031
Platform show at each one of these

1323
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:12,799
If you think of them

1324
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:16,639
We need to build the nest as well make sure that Nest is

1325
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:19,199
Go Boston comfortable

1326
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:21,247
What about you I'm talking about his mobile device

1327
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:23,039
Mobile application manager

1328
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:26,367
Different microservices in the cloud to help enable these things

1329
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:28,671
Because while you deploy 10000

1330
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:30,207
Hmt-1 sore

1331
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:33,279
Any wearable system for Enterprise or even any

1332
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:34,047
Phones

1333
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:35,583
Or tablets for Enterprise

1334
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:42,239
Is very different than the way you do it as a consumer because there's a consumer kind of your own admin your own it it's sort of us

1335
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:43,007
Team of one

1336
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:48,127
Whereas in Enterprise you're deploying 10,000 systems you might have one admin

1337
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:49,919
She's running all 10006

1338
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:54,271
Needs to be a little bit different

1339
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:58,111
Then what Google provides consumers and others like that and that's what we're building

1340
00:56:59,391 --> 00:57:03,743
In a world where we have these this awesome connectivity and we have

1341
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:07,839
This sort of technology in the in the nest that you are so thoughtfully build for us

1342
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:10,143
What becomes possible what is that look for

1343
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:14,239
What we love to think about it real where what we're doing is

1344
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:18,079
Enabling sort of the 21st century maker

1345
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:21,151
Jones furniture makers are Folks at work with their hands

1346
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:25,759
I come from a family of sheet metal workers

1347
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:27,295
Grassland

1348
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:28,831
Next Generation

1349
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:29,599
Digital worker

1350
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:31,135
With the same sort of

1351
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:35,231
The Clark College of the road

1352
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:37,535
Where we sit here and Vancouver Washington

1353
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:39,839
I bet trains new automotive tech

1354
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:40,607
Patience

1355
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:42,143
How to do edging

1356
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:45,215
Well, part of their curriculum now for a day they spend

1357
00:57:45,471 --> 00:57:46,751
Learning about the HMT

1358
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:50,847
Because how that will turn them into a 21st century worker

1359
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:52,895
Is so much faster

1360
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:53,919
Then the workers

1361
00:57:54,175 --> 00:57:54,943
20th century

1362
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:56,735
Because they're able to get the

1363
00:57:56,991 --> 00:57:57,503
Basics

1364
00:57:57,759 --> 00:58:01,343
Word directly to a contributional sort of

1365
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:02,623
Position on the team

1366
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:06,975
Because they have with some of these digital tools to help them be the sort of half

1367
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:09,791
Human half computer type

1368
00:58:12,351 --> 00:58:14,911
I watch did you ever hear of something called

1369
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:15,935
Centaur chess

1370
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:18,495
I have no idea what you're

1371
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:21,823
This is a fascinating thing and trust me I mean if we

1372
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:23,103
State came out with

1373
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:24,639
The beat of

1374
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:25,663
Kasparov

1375
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:28,223
Grandmaster chess champion in 1997

1376
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:28,991
Beat Buy

1377
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:30,783
Deep blue with IBM computer

1378
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:31,807
We all kind of

1379
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:34,367
Echoed across the whole globe about this idea

1380
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:36,415
Oh man the computers are smarter than people

1381
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:39,231
But what Gary did was say na they're not smarter than

1382
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:42,047
Because the computer didn't play the game of chess that I play

1383
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:42,815
However

1384
00:58:44,351 --> 00:58:48,191
Computer to maximize with a computer

1385
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:51,007
Centaurs

1386
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:51,775
Mythological creature

1387
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:53,055
Half horse half man

1388
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:55,871
The idea would be the man would be the

1389
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:56,895
Intuitive

1390
00:58:57,151 --> 00:58:57,663
Creative

1391
00:58:57,919 --> 00:58:59,199
Type source of knowledge

1392
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:00,991
And the horse would be your bootstrap

1393
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:02,527
Powercranks rocks

1394
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:05,087
Make sure it's Eric fruits that sort of thing

1395
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:07,391
It was a little bit

1396
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:09,951
More harmonious than a cyborg

1397
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:12,255
Some people caught cyborg chest

1398
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:14,815
But this chess is played at the highest level of chest

1399
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:15,583
History

1400
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:16,351
Play time

1401
00:59:16,607 --> 00:59:19,935
It's virtually are proof and you got the greatest chess Minds the world

1402
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:20,703
Creatively

1403
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:21,983
Doing each other

1404
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:24,799
On a chessboard at a very high high high level

1405
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:29,151
What we're doing is doing the same work reading a centaur works

1406
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:32,223
This Workforce of centaurs

1407
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:33,759
That'll be

1408
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:34,783
Digital

1409
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:37,087
What's the tools like the HMT that

1410
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:39,647
Go into the field and take a vacation

1411
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:42,719
It's a very well take these folks will be welcome

1412
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:47,071
Because other skills are so much higher than a conventional

1413
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:50,655
That has to go back home not sure how to fix this

1414
00:59:50,911 --> 00:59:52,191
Let me get someone else out there

1415
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:54,495
I get my supervisor there

1416
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:56,031
Additional worker

1417
00:59:56,287 --> 00:59:57,823
Will be able to diagnose people in

1418
00:59:58,335 --> 01:00:00,639
Pedialyte

1419
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:01,919
Minor it is

1420
01:00:03,455 --> 01:00:04,223
When you try to make

1421
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:09,343
Translate that out to a global scale and as we're building infrastructure of things like

1422
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:10,367
Wind power

1423
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:11,391
Geothermal

1424
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:14,719
And all of these things that will begin a world that will be

1425
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:17,279
Truly lower lower marginal cost

1426
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:20,607
Truly less and less dependent on scarce resources

1427
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:24,191
So that the idea of sharing economy something that is

1428
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:28,287
Jeremy Rifkin does a very good speech on this

1429
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:31,871
About a sharing economy where we reduce the margin

1430
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:35,455
Anything that we do energy we make Logistics

1431
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:36,479
The knowledge

1432
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:39,551
She nearly zero and then in that sort of contest

1433
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:41,855
We told the world that is

1434
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:44,671
A lot less prone to have us fighting over

1435
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:45,951
The scraps

1436
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:47,999
Like we do today like we did in the industrial

1437
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:52,863
Play the next two generations will be the workforce that actually

1438
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:53,631
Implement

1439
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:55,679
Wechat infrastructure

1440
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:56,703
Build the world

1441
01:00:56,959 --> 01:00:59,519
That is much more orientated on creativity

1442
01:00:59,775 --> 01:01:00,287
And the

1443
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:01,823
Potential of the human race

1444
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:04,895
Fighting over little scribbles and scraps

1445
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:07,199
Okay that's a fun big vision

1446
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:09,759
All right will Andy I feel like I've learned a lot

1447
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:10,783
Thank you so much

1448
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:11,807
For coming on the show The

1449
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:18,975
You're very welcome say you had a great time that's it for this week thanks

1450
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:25,375
How much for listening and remember if you'd like more iot news sign up for my newsletter at Stacy on ice

1451
01:01:25,631 --> 01:01:28,959
Coyote.com will see you next week
