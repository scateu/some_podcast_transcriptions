This week we're going to be talking about a new

8
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:32,768
Program that you can load on your back book that will actually help you understand what iot devices are running

9
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:33,792
In your network

10
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:35,328
And how

11
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:36,352

Facial recognition and overall privacy

15
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:47,616
Their supplies related to that plus

16
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:51,968
Intel's big news about getting out of modems doesn't apply to SMS

17
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:55,552
Inside but it does apply maybe on the iot side

18
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:56,576
We'll talk about that

19
00:00:57,344 --> 00:01:01,696
We got a lot of self-driving car news you love news from Apple the US Army and wave

20
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,232
We've got

21
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:04,256

00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:11,680
And a program

26
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:13,216
That allows things to work

27
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:13,984
With ring

28
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:16,800

Common pitfalls

40
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:43,424
For the iot

41
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:44,704

53
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:41,536
Okay Kevin let's get this show started

54
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:42,816
First step

55
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,096
We saw it last week

56
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:46,400
A couple of new stories about

57
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:48,448
Service called iot inspector

58
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:49,984
Everything about this

59
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:52,544
I realize that we'd actually talked about this

60
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,592
Almost a year ago we had a

61
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:56,640
Nick feamster over at Princeton

62
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:58,432
He and I talked about this

63
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,968
Program called iot inspector

64
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:03,040
An idea was he wanted to build something

65
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:07,136
That would monitor the iot devices on a user's Network

66
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:08,928
And see how they behave

67
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:10,976
And lo and behold

68
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,000
Last week

69
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:13,536
He launched

70
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:14,304
That app

71
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:16,096
So this is a

72
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:16,864
Princeton

73
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:18,144
Research project

74
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:24,288
Basically so when you download this to see how your devices Behavior also going to be in sharing that device data

75
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,568
With the research

76
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:33,504
It is important to know if anybody does plan to use it Princeton does list all of the data that i r t s

77
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,272
Spectre collect

78
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:36,320
It's actually a lengthy list

79
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:37,344
I don't

80
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:42,720
Think I would person be concerned about it but if you're not willing to share any of that information

81
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,768
Certainly this is not something you want to run

82
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,560
Well actually

83
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:48,096
You can delete

84
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:48,864
All of your day

85
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:51,680
At the end so you could just for yourself

86
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:52,704
And then you could

87
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:54,496
But

88
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:55,520
It's nice of you

89
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:57,056
If you don't have qualms about it

90
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,336
This is the sort of

91
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:01,408
Third-party research that is hopefully going to

92
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,176
24 scumpa

93
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,200
I needs to be better

94
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:06,528
You can fight it iot - Inspector.

95
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,296
Princeton

96
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,064
. EDU

97
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,856
I downloaded it

98
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,904
And had it running for a while

99
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,672
Meister

100
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,280
Now I'm going to tell you my network is a little wacky right now because I am

101
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,559
In the midst of the moving

102
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:20,607
Time dismantling all of my iot device

103
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,143
So not everything is

104
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,167
Giving data

105
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,959
But the things that are

106
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:26,239
Giving data or actually

107
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:28,031
That's a pretty good devices on my

108
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,055
On my network

109
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,079
Believe it or not

110
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,359
They're good actors

111
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,383
They are good at

112
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:33,663
So

113
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:36,223
Many of them such as some of the

114
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,247
The better actors

115
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,015
Where's that I see so

116
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,807
So far my Nest Thermostat

117
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,599
That behaves very well

118
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:45,951
Talking about encryption we're talking about not going weird places on the internet

119
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:48,767
Amazon Echo is actually doing

120
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,815
Pretty well and so is my Roku

121
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:51,839
So

122
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:52,607
Who knew

123
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,887
I would love to see my

124
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,935
Google devices but unfortunately May

125
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:57,983
Family unplugged

126
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:00,287
Okay

127
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:04,127
Well they're not sending any data that's the good news

128
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:07,199
Some things that are a little bit trouble

129
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,479
Not Troublesome but

130
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,527
Not user-friendly

131
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,575
The things that this program

132
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,111
Picks up

133
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,135
They're not labeled

134
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:18,463
So like for me to figure out that my August video doorbell

135
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:19,743
Was listed on

136
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,023
I'm here I had to go and see

137
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:23,583
What that particular mystery device was talking

138
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:24,863
The fact that I was talking

139
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:27,423
Into august.com at Rackspace CDN

140
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,191
And some other

141
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,215
Video sites

142
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:30,751
That's my dawg

143
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,031
So there is that

144
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:34,335
It is hard to tell this is not like

145
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,103
Odoo user

146
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:35,871
Most user

147
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:39,711
And some of my iot devices such as my wink

148
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:41,759
Carmi Ikea tradfri Gateway

149
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:44,063
Those are labeled as non iot

150
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,135
And if it thinks

151
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,415
That something is a

152
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:50,975
A phone or a tablet it actually doesn't

153
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:53,023
Collect the data you need on it

154
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,327
So you have to enter the MAC address of these divide

155
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,095
Spices

156
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,631
To get it to download

157
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,679
Which is kind of frustrating

158
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:09,919
It is but I can understand why they took that approach it as there's a lot of a lot more personal information on people's phones and

159
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,711
What so if they don't want to

160
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:13,759
Cross that line and I totally respect that

161
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,807
Yes but as a warning

162
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,367
Do all of you guys were like yes I totally wanted

163
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:21,183
I do this you're probably going to want to you know have the Mac

164
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,487
Prefer some of your hub

165
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:25,535
Devices that most of the ones that

166
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:26,559
It seems to think

167
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,327
ARROW computers

168
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,607
Are hubs

169
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:30,911
And in one case there's a thermostat that is

170
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,959
Homekit enabled so I'm not sure if it's

171
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:34,495
Homekit functionality that

172
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:36,799
That seems to be a common denominator here

173
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,615
I've got a couple devices that are using

174
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,383
Weekend

175
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,151
Scription butt

176
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:46,783
Actually I was surprised out of the 31 devices I have only 5 or using week or no in crib

177
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,319
So

178
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,087
Yay

179
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:57,279
No that's good that's very good to me then everybody smart home is different so obviously your results will vary if you use this but

180
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,327
It's nice that this is

181
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,631
The types of information that says checking

182
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:02,655
Such as

183
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:05,471
Who is contact who are the devices

184
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,751
Pinging servers

185
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:08,031
Vagina is itchy

186
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:10,335
In the middle of nowhere or is it where you would expect

187
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,895
How much data is exchanged

188
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:15,711
Between the devices and how often

189
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:20,063
I think it looks for hard-coded passwords and such to but I'm not a hundred percent sure

190
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,343
Well we will get Shore

191
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,391
Because next week's guest is actually go

192
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,439
When are the creators of

193
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,999
So we'll get a lot

194
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,023
Information on

195
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:35,423
What does is going to be used for so if you're a little uncertain you're like how I don't know if I want to download this yet until I really know I'm doing good in the world

196
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:36,959
Think you can wait

197
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:37,727
And

198
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:38,495
We will

199
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,519
Put that question

200
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,287
2

201
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,567
Danny who is one

202
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,591
The creators

203
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:48,991
And if you don't want to wait because right now this is only available for Mac OS

204
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,807
It is coming to Linux and coming to Windows

205
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:55,391
So you can sign up for waitlist if you're on either of those platforms

206
00:07:55,647 --> 00:08:00,767
Or if you like me I just noticed that the source code is available written in Python

207
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,559
And I might put it together

208
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,095
Linux and

209
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,119
See if I can get a ride

210
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:08,959
The folks over at Prince

211
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:14,079
NFL say hey great let's give us that and we'll just Distributing

212
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,871
Make a cake

213
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:17,663
All right

214
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,455
So that's how you can monitor

215
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,735
What devices are

216
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,015
Baby

217
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,807
Giving up some of your privacy and

218
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,111
Security on your own network

219
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:31,743
Let's talk about the loss of privacy in everyday life the New York Times has been doing a story

220
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,535
Are series on privacy

221
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,327
Rio Tierra

222
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,375
Alternatively like

223
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,655
Excited me because

224
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:40,191
It's great coverage and enrage me

225
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,215
Because it's stupid

226
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:42,751
So

227
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,543
One of the better stories though

228
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,311
Was

229
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:46,847
Basically

230
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,383
Reporters at the New York Times

231
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,663
Accessed

232
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:52,223
Publicly available webcams in the city

233
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:54,015
And then they ran

234
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,039
That

235
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,831
Data that they had

236
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:57,599
Against

237
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:00,159
They used Amazon's recognition

238
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:03,743
Facial recognition service and they pulled photos from

239
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:08,095
The websites of offices around the places where the cameras were

240
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,119
And then

241
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,911
They were able to identify someone

242
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:11,935
People walking around

243
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:15,263
As you said they looked at

244
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:20,895
Public data public photos that were available on the web of people that may be in the area supposed to be

245
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,687
People who worked in the area

246
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:23,967
So it's not like they

247
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,503
You know we're spying

248
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,527
Were using

249
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:29,087
Photo is that working illegally to

250
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,135
Train the model of work yet

251
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,695
Actual results here

252
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:34,719
Rates

253
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:35,487
If it's

254
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:38,303
This is all publicly available photos

255
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:40,095
Tied to the recognition system

256
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:43,167
Across from 60 bucks to do this for a day

257
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:43,935
And

258
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,727
Yeah they recognize actual people

259
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,007
And even talk to her

260
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,335
Who was actually on his way to an appointment to meet a

261
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,359
Job candidate

262
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,383
Tencent

263
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,943
So the way I look at this is

264
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:55,711
There's a couple

265
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:59,551
Personally I look at this and I'm like hey

266
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,087
If someone has my photo

267
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:04,671
They can actually use a service like this

268
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,951
Pull camera data

269
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,743
From all over the place just to see if they

270
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,535
That's not crazy

271
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:10,559
And

272
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:13,119
As someone who's had a stalker in the fartist

273
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,399
To pass the scariest

274
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:20,287
And even if you think about governments have access to our

275
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:21,567
Face

276
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,359
Because they have our passports and

277
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,639
Driver's license

278
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,919
A lot of our drivers license

279
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:28,991
Data is now our face and our names are tied together

280
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,271
Database

281
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:32,063
There's a new standard of driver's license

282
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:37,695
So if you imagine law enforcement being able to use the sort of service

283
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,463
Manhunt

284
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:42,559
Is it if there's a serial killer on the loose

285
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,327
Yay

286
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:46,143
They're just tracking like a dissident

287
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,423
Oh that's real nice

288
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:49,983
It really makes the surveillance State cheap

289
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,007
Inaccessible to

290
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:52,543
More and more people and

291
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:53,823
It also

292
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:59,711
Makes it cheap and accessible to just anyone who wants to find out where you are like maybe your boss is like

293
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:01,503
Where they really sick

294
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:04,575
That's kind of where I was going this is not something that

295
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,599
Is

296
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:07,135
Difficult to do

297
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:09,951
It is easily accessible both be public

298
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:14,047
Photos liked an image search for me to be a hundred photo serum Shore

299
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,327
And then using

300
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:19,423
Amazon service or any any similar service they want to pin this on Amazon of course

301
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:22,239
As well as publicly available cameras and

302
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:27,103
A New York City and it listen I know when I can have been over to London there's cameras everywhere so I know there

303
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:29,663
Regions of the world where this is already commonplace

304
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:32,479
But I'm in New York City in Atlanta's link

305
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:36,575
NYC kiosks which I used to use all the time there were there wi-fi kiosks

306
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:38,367
Better up and down

307
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,159
Various parts of Manhattan

308
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:45,791
They all have two security cameras on those when you add in the actual traffic cams that are New York City you have access to light

309
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,839
3000 cameras

310
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:48,607
In

311
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:49,631
New York City

312
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,167
Dying at 2

313
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,703
Publicly available photos

314
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,007
I'm probably pretty easy to track when I go to New York City

315
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,311
I'm so anybody could really do this

316
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:58,847
Oh yeah

317
00:11:59,103 --> 00:11:59,615
And

318
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,383
Again

319
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,663
The stalking issue

320
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:04,223
Government surveillance is scary

321
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,247
And I'm definitely

322
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,271
We concerned about that

323
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,319
Imagine using it to profile pic

324
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,087
People who

325
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,879
Are in the ice databases

326
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:12,415
Sure

327
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:14,719
Or in just think about all the mistakes that cover

328
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:15,743
Hornets make rate

329
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:18,047
The people who are on the no-fly list without

330
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,327
Recourse you know when

331
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,375
I got their life turns into a pain

332
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,655
Imagine something

333
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:23,935
Like a government era

334
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,215
Apply to some

335
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:25,983
Something like this

336
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:31,871
Suddenly you're being monitored all the time by the government may be without any sort of due process

337
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:35,455
You don't have to match I just talked to anybody lives in China right now

338
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,735
And I say that because

339
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:39,039
We've covered what's going on over there with the

340
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:42,623
Cameras in the social scores and so on and so forth but

341
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:47,743
One of my classmates lived in China for 20 years and she's been in the US for the last five

342
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,279
We had a lengthy discussion

343
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,303
Over all of that

344
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,839
What's going on over there

345
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:54,143
The stories that you told me were scary

346
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,471
She's very careful how she speaks to her parents over

347
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:00,287
Video chat from the US to China I mean it's

348
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:03,359
Really scary so you don't have to imagine it just look what's going on there

349
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,943
Yeah that's my very inarticulate

350
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:07,711
The cravory

351
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:10,527
And I do think we need some pushback

352
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,551
On the legislation

353
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,855
I hate when people are like it's too late

354
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:16,415
Like no it's not too late it is getting late

355
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:17,951
Don't get me wrong

356
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,999
The horse has run out of the barn

357
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,023
We can still

358
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:21,791
I'll pick some up

359
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,839
But that won't happen anytime soon

360
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:25,375
Illinois

361
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:31,775
I know it's rather convenient that they were just looking at the keep Internet devices SAFE Act

362
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:35,359
The Illinois state senate they passed this act on April 10th

363
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:38,431
And basically it's a bill that would ban internet

364
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:40,991
Device manufacturers from collecting audio

365
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:41,759
From

366
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,295
Internet-connected devices

367
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:45,599
But without disclosing it to Consumers

368
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:50,463
Do seem to have a lot of teeth and there's a $50,000 fine and so on so forth

369
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:52,767
But the actual bill DACA

370
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,559
Past has a lot less

371
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,327
Teeth

372
00:13:55,583 --> 00:14:00,191
And that's mainly because of two companies that were familiar with Amazon and Google

373
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,215
Who

374
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:01,983
Where

375
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,007
Kind of against it

376
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:07,359
Because why well they've got their neck microphones all over the place

377
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,663
People dying left and right so

378
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:10,943
Will said

379
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,223
You had to disclose if they

380
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,039
Yay

381
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:17,855
Creative penalties for accidental

382
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,135
Activations

383
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,159
In required

384
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,951
Companies to explain what happened

385
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,487
And I can't Jackson

386
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:29,119
When suddenly you're sitting there and the TVs on or maybe don't say anything and all of a sudden Madame a pops

387
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:32,191
The weather in Kazakhstan is

388
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:34,751
Is cold

389
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,823
Yes

390
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:41,663
You write an n and I've had Phantom digital assistant

391
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:46,015
Answers to questions I did not ask from time to time and it always makes me wonder but

392
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:47,807
You know

393
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:51,647
Certainly advocate for Consumer privacy

394
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:52,927
And controls

395
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:55,487
I also understand that

396
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:58,047
The technology is not perfect and some things are just

397
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:00,095
Gosh darn it honest glitches

398
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,631
But there are times when

399
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:08,543
These things are getting hacked and people are listening to us when they shouldn't be well and I don't know if companies are necessarily

400
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:11,615
Putting in place the right practices to protect our privacy

401
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,919
We just found out that

402
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:15,199
There's a team of

403
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:17,247
Oaks at Amazon that

404
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,527
Listening on

405
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:19,551
Summit

406
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:20,831
It's a small percentage

407
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:23,647
On the flip side

408
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,671
It takes the

409
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:25,951
Voice utterances and

410
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:26,719
Tries to

411
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:29,023
Warped the the audio so you can't tell

412
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,303
Who it is Amazon just

413
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,631
You need some sort of human accountability

414
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,935
Right humans have two

415
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:37,215
Check and make sure

416
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:37,983
Birthday is

417
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,031
Health Canada

418
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,615
But you know are there ways you can do it with

419
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:44,895
With more respect

420
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,175
People whose

421
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,711
Voice Taylor you're using problem

422
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:52,319
Yeah and I wonder I'm sure this wasn't the primary impetus of this

423
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:55,647
We spoke a few weeks ago about Google moving

424
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,951
Natural language processing to the edge

425
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:58,975
On devices

426
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:00,767
Supposed to being connected and sending it

427
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,047
To the cloud all the time

428
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:05,119
That's kind of like a benefit in my book that

429
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,655
They're gaining a little bit of

430
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:12,543
Saying hey you know not everything is going in the cloud anymore your data is local and more protected as a result

431
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:17,151
It gives them a chance to say that although again I don't think that was the reason I think the reason was

432
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:23,551
To enable more functionality when you don't have internet access and get more people using the service doesn't feel comfortable with them so

433
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:24,575
All right

434
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:25,599
That's all about connect

435
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,647
Let's talk about until which

436
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:30,463
Is disconnecting from its modem business

437
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:33,023
It's actually

438
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,583
It's exiting is 5G smartphone

439
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,143
Modem business and then it will evaluate

440
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,679
Its modem business

441
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,447
4

442
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,727
PCS

443
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:43,263
Iot devices and

444
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:46,847
Also in line with this

445
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:49,151
These two stories are definitely related

446
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,687
Qualcomm and Apple

447
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,223
Settled their big

448
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:52,991
Licensing

449
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:53,759
Lawsuit

450
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:57,087
These are related because Qualcomm is basically

451
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,135
Should I say the best the only

452
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:02,207
The de facto standard when it comes to mobile modem

453
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:04,255
There you go that was good

454
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,279
The Defector

455
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:08,607
And Intel got into this business and

456
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,143
We heard a lot

457
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:14,495
Years ago when Intel got into this business and started actually producing these modems

458
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:16,287
We heard that they weren't very good

459
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:18,591
And my hunch is

460
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:21,151
Apple ended up settling with Qualcomm

461
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,431
Because they realize that

462
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:24,991
They're going to Intel's not producing of Iowa

463
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,015
Basically

464
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:28,319
So they're just going to have to suck it up

465
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,343
Continue working

466
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:31,647
I think that's part of it

467
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:33,695
Intel modems actually have

468
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:36,511
Improved and certainly not to the standard of a

469
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,815
Qualcomm modem but the most recent iPhones

470
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:41,375
Some models do you use the Intel modem

471
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,655
So Apple at least

472
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:43,679
Had enough

473
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:45,215
Faith in the product to

474
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:46,495
You know actually use them

475
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:47,775
But there was also talk

476
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:49,567
Recently about until being

477
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,871
Further behind on developing its 5

478
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:52,639
Cheap modem

479
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:53,919
Then Qualcomm

480
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,479
That put a pelota

481
00:17:56,735 --> 00:18:00,831
I guess across roads like what we going to do here if we rely on them as a supplier

482
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:03,391
So I think they wanted to just go with

483
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:05,183
Call Camas results

484
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:08,511
It was just easier to settle and I don't know the settlement terms

485
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:09,535
But

486
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,071
I believe it dropped all

487
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:14,655
Lawsuits there must be some money changing hands or some deal that says

488
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:17,727
We will use you as a primary modem supplier

489
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:20,287
Going forward for at least X number of years so

490
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,311
Yeah no

491
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,383
Twenty-something Tyler lights

492
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:26,175
Versus a $7

493
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,455
Licensing a so

494
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,991
My hunch is they

495
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,271
Damn it in the middle somewhere

496
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:31,295
Tia

497
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:33,087
Probably

498
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:38,719
But again it from Mobile standpoint we don't care as much for the show but Intel seems out of that business

499
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:40,511
What does it mean for Intel

500
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:43,583
Connectivity in smaller devices iot devices

501
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:47,679
They're going to look into it my gut says they're just going to exit this Market entirely

502
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:54,335
Because until it's finally after years and years of dominating so many

503
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,359
Key markets

504
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,127
Dave

505
00:18:56,639 --> 00:19:01,503
Had a lot of frustration against the smaller upstarts and I wouldn't call arm small I was sleep but

506
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:03,551
Talk on being an arm licensee

507
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:08,415
I think they finally realized we have to pick and choose our battles a little bit more carefully

508
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,487
And yeah this is

509
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:14,303
Fun battle in Intel's gotten out of some of the iot

510
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,327
The smaller iot

511
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,095
Teechips in

512
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,655
So it does make sense

513
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:19,679
Kind of sad

514
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:21,471
And I don't know why I was never really

515
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:27,871
Sold on this I mean Intel had its a scale business way back in the day that was arm-based and they got rid of that

516
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,663
It really double down on

517
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:30,431
The current

518
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,199
Conjecture

519
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:33,759
I see a lot more promise with Intel in there

520
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:35,551
Fpga business

521
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:40,671
The one thing I will say they do seem to be with movidius doing a lot with

522
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:42,975
Inference at the edge

523
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:45,791
Anti revisionism

524
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:48,351
That's not the radio side that's a processor side

525
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:50,399
So we'll probably still see them

526
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:51,423
There really were

527
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,471
That makes sense they should really

528
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,543
Hey speaking of

529
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,311
Computer vision

530
00:19:59,359 --> 00:19:59,871
Apple

531
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:01,407
Apple apple apple

532
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:03,455
I still don't hate apples going to build

533
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:06,015
Car but it's clear to me that at the very least

534
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:11,135
Apple wants to be the platform that an autonomous vehicle runs on at some point in the future

535
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:14,207
They have been investing and lidar

536
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:17,279
Technology with their own internal groups

537
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,303
But

538
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,911
According to Reuters they have held talks with four companies are at least four companies

539
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:24,703
As possible suppliers for

540
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:27,263
Next-gen lidar sensors so

541
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:32,639
I'm not sure what their overall strategy is I still think it's to be the platform in up the vehicle

542
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:36,991
Per say not not a Tesla they're taking their time getting there for sure

543
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:39,807
But that's typical Apple will wait till everybody else

544
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:41,599
Enters the market and then will come in with a

545
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:42,367
Better product

546
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:43,391
And

547
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:44,927
Hopefully everybody will buy it

548
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:48,511
Everybody being used

549
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,071
Correct

550
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:52,095
Correct in this case

551
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:52,863
Is correct

552
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:58,239
You don't seem too enthused though that was a kind of a half-hearted yeah this whole area is so

553
00:20:58,495 --> 00:20:59,775
Up in the air speaking of

554
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:00,799
Wavo

555
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:01,823
They have an app

556
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:04,127
And we might be excited because like

557
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:06,175
Maybe it's not going to be the car manufacturer

558
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:08,223
Maybe it's going to be these weird

559
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:11,551
Third-party Transportation providers for self-driving cars

560
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:12,575
And

561
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:13,599
I don't I don't

562
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,623
So Weymouth

563
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:18,976
You can get it you can get it right now on the Google Play Store

564
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:23,840
And still unless you live in the Phoenix Metro area it really doesn't do you a bit of good

565
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:24,608
But

566
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:25,888
It suggests that

567
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:27,680
Or alphabets waymo division

568
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:31,264
Is ready to start expanding Beyond its test area

569
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:36,384
In the Phoenix Metro area so that's a yay I guess depending on where they roll it out

570
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:40,992
I did not install the app but I saw the screenshots and I don't see any mention of

571
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:41,760
Cost of a

572
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:42,528
Arrived

573
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:43,808
0

574
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:44,832
I don't get that

575
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:49,184
You know who does have driverless cars

576
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:51,488
Baidu

577
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,536
And this makes a lot of sense for me the US Army

578
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:54,816
They actually have

579
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:58,656
I wouldn't call him self-driving cars are more like self-driving

580
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:00,960
Trucks that would deliver supplies

581
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:02,752
People food and other supplies in

582
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:03,520
Combat zone

583
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:06,080
That makes total sense I mean why have

584
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:09,408
Why run the risk of injury to somebody or a group of people

585
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:11,968
You're deploying supplies in a Battlefield

586
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:14,272
When you can just have a self-driving

587
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:16,576
Filled with supplies handle it for you

588
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:19,392
I think it's selling some wonderful they're moving quickly on this

589
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:21,952
They demonstrated their first 10

590
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,256
Down to your way Fort Bliss Texas

591
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:27,328
And they have 60 additional trucks

592
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:30,144
Planning to be deployed it to other US military bases

593
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,424
Over the next year

594
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,472
They're on bases

595
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:38,848
It will be nice if they didn't have any combat to tuipulotu but yes

596
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:39,616
Yes

597
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,432
Get rid of the entire defense system

598
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:43,456
And poo

599
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:45,760
Yay

600
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,808
All right let's do some quick news bits

601
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:52,160
I've actually been looking into certifications I'm going to take my

602
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:53,696
Google Cloud

603
00:22:54,464 --> 00:23:00,608
Developer associate certification test in a month or two but I just realized today that you can

604
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:01,632
Also be

605
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:02,656
A certified

606
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:04,960
Madame a skill Builder

607
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:09,824
So if you want to pad your resume and you like building meta mage skills

608
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,896
You can take a test to be a certified skill Builder

609
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,968
Speaking of other developments

610
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,504
AI

611
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:22,624
Has actually created a brand new sport that you yes you can play

612
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:27,744
The game is called speedgate I'll talk about the game in a second but what's really interesting is

613
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,280
How this was created

614
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:31,072
A group of

615
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:32,096
Developers

616
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:36,448
Akqa which is a global Innovation agency

617
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:38,752
Has trained a neural network

618
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:40,032
By feeding it

619
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:43,616
Information on over 400 traditional Sports

620
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:45,152
And the AI came out

621
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,688
With a sport called

622
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:49,248
It looks really cool

623
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:52,832
It's got a ball very similar to what rugby has

624
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:55,648
You kicking pass that ball kind of like

625
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:56,928
Rugby & Soccer

626
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,464
There is no

627
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:03,328
Kicking hitting biting scratching her than like that allow thank you AI for that

628
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,144
Basically there are three sets of gates

629
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,448
On the field that the AI develops

630
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:09,472
You kick

631
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:11,520
Or pass the ball through the center gate

632
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:12,544
Which lets you then

633
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,104
Score you would then have possession to score

634
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,384
In the end gate

635
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:20,992
I wish you can do this by throwing or kicking the rug be blackballed

636
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:24,064
There are three forwards and three Defenders on every team

637
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:26,880
And I think it's kind of cool there's a whole speedgate

638
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:28,928
Website where you can see the

639
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:33,024
Rules the field and you can say I want spaghetti in my community in

640
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,304
I don't think this will be the next

641
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,608
Sport of America on TV but

642
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:37,376
It looks like fun

643
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:42,752
When you go

644
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:46,080
Only four more people

645
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:49,408
Yes we can go tell him about it

646
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:50,176
Okay

647
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,200
Play Quidditch

648
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:51,968
Is a

649
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:53,504
Sometimes sponsor the show

650
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:59,904
They have their own code lock which is there wi-fi lock and now it works with the ring doorbell so when people come

651
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,672
Senior ring

652
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:01,440
You can

653
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:02,464
Unlock your lock

654
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:03,488
Write 4 with

655
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:04,256
Open the app

656
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:06,048
Cool

657
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:08,352
And mortifications are always good

658
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:09,888
Yes

659
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:10,912
I'd love to see that with

660
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:12,704
Other doorbells I know she likes Ben

661
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:14,240
With Amazon for their Amazon

662
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:15,008
Key programmer

663
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,544
I assume this is an outlet

664
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,312
Play or something like that

665
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:19,616
It is this is Amazon key

666
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:20,640
As someone who

667
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:21,664
Does not have

668
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:22,688
Ring doorbell

669
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:23,712
Right now I have an August

670
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:27,296
If I had a nest doorbell which is the next

671
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,320
Doorbell I will have

672
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:29,600
Ben

673
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:30,624
Love for that

674
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,392
To work together

675
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:32,672
One day I will

676
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:35,232
Question actually this week

677
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,768
Not for me

678
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:40,352
Loser hotline this was a email question about reading openhab

679
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:41,376
Or home assistant

680
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:43,168
We had someone who wanted to run it

681
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:44,448
In the cloud so

682
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:45,216
Kevin

683
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:48,800
Can I answer that question on our blog but we also wanted to talk about it

684
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,896
Yeah for those who aren't familiar openhab and homeassistant are

685
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:55,712
Localized open source

686
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:59,552
Smart home platforms so if you want like total control over everything

687
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:02,112
And you're a DIY person you can do this with

688
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:04,416
Like a $35 Raspberry Pi

689
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:05,440
What

690
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:07,744
This was an interesting question because

691
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:14,144
The person who wrote inside is there an easy way to set up a site-to-site VPN to Azure or AWS or I presume Google Play

692
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:14,912
The platform YouTube

693
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:16,192
Didn't mention that one

694
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:17,472
And host my

695
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:23,872
Containers in the cloud that way I could host them and compare them easily until I get a final solution to run

696
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:24,640
Locally

697
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:26,176
I love that idea

698
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:31,296
Because yeah I mean you got to set up Ally systems and spend time to figuring them and

699
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:32,832
By the time you set it all up your kind like

700
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:37,184
It's good enough I'm not going to try the other system cuz I don't have to have more hours to figure this all out but

701
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:39,488
It's actually quite easy to do this

702
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:40,768
With openhab

703
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:43,072
It is not so easy if I can

704
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:45,120
Find a way to do it with home assistant

705
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:46,912
And the main reason is

706
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:51,008
Homeassistant they don't believe in the cloud as a

707
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,032
Smart Home

708
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:53,312
Platform I guess

709
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,592
They have a nice

710
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:56,896
Blog posts that I've liked you in my post

711
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:59,712
Basically saying you know the clouds magical it's great

712
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:01,504
But if it

713
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,040
Breaks down

714
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:06,368
Your house should be able to continue functioning so

715
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:11,488
It's really an extension of your smart home not running your smart home is what they say so I get why I could not find

716
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:13,024
Home assistant in the cloud

717
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:16,352
Openhab know you could do it and you can do with containers if you

718
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:19,936
I want to set up a Docker container that are easy to follow instructions

719
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:21,728
Do you want to set it up yourself

720
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:24,544
Command lines I found tutorials and

721
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:31,200
Most of them are on AWS but the same principles apply to say Google Cloud platform on Microsoft azure

722
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:33,248
You pretty much have to set up a

723
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:36,832
Computing instance very low power you don't need any massive witch

724
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:39,904
Your cost increase as you add more resources to the cloud

725
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:41,440
Set everything up in

726
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,464
You you could do it

727
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,000
I'd say just bite the bullet

728
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:46,560
It's been 35 bucks on a Raspberry Pi

729
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:47,584
Even if

730
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:48,608
You

731
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:52,960
Don't use it for this long-term there's so many things you can do with a pie so that's just me

732
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:54,752
I would do that as opposed to

733
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,544
Running in the cloud and entering

734
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,568
Some cost

735
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:59,616
Although you can get a free 2-year free

736
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:01,408
Trial of these Cloud products

737
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:04,480
I cycle with the pie but yes you can do with it with that

738
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:08,320
Copart

739
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:09,088
Okay

740
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:11,392
And I promise you guys a

741
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,440
Discussion of iot industrial security

742
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:14,208
Because

743
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:14,976
Bossman

744
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:16,768
From the middle of March

745
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,560
We all heard about

746
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:19,840
In aluminum

747
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:21,376
Company called norsk Hydro

748
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:28,032
What happened is they had ransomware that infected their systems and shut them down costing them up to 41

749
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:29,056
Million dollars

750
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:29,824
Is pretty bad

751
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:36,480
And a company called cyberex which does industrial iot security they published a blog post about the ransomware

752
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:37,248
Which is called

753
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,528
Locker Goga

754
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:40,064
Basically talking about

755
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,344
What it is

756
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:44,672
Or what they think it is cuz we don't have a full post

757
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:49,536
So what they did is they now can identify Locker go go

758
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:52,352
And they talked about how

759
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:53,632
Attack

760
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:56,960
So what they think happened

761
00:28:57,216 --> 00:29:00,544
Was the attackers gain access to the system

762
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:02,848
Through an exposed remote

763
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:04,384
Connection so I can RDP

764
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:07,968
They also likely use stolen credentials or they did it

765
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:08,992
Password at

766
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:11,296
The stolen credentials if they stole them

767
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:13,344
In a lot of the Industrial

768
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:14,880
Hacking attacks

769
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:16,672
What cyber axes

770
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:17,952
David Arch tour

771
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:19,488
This week was that

772
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,304
A lot of times they're getting those passwords

773
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,864
From contractor so third-party contract

774
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:30,240
The IT world is pretty familiar with this after the Sony hack which happened because

775
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:32,032
The attackers got access

776
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:32,800
Through third-party

777
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:34,336
Contractors to Sony's

778
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:35,104
Computer system

779
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,640
So I think a lot of

780
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:40,480
Corporate it Department separately Earth with this but maybe not a lot of

781
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:41,504
Industrial

782
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:43,552
Companies and there's a lot of sharing have

783
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,392
Not only are there 3rd party contractors that you might share

784
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:49,184
Files and data width and let the money

785
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,208
Corporate Network

786
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:53,280
A lot of times those people can actually come on your OT

787
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:56,096
Your operational Tech Network that isn't even connected to

788
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:57,120
Internet

789
00:29:57,632 --> 00:30:01,728
So those guys might come in and plug their laptops directly into like some equipment so they

790
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:02,752
Can diagnose something

791
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:05,056
Wrong in that case that's when the mall

792
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:06,848
On your OT Network

793
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:10,688
This is a big problem it shuts down Manufacturing

794
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,248
Cuz like safety issues can cause a

795
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,272
A lot of problems

796
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:16,320
And it is becoming more

797
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:18,368
Common because manufacturers

798
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:20,928
Because it is so expensive to shutdown a Manufacturing

799
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:22,976
They will pay rental

800
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:26,048
That makes them a delicious Target

801
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:28,864
In addition cybrex found that the

802
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,192
Rental car here actually increased in sophistication

803
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:33,728
Over a few months

804
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:36,544
So earlier versions of the software were not as good

805
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:40,384
And they saw that there was plenty of food that have been

806
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,688
Adapted basically to make it a little bit more

807
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:43,712
A little bit better

808
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:45,248
We're not going to get too into the weeds here

809
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:46,528
So

810
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:48,832
Basically this points to the sophistication

811
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:50,368
The growing sophistication

812
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:51,136
Attack

813
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:57,024
It also highlights what I would say is a key

814
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:00,352
Best practice if you're going to bring contractors in

815
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:03,168
Which many many companies do for very good reason

816
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:04,960
They should be

817
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:05,984
Given

818
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:08,800
A corporate-owned device

819
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:09,824
That has been

820
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:13,152
You know found to be clean and clear

821
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:14,432
Sanitizer

822
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:17,248
I'd rather than using maybe their own devices and such which

823
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,576
You know you if you've brought in a potential bad actor by allowing

824
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:26,208
Non manage devices on to your network for good reason you brought them in but still that doesn't justify it

825
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,488
So they mean

826
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:30,048
Particular software for Diagnostics and such but

827
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:33,632
That should be worked out in advance and that should be added to the managed

828
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:34,400
Devices

829
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:37,984
And make sure that they are clean and then that's at the shouldn't be

830
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,776
Using their own devices to connect to network

831
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:41,312
Or two devices

832
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,896
Yeah and I will say in the industrial world

833
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:47,968
Companies like Honeywell and Emerson have done a lot of work with me

834
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:50,272
Like USB drive so they will inspect

835
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:51,808
USB drives

836
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,856
There are devices on the factory

837
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,392
Plug in your us

838
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:56,928
Ensure device

839
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,488
Shoot a text anyting it shuts it

840
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:01,024
Can't use it

841
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,304
So maybe

842
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,072
Given

843
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:05,888
How highly specific some of the software is and how

844
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:07,424
Proprietary it is

845
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:10,496
If you could have some sort of help scan

846
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:11,264
Other device

847
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,032
Before it gets in

848
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:16,896
And the other solution which obviously cybrex is promoting

849
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:17,920
Because they are in network

850
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:19,200
Work monitoring solution

851
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:21,504
Is to have some sort of

852
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:24,064
Awareness of what's traversing your network

853
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:29,440
And there are tons of companies not just cybrex doing this but it is becoming increasingly important

854
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:34,048
How do I coyote inspector for the home

855
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,840
I was just going to say that

856
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:36,608
Full circle

857
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:39,424
Dunedin and the industrial version of that

858
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:40,448

Diggy

882
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:30,368
Thinking is a really terrible way to do this but what this device does is it connect to SmartThings Hub and

883
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:31,648
Your alarm panel

884
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,440
It's a very much a DIY Thing

885

Very cool

889

Try this and play with it

This week's question is from

893
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:52,896
Scott

894
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:56,992
Hi Stacy and Kevin this is Scott in Houston

895
00:33:57,504 --> 00:34:01,088
I have a question regarding smart locks which I've been researching

896
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:02,112
Quite some time

897
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:05,440
Is there any such thing as a double cylinder

898
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:06,464
Smart Lock

899
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:12,352
I noticed the sealant single-cylinder smart locks but I would like to have a double cylinder Smart Lock

900
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:13,376
Security

901
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:16,448
And yes this can be used online

902
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,472
Thank you

903
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:20,288
Okay Scott this is actually pretty easy answer

904
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:26,432
Because right now these things don't exist and they don't exist because most modern building codes don't allow

905
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:27,968
Double cylinder

906
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:30,784
These are locks for those of you or not

907
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,064
Two player that need to be

908
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,136
Unlocked with a key from both the inside and the outside

909
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:42,048
The reason people tend to gravitate to them is because they are concerned about someone like breaking a window and then reaching in

910
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:42,816
Hainan opening up the

911
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,120
And then getting access to

912
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,680
My in-laws actually had these locks

913
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:48,448
For a long time

914
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,496
And I had nightmares about the

915
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:51,520
I'm dying in fires

916
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:53,312
Because they never knew where the keys were in

917
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:54,080
It was such a pain

918
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:55,360
So

919
00:34:55,616 --> 00:35:00,992
In the case of a connected lock if you had a keypad on both sides that might actually

920
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:03,552
Address some of the issues in the sense that

921
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:05,344
If you don't know the keypad you can unlock

922
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:07,648
Leave in a few

923
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:12,768
Broken Window you couldn't get in because you wouldn't know the combinations cuz if you knew the combination you would bring the window

924
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,048
But it does

925
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:18,400
There's still the issue of if you need to get out what if you're a guest in the house if you don't know the cam

926
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:19,168
Combination

927
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,192
How do you get

928
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,008
Or the batteries go out on the

929
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:23,776
Lock

930
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:27,360
Yeah it still has a safety concern issue there

931
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:29,664
I don't I don't love her

932
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:35,808
Yeah I mean some people I know I wouldn't mind locking them in their house but no in general now

933
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,648
I'd be shocked if a manufacturer came out with a just because the

934
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,952
Building codes have moved away from this

935
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:42,976
No

936
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:46,816
And Manuel Roxas

937
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:51,424
But nobody makes a smart one right now

938
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:56,032
There you go Scott

939
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:58,848
Alright that concludes this week's News segment

Dorothy Wacker and crazy devices

945
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:13,696
That he's found connected on corporate Networks

946
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:14,976
Could pose problems

947
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:21,632
Plus we're going to talk about Bradley industrial & Enterprise iot security

948
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:28,032
Hey everyone we are taking a quick break from The Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor this week sponsor

949
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:31,104
Where is software Ag and I have Mark Olsen

950
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,640

And business Process Management

963
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:06,176
Specifically to iot

964
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:10,528
Varsity is a iot device application platform

965
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,320
To connect and manage

966
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:13,856
Advise or advice

967

Focus and strategy is around

973
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:34,336
Three areas OEM

974
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:37,920
Horizontal invitations to specific use cases

975
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:41,504

977
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,928
Okay that's awesome so we're here today to talk about how

978
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:49,696
Companies

979
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:51,488
Succeed in the iot

980
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:52,768
What do you recommend

981
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:54,048
First

982
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:58,144
Define the use case of business value at the start of your iot journey

983
00:37:58,656 --> 00:37:59,168
Second

984
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:02,752
Think about integration and devops Alignment from the Inception

985
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:03,776
Of your project

986
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:04,800
3rd

987
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:07,872
Think about driving intelligence and insights

988
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:09,152
To the edge

989
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:12,736
Or device is extremely important achieve automation

990
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:14,272
And real business value

991
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:15,296
And finally

992
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:17,344
Extending Cloud platforms

993
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,928
With sdks really means a long and costly development cycle

994
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:23,232
And time to value in terms of years

995
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:24,256
Depending on the

996
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:25,024
Specific use case

997
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:27,072
Those are some pretty big pitfalls

998
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:29,888
How does software AG help you solve those

999
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:36,544
Out of the box Camellia city of delivering commoditize 85% of the technical requirements components to deliver

Companies in the world

1006
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:52,160
Software AG provides

1007
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:53,440
Solution accelerator

1008
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:54,464
To achieve

1009
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,000
The remaining 50%

1010
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:57,792
Against your particular use case

1011
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,608
Multi-tenancy is offered out of the box

1012
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:01,376

1013
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:02,656
Support for devops

1014
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:03,680
Hello I'm into it

1015
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:05,216
Additional plugins

1016

Is measured in a matter of days weeks

1020
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:13,664
If not

1021
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,432
A month

1022
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:19,552
Awesome and Mark where can I go to learn more about software Ag and cumulus

1023
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:26,208
You can go do suffer a g.com iot to start your free trial today

1024
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:37,728
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest is done.

1025
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:40,800
Deer Israel who is the CTO and co-founder

1026
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,336
A security firm

1027
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:43,104
Arvest

1028
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,640
Hi dear how are you doing

1029
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:47,200
Hi Stacy I'm great how are you

1030
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:49,248
I am really excited to talk to you

1031
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:50,272
Although

1032
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:51,296
I better not as a

1033
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:53,344
Excited as you guys because you just raised

1034
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,416
Last week 65 million in funding

1035
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:58,720
That is a lot of money what is happening with our

1036
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:02,560
Pharmacist doing really great

1037
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:03,584
I think it will

1038
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,656
Great for the company maybe slightly more problematic

1039
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:07,936
The fact that we're seeing a lot of

1040
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:10,752
Problems in the world with iot so in that sense

1041
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:14,336
There's a lot of space for us to come and help organizations

1042
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:16,128
Help them protect themselves

1043
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:21,248
Dangers about but we've had quite a year say that's a lot of new clients

1044
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:24,064
A lot of very large organizations that are

1045
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:28,672
Using us for disability and security of different devices that they have

1046
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:33,024
And I realize that's a made-up word but it's what we're trying to say so

1047
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,048
It's been tremendous

1048
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,072
In that

1049
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:39,424
I think that the new investment is really about doubling down and

1050
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,704
Being able to provide that

1051
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,472
Solution

1052
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:42,752
Better for everybody

1053
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:44,800
Okay and I would say

1054
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:48,128
How big is actually I'm going to say all the way since Mariah

1055
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:49,664
We've been hearing a lot about diode

1056
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,432
Security

1057
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:56,064
Now I would love to make the distinction between some of the devices that the original Mirai botnet

1058
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:59,392
I took over which word Network video cameras printers routers

1059
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:01,696
They actually were devices that

1060
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:05,024
They had more processing power they were little bit smarter

1061
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,560
And they had access to more bandwidth

1062
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:07,840
And I think

1063
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:11,680
It's worth talking about the distinction between those types of devices

1064
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:15,264
And some of the iot devices that were a little bit more worried about

1065
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,544
Now which might

1066
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,592
Like you say their agent list Maybe

1067
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:20,896
If they're resource-constrained maybe there

1068
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:21,920
Hard to find

1069
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:24,480
So can you kind of make the distinction between

1070
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:26,016
Where We Are

1071
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:30,368
In our sophistication when it comes to understanding and securing iot devices

1072
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:33,696
Yeah I would separate the world probably

1073
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:34,720
Not So Much by

1074
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:39,840
Processing power but by the types of devices are out there and what are they running

1075
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:40,608
Basically

1076
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:43,168
The world pretty much separates into

1077
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:44,448
Devices that run

1078
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:47,264
Standards albeit old operating systems

1079
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:49,312
And then the devices that run

1080
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:51,872
Criteri software firmware

1081
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:55,199
Now there is a correlation in a way to what you described the wrong kind of

1082
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:56,223
Compute power

1083
00:41:56,479 --> 00:42:01,087
Really boils down into what's running really old windows Android limit

1084
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:03,391
And what's running very very specific

1085
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:10,815
Very big I would say that

1086
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:11,583
A lot of device

1087
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:12,863
She's out there that you wouldn't even

1088
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,143
Consider

1089
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:15,167
Types of Opera

1090
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:17,983
All the way to digital microscopes

1091
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:21,055
ATMs that you can tour controller that are running Windows

1092
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:23,103
There's all kinds of smart assistant

1093
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:24,383
Something like that

1094
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:29,503
Old versions of Linux and Android

1095
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:32,831
This is the thing where you sign into work every day a lot of those things are

1096
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:38,975
Running really old Android well so I would say that the world of those devices actually very very large in the reason I bring them up

1097
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:42,815
It's because these are devices that very easily

1098
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:46,143
Can track any type of malware that you can imagine

1099
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:53,823
Craft something very special they don't need to do something that specifically targets those devices they're just really really easy pickings

1100
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:58,431
Because they're vulnerable to things that should have gone away

1101
00:42:58,687 --> 00:42:59,967
A long time ago

1102
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:00,735
Operating

1103
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:02,271
Up to date and patched

1104
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:04,831
Those are

1105
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:11,231
For the most part the resurface that organizations are worried about now naturally there's all kinds of things that are

1106
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:14,047
And specifically abused devices that have

1107
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:14,815
Specific

1108
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:19,423
We'd even seen you mention the ride but we've even seen a variant of Mirai in Singapore

1109
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:20,703
Just a month ago

1110
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:25,311
What specifically crafted to take advantage of things that are there but for the most part

1111
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:29,407
The wannacry is not pictures of the world the variety of different botnets and crypto mining

1112
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:30,943
Ransomware

1113
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:33,503
General malware all these things the reason

1114
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:34,527
Iot is

1115
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:37,599
So so dangerous is because you don't need to do anything

1116
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:43,999
Specialty

1117
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:47,327
Problems for organization that they try to clean up

1118
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:49,119
What is the Trenta

1119
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:53,215
Obviously we're reading in surveys there plenty of surveys that come out each month

1120
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:54,751
How to say oh my gosh

1121
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:59,871
CIO CTO CEOs are all worried about the security of their connected devices

1122
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:02,431
And there feels like a sense of panic

1123
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:05,503
And many are not sure what to do about

1124
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:06,271
This

1125
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:08,319
But we've been here before

1126
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:09,855
I feel like

1127
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:12,159
We've had this Panic before we talked about

1128
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:13,439
Viruses on

1129
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:15,231
Computers that sort of thing that says

1130
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:16,255
Still happening

1131
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:19,071
We've had it with app system so Lake

1132
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:20,095
How should we think about the

1133
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:21,887
This is the world really ending or can we solve

1134
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:27,263
I think generally optimistic approach about solving problems I think that this

1135
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:28,287
Pierpoint

1136
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:29,311
Comes in Cycles

1137
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:34,175
I think that's the best thing to equate this to is 10 years ago the world application

1138
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:39,039
Same deal all kinds of applications running on my devices or being accessed by my devices

1139
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:41,343
I as a cecilware CIO

1140
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:46,975
Have no idea what they are I completely blind into what people use what they tag is transferred into them

1141
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:52,095
And specifically the risks around that or the ability to just one anything was a problem

1142
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:53,375
Income

1143
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:59,775
All kinds of solutions including connection firewalls or things like that which basically gives you a good idea

1144
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:04,895
What's running and also provide the Intelligencer on understanding what should run and what should men take action against

1145
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:05,919
I think the

1146
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:07,455
Coyote in essence

1147
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:09,247
Is physical application

1148
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:10,783
Cytus basically

1149
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:12,575
It's purpose-built devices

1150
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:16,415
That function is applications except they have a physical reality

1151
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:18,463
And I would say that the same problem

1152
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:21,791
That existed 10 years ago for applications exist today for devices

1153
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:26,655
Most organizations don't know what devices they have even if they do know all kinds of devices

1154
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:27,935
They have no idea

1155
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:29,727
What they should be worried about with

1156
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:30,751
Princeton

1157
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:37,151
They don't necessarily know that a particular brand of Chinese IP camera has a known Chinese government back door built-in

1158
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:38,943
And this is something that comes up

1159
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:43,551
I would say someone scary time schedule

1160
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:44,319
Come up a lot

1161
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:47,647
What is various forms in various ways. The point is that

1162
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:49,183
Disability

1163
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:50,975
Is the first driver in

1164
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:52,255
Security for almost

1165
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:53,535
What do I have

1166
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:54,815
And what do I need to know about

1167
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:57,631
Then the second piece of that puzzle is what do I do about it

1168
00:45:57,887 --> 00:45:59,167
Basically what can I do to

1169
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,191
Securities devices

1170
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:03,007
And thankfully a lot of these devices are

1171
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:05,055
Bring me reliant on their connectivity

1172
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:07,359
Which is also what creates the resurface

1173
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:08,127
In the first place

1174
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:10,943
I would say that being able to intelligently

1175
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:14,783
Limited connectivity intelligently police what these devices can do

1176
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:17,087
Is a very very effective method at

1177
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:20,159
Securing them and that's really the bread and butter of what

1178
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:21,183
Imagine

1179
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:25,023
An organization that has no idea what devices they have

1180
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:31,423
At all and then you come in and show them if we show them a complete inventory of all the devices that they have

1181
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:35,519
On top of that layer in the intelligence of what they should know about all these devices

1182
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:39,871
What they know about the risk provide easy steps into

1183
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:40,639
Securing them

1184
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:46,783
This is really in a nutshell organizations seem to be concerned about also what they're trying to solve

1185
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:52,415
So how worried should an organization be I feel like right now when you buy some of these connect

1186
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:53,183
Two devices

1187
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:58,559
Your elevator company is like a let's do elevators as a service and you're like yeah that sounds great

1188
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:01,119
Or maybe someone comes in with a connected lighting pack

1189
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:03,679
Are companies aware that their broadening their attack

1190
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:07,263
That is a terrific question

1191
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:09,311
Because I can throw that in many cases

1192
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:12,383
Surprisingly enough no they don't the reason is that

1193
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:13,407
Traditionally

1194
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:14,431
Things like

1195
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:15,455
Office spaces

1196
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:16,479
Building automation

1197
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:18,015
System seems like that

1198
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:21,087
They don't really go through any type of IP

1199
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:23,903
Think about TVs in the hallway

1200
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:25,695
For instance of a building for a company

1201
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:29,023
Normally the people who install that are third-party contractors

1202
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:32,351
The facilities group are the one that can track them in the first place

1203
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:33,631
It's not really

1204
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:37,471
A process that goes through the general it procurement process

1205
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:39,263
Now not just that

1206
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:44,127
You mentioned two different things that happen a lot and I'll focus on the elevator one because it's an interesting

1207
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:47,455
The reason is that

1208
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:48,735
It's just a cost reduction

1209
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:49,759
Basically

1210
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:52,575
The company that sells the elevators wants to go to

1211
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:54,623
Support them remotely so they don't have to send

1212
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:59,231
Ignition every time there's a problem

1213
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:01,023
A very good thing

1214
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:02,559
Up until the point you realize

1215
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:04,351
That elevator needs to be connected

1216
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:05,119
Somehow

1217
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:05,887
To the internet

1218
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:07,935
And usually that somehow is through

1219
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:10,495
Other companies infrastructure basically the network

1220
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:11,263
Alba company

1221
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:13,055
Spell that presents an interesting dilemma

1222
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:14,335
Because on the one hand

1223
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:15,871
It security at that point

1224
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:17,919
If they suddenly realize that that's happening

1225
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:23,039
Can come and say there's no way I'm connecting an elevator in my building to my network to the internet

1226
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:24,831
At that point

1227
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:26,111
The company would come and say

1228
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:29,695
But they give us a 20% discount for doing this so of course we're doing

1229
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:35,071
I think that it security are increasingly facing these types of issues where the mission of the business

1230
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:37,887
Something around the way the business works

1231
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:39,167
Is demanding

1232
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:40,959
The more and more of these things you put in

1233
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:43,007
Digital transformation is creating

1234
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:44,031
My conference

1235
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:45,055
Screeding

1236
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:47,871
Supply chains that have dinner connected devices between the

1237
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:52,735
They're creating building automation systems like connected elevators that service all but really

1238
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:54,783
All of these

1239
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:58,623
Are creating a mounting resurfaced where the security is put in a position where

1240
00:48:58,879 --> 00:49:02,463
They don't want want to be the one to say no they want to be the ones who say

1241
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:03,487
How to do it

1242
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:04,255
Correctly

1243
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:08,351
How to integrate all these things without a proper solution

1244
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:11,935
That makes no sense so then the solution for them is

1245
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:13,727
Please do not say by yourself

1246
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:16,799
Putting aside for a second

1247
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:18,335
Armistead the solution

1248
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:21,151
It really comes down to the same principles that

1249
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:22,175
Always guide

1250
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:24,479
Security When approaching these types of problem

1251
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:26,271
It's around disability

1252
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:28,319
Monitoring analytics about proactive

1253
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:31,135
Disability means they have to be aware of all the

1254
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:33,439
Things we have to be aware of what connected to network

1255
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:35,231
There are multiple ways to go about this

1256
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:38,047
And a lot of companies are trying out different strategies

1257
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:39,839
But the point is that the first step

1258
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:45,215
Is for security to realize that there is nothing that's really outside of their scope

1259
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:46,239
Responsibility

1260
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:47,775
In five years ago

1261
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:48,543
Cecil's

1262
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:50,335
Expected to protect IP cameras

1263
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:53,151
Allan Block metabolism in a lot of other things happening

1264
00:49:58,015 --> 00:49:59,807
And it's the same with everything else

1265
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:01,599
And it starts with visibility

1266
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:02,623
Being able to

1267
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:04,671
Count for every device that you have

1268
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:08,255
Also means being able to account for the risk surface that they create

1269
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:10,559
Basically all those folks

1270
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:12,863
Got hit by one guy or not text you

1271
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:15,679
The device of the godhead were essentially unmanaged devices

1272
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:17,215
Every device that has endpoints

1273
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:20,287
I would have thought something like that

1274
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:23,103
But the problem is that if you have even one device

1275
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:26,175
Tucked away in some closet somewhere or sometimes even

1276
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:31,551
Buried inside a wall because 10 years ago there was a server running Windows XP

1277
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:33,855
All these devices it's an app that you have

1278
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:34,623
1

1279
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:38,975
Just one device and it to take down an entire facility so the visibility

1280
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:39,999
Being able to

1281
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:41,535
Account for all these things is key

1282
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:43,071
Elmo 2nd pieces

1283
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:44,095
General Lee

1284
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:45,119
Airport hygiene

1285
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,167
Around device is being able to implement policy

1286
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:48,191
No matter how you do it

1287
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:49,983
You do it automatically if you do it

1288
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:50,751
Manually

1289
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:52,031
Policies are really important

1290
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:52,799
Like I said

1291
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:54,335
Connectivity is the main thing

1292
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:55,871
The Relief Society

1293
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:58,431
The main aspect of what makes them

1294
00:50:58,687 --> 00:50:59,967
Markdown quote on quote

1295
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:01,503
And so limiting

1296
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:02,783
Connectivity intelligently

1297
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:04,319
Is really really the most

1298
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:05,599
Important part in policing

1299
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:08,159
And also of course with reducing risk

1300
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:11,231
Go back to your question I would say that

1301
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:12,767
Getting a good handle

1302
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:16,095
And a good comprehensive handle it that at all the assets

1303
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:17,375
The organization

1304
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:18,143
Is

1305
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:19,679
The first step it's

1306
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:21,727
So I would say Primary in that

1307
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:23,519
Such a basic step

1308
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:25,311
That all the rest after that

1309
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:27,871
Wolf logo directly from what you find out

1310
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:29,919
And trust me organizations find out

1311
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:30,943
All kinds of

1312
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:33,503
Anything from connecting treadmill

1313
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:36,575
All the way to door controllers are running Windows

1314
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:38,111
From 20 years ago

1315
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:39,135
There's all kinds of ants

1316
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:39,903
Interesting stuff

1317
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:41,183
Connectnetwork these days

1318
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:44,767
Let's break down some of the crazier things you've seen

1319
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:45,791
We'll have a little fun here

1320
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:47,327
What have you seen running on

1321
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:50,655
That you're like oh that's connected and surprise

1322
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:53,727
Wow all kinds of things

1323
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:54,751
First of all

1324
00:51:55,007 --> 00:52:01,151
The treadmill part is really interesting I mean most companies don't even consider the fact there is such a thing of a connected treadmill

1325
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:02,687
That happens more often.

1326
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:04,991
I assume these are in company gyms

1327
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:07,295
Yeah sometimes it's company gym

1328
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:11,903
Sometimes by the way it's things that employees are departments bought for themselves

1329
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:12,927
I just connected

1330
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:15,487
So not always is at the

1331
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:19,071
Play Gym specifically where that but yeah that would be one of them

1332
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:22,655
I think that there's a wide variety of gaming consoles and things like that

1333
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:23,423
Peopleconnect

1334
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:24,447
Again

1335
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:27,007
Things that depending on your point of view it might seem

1336
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:28,543
Trivial and it might be very slow

1337
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:32,639
Surprisingly surprised to find just how many they have

1338
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:33,407
Connected

1339
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:34,431
Smart assistant

1340
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:37,247
Seems like you know Amazon Echo and Google home

1341
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:38,271
Some things like that

1342
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:40,063
Absolutely all over the place

1343
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:41,599
Digital microscopes

1344
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:42,367
You wouldn't

1345
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:44,671
Never in a million years think run Windows

1346
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:47,743
Not only are these types of things connected to network

1347
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:49,791
In some cases they can even be

1348
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:54,655
Patient zero in spreading things like wannacry for instance or kind of other types of ransomware

1349
00:52:54,911 --> 00:53:00,543
And by the way you name one example before I think a lot of organizations don't realize just how much of your building automation

1350
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:03,103
Just how many

1351
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:04,127
Things like

1352
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:06,943
Door controllers or lighting fixtures or

1353
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:09,503
All kinds of other things are connected their Network

1354
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:16,159
And just for the heck of it all to say that's a lot of companies don't realize that these kind of emergency call stations like

1355
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:16,927
You know how you have them

1356
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:22,047
Can always sometimes these defibrillators but kind of emergency nurse call station

1357
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:24,351
These types of things are also network-connected

1358
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:25,887
No one even knows

1359
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:28,959
Definitely interesting things that come up

1360
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:30,751
When you do kind of a discovery like that

1361
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:32,799
Okay I like that

1362
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:35,359
And let's talk one of the things

1363
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:39,711
Been talking about recently on the show is this idea of connected medical device

1364
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:40,991
Connected medicine

1365
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:41,759
And and

1366
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:45,343
I worry a lot about this because I feel like hospitals

1367
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:47,903
It security is not their strong suit

1368
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:49,439
People's lives

1369
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:50,463
Hopefully their strong suit

1370
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:51,231
So

1371
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:55,839
What are you seeing in the medical world because they are really embracing connectivity in ways that

1372
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:57,375
Figure very helpful

1373
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:58,399
But are also

1374
00:53:58,655 --> 00:53:59,167
Little bit scary

1375
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:00,703
First of all

1376
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:03,519
Hospitals have gone through quite the transformation

1377
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:04,799
Over the past 2 years

1378
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:07,103
From being an install being

1379
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:08,639
Very very obviously

1380
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:09,407
Patience

1381
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:14,015
Saving oriented

1382
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:15,295
The problem is this

1383
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:17,855
That exact orientation also made them Target

1384
00:54:18,111 --> 00:54:19,391
They're increasingly the target

1385
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:22,207
Cyber attacks that are meant to Cripple their operations

1386
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:24,511
So where once

1387
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:27,583
Hospitals mostly have to worry about stealing of patient

1388
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:28,351
Information

1389
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:29,887
Something like that

1390
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:32,447
Today they're handling a much tougher situation

1391
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:33,471
What happens

1392
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:34,239
Someone

1393
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:36,031
Takes over your MRI machine

1394
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:37,055
It cost you

1395
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:37,823
Quite a bit

1396
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:39,359
And takes it offline

1397
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:43,455
Most hospitals is a really a really tough one

1398
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:44,223
I mean

1399
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:46,015
They need that device

1400
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:47,551
Deceit lies they need it back

1401
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:49,087
What is it

1402
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:53,183
Statistics show that if you pay ransom for ransomware

1403
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:54,463
You're going to get hit again

1404
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:58,303
It kind of makes sense in a cynical way but it's just the way the world works

1405
00:54:58,815 --> 00:55:01,119
So increasing over the past two years

1406
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:02,655
More and more hospitals

1407
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:03,423
Realize

1408
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:07,007
But they have to get a handle on what's going on with their medical devices

1409
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:08,799
They have to get a handle on everything

1410
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:09,567
Carmen

1411
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:10,847
And I have to do it quickly

1412
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:12,127
So your point

1413
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:13,151
Understanding

1414
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:16,479
Network-connected medical devices understanding their weaknesses

1415
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:20,575
Standing what they should or should not be doing it being able to lock everything down

1416
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:22,111
Is a very very

1417
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:22,879
Big thing

1418
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:24,671
Large Hospital

1419
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:26,719
Today and I would answer that

1420
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:33,119
That's some of the problems that they face is that a lot of the medical devices that they have kind of the earlier points

1421
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:35,679
Are running really old

1422
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:36,447
Standard Opera

1423
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:38,495
Sothink Windows XP

1424
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:39,775
Sync Windows 7

1425
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:41,055
Which is going to be end of life

1426
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:43,103
These are things that

1427
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:44,383
Are hard for that because

1428
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:45,407
Medical devices

1429
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:47,967
Given everything that they know true

1430
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:48,735
Application

1431
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:51,295
All the different certifications of these devices went through

1432
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:53,343
Names of the hospitals also camp

1433
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:57,951
Securecrt traditional

1434
00:55:58,207 --> 00:55:59,231
Monitor

1435
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:02,303
Take a look what they're doing so they're in a very very

1436
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:03,583
Christine

1437
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:05,119
Let's spin

1438
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:08,447
2 second with chatting about maybe what we see happening

1439
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:09,471
Types of device

1440
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:10,495
I would say that

1441
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:13,311
Beyond the general sense of these are problems

1442
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:15,103
I can tell you from our own

1443
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:22,015
So we've seen anything from MRI machines that were taken over and connected to command and control servers in Russia

1444
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:26,879
All the way to ransomware spreading across Hospital networks in general

1445
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:28,159
Even one

1446
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:29,951
Fairly elaborate case where

1447
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:32,767
Client hospital was faced with a situation

1448
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:35,583
Where infusion pump connected to a live patient

1449
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:38,143
Have malware running on it but it wasn't

1450
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:41,727
In the scenario where you can't disconnected because there's a person connected to it

1451
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:43,519
So they have to have a nurse

1452
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:47,615
Sit next to me all night and make sure that device is still operational.

1453
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:50,175
Shutting down not doing anything weird and

1454
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:52,479
That's a situation that I think that's most

1455
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:56,063
Hospital that's kind of a doomsday scenario reaching that point

1456
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:58,367
Kill Point around kind of what to do about all this

1457
00:56:59,135 --> 00:57:01,695
So the answer is that you have to take

1458
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:05,535
The very design of these devices into account when you're approaching the problem

1459
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:08,095
All these devices

1460
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:11,167
At the end of the day the risk surface that they pose

1461
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:11,935
Is

1462
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:18,335
So connectivity is exactly

1463
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:20,127
A lot of these devices

1464
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:22,175
We're not designed

1465
00:57:22,431 --> 00:57:24,223
Security in my car not too much security

1466
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:26,015
There's a lot of
