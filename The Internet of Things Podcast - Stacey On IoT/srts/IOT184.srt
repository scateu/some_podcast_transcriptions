Get started for free at Auckland. IO

38
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:59,296
That's a UK let.

39
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:00,064
IO

40
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:02,112
Hey Kevin

41
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,904
Start off this week with

42
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,928
Branding

43
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,464
The Wi-Fi Alliance

44
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:07,488
Is at it again

45
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,024
They have decided

46
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:11,584
But the energy. 11.

47
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,376
Acaax

48
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:15,680
Angie B I don't know Q

49
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,728
It's all way too confusing

50
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,752
Yente

51
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:19,776
Their solution

52
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:20,800
Is

53
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:21,824
Adverse

54
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:28,992
So the new ax standard is going to be called Wi-Fi 6

55
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:31,296
I guess AC within B5

56
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:34,368
I guess it would be and that would be

57
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,136
4

58
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:41,536
Cats they're doing a rebranding all those with numbers you will not hear about Wi-Fi one two and three cuz

59
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,352
I'm gone

60
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:49,472
We're beyond that although a lot of smart home devices doorbell

61
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:50,752
B r g

62
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:53,312
They do so that's going to be interesting

63
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:54,336
And that gets us

64
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:56,640
To public service announcement about Wi-Fi

65
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:58,944
You probably do not need

66
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,480
Update your system

67
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:01,504
To LAX

68
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,296
Not yet anyway

69
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,576
Don't don't do it

70
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:10,208
Don't do it I'm an early adopter of these things and I am not doing it

71
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:10,976
Yes

72
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,000
Because

73
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:15,072
It has to be really awesome and to get the amazing GBS

74
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:18,400
The 2.3 gigabits-per-second capacity

75
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:21,472
1.2 using all 8

76
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:27,616
Streams and apple be using 160 megahertz channels that's the biggest pipe I believe for ax

77
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,896
Okay

78
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,736
You will also

79
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:34,016
You said you need to do that

80
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:36,064
And then your client devices also

81
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:36,832
Have to have

82
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:40,160
Copper capability otherwise they're just going to use what they can do

83
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,440
Invited in

84
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:43,232
Remember what that is but it's

85
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,768
A gigabit per second

86
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,840
So

87
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:50,144
Upgrade your smartphones not using us yet

88
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,448
Which is probably the year most popular most

89
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,216
Commonly

90
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,496
Used device

91
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:56,800
Certainly not your iot devices

92
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:59,360
So if you think this is going to help you in that capacity

93
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:04,224
Percy routers that have us and I believe there have been already

94
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,504
Released

95
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:11,904
I don't recall who has put them out there but don't rush to get them because you're right once you have the router

96
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:16,512
Then you're going to have to wait for your client devices to have their Hardware upgraded

97
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:22,911
To take full advantage of this and that means yes your phone's your tablet your set-top boxes you two devices which again

98
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:25,727
Probably won't get this capability anyway because

99
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:29,055
Gabby cranmore antennas and older devices to get this so

100
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,079
There's just no rush

101
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:35,455
So wait for that APK or 32k TV with all the antennas and maybe then

102
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:36,479
Maybe then

103
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,015
So what other thing

104
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:40,831
And this is kind of annoys me and maybe I'm nitpicking here

105
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:44,159
Here's what I do not want to see happen but I'm sure it's going to anyway

106
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:46,207
Do you remember Stacy when

107
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:50,047
Neuer wife I came out and all of these companies said hey we got

108
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:53,631
5G Wi-Fi Wichita

109
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,423
Yeah

110
00:04:56,191 --> 00:05:01,823
Technically that was correct because hey this is versus the 6th generation of life I standards for

111
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:02,847
Nostra news

112
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:06,431
Please do not call it 6G don't even call the old ones

113
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,455
5G because

114
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,735
You're messing around with

115
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:13,599
No cellular network naming conventions in that ditch

116
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:17,439
I will call at the first one it doesn't

117
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,975
This is so upsetting to me

118
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,023
I just can't

119
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,815
So let's talk about

120
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,863
Satellite.

121
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:28,959
Is launching an iot satellite Network

122
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:29,727
Amazon

123
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,519
Web services

124
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,287
This

125
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:36,895
Is designed to basically give you connectivity for things where there is no Cellular Connection

126
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:37,919
And

127
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,199
It is so cool

128
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:46,111
It is cool and I totally understand what they're trying to do because you know there are remote areas where you might want iot

129
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,647
Key devices or applications

130
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:51,743
And you just don't have good cellular coverage so doesn't matter if

131
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:54,559
You know he had an NB iot device

132
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:57,119
If there's no network

133
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,167
It's funny to me iridium is like the

134
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:01,727
Satellite service that just will never die

135
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:02,751
Remember

136
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:06,591
It was actually for voice Communications back in the day

137
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:09,407
For the same reason because of cellular coverage

138
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:14,527
Yeah when you were going to your trip to Antarctica

139
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,111
Crazy septum

140
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,159
You had your sat phone

141
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,951
Yes satellite is one of those

142
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,487
Expensive necessities

143
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:25,535
They've always wanted

144
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,095
Find use cases that

145
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,447
When you're doing satellite

146
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,983
One of the cost is

147
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,543
Launching a satellite

148
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:40,127
But the other costs are you got these

149
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:42,431
Really the modules that you have to have to

150
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:45,759
Communicate with a satellite or very expensive

151
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,039
Again

152
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,319
To be honest

153
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:53,439
IRT actually makes more sense than some of the other implementations for satellite Communications

154
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,463
The Voice

155
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:56,767
For internet you had like up to 2

156
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:59,071
Second latency

157
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,095
Highlights

158
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,375
So here's my question

159
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,423
They're talking about this is called cloud

160
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,959
They're talking about using it Electra

161
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:07,775
Makes sense

162
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:11,871
Another popular thing on a shipping container

163
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,663
But comes to buy

164
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,223
Most of those are going to function

165
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:21,599
With like normal radios that talk to a Gateway the gateway to satellite backhaul

166
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:22,623
But a lot of

167
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:25,183
Could actually just be done effectively be a lot

168
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:28,511
So you can say hey if it's a refrigerated shipping container

169
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:33,631
Yule log it like log temperature changes and if it goes out of range even if you could have notified

170
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,399
Vacation

171
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,191
It's unclear if there's much you can

172
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:36,959
Do

173
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:37,983
Lake in the middle of the ocean

174
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,775
There may be something

175
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,847
It has to be a high-value item to Justified

176
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:43,871
Cost

177
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,663
So I'm just thinking here

178
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:50,783
And it's possible when you go back into cellular range

179
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,855
Just uploaded

180
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:56,927
Again I think it makes sense for some high-value objects

181
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,975
If you're transporting diamonds then

182
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:02,047
Popping on this network so you can see it wherever it is

183
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,071
But I don't know

184
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,095
We'll see

185
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:07,423
Maybe third time's a charm for iridium I don't know maybe

186
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,471
I'm just such a satellite you know

187
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,775
I look satellites I just

188
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:12,799
It's a difficult business

189
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:14,847
California

190
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,151
Which is left and right

191
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:20,735
Crazy has left and left space of corset net neutrality

192
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,527
They now have this new law

193
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,063
That we talked about that is the

194
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:30,463
Cybersecurity law covering smart devices it is the first state to pass such a lot is SB 327

195
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:33,279
Passed in late August and the governor signed it

196
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,303
It's a first step

197
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,583
It's minimum

198
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,351
So we need

199
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,887
Work because it's just

200
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,959
Requiring that any device that connects to the internet

201
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:47,103
Has to have reasonable security features so we talked about this on Pryor show it's a first step it's not the end-all be-all by any means

202
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:52,223
So the law requires manufacturers to equip connected devices with quote

203
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,271
A reasonable security feature or

204
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,039
Futures

205
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:56,063
Designed to permit

206
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,343
Packers from

207
00:08:57,599 --> 00:09:02,463
It does not define what this feature should be some people are upset about this but I actually think it's

208
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:07,583
Probably a good thing to keep this bag because technology and decryption Technologies change so quickly

209
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:10,143
It does mandated connected devices

210
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,423
Come with unique passwords

211
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,471
That users can change

212
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:17,823
So yeah I would love for them to say that you know you force users to change

213
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,359
That didn't happen

214
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:23,455
I think they are forced a required for Caesar to change if it doesn't

215
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:25,759
Come with a unique password I think it's an either-or

216
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,319
So

217
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,367
Some critics have talked about

218
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:32,671
Dealing with mean to bag which I've just

219
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:34,719
Praise but they're like it's not useful

220
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:35,743
And they also

221
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,279
Basically are like saying

222
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:41,119
Hey instead of forcing people to add security features why don't you

223
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,399
Insecure future

224
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:47,519
I wish that they'd spent more time deciding what those insecure features actually are

225
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,639
Device to the internet

226
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:53,919
Typically I think

227
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:55,199
Good practices or

228
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,479
Car security alert

229
00:09:56,735 --> 00:10:02,367
Make sure every devices over there update and

230
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,927
Unique he's actually are really relevant

231
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:06,207
And I like

232
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,535
That's a good thing

233
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,071
That gets a little bar in

234
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,351
No hay

235
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,655
Okay so that is the new law

236
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:17,471
The idea is this only works for people selling devices

237
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:18,495
California

238
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,031
California

239
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,567
So do many other

240
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:24,383
The most populous state in the US

241
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,407
Chimpanzee

242
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,943
Has got

243
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,223
How do you want it

244
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:32,575
I think I might not sure yet

245
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:35,647
What is going to bring to the table but I think I might

246
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:38,463
IBM has actually put out a blog post

247
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,487
That's

248
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:45,887
Explain how to add IBM Watson services to home assistant which I know is a platform some of our folks

249
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:49,215
Home assistant is open source and it's something you kind of

250
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:55,615
Have to put on your own device like a Raspberry Pi instead of buying a Smart Hub human system becomes the Hub so it's more for the

251
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:57,919
DIY folks in the books like the program

252
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:04,575
I think it's going to be interesting to try and I think I'm going to do this because I want to see you again what Watson brings

253
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,111
The idea here is it

254
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:11,743
Platform-agnostic devices in your house and will provide a unified interface and then

255
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:14,559
My guess is based on what IBM is saying

256
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:15,839
They will help you

257
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,119
And developers make

258
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:21,215
Compose analytics visualization cash boards and new apps

259
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:22,495
I'm thinking

260
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:28,895
Will it bring some kind of machine learning Watson actually start bringing more smarts to the smart home as a reason

261
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:30,431
So that's the whole

262
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,967
But I will have to try it and see

263
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:38,367
Provokes a half home assistant it doesn't look too difficult to integrate a little bit of

264
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:41,695
I think that's something everybody should have anyway I'll get off my soapbox

265
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,719
And

266
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,999
Yeah it's pretty much

267
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:46,047
Bright out there and I github

268
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:48,095
Repository and add

269
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,119
Got it and

270
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:53,727
So are you looking for like visualisations of what's happening in your home like what kind of machine learning are you

271
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:54,751
Trying to do with your hair

272
00:11:55,263 --> 00:12:01,407
Will know it would be nice if Watson saw that I'm doing the same things all the time manually if there's a way to automated Maybe

273
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,687
You could come to be like the

274
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,991
Amazon Padme hunches

275
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:08,575
I still haven't have you thought Hunters on your battle Bay yet

276
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,855
I got soul Hunters

277
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:14,719
All right. I don't know yet but I am very curious

278
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:17,791
Hey

279
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:19,839
Okay

280
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:20,863
Rooting

281
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,143
Right along

282
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,679
Let's talk about

283
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,447
Mox

284
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:27,263
Apple's bringing keyless door entry to campuses

285
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,031
And

286
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:32,895
You know

287
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:33,919
Why are there

288
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:41,343
Yeah they're in this is great and I'm taking classes at my Community College my daughter is taking classes at her College

289
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:47,743
Neither one is one of the three that Apple just added support to and I think they'd already mentioned that this was going to happen these canvases it's Duke

290
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:53,631
University of Alabama and University of Oklahoma

291
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:59,263
They can use that to you know when I need to show the ID that can pay for things using their

292
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,079
Student account with that really interested me was

293
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:05,407
Using that to get into their dorms the gym in the library

294
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:10,271
And told them through NFC and I'm like okay that's cool that iPhone has NFC and so does he

295
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,391
It's awesome

296
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:18,975
Why don't we have more NFC locks because to me this

297
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:23,327
Just makes more sense of remembering little codes like we had at my house or example

298
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,095
Punching arm

299
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,375
Kiko don't get in

300
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:29,471
Makes more sense perhaps than Bluetooth which has a much larger range in might be easier

301
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,239
Pack

302
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:33,311
Yeah NFC just put something close to the door open

303
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:36,639
I do recall that Yale had about two years ago some NFC locks

304
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:40,479
But I don't see them for sale anymore and I just wonder if the idea of NFC locks

305
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,759
Was head of it

306
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:42,527
Time

307
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:47,391
Because people wouldn't have phones and watches with NFC at that time but now it's becoming so prevalent

308
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,671
I think we need to research

309
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,207
Kevin I don't know

310
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:52,511
I want to think it's a power

311
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:58,911
Consumption thing or maybe it was just people don't use it and you know it

312
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:04,031
Is interference

313
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:10,687
Maybe someone has a really good explanation

314
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:11,967
All right

315
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:13,247
We're puzzled by this

316
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,527
But I am

317
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:16,575
Microsoft has brought Cortana

318
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:20,927
Too noise cancelling headphones these are $350 which is expensive

319
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:21,951
In the rain

320
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:23,231
Headphones

321
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,791
What why why Cortana

322
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,119
Well

323
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:32,447
I mean they did me this earlier this week after being Hardware event

324
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:35,007
Where they also debuted all new Surface products

325
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,823
Surface Pro's news

326
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:42,943
Sunset Ford so this kind of goes along with that in terms of new hardware

327
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,527
So you really going to add they're not going to have Google or Madam a

328
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,551
Now they're going to

329
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:49,343
Try and get people using Cortana

330
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:51,647
We put that thang up the partnership

331
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,719
They do and maybe they'll integrated Madam a

332
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:56,767
Into these with a firmware update later

333
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,047
But I'm not surprised that you was

334
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:04,447
Cortana the thing is to use them to use the Cortana bets you do have to be paired with a computer or a phone

335
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,471
Something that

336
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:10,591
Has Cortana already installed obviously and it's no different than Google assistant or Madame a butt

337
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:13,151
If you're not using Cortana any other devices

338
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:15,199
Likely going to buy these headphones

339
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:18,271
The one nice thing is normally on

340
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:20,063
Headphones that have an assistant built in

341
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:20,831
You have to

342
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:21,855
Tap something

343
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,391
To enable.

344
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,415
Assistant

345
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:26,207
You don't have to do that with these

346
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:26,975
D6

347
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:33,119
Kind of an always-on thing you can't set turn off by default yet but I presume you will be able to in the future but you just

348
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,655
Say Hey Cortana

349
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,935
And if you're wearing his headphones

350
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:37,215
He responds in your ears

351
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,055
So I am not buying this

352
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:45,151
All right moving right along to some quick news Bates Johnson Controls

353
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:45,919
Which

354
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:46,943
Thermostat

355
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:47,967
Control products

356
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:50,527
Industrial stuff that they bought a thermostat maker called

357
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,807
Lux products

358
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,087
Lux actually

359
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:59,999
I have a thermostat which is a

360
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,791
The talks to Google home

361
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:06,655
Set the nice-looking

362
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,703
It works

363
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,775
It works it's $150 people like it

364
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:13,311
Johnson Controls

365
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,359
So yay

366
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:16,383
Splunk

367
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,151
Which is

368
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,711
This is a data logging

369
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:22,271
Company they now have their first

370
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:24,319
Industrial iot product

371
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:28,671
Surprisingly called Splunk for industrial iot

372
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:31,231
This brings Splunk logging

373
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:32,255
Software

374
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:34,815
Machine learning toolkit

375
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,863
Visualization

376
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:37,887
Package

377
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:39,935
All to the industrial world

378
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:43,519
So this is really to capture and analyze data in a

379
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:47,615
Customizable dashboard I suspect on exmoor analytics that anything else

380
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,407
It's logging in and out

381
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:51,199
So you get all this information

382
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:55,551
Sponge has been involved in the IT world for a long time

383
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:56,575
Smogon all kinds

384
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:59,135
Now it is going into the

385
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:02,975
What was all the OT role vs. operational Technologies

386
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:05,279
Sensor controls Industrial

387
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,095
Hardcore stuff and a lot of that

388
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:11,679
Stop is on his own network that never deals and touches with it now

389
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:14,239
So spark is basically saying

390
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:17,311
Something just for you

391
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,079
Power

392
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:22,943
Energy Transportation these companies have these networks artist Abba

393
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,735
So it's a big deal

394
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:26,015
Asplundh

395
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:26,783
There are

396
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,343
Tough tools in the industrial world

397
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:33,183
So the competition there should be

398
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:33,951
Kind of interesting

399
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:35,231
But it's possible

400
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,511
As

401
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,047
Companies are pursuing

402
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,607
The internet of things and what they call Digital Trends

403
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,375
Information

404
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:43,423
The it guys are getting a lot

405
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,263
More say in what happens on the OT side so that maybes blocks weigh in

406
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,055
Okay

407
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:52,127
Speaking of industrial GE

408
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,407
Could have started

409
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:57,503
5 years ago with the industrial internet-of-things

410
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,039
I was there

411
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:01,855
GE just started talking about its jet airplane engine

412
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:04,671
How old is Cindy

413
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:06,207
Octave machine learning

414
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:10,303
Everything was going to be a service

415
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,839
She's been in trouble for a while

416
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:14,655
And earlier this week and CEO John Flannery

417
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:17,727
Was

418
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,519
Surprisingly kicked out

419
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:21,311
And replaced

420
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:22,847
So

421
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:26,687
No Larry

422
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:27,967
And selling various assets

423
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:29,247
So now

424
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,015
Larry Culp

425
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,295
The new CEO

426
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:32,831
It's going to be

427
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:35,391
Finishing that up and trying to

428
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:36,927
LG get back

429
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,463
Track

430
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:40,767
They also announced

431
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:41,791
The sale

432
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:42,815
Oh

433
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:45,631
Is intelligent platforms automation business

434
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:47,935
Emerson and this week I'm actually at

435
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:48,959
The Emerson

436
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:50,239
Annual country

437
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:56,383
Prince and announcements on Tuesday the day Emerson answers on Tuesday that they bought the intelligent platforms

438
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:59,455
Business sadly they could not say much about it including

439
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,735
The deal terms

440
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:05,855
That business did generate about 210 million in Revenue in 2017

441
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:06,879
So

442
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:08,671
Probably hopefully higher than that

443
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,695
Yeah

444
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:15,327
Interesting it's the most like this was one of the more successful areas in this space for GE because

445
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:19,679
Perfect example early adopters of their industrial internet control system

446
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:25,567
Saw a 40% reduction in maintenance minutes because of the predictiveness of Analytics

447
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:30,943
White and Emerson which has their automation controls business which is very much apart

448
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:32,991
Process manufacturing so thick

449
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,271
Anything like

450
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:36,063
Oil and gas chemical refinery

451
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,855
Even some food production

452
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:38,623
Those guys

453
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,415
Bunch of clients

454
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:42,463
It's this week that talked about saving

455
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,487
Gobs of money

456
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:45,791
Actually

457
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:48,095
Generating real savings from there

458
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:49,887
Installation of smarter

459
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:52,191
Sensors in predictive and using things like

460
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:55,519
So this DuckTales really well

461
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,287
But

462
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,823
It is still kind of like where I live

463
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,615
What is happening with GE

464
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:00,639
The answer is

465
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:02,175
A lot

466
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:06,015
But

467
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:08,575
Big companies are picking up the pieces

468
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:11,391
Export

469
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:13,183
Heart digital know how

470
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,975
To a lot of other places

471
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:18,047
Emerson already had plenty of digital know how

472
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,327
Other places

473
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:20,863
You can never have

474
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:21,887
Too much know how

475
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:25,471
I feel like some people might feel they have too much

476
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:28,287
They don't need to tell me how much you know how they have

477
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,055
All right

478
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,079
Speaking of know how

479
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,103
Kevin

480
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:33,151
You know how we can use our

481
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:34,687
Doors windows

482
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:35,711
Yeah

483
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:42,111
Yes I kind of feel like the door window sensor doesn't get respect it's like the least respected thing in the iot world in the smart

484
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,391
So

485
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:45,183
I had a couple sitting around so I

486
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:48,511
Different ways to use them cuz what do most people use it for

487
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:50,303
Doors and windows

488
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,583
For security

489
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:56,959
Total sense but these things are pretty inexpensive the batteries last a long time and they

490
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:02,847
Just make for a great trigger event for so many different things you can automate in the home so this week I wrote a blogpost

491
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:04,639
Explaining for unique

492
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,919
Use cases that

493
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:12,319
I come up with and I'm sure other people have come up with more some helping people share their own I know you have a favorite you can chime in when I

494
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,343
Say your favorite

495
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:21,280
My kids just don't turn on the exhaust fan in the bathroom when you take a shower which is not good for the bathroom

496
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:24,096
Terrible actually thought about spending some

497
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,888
Serious money for a

498
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:30,752
Exhaust fan that had a humidity sensor but the easier thing to do is to just put

499
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:33,056
The fan on a Smart Switch

500
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:39,200
And then use a door window sensor on the actual shower door so when they're taking a shower it just goes on

501
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:40,736
That's it maybe it's not the most

502
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:46,880
Slightly thing to see about having that sensor on a shower door I feel shower curtain obviously this is not going to work but it works

503
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:50,720
Pretty well in certain cases

504
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:52,256
So that's one way

505
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:53,792
Humidity

506
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:55,840
You know I haven't seen any problems

507
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:59,168
I know you're not like IP rated that I know of but

508
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,448
To be honest

509
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:03,008
There should be less humidity when they're taking a shower then

510
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:04,288
Biggest fan

511
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,312
I don't know

512
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:08,384
They're cheap and outfits 20-25 bucks for sensor

513
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,176
Also

514
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:16,576
I tend to after dinner had to my little comfy chair which is a recliner and I thought about this NyQuil

515
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:17,600
Why do I every night

516
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:19,904
Turn on the light

517
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,184
To that chair and

518
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,232
Turn on a playlist on the Google home

519
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,256
I just put

520
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:26,304
A door window sensor

521
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,328
Into the chair

522
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:30,912
I need the chair smart and nobody knows cuz you can't see it

523
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:31,680
To do it either

524
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:38,080
Flip my recliner over and where the footrest resides when the chair is not in recline position that's where you put the lid

525
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,104
Magnetic contact

526
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,152
And then on the inside of the charity but the

527
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:42,176
Centered self

528
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:45,248
Now when you recline in the chair you got a trigger event

529
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,272
And now

530
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:50,112
I sit down my light goes on in my music starts playing really really cool

531
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,392
That was my favorite one

532
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:59,072
And it's not going to have to have a certain

533
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:05,984
Want to talk about before but I'll mention again cuz what time is hey why walk into a dark closet

534
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:12,384
Sure you have a light switch for a minute walk-in closet to put the light on but we're leaving the light on all the time we walk out of the closet

535
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,688
I have to switch summer wasting electricity

536
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:16,480
Just put a door sensor

537
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:19,296
On the backside of that closet door and put a smart bulb in the

538
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,064
Cause it rather

539
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,344
I just open the door

540
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,368
Life Goes On

541
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:24,416
Close the door

542
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:30,560
So you're not walking into a dark closet and it's hitting electricity if you are like us and forget to turn that switch off

543
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:32,096
I do that

544
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:36,960
I do that in a couple places I do that on my closet door but I do it with a motion sensor

545
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:39,520
And then I also do it in my laundry

546
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:40,800
Because

547
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:44,896
It is awesome

548
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:46,944
And then again I use a motion sensor there

549
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:51,808
The other place

550
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:55,392
Master bathroom

551

00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:08,960
Makes sense and we often have our hands full bring laundry into the closet so yeah makes little sense in closet

Hi Stacy and Kevin

583
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,328
This is Derek

584

Malinois

585
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:09,888
I'm calling in regards

586
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,936
Question on a

587
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:13,472
Freezer that I

588
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:15,520
Modified to hold the

589
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:16,800
Keg of beer

590
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:18,592
I'm trying to monitor how freaky

591
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:19,616
Plant Cycles

592
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:22,432
Have a Z-Wave monitor but it

593
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,992
Currently only reports out about every 30 minutes

594
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:29,600
How are usages so I don't get a very good idea when it's actually running or not

595
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:31,904
Curious if you guys have any recommendation

596
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,184
End of a different product

597
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:35,232
Use that word

598
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,000
Allow me

599
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:37,280
Track my power usage

600
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,328
Frigerator

601
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,376
How long was that if you had a way to

602
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:43,936
Monitor the internal temperature

603
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:45,728
Of the refrigerator that would also be

604
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:46,752
Be helpful had trouble

605
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:47,520
Find nanny

606
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:48,544
But don't

607
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:49,824
Require mounting

608
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:51,360
The sensor in

609
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:53,408
Inside and it would have trouble getting out of this

610
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:54,688
Any help

611
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:55,456
Would be appreciate

612
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:58,016
Alright lyrics

613
00:25:58,528 --> 00:25:59,552
This is a lovely

614
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:01,600
Question and an easy one

615
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:02,368
For the most part

616
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,136
So

617
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:08,768
My suggestion to you right away is using smart plug like the WeMo Insight or any smart plug

618
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:11,072
That has some sort of energy

619
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:12,096
Tracking on it

620
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:13,120
And

621
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:16,960
Put that in and you'll get a nice little graph of azure refrigerator cycle

622
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,264
So that's

623
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:22,848
That's one way to do it and ask for the temperature inside

624
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:24,640
We actually addressed that last week with

625
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:25,664
Variety

626
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,432
Temperature

627
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:27,712
Sensors

628
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:33,088
If you're worried about the wireless signal getting out of the refrigerator which is like a giant Faraday cage

629
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:34,880
You can put it on the temperature

630
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:36,416
Which is like

631
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:37,184
The probe

632
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,976
Connect to a device

633
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:40,768
An approach that is inside the freezer

634
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:42,304
Isis actually outside

635
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:46,144
The freezer so expensive

636
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,936
Or required

637
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,728
Required a hug

638
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,776
So you may not love it but

639
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:55,104
Someone else did suggest a cheaper alternatives you have

640
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,152
SmartThings and are feeling incredibly

641
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:57,920
Technically savvy

642
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:58,944
So

643
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,784
Listeners actually sent me an e-mail

644
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,576
If you guys have SmartThings

645
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:08,416
He's been using the xiaomi temperature sensors there on $9

646
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:09,184
2

647
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,720
Check his freezer

648
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:13,024
Temperature so that's an option

649
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:16,352
You do have to download a special device Handler

650
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:17,376
On GitHub

651
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:18,656
Orthocenter

652
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:19,936
And lieutenant

653
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:21,728
So this is not

654
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:25,568
I think I fully believe that everyone is capable of doing this but

655
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,592
Some people mean

656
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:29,408
But for 9 bucks

657
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:34,784
So it's actually pretty easy to install a SmartThings Handler

658
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:41,184
I had to do it for some fibaro devices for example and literally or just downloading a code from GitHub saving it as a text file

659
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,232
Remember that file format is for SmartThings

660
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:44,000
Images

661
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:45,280
Using your SmartThings app

662
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:51,680
How to install it once you do that then SmartThings Hub knows what to do with information from that sensor or device

663
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:52,704
It's not so bad

664
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,264
And you mentioned Stacy's a WeMo Insight switch

665
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,312
That was actually one of the first

666
00:27:57,568 --> 00:28:00,640
Iot devices that I added to my house it's super useful

667
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:07,040
I wish we could do more than just look in the app and see a log or real-time energy use but and there may be ways

668
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:09,088
Listen to what I have not look at wemos apis

669
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:10,112
But there's no

670
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:13,440
Simple native way to like Mucinex trigger events to say hey

671
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:15,232
The refrigerator has been running

672
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:19,840
Too long or something maybe something's wrong as a result what's not running at all when it should be

673
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:25,728
Easy way to use that but still it is informative and I think get there on the right track

674
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,544
Yes it doesn't fibaro they also have

675
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,592
Energy tracking

676
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,896
It's ass eating

677
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:34,176
If you have a heart

678
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,736
Okay so Derek we hope that

679
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:38,272

And suddenly

763
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:33,632
To all the evolution in sensor technology

764
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:34,912

Enterprises

772
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,600
Leave it as fraud industry and Technology expertise

773
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:56,160
To bring together

778
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:06,912
So is this

779
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:08,192

Digital product companies in high-tech companies

782
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:20,224
It's complex when you begin collecting people processing Technologies in new ways

783
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:20,992
But it's anxiety

784
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:25,856
I just called to be working with the largest industrial companies in the world

785
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:26,880

00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:04,000
I'll call The Internet of Things

797
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:05,280
This kind of has been

798
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:06,816
Generation of the internet

799
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:08,864
I don't know so

800
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,912
4 people let's talk about why I'm asking you

801
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:12,448
You are with cloudflare

802
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,472
Explain what that is

803
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,056
Yasso cloudflare our mission is to help

804
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:18,080
Build a better internet

805
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:18,848
And

806
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,128
To do that we run

807
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:21,152
Wonder World Park

808
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:23,200
We have this morning

809
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:25,504
I think equipment running in the hundred

810
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,064
Eforcity is got it all around the world

811
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,088
And what

812
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:30,112
World Hinduism

813
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:30,880
Figure out ways

814
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:31,648
Make the internet

815
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:34,976
Orange alien

816
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:35,744
More efficient

817
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,096
And so what we're thinking about is how do you help

818
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,120
I'm sure that

819
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:41,888
You Candlebox

820
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:43,168
Exercise technology

821
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:45,216
You can spread them out very broadly

822
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:49,312
And make them available to anyone anyone who needs them

823
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:50,080
Art of that

824
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:53,408
Somebody has a lot of

825
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:54,688
When the internet first came out

826
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:56,224
It was a massive

827
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,272
Decentralizing Force

828
00:33:58,528 --> 00:33:59,552
As you have lines

829
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:01,856
Companies like Google and Facebook

830
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:03,392
Decentralized a lot of

831
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:05,952
I've come out of those come

832
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:09,024
Wondering

833
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:11,840
Play Rolling is

834
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:15,680
For their decentralized that and I think iot exactly one major ass

835
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:16,704
Doug

836
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:19,776
I would probably agree with you

837
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:21,568
Before we get into like

838
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:24,640
Crazy nitty-gritty technical details cuz I think you guys are

839
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:27,200
Actually launching some products that make sense for the future

840
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:28,736
Internet

841
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:30,016
What is the internet of the

842
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:33,600
We talked about decentralisation Butler

843
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:35,392
How we think about designing this

844
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:36,416
How we think about the

845
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:37,184
Problem set

846
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,464
We start talking about

847
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:41,024
Challenges

848
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,048
What the

849
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:45,632
If you training at our how do you ensure that the best

850
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:46,400
Things about the internet

851
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:48,448
Virginia Beach Red Witch is that anyone

852
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:50,752
Anywhere an idea or

853
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:51,776
Business

854
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:54,336
More information can

855
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,128
And reach a global audience

856
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:58,176
To go through

857
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:02,528
Amazing companies

858
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,552
Creative

859
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:06,880
An enormous amount of value and they have a huge amount of

860
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:07,648
Technology which

861
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,208
Information on their Network

862
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:11,744
Easter basket

863
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,304
Security built-in from the beginning

864
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,352
Enormous resources

865
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:18,144
So had I think about the internet

866
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,936
How do you

867
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:21,728
Take those advantages

868
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:23,264
Is that the internet Giants

869
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,056
And make them available everyone

870
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:26,848
How can you make sure that

871
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:29,152
Even if you don't have an enormous Center resources

872
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:32,736
It's all about

873
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:33,504
How do you make

874
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,272
Sure that

875
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:38,880
The four billion people on Earth that still don't have internet

876
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:40,672
How to get online

877
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:42,208
Field have a great

878
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:42,976
Experience

879
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:44,000
NBA Bulls

880
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:46,560
To do so in a way that they

881
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:52,960
So much of the internet is really centralized in North America and west

882
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:56,544
The bytes call-out traffic

883
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,568
And that

884
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:58,592
That as

885
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:01,664
We get away from this place has the internet somewhat

886
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:05,760
Becomes actually much more expensive for those people who actually

887
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:10,368
Pay more for it.

888
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:12,928
Everything about how do you make sure that you

889
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:15,232
Creation on one side

890
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:16,512
And then democratized

891
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:18,304
Wow

892
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,072
All right

893
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:20,608
That's a lot to think about

894
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:22,144
What about old ways of doing

895
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:22,912
So

896
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:24,192
We have had

897
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:25,984
And actually this is something I've seen

898
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:29,056
Anglesey access and the kind of internet archive

899
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:30,592
Which is

900
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:31,616
Peer-to-peer Network

901
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:34,432
So we've had in historically things like

902
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:35,456
Napster

903
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:36,736
Original Skype

904
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:39,040
But then there was also really interest

905
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:40,320
Things about Distributing

906
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:42,112
Haitian with networks likes

907
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:46,464
One person had phone connectivity other people had this program

908
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,024
Your phone could talk to each other and backhaul using

909
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:50,304
Original phone

910
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,352
So how should we think about

911
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:53,888
Bringing those types of

912
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:54,912
Technologies

913
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:56,448
Forward or should we

914
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:57,984
Skip all that

915
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,264
And there's a new way to do

916
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:01,056
Yeah you know I think that

917
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:02,848
You know the nature of

918
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:03,616
Ecology

919
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:04,896
He is that

920
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:06,176
It moved in service

921
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:06,944
Sine wave

922
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,504
Overtime where you have a map

923
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:10,528
Dispersion

924
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:11,552
Validation

925
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:14,112
Networks will definitely

926
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:15,904
That went forward your network

927
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:17,952
Even when Micah

928
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:21,280
The way that's gay

929
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:23,072
It doesn't mean that

930
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:27,680
Life is always right

931
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:30,752
In those two things and constantly be fine

932
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:33,056
Disrupt whatever the reality was

933
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:35,616
Foreign and hopefully striving towards

934
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:37,920
More distributed more efficient

935
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:39,456
Secure future

936
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:40,224
The internet

937
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,248
Technology

938
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:43,296
Inside about

939
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:44,320
Is a protocol

940
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:45,600
Ipff

941
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:47,904
Interplanetary file

942
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:49,696
Is actually backed Limited

943
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:52,256
It means it was designed around the idea of

944
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:53,280
If you actually have

945
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:54,048
The internet.

946
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:55,328
Spam

947
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,864
The globular

948
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,144
But you actually had to happen

949
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:00,960
Planetary

950
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:02,240
That stops working

951
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:04,288
When you have to rely on be light because

952
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,336
Particle of light going from

953
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,128
Mars's

954
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,944
And so you can't rely on

955
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,504
Nutrition system

956
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,784
EBay net worth

957
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:15,808
Where continent

958
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:16,576
It's a trap

959
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:17,856
On an address

960
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:19,648
What ipff

961
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:21,696
Contact

962
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:22,464
On

963
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,768
The hash of the content

964
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:29,632
And then you can distribute

965
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:30,656
Tension

966
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:33,728
Some of the things that we were working on it with

967
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:34,752
Peer-to-peer Network

968
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:36,544
I didn't get a p switch

969
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,848
Not really interesting is when we

970
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:39,872
Two blocks

971
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:42,432
Chain and other cryptocurrencies

972
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:44,736
Could create some sort of incentive

973
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:47,808
I got a little bit of that

974
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:48,832
Striped bass

975
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:50,624
My server

976
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,928
Band with tears away that I can

977
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:54,208
Actually get compensated

978
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:57,280
There's been a lot of hype

979
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:59,328
Some of the cryptocurrencies and blockchain

980
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:02,912
That if you combine ability

981
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:03,680
To address

982
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:04,704
Contact

983
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,728
Actually content

984
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:10,080
With that it has

985
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:11,104
The current

986
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,384
The or other

987
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,920
Micropayment types

988
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:15,200
That might

989
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:16,480
Be away again

990
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:17,504
Democratizing

991
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:18,784
Internet

992
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:21,344
Protocol labs

993
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,112
Doing it

994
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:25,440
Really interesting I think you know that your body is around

995
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,232
And so

996
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:29,536
It's a

997
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:30,304
How can we

998
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:31,840
Together

999
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:33,632
I have the traditional internet

1000
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:34,656
With now this

1001
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,240
Weeks ago

1002
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:39,520
Support.

1003
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:40,800
Net worth

1004
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,080
So that you could

1005
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:43,616
Standard browser

1006
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,688
That's the interplanetary file

1007
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,760
And I guess I don't know that we know exactly what

1008
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:52,064
That's going to go but if we can be a gateway

1009
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,904
To make it so that more people can access these new technologies

1010
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:56,672
Cheap things to make

1011
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:05,632
Okay so we talked about distributed we talked about making things cheaper talked a little bit about some of the things

1012
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:06,912
Let's talk about

1013
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:08,192
Your birthday weekend

1014
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:09,216
So

1015
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:11,264
The last couple weeks you guys have

1016
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:14,080
Pinterest drop Inus left and right

1017
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:15,360
It's been kind of fun some of it

1018
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:17,152
I don't care very much about like

1019
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:20,992
For y'all but there are lots of things I do care about

1020
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:24,576
About was actually the bandwidth Alliance

1021
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:28,416
So talk to me just a little bit about what your goal is there

1022
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:30,976
Yeah so what the bandwidth alliances

1023
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:32,000
Citic group

1024
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:33,536
A provider

1025
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:34,816
Come together

1026
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:35,584
To say

1027
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,352
That

1028
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:37,632
We should reduce

1029
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:39,680
Cost of moving data

1030
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:45,056
Between different providers so typically if you're using a cloud provider

1031
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:46,592
Google Cloud

1032
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:47,872
Microsoft and IBM

1033
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:50,432
When you put it into them

1034
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:52,736
Do you want to take data back out

1035
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:54,784
Talk to you a lot

1036
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,904
You're a fat provider

1037
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,440
Alldatapro

1038
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:03,488
Ashburn Virginia where you got

1039
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:05,536
Your data center back the time user

1040
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:07,584
Cruise in Sydney Australia

1041
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,120
You got to pay for that

1042
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:11,680
With a number of dividers

1043
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,264
Is the markup on bandwidth

1044
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,800
Are extremely high but

1045
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:19,616
Barbie threesome

1046
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,920
The cloud provider

1047
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:22,688
They will

1048
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:24,992
My hand that data directly off

1049
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:27,808
I like pie

1050
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:30,624
Connected over was known as a private

1051
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:33,184
Literally

1052
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:38,304
It goes from your router

1053
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,840
To the top

1054
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:41,120
Something

1055
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,448
Beginning

1056
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,008
Bike that has no incremental

1057
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:49,056
Extending bandwidth

1058
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:52,384
Link and throw

1059
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:54,431
Was

1060
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:55,967
Not paying for the data

1061
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:02,879
No I think that the real leader here

1062
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:04,927
What's Google + Google

1063
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:06,719
2015 Prius

1064
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:07,487

1065
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:08,511
Intertek program

1066
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:10,047
And Papa was

1067
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:10,815
One of the

1068
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:13,119

1069
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:13,887

1070
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:16,191
Or gathering all the other Cloud providers

1071
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:17,215
Safeway

1072
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:18,751
Together

1073
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:20,543
Find a way that it

1074
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:23,103
You're changing bit in a way that the

1075
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:24,383
You

1076
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:30,527
The long-term value

1077
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:31,807
Is

1078
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:33,599
That if we can make it

1079
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:35,391
You can

1080
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:36,671
Say I'm going to pay

1081
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:37,951
Amazon

1082
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:39,999
Everything in Amazon stock

1083
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:42,047
What you know

1084
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:46,911
M4ai and that the Microsoft

1085
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:48,703
Stop

1086
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:53,055
Google interesting

1087
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:53,823
Stopwatch

1088
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:54,591
Bear

1089
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:56,383
Storage in database

1090
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:00,991
Heap data where they

1091
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:03,807
If we can make it so that would apply breakfast

1092
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:05,087
Mack Oliver

1093
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:07,391
Together without you have

1094
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:08,927
Pay to move your data

1095
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:13,279
Specialized

1096
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:15,583
And instead of everyone the same

1097
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:17,631
We get another thing them.

1098
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:22,495
I'm going to build the best agree for this one particular thing

1099
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:24,287
People will choose me for that

1100
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:25,567
Overall

1101
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:26,591
Open

1102
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:28,383
Overall ecosystem

1103
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:29,663
Significantly

1104
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:30,943
Amazon Safari

1105
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:32,479
Is the one major old out

1106
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:38,623
Good thing to do

1107
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:41,695
Okay and let's talk about another one of your

1108
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:45,791
It is tied to something that you guys.

1109
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:46,559
Spring

1110
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:48,607
Beyonce program called workers

1111
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:50,655
Really

1112
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:52,191
Interesting

1113
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:55,519
Been out for a while so I'd love to get an update on how people are using

1114
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:57,311
And then you guys also a noun

1115
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:58,591
Key Value Store

1116
00:43:58,847 --> 00:43:59,359
For workers

1117
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:00,383
Which

1118
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:02,687
I was really exciting like data could be

1119
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:05,503
All over the place and accounted for but tell me about that

1120
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:07,039
Yes boo

1121
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:09,855
Today

1122
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:10,623
Knott County

1123
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:15,487
Three generations of how you've been able to deploy Network

1124
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:19,583
Generation Y

1125
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:20,607
Application

1126
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,655
New bottle server

1127
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:24,703
And that if you needed a new

1128
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:27,007
The new application you bought a new server

1129
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:28,287
Cancel the deployment

1130
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:30,847
Time for that was measured in months

1131
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:32,383
In 1999

1132
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:33,919
The Next Generation

1133
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:34,687

1134
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:35,711
Is VMware

1135
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:38,527
Are there open source

1136
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:41,599
Allowed

1137
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:45,695
Electric at this point in time

1138
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:47,487
Your mom

1140
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:52,095
Coordinate with their people in order

1141
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:54,143
But

1142
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:55,935
You could actually take your unused

1143
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:59,007
Beyond servers

1144
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:00,031
On the phone

1145
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:06,175
Utilization of the

1146
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:09,247
The Next Generation

1147
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:13,599
Which is Amazon web services and all the other

1148
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:15,903
Cloud hosting providers

1149
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:18,463
Let's take your you think you have me on that episode

1150
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:25,631
Our infrastructure

1151
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:26,911
And that's a bet

1152
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:28,191
One time down

1153
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:30,239
From days a week

1154
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:31,519
2 minutes or hours

1155
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:33,567
In order to be able to do

1156
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:35,871
Still this model of man

1157
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:36,895
Adwa

1158
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:42,015
As if it was a verb

1159
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:43,551
Securities property

1160
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:45,087
Configure that everything else

1161
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:45,855
Template

1162
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:48,159
What we were doing with workers

1163
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:50,207
Creating what is that

1164
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:53,023
Generation 2 we all know what bare metal is

1165
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:54,559
GM.

1166
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:58,911
We don't walk around with a new idea

1167
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:01,471
Exotic

1168
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:05,055

1172
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:11,711
Wireless router

1173
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:12,735
You need

1174
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:15,551
Who are when you encounter

1175
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:18,879
Start getting incredibly quickly

1176
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:20,415
Cold start time

1177
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:22,975
I didn't meet a very efficient and with

1178
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:23,743
You don't have it

1179
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:24,511
Giant

00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:26,815
Feeling good in your laptop

1182
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,655
Different pieces of code run

1183
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:32,447
Next to each other

1184
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:34,495
Isolation from one another and

1185
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:41,663
The V8 engine

1186
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:43,711
And isolate and we deployed that

1187
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:45,247
As code running

1188
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:48,575
What was amazing about that is that

1189
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:49,599
Appointment time

1190
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:51,391
Down from what now is

1191
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:52,415

1194
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:58,047
2 minute

1195
00:46:58,303 --> 00:46:59,583
Down

1196
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:03,935
Workers you can write code

1197
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:05,215
Quit urin

1198
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:06,495
Iron Network

1199
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:10,847
Running on every one of them

1200
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:15,967
Machines out there and then you can look at it as if it is an individual

1201
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:16,735
Function

1202
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:18,271

1203
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:19,551

1204
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:21,343
And it will be available as

1205
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:22,879
I need whenever

1206
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:24,159
With almost

1207
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:27,487
Different model

1208
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:32,351
And that you didn't have a weight back

1209
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:41,055
So during our birthday weekend

1210
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:44,383
The amount that we would leasing a value

1211
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:48,223
Right

1212
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:48,991

1213
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:53,087
You only one of our Philadelphia

1214
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:56,415
Our system will figure out

1215
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:58,463
Consistency

1216
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:01,791
I meant

1217
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:07,423
You letting it in Vienna then we did in San Jose

1218
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:09,727
And it can be instantly available

1219
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:10,751

1220
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:12,543
How did RM

1221
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:14,335
Updated

1222
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:19,199
The ability to write

1223
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:20,479

1226
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:34,047
Earlier this week

1227
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:39,935
Mild webassembly

1228
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:41,215

We've now babe.

1233
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:57,087
Exciting

1234
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:01,439
I'm in the other dimension

1235
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:04,511

I'm at work

1240
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:15,519
And I think that if you can combine the thing

1241
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:16,543
Lola

1242
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:17,567

Voice recognition or additional intelligence

1257
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:56,735

1258
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:58,271

00:49:59,295 --> 00:49:59,807
New device

1261
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:04,671
But every device

1262
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:05,695
That we never stole

1263
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:07,231
And so what if we date

1264
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:09,023
The device is good at today

1265
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:10,815
A DUI portion

1266

In the network

1267
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:18,239
Are we going to have that short latency and high efficiency

1268
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:19,519

1270
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:23,615
Okay

1271
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:26,175
We should talk about

1272
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:27,455
Announce support

1273
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:30,015
For an iatf standard

1274
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:31,295
Quick

1275
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:33,343
So why don't I let you defy

1276
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:36,927
It's a quick really is a replacement for eggs

1277
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:40,511
One of the differences is that

1293
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:18,655
And if there's any noise or anything

1294
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:19,423
That might

1295
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:22,239
Interfered with any of the communication

1296
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:24,287
Where this really matter

1297
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:28,383
Devices that are

1298
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:29,663
Connected to a wire

1299
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:31,455

Gcp is that

1303
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:42,719
In those conditions where you see a y

1304
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:45,279
TTP is actually incredibly low on

1305
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:48,863
First of all it built

1306
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:50,399

1310

Is overwhelmed

1311
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:03,455
That could mean because somebody

1312
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:05,503
Turn on the microwave or

1313

00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:32,895
Where is a mobile device

1324
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:33,919
Will be able to talk

1325
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:34,687
Duet

1326
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:35,455
Quick

1327
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:36,735
And then behind

1328
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:37,503
Will still

1329
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:43,135
PCT in HDPE and all the things that standard web server

1330
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:44,415
The Wire

1331
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:47,487
We hope to bring the back

1332
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:48,255
World

1333
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:50,047
Connection

1334
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:51,583
From the device

1335
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:52,607
Wandering around

1336
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:53,631
Reebok

1337
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:54,399
Dude the Clown

1338
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:55,935
Out running

1339
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:57,215
The address of the internet

1340
00:52:57,727 --> 00:52:58,239
And then

1341
00:52:58,495 --> 00:52:59,007
Eubank

1342
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:00,799
Traditional protocol

1343
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:09,503
Do you think of this is again something that help make the internet

1344
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:11,551
Make it more on again tomorrow

1345
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:15,135
Is it something that previously

1346
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:19,231
Okay

1347
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:21,279
Think of your network

1348
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:22,559
Where can you register your network

1349
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:23,327
Is

1350
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:25,631
And I believe you said 154 City

1351
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:28,191
So because this is all tied back

1352
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:29,215
To you guys

1353
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:34,335
How do you answer the charge that idea that well are we just centralizing around

1354
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:35,871
Innovative

1355
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:36,639
Places

1356
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:39,199
Really

1357
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:45,855
Bride-to-be

1358
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:46,879
In terms of

1359
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:50,463
Pushing the internet over but doesn't require

1360
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:52,511
Beat the only provider

1361
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:54,303
Ipff

1362
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:56,351
Gateway between

1363
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:57,375
Browsers that don't

1364
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:58,399
What IP path

1365
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:00,191
Write the world

1366
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:02,239
But if you have a father

1367
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:08,639
Down

1368
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:10,687
People that use

1369
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:14,783
In awhile today

1370
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:18,367
Together

1371
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:20,159
What each other

1372
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:21,183
Thanks

1373
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:22,719
You know

1374
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:24,511
Connect directly to digital

1375
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:25,279
Great

1376
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:33,471
Stand-alone entity

1377
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:36,799
Protocol

1378
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:40,895
It's on

1379
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:44,991
Call what is a chicken-and-egg problem on the internet

1380
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:46,527
The browser guys don't want to

1381
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:53,439
And what we found it

1382
00:54:55,743 --> 00:54:59,327
If we can be kind of the first mover and solving the problem

1383
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:03,423
Standard

1384
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:04,703
I'm not going to give it enough

1385
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:08,799
Anything that we do

1386
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:11,359
Support on business

1387
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:18,015
Back more than

1388
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:19,807
And

1389
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:25,951
Then again

1390
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:27,487
The only way that you can get online

1391
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:30,303
Awesome

1392
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:33,375
