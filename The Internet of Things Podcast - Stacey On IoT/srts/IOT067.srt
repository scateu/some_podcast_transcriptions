00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:14,848
Kevin tofel

4
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:16,896
And this week on the show we got to

5
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:17,920
Awesome stuff

6
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:19,968
Kevin installed an ecobee3 in

7
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:20,736
Discovered

8
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:21,504
Something

9
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:23,808
Difficult

10
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:26,112
We're talking about Pokemon go

11
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:27,904
Just because everyone's talking about

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:28,672
Pokemon go

13
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:31,744
We got a new outdoor camera from nest

14
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:32,768
Its first product

15
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:33,536
Forever

16
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:37,376
We got smart car news and some other big news in the IRT space

17
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:38,400
But first

Working on building connected product

21
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,568
Do it yourself

22
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:46,592
Its complex

23
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:48,384
Before you're up and running

24
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:50,688

X i v e

35
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:13,216
Alright Kevin

36
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:14,240
Let's go

37
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:15,776
Take it off with

38
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:18,336
I don't know let's talk about your LG experience

39
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:24,736
Yeah what's up I think I said in the last show that I was moving and we did move in between then and now

40
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:26,272
Still unpacking but

41
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:29,344
I want the first things I did once I had

42
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,904
Found my new ecobee3 that I ordered

43
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:33,184
I try to install it

44
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,976
Well as anybody who

45
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:37,536
Has any covino's in for those who don't

46
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:38,816
It really needs

47
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:42,656
5 wires coming out of wall for the thermostat

48
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:44,704
Tips on being a common wire

49
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:49,568
And that is for I'm not mistaking just for the power the power up to

50
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:52,128
Keep the power on on the ecobee thermostat itself

51
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:53,920
Because if the ecobee has a

52
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:54,944
Touch screen

53
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,736
Explains on sofa

54
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:57,504
What's so

55
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,784
I only have 4 wires

56
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:00,576
Oh

57
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:04,928
Yeah but the townhouse that I moved into his Fulton mm so I'm not terribly surprised

58
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,536
You still have the original thermostat which was fine just a regular

59
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:10,304
Programmable

60
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,072
Thermostat

61
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:16,960
That shouldn't be a problem because included in any ecobee3 box is

62
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:18,240
Say happy birthday call

63
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:19,264
Tek

64
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,568
I forget what it stands for basically

65
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,176
Standard kit

66
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,200
So

67
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:29,760
If you use that or need that which I did

68
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:34,624
You actually have to crack open your HVAC system and find the circuit board of it which

69
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,160
Found no problem

70
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:40,256
And there I found 5 wires and 5 terminal

71
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:42,304
I'm like okay cool

72
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,584
The PCAT

73
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:46,144
As I understand it would essentially does is

74
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:49,216
You connect the 5 wires of the PE

75
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:49,984
Hey

76
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,544
To the circuit board of the HVAC system

77
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:55,872
And the wires you from HVAC system

78
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:58,688
You connect to the inside of the p e k

79
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:00,224
Any basically Bridges

80
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,016
5 wires into 4 I think it

81
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:08,672
Ty's the power through the yellow or green wire don't quote me on that but essentially kind of creative virtue

82
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:09,952
Show common wire

83
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:10,976
Got it

84
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,024
Yeah that's how it's supposed to work

85
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,352
Well no matter what I did once I hooked it all up and

86
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,424
And putting HVAC system back together and all that

87
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:25,056
Then showed power like the screen was on which was awesome cuz it wasn't on the first time

88
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:27,360
Without a common just to see what

89
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:28,896
I knew it was kind of

90
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,176
But basically

91
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,200
The thermostat work

92
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,992
You couldn't control it because you couldn't see it

93
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:36,320
So once I use the p e k

94
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,880
I had power d4b everything was good

95
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,952
Except when the air conditioning won't turn on

96
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:46,304
You would actually only blow the fan so the compressor outside was not on there was no

97
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,584
Cold air coming in

98
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:48,864
You have to realize

99
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,400
When we move last week

100
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:55,776
It was. 95 degrees and 90% humidity so we couldn't live without

101
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:56,544
Are

102
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:59,360
So am I, I don't have time to deal with this right now

103
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:05,248
Unconnected everything and reconnect it back to the original thermostat and then reconnected everything correctly

104
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:08,576
The HVAC system and just had air Michael do with his later

105
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:12,160
I found an excellent article on

106
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:15,232
Steve Jenkins blog and hopefully we can put it in the show notes

107
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,000
We will

108
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,559
Super it explains exactly what you need to do

109
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:20,351
What my issue was

110
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:23,167
In particular in every HVAC system is different of course

111
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:26,751
I had multiple wires in the HVAC

112
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:29,567
System control board connected to the same terminal

113
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:30,847
Send

114
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:35,199
Instructions are clear but they're not going to deal with every single

115
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,735
Nielsen arioso

116
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:41,599
I didn't realize I needed to keep certain wires connected and remove other wires and all that

117
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:43,647
And the last time I did this

118
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:45,695
I thought I had hit the

119
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:49,279
Switch on the HVAC system to flip the breakers in a power is going on and I

120
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,047
Didn't

121
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,839
And fortunately

122
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:54,911
When I was connecting some wires in there it's pretty tight space

123
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:55,679
Two waters

124
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:56,959
Are supposed to touch

125
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:57,983
Actually did

126
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,007
I had a spark

127
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:02,335
All of a sudden a little LED on my HVAC control board

128
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:07,199
Went dead and like all know I've got to control board

129
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:09,503
And it's really hot outside but I was

130
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,039
How to say was in a panic

131
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:17,439
I sat there after retinol over the shock as well I sat there just rubbing my fingers getting feeling back

132
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,719
And

133
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:19,743
Then I realize

134
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:23,583
There's a fuse on my control board in the HVAC system

135
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:24,863
I pulled it out

136
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:25,887
Turn off at 3

137
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:26,655
Fuse was

138
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:27,423
Alone

139
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:30,495
Which is that's yeah that's better than losing

140
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:32,543
Exactly

141
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,823
Exactly of course

142
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:37,407
We still had boxes everywhere I didn't have spare fuses so I went out to my

143
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,175
Car

144
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:42,015
When is the fuse box in my car that lowest amperage I can find them

145
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:42,783
Spare fuses

146
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:46,623
I make money just put this in and see if it

147
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,391
Brings back

148
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,671
Controller back to life

149
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:49,695
I did that

150
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:51,999
My LED popped up

151
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:56,095
I connect everything properly / Steve Jenkins article

152
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,887
Upstairs cast of the air

153
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:58,911
We had air condition

154
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,215
It all worked out in the end

155
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:04,031
It can be tricky and even say an eagle be instructions

156
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:06,591
If you need to install the Tek

157
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:10,431
They warned you you're going to have to mess with your control board of your HVAC system

158
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:14,783
You may can I come without you may want to get electrician etcetera etcetera of course

159
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,575
On everything

160
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,855
So I can do that

161
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,879
Yeah well

162
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,695
So Kevin's like

163
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:22,975
The wire hot

164
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:31,167
I'm going to install an HVAC system in the summer which is also the only time I install my new age

165
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:33,983
Back hurt my new thermostats and I

166
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,519
When we installed

167
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,287
Ecobee

168
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:40,895
And we did the ecobee smart SI cuz I installed 9 years ago

169
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:41,919
I know I need a

170
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,711
I'm sorry but

171
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:45,503
We actually had a similar problem

172
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,527
We actually had a

173
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,599
Because we had a 2-stage heat pump

174
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:52,671
You messed up our wiring a little bit but

175
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:54,975
Peekaboo people were super nice they haven't

176
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:56,255
Awesome support

177
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,279
2

178
00:06:57,535 --> 00:07:02,143
If I don't know if Steve Jenkins had written his article cuz that did not come up in my Google searches

179
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,935
When I was dealing with this but

180
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,215
Let Kevin

181
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,751
Experience piano lesson

182
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,543
Not a lesson that

183
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:09,311
It's too hard

184
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,079
You shouldn't do it

185
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:13,663
Because you totally should I have never wire to thermostat and things are really

186
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:14,687
It's not hard

187
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:18,783
It's not I mean pretty much every HVAC system has

188
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,343
At least four wires maybe five

189
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,671
The ecobee system the kit

190
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,719
Should be able to manage it

191
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:27,743
No matter what

192
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:30,303
Give or take him in or what your situation is

193
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:35,679
Don't go what one word of advice don't go by the color of the wires because not every installer

194
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:42,335
Puts a red wire on the red terminal Green Mountain Regional Center Etc so make sure you're looking at what the terminals are more

195
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:45,151
As opposed to just looking at wire colors

196
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,455
But it really is easy it is

197
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:51,551
Honestly if I knew what I was doing the very first time if I had Steve's instructions

198
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:53,087
That would work for mice

199
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:53,855
Scenario

200
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:57,951
It probably was a 10-minute install literally maybe 15 is

201
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:59,487
It's not that difficult

202
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:02,047
Bright but would you like

203
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,071
I have no AC

204
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,351
It's 95 degrees

205
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,375
Yeah

206
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:12,799
The clock was running and I didn't want to everybody in my house to be like super hot especially if we have you know

207
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:16,895
Pakistan Pakistan live pets and it's just not good for anybody in this heat so

208
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:20,735
Needless to say it's all working yes I blew the fuse hello spark fixed it

209
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:25,855
Diego beats working fantastic I have included remote sensor which does presents and temperature

210
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:27,135
That's in

211
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:31,231
Right here in my office cuz that's where I am most of the day up on the second floor so

212
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:36,095
Ecobee will not go to away mode when I'm not downstairs like my Nest ID

213
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,375
Because of the sensor

214
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,191
Nice and you can actually buy extra sensors

215
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:44,287
Pro tip

216
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,567
Amateur tip

217
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,335
Is

218
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,103
1

219
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:49,663
Don't wire hot make sure you turn off your breaker

220
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,455
Into

221
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:53,759
I know, I thought you knew but

222
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,039
My bad

223
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:56,575
The other two

224
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,367
Is take a photograph

225
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:01,951
Of your wiring before you start removing wires

226
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:02,719
I do this

227
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,255
Before any install

228
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:06,047
You know I take off that plate

229
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:07,839
I'm faced with wires

230
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,887
It's stuck under Terminals and I'm like

231
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:10,655
Oh

232
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:12,703
This is so awesome in your gut

233
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:14,495
Changes like to start on wiring

234
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,263
No

235
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,079
Close up photo you are dead on

236
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:23,967
Correct on that and I actually did do that both at the thermostat and the HVAC control board before I mess with

237
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:24,735
Anything

238
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:28,063
I'm glad I did since I had to redo my wiring at the thermostat

239
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:31,135
Dancehall the first time

240
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:36,511
And I would have forgotten it like that a red jumper cable was actually between two terminals

241
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,047
My old thermostat so

242
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:38,815
Yeah

243
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:41,119
I still have the photos I probably will never get rid of them

244
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,167
You just never know

245
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,727
Dropbox file

246
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,263
Wiring photos

247
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,311
All right

248
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:51,359
So that's Kevin's experience

249
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:57,759
Don't let it scare you it's not scary please install and uninstall thermostats to your heart's content

250
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:00,063
It's super fun and worthwhile to feel like

251
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,599
I am the master of my home

252
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:04,671
Badoo turn off the breaker though okay

253
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:06,207
Let's talk about

254
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,231
The hottest

255
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:08,255
Staying since

256
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,279
My God

257
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:13,375
A Nintendo Wii maybe I can remember how people were like so hot

258
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:15,423
Now we're hyped up on

259
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,959
Pokemon go

260
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:18,751
It's interesting its and it's

261
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:19,519
You know

262
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:22,079
Nintendo mobile

263
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:28,479
Market that's transformed everything the past couple years until recently they put out me told me game

264
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,759
I think that's what it's called

265
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:35,903
Avatars basically it's a little social network he kind of thing and it was okay I installed it

266
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:39,743
I did not install Pokemon go which is an augmented reality game

267
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:43,839
From the same folks that created Ingress which I did used to play

268
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:47,423
Both of these rest created in conjunction with nianticlabs

269
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,471
Which was a Google company

270
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:53,055
Then was spun off as an independent company when Google

271
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:57,663
Transform into alphabets we can not an alphabet company it's now a standalone company

272
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,199
And

273
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:04,575
Basically you just like Ingress or people are familiar with that you run around you know how the real world and

274
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,879
There might be a Pokemon nearby and

275
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:10,207
You look at your camera on your screen on your phone which has access

276
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:10,975
Set the camera

277
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:12,767
So the screen is showing your

278
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:18,143
World around you that you can see and then occasionally will show a Pokemon that you have to capture and so on so forth

279
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,679
I didn't install it

280
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:24,799
I did ask my stepdaughter to yesterday and she's like I don't want to do it and then sure enough once she did

281
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:26,079
She's been playing it all the time

282
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,407
Awesome and I haven't installed it because

283
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,175
The one

284
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:30,943
When I was

285
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,735
Ready to install it

286
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:37,087
The servers were down or having trouble so I was like all I'll come back and get it then I was like

287
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:39,391
Plus I'm on vacation in

288
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:42,207
Nowheresville made so actually might be interesting

289
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:42,975
To see if there are

290
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:48,351
The points cuz there's probably far fewer people out there in general

291
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,911
And that doesn't mean there's fewer Pokemon capture

292
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,191
That's true

293
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:52,959
So

294
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:55,519
What's interesting in there a couple things that are interest

295
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,799
1 is

296
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,079
A lot of the social

297
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:00,639
Any other is this is a really

298
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:03,711
This might be the first mass-market use of AR

299
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,991
Which is augmented reality

300
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:06,783
Which is different from PR

301
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:07,551
AR

302
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:08,831
Superimposes

303
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:10,623
Digital stop on the real world

304
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:14,463
As opposed to BR which is like immersing all of you into an imaginary

305
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,231
Virtual world

306
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,279
And I've always been kind of

307
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:21,119
Alex Fierro had an AR game I don't know if you remember the little

308
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:27,263
I mean that they had this like game where you roll the ball and in like capture things

309
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:29,311
It was It was kind of fun but

310
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:34,175
And I think it over the real world is really with me

311
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:34,943
Making this

312
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,735
So compelling.

313
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,271
But

314
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:40,319
It's also posing a bit of a challenge

315
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:43,391
Because we've had people setting up Pokemon lures to grab

316
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:45,183
Tumblr people there with a then

317
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,207
Rob them

318
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,487
Their concerns from

319
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,511
People who

320
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:49,791
Are saying

321
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:54,143
That their homes or places like the Holocaust Music Museum

322
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,191
People are trying to catch

323
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,471
Pokemon

324
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:58,495
Fair

325
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:02,335
I think it's a really fun social

326
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:06,175
It is an end of the Holocaust Museum

327
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:10,271
Has me questioning why isn't there or should there be rather

328
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:15,391
A way to say my personal property or this Museum

329
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,671
Whatever this Landmark is

330
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:21,535
How do we make this out of bounds for these ar-type games because we don't want people

331
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:25,375
Visiting Holocaust Museum and not paying attention which really important there

332
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:27,679
Instead they're capturing imaginary Pokemon

333
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:31,519
There doesn't seem to be a way to do that yet and I think there should be

334
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,567
Well in and I stink

335
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:36,639
Niantic is probably recognized

336
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,175
Such a mess

337
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,711
Hector like holy cow

338
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:41,759
So I don't know if it'll be like

339
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:42,783
Their database

340
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:45,599
You know you can submit things kind of like you did

341
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:51,487
Google Maps

342
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,511
Crowdsourcing

343
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,279
Information

344
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,047
Like

345
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:56,095
And that would be kind of more interesting it

346
00:13:56,351 --> 00:14:01,215
Infinitely more scalable probably

347
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:03,519
You know you'd want to quickly be able to like

348
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:07,615
No this is this is not where you want to go

349
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:10,175
And that that would be kind of like a wave extra

350
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:10,943
Taobao

351
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:11,967
It'll be

352
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:13,503
I can't wait to see what they come

353
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:18,623
Hopefully they're coming up with something I know people are very impatient to hear this so

354
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,415
We'll see but

355
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,439
I think it's great

356
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,231
Only the best

357
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,535
The best use of AR that I've seen

358
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:27,839
People use it

359
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:28,863
For you know

360
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:31,679
Fixing machines I've always said it could be interesting

361
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,727
Assembly like Ikea furniture

362
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:40,895
It's worth noting for people who have not yet installed it they might have read some stories that

363
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:46,783
The app actually if you sign in with your Google account cuz you can either sign with Google or with a Pokemon account

364
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,319
Bassani with Google

365
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:49,855
Literally the app had

366
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:52,159
Full access to your Google account

367
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,183
Massive scope

368
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,463
That's a bad thing

369
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,487
Apus

370
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,791
And since that

371
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,839
Report came out it which was confirmed

372
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,631
At 9 second said it was a mistake

373
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:05,727
And they have actually created an update for the app that you can

374
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:11,871
You basically revoke all the permissions and then reapply permissions and it only has maybe your email address in your you're

375
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,919
Have your account name and your name and so on

376
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:16,991
They reduce the scope from like everything to

377
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:18,527
A lot less what it should only have

378
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,295
Not

379
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:23,647
No option have access to your full Google account save for maybe a Google app

380
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:26,207
Essay for Google

381
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,487
All right

382
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,511
We should o

383
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:29,791
Because we mention the word

384
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:31,071
We mentioned the G word

385
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,095
We should mention

386
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:34,143
Google home

387
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:35,935
Time

388
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:36,959
Not an idiot

389
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:39,007
Okay

390
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:41,311
Which is good because we're moving into nest

391
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:43,103
We're not going to talk a lot about the

392
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,127
Because

393
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,919
Our Guest today is

394
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,455
Google

395
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,991
What is a product manager

396
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,015
Of Nest outdoor

397
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:50,783
Camera

398
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,319
They don't have another camera

399
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:54,367
I know but now they do

400
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:56,671
New products from nest

401
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:58,207
So this is actually nest

402
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:59,743
What is launching an outdoor camera

403
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,023
And

404
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,815
What's notable here is

405
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,863
There's there's

406
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,399
That's just watching it

407
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,423
First new product

408
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,447
It was acquired by

409
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:10,239
If we

410
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,775
We don't count its revised

411
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:14,079
Dispersion of Dropcam which was kind of just like

412
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,103
Every brand

413
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:18,687
It was a Rebrand of a slight design shift but nothing like

414
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:23,039
We could debate whether it outdoor cameras really a design shift

415
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,063
But it is

416
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,111
You because

417
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,903
In this camera

418
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:30,463
What they did this is a very nice thing to do

419
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:38,655
Something that most people probably wouldn't think about which is the adapter so this is actually a wired camera for outdoors

420
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:42,239
And everyone's like

421
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:44,543
They make the adapter so weatherproof

422
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:47,615
Could sit under a bank of snow or in a puddle of water

423
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,455
And still work which means you can plug it into any outdoor

424
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:52,479
Outlet on

425
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:53,503
If you have

426
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:56,319
And so it makes it much easier install so

427
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:57,599
I actually thought that was

428
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,927
Did they say what this is going to retail for

429
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,975
This is going to retail for 199

430
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:04,767
Pre-order it as of

431
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:05,791
Today

432
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,071
Today being Thursday

433
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,095
And

434
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,911
It won't ship though until September

435
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:14,751
And we'll talk we'll talk about some of the other stuff

436
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:16,543
In the interview but we did wanted

437
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,335
But you guys know that that's out there

438
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,871
It is going to compete with

439
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:22,431
There's outdoor cameras from Arlo which

440
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:23,967
I'm working with now

441
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:26,527
I'm also in the fall we're going to get

442
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:29,599
An outdoor camera from netatmo

443
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:31,135
Call the presents camera

444
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,927
And then there's the stick up cam

445
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:34,463
I'm laying

446
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,487
Which is

447
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:37,535
Wireless but has its own solar panel

448
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:39,583
And they're all in

449
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:40,863
French they're all

450
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,911
At Darla's are bit more

451
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,447
Tampa Bay stations

452
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:47,775
Stick up cam

453
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:48,799
Presents

454
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,591
1-99 range

455
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,639
Cool and then

456
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:55,711
I see that if you have a nest aware so

457
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:56,479
Subscription

458
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:57,503
It person alerts

459
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,271
As well

460
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,295
Yes

461
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:02,879
Then and we talked about that it's basically the camera

462
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:03,647
What's a dog

463
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:04,927
Car

464
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:06,719
Useful for

465
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:08,511
Send a text Sharon

466
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,815
UA new products

467
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,863
New products

468
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,143
You can learn a lot more

469
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:16,447
Frowned upon this camera

470
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:18,239
After later messages

471
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:23,615
I was going to sing a little after these messages

472
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:26,687
Talk about

473
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:27,711
Smart cars

474
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:29,503
And not Tesla

475
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:30,527
Not Tesla

476
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:33,599
Alibaba

477
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:35,135
Which is the

478
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:37,695
I will call it China's Amazon

479
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:41,791
Yeah that's fair I I did not know I mean we knew they weren't e-commerce

480
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:44,351
Play before I did not know that

481
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:46,143
Working on

482
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:48,959
Their own operating system for iot

483
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:49,983
Yeah it

484
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:52,543
Well they had the Arduino board

485
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,639
And they have the you know a switch is there iot OS

486
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,407
And

487
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:01,247
They're putting that in this car that's going to retail for

488
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,783
I think it's about 23,000

489
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:05,599
Now they're not selling at us so

490
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,647
Don't get your hopes up

491
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:13,279
But what's Happening Here is there putting this OS in there with the idea of creating

492
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:15,071
A smart car that can

493
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:15,839
Payments

494
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:23,007
Work with internet services like radio services I don't know all the type of things in this

495
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:23,775
Because

496
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:28,639
This makes sense because they are an e-commerce as we said like the Amazon of

497
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:33,503
China and it seems to me that most of the at least initial features in the you know s

498
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:34,783
Inside this car

499
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:37,087
Are all Commerce related so you can

500
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,135
Reserve and pay for parking spaces

501
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,415
You can pay for gas you can

502
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,695
Pay for coffee so it

503
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:43,743
The key word is pepepe where I guess

504
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,279
Bye bye bye

505
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:47,839
So it makes sense it's almost like if Amazon weird

506
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:48,607
Put

507
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:49,631
It's

508
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:51,167
Don't say her name but

509
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,447
The Voice services

510
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:57,823
Voice services in cars natively

511
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:00,639
So that you could do the same thing just you know

512
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:02,431
I'm heading out to the movies

513
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,199
Histamine

514
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:04,991
Buy some tickets for me

515
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:08,575
Pay for my parking let me order food whatever it maybe

516
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:09,599
Anythink Commerce

517
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:10,623
Cremated ashes

518
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:11,647
It just kind of fit

519
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,999
I don't know that I want that in my car and I granted I can't get this car but

520
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:19,839
Could this be a trending if so I don't I don't know that I want to let me know

521
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,631
It just moves everything from the phone to the

522
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:22,655
Car

523
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,007
It's going to move everything

524
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:27,775
To the phone

525
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:29,823
And of the car and your home hub

526
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:33,919
The idea is that it'll be so deeply integrated

527
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:35,199
And hopefully

528
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:39,039
Like they're talking about this is a platform that works with Chinese smart cities

529
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:41,343
Imagine if you

530
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:43,135
You pulled up to a parking meter

531
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:46,719
It communicated with your car like a 2 hours of parking

532
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:47,999
It's going to cost you ten bucks

533
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:53,887
And the accounts already there so you don't have to download like an app for every city that you're in

534
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:54,911
I mean

535
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,191
That's why

536
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:57,983
It done well

537
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:00,543
Adam poorly than yes you're going to be like

538
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:03,359
Play Everybody's shouting at me to buy stuff

539
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:04,127
Everywhere

540
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:10,015
Yeah we can definitely reduce barriers to make it easier to buy things and

541
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:16,416
And get Services you know maybe that maybe going to a parking garage in your example and as you check in you know normally we get a ticket

542
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:17,952
Google search for space

543
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:21,024
He could actually say there's a space on level two

544
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:22,560
Spot47

545
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:23,840
And

546
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:25,632
Is it $10 do you want it

547
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:26,656
You know so yes

548
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:28,704
Makes things easier

549
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:31,008
But I worry because

550
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:35,360
All these different operating systems and platforms moving to

551
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,152
Other devices now you

552
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:39,968
I want to use the F-word Bonnie's at fragmentation you know

553
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:43,040
So I pull in with my car that maybe it runs a voice

554
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:45,088
Services not using her name

555
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:45,856
Not

556
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:46,880
You know s

557
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:48,672
The Amazon Echo

558
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:50,208
Play services

559
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,512
So you know then

560
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:54,816
I mean I'm sure I could pay through normal means

561
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:55,584
But

562
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:57,376
It's not a major mishap

563
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:59,680
But I just worry that you don't send

564
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:02,240
It adds complexity at the endpoints

565
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:03,264
You know

566
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,592
When things don't work it's going to be

567
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,128
Worse than ever

568
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,712
When you can't park in the garage or you can't

569
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:16,064
Well I mean I know people now that won't shop at places that do not take Apple pay

570
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,624
Android pay or Samsung pay

571
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:20,672
Gogoat someplace else

572
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:22,720
Because to them it's more convenient I don't

573
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:24,256
Like maybe I didn't care in my wallet.

574
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:29,120
So what are we going to do we're going to drive our car parking lot and see who they take

575
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:31,680
They work with you know S I can't park here

576
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:32,704
You know what

577
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:33,728
I don't want that

578
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:38,592
I don't think that I can't imagine people living room on the table like that but I could be wrong

579
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:39,616
People did do that

580
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:40,384
With Apple

581
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:44,736
They didn't enter coming back around now too and adding

582
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:47,552
Support for the different payment services when they tried to

583
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:48,576
Focus on

584
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:50,112
Using only one for that

585
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,672
Bright it's going to be harder

586
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:53,696
Before it gets better

587
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:54,464
Sadly

588
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:55,488
All right

589
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:57,792
Will hear some quick news we're going to run down

590
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:58,816
First off

591
00:22:59,072 --> 00:22:59,584
Canary

592
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:04,192
All In One Security device has signed a partnership this week with Liberty Mutual

593
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,216
End

594
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:08,544
This ties in with last week's podcast we had Ryan rice

595
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,568
II was at

596
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:11,360
American Family Insurance

597
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:12,896
I'm talking about

598
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:14,176
How people might buy this

599
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:14,944
Smart Home

600
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:15,968
So

601
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,552
Canary with Liberty Mutual what's going to happen is you get a discount

602
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:21,088
If you have a canary

603
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:24,416
Canary also has a partnership with State Farm

604
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:25,952
You don't share all your info

605
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:29,280
Cremation you only share some of it but the idea of like being able to

606
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:31,840
Monitor things while you're away is really

607
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:32,608
Compelling

608
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,400
Shopping burglaries also

609
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:35,168
Compelling

610
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:36,448
So everyone wins

611
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:37,984
That should be good

612
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:39,264
Now I will stay

613
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:45,152
Canary was a partner with Apple homekit so if you are excited about getting a canary you may want to wait

614
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:47,968
The fragmentation issue

615
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:52,064
Because they're going to launch a second-generation product is going to be homekit compatible

616
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:55,648
And I know that a lot of people don't want to give up there

617
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:58,720
Personal information to get discounts on insurance

618
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:00,768
I kind of I understand that

619
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:06,144
But actually I'm doing it I'm doing it through Progressive with my auto insurance my wife and I both had to do a little

620
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,448
Odbc

621
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:10,496
Montreal the plugs in it Progressive gets

622
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:12,288
All of the data from our cars

623
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:15,872
And we get a discount in return for providing that data so

624
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:18,432
Any monies money I'll give it up

625
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:21,504
Next item on the news is

626
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:23,040
Let's see what is the next

627
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:24,832
GE

628
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,112
Predix

629
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:28,416
OTR

630
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:33,536
They signed a deal to partner with Azure so customers who are using critics as software

631
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:40,704
Hosted on GE predix cloud

632
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:46,080
Products which applications

633
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:48,640
Microsoft

634
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:49,920
And this is

635
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:51,712
This is actually

636
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:52,736
Grateful

637
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:55,808
So it's great for Michael

638
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:59,392
Because in my conversations with people

639
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,928
A big Industrial

640
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:01,696
Conglomerates

641
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:03,744
Their customers do not

642
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,584
I want to say they don't trust you either but they're like geru really a cloud provider

643
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,120
RIT Department

644
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:09,888
Feels better

645
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:10,656
Going with Mike

646
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:11,936
So

647
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:15,264
This is going to help GE get those customers who are like

648
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:21,664
I don't know about your Cloud it may be awesome but my it department is not keen on that you know cuz what's happening is

649
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,224
OT. Operational tag

650
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,784
Can the industrial tech people there like we love GE

651
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:27,808
But it Department

652
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:30,880
Has to get involved now with I like the industrial internet-of-things

653
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:32,672
I love Microsoft

654
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:33,696
So

655
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:35,488
This deal makes a lot of sense

656
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,376
And it's great for pretty much everyone involved in GE will still have its own cloud

657
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:43,424
For people who want to just stick their stuff there

658
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,960
But I imagine a lot of

659
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:46,496
Microsoft in

660
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:50,080
Let me just tell you Microsoft is either a marketing genius

661
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:52,384
Or they're really winning

662
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,664
A lot of iron

663
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:54,688
Deals

664
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:56,736
They've been killing it on the other side

665
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:58,016
Honestly

666
00:25:58,272 --> 00:25:59,552
Obviously battling Google

667
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:01,856
Amazon Amazon web services

668
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:04,160
Several other traditional Cloud players

669
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:08,000
So this is I think they're doing really well they're doing what they need to do

670
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:09,024
Is

671
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:09,792
Stay

672
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:10,560
Relevant

673
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:11,840
In this club Meets World

674
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,656
So the other

675
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:19,264
Piece of news is really an app recommendation I did do this I'm on this week in Google

676
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,056
Recommended it there so you

677
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:22,336
You can just like skip ahead if you

678
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,360
I want to hear it again

679
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:25,152
But I had to tell everybody

680
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:26,688
The podcast because it's

681
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:31,808
It's called Alexa Alexa it's by the Unified

682
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,600
Unified computer

683
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:34,880
Intelligence Corporation

684
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,928
Yes ucic

685
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:40,768
If you Google Alexa and you see I see you're going to find it

686
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:42,560
It will put in the show notes as well

687
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:43,584
It's for iOS

688
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,120
Turn Android in all it does

689
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:46,144
Is you press a button

690
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:48,960
You bring it to your Amazon account

691
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:52,288
I thought you just press a button and you're like

692
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:55,104
Turn off living room lights you don't even have to say your name

693
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:55,872
And then

694
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:58,176
I didn't mean I've done it in my life

695
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:59,200
Wish I could say

696
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:00,736
C4 my netatmo camera

697
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:04,320
Is basically replicates the

698
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:06,624
Feature of the

699
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:08,928
Hardware remote that you can get

700
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:09,952
With

701
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:11,232
The echo

702
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,328
It doesn't play music so you can't set timers and you can't

703
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,424
But that's okay but but it's a software implementation of the hardware remote which is

704
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,448
Really clever

705
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:21,216
And this is

706
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:23,776
I thought it must have been eight months ago

707
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:25,056
It's not longer I said

708
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:25,824
I wish

709
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:28,128
This type of functionality was built into the

710
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,432
App that comes with the echo

711
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:36,832
You know why can't why do I need a Bluetooth remote to speak to the thing when I'm not in the same room that why can't I just use the app

712
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,624
Can my phone as microphone

713
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,208
Exactly how I do wish they would do a widget

714
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:48,864
That would be nice but are you 100% sure this is IOS as well because I'm looking icy it for Android

715
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:51,680
I lied to you you're right it is

716
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:52,448
Only

717
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,216
Android

718
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:55,264
Sorry so sorry people with the iOS

719
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,568
Tell if your side just went out from the iOS

720
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:59,360
Oh

721
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:02,944
So that I think

722
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,480
Is pretty much everything

723
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:05,760
That's all the News That's fit

724
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:08,064
I guess no need to talk about this week

725
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,600
Kevin Kevin was moving

726
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:11,904
And I am on vacation so

727
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:13,696
It's possible we missed some stuff

728
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:16,768
And you know what will come Circle back to it

729
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:17,792
And

730
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:19,072
I'm still recovering from

731
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:19,840
Trying myself

732
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:21,632
Yes

733
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:24,960
Don't wire hot

734
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:25,984
Who

735
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,824
No so I want to hear more about the nest outdoor Cam and I think I know who's going to tell

736
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:33,152
Yes stay tuned for May who

00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:53,888
On device security we've been working in the space for the last decade

743
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:56,448
We're now the most widely deployed

744
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:57,728
Security solution

745
00:28:57,984 --> 00:29:01,824
For the iot with over a billion devices secured at this point

746
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:03,104
That is a lie

747
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:04,640
A devices

748
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:05,920
What goes into

749
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:06,944
Securing and IRT

750
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:10,784
So we think about three key things first of all

751
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:15,136
The the data in transit or the data between your device

752
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,928
And your cloud

753
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,256
So the the traditional are most popular way

754
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:22,304
To secure that data

755
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,584
Is through

756
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,424
The SSL protocol which is the protocol that is used

757
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:29,728
On the rest of the internet for securing

758
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:31,008
Data in transit

759
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,056
We also think a lot about

760
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:34,848
Securing data on the device

761
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:35,616
6 l

762
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:36,640
So encrypting

763
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:38,176
Data that you might

764
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:39,456
Have on your device that you

765
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:40,992
Needs to be private

766
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:43,296
And it finally we help companies

767
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:45,856
Make sure they're the firmware update

768
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:48,928
It's one of the clever things that attackers like to do

769
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:53,024
Two devices is install their firmware instead of yours

770
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:55,072
So what you need to do is Havasu

771
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:55,840
Secure Channel

772
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:56,864
To your device

773
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,192
The best way to do that the most common way to do that is through

774
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:01,216
SSL

775
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:04,032
And we do all of the above that's what we do

776
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:08,384
BrandsMart created where in Automotive

777
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,200
Industrial Automation consumer devices

778
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:12,992
In medical devices

779
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:15,552
And we address this wide range of markets

780
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:16,320
Through

781
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:21,696
A long list of Partnerships that we have with the silicone vendors in that the operating system vendors

782
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:23,488
Alright well

783
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:24,256
Refined

784
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:29,888
So just check us out and wolf ssl.com coyote

785
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:39,616
Hey everyone welcome back to the iot podcast I'm your host Stacey Higginbotham

786
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:42,944
And today's guest is mehu manual

787
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,504
Who is a product manager for the nest

788
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,856
Easier to talk about this big news today which is the release

789
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:53,184
New outdoor security camera

790
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:54,976
Hey man what are you doing

791
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:57,024
I'm getting great thanks for having me

792
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:58,560
Really appreciate it

793
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:00,352
I am super excited

794
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:01,376
Because

795
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:02,656
I love Outdoors

796
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:05,216
Security cameras I'm currently testing the Arlo's

797
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:07,520
I have an order in for the netatmo welcome

798
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:09,824
So now I'm like oh my gosh

799
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,360
Come September I should

800
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:12,384
Check out the

801
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,920
Nest outdoor cam

802
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:17,248
Tell us a little bit about what you guys were thinking

803
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,040
When you decided to go

804
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:19,808
Design

805
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:21,088
Sure

806
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:24,672
Take a step back

807
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:29,792
All experience using Nest cam indoor and we decided on a place of peace

808
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:31,840
That you wanted to go to the camera on

809
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:33,888
And yet realized after you

810
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:35,424
Joseph dropped MN

811
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,984
Users had told us

812
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:40,800
They want to use camera

813
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:45,920
If you want to secure their homes the benefit they when I get out of this protect their own

814
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:48,992
And if they want to protect their home

815
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:52,064
Look around today your security cameras better

816
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:53,856
Market

817
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:57,184
And you realize that most of the cameras either

818
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,744
Rely on a motion light sensor

819
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:05,120
And unfortunately this resulted in a camera

820
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:05,888
Either

821
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:07,168
Off all the time

822
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:10,240
Essentially dependent on Angela. Sanchez

823
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:13,312
Oscar results

824
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:14,848
And the question

825
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:17,664
As a user if you wanted to buy a camera

826
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,200
Woodley traffic camera

827
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,992
That actually stays off all the time

828
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:26,624
You know how can security camera be a camera that sees off all the time

829
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:31,232
An answer was very clear to us that we had to go to camera

830
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:34,048
Add stands guard 24/7

831
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,120
We also wanted to go to Canada Actually

832
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:39,680
130 degrees

833
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:41,728
Indian Knight and Day

834
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:46,848
Absolutely athletically beautiful so that my wife would actually

835
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:51,456
House vs bee industrial design that typically does cameras have

836
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:53,760
And lost

837
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:57,088
But actually texted bondage of the machine learning

838
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:58,624
That is available

839
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,392
Bill vision

840
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,744
Westchester

841
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,024
Pain

842
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:06,304
Okay

843
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,096
So let's dig into this little bit

844
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:09,888
The camera is

845
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:12,192
Wired so I have to have it plugged in

846
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:18,848
Are you told me that is ip65 rated which means it's good for rain dust and other outdoor use

847
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,152
It's adapter

848
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:25,504
Is actually a higher rating so I guess you told me it could be buried in snow which is super fun

849
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:27,296
I would love that here in Austin Tech

850
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:28,832
But that's okay

851
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:30,624
Mine is more like it will it melt

852
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:35,488
Beyonce all the cameras that are wired

853
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:39,584
Available sounds of your life that as a user of how to drill a hole in my

854
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,400
On walls actually take the virus the doctor

855
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:43,168
Bikes

856
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:46,752
Which essentially difficult puzzle DIY because yfu

857
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:50,080
Uses of calendula research

858
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:52,128
So what we did is we designed the first

859
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:53,920
Apple wireless adapter

860
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:57,248
Mitch is IP67 radio dimensions

861
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:58,528
/.

862
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,344
Inside a small being a pot of water

863
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:07,488
And I don't obviously recommend to put it inside of puddle of water

864
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:08,512
Videos season

865
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:11,584
Weather

866
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:15,936
And you could easily plug into your outdoor outlet installation

867
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,472
Got it yes

868
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:22,336
Because that is the reason most people are like sacrificing your wireless camera

869
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:23,872
I just don't want to mess with

870
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:24,896
Treeland stuff into

871
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:25,920
My house which is

872
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:26,688
Intimidating

873
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,016
Before you get to the software is

874
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:32,320
You guys have a microphone on this camera

875
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:35,392
Which I thought was kind of interesting because it means

876
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,952
I could talk to people and they can talk back to me

877
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:39,488
Why did you

878
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,656
Just realized the bunkers

879
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:49,216
Number one that's Run for the burglars of Dialga

880
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:51,264
Camera camera

881
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,056
And wild and Luke kissing

882
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:57,152
Queen for the house that they want to work like that

883
00:34:57,408 --> 00:35:00,224
And if you can tell you is the camera there is a person in it

884
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:01,248
Camera

885
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:04,832
To get their attention and say hey

886
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:06,368
Why are you here okay

887
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:07,392
What's up can I help you

888
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:11,488
At that point in time and becomes a quite a bit of the trying to get their attention

889
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:19,936
That was a fighter

890
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:22,752
The second reason is that a lot of people you could just

891
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:24,032
Erin Broderick

892
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,312
Franchi Auto door

893
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:29,152
And that's right there is a delivery driver

894
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:44,000
So this seems like it might encroach a little bit on the video doorbell Market

895
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:47,072
Obviously you're going to tell me I should buy an outdoor nest

896
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:48,352
Instead of a video doorbell

897
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:50,144
Could these devices work

898
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,448
Together or do you really see them as

899
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:56,800
Little things that

900
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:14,976
Let's talk about software

901
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:17,792
You guys are introducing new software

902
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:18,560
4

903
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:21,632
This camera or is it a new Nest app for honest

904
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:22,400
Devices

905
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:25,472
It's a new one that's that for all NetSpend Eliza

906
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:27,776
Specifically for all net

907
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:33,920
Users and abusers

908
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:35,200
Will be able to use this

909
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:37,760
And then there are three critical

910
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:40,832
Teachers that were bringing it back

911
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:42,112
One of them is

912
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:45,952
Dropping users had enjoyed through.

913
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:48,000
We're bringing that to netcam as well

914
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:49,792
And that feature allows you to

915
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:51,072
Shadow video feed

916
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:52,352
Off your camera

917
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:54,912
Your neighbor out your nanny or two grandparents

918
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:59,520
II

919
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:01,056
Features are called spaces

920
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:04,640
And then as I mentioned early on little bit

921
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:07,456
Feature that allows you

922
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:13,856
Pictures of beautiful to rectangular few of the radio stations within that's how it in their house

923
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:14,624
Living room

924
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,928
Dining room wherever they have police camera

925
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:18,976
It is that a beautiful

926
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:20,000
What it takes

927
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:21,536
All the connected devices

928
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:25,120
Are protected or any other devices

929
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:27,424
Puts it in between the spindle space

930
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,704
Odoo user

931
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,984
Now I no longer have it

932
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,520
Think about whether this thermostat

933
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:34,080
Or downstairs living room or upstairs

934
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:35,872
Now the states of southeast

935
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:36,640
Easiest way to

936
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:37,408
Absolute

937
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:43,552
Teachers that we are introducing which is available to all natural

938
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:44,320
Subscribers

939
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:45,856
But has yellow on Dropcam

940
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,720
This feature is called person

941
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:53,536
And we really work

942
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:54,304
Hard

943
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,328
To understand

944
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:57,120
How to bring about the machine learning

945
00:37:57,376 --> 00:38:00,960
Nei capabilities into this cameras and what you're trying to

946
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:03,776
Did you get that human behavior

947
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:04,544
So

948
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,312
Does humans

949
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,664
But you know that it's not there not perfect

950
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:11,968
Because we miss the things and we sometimes

951
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,016
Communicating

952
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:20,928
When there's a person in front of the camera there are times

953
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,304
And I kissed

954
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,008
Might be hidden behind your mailbox

955
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:37,568
Kind of spending only face is visible

956
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:42,944
Or they're just walking towards a vehicle in between toe only torso

957
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:49,600
So then we actually give you an ability

958
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:51,904
Still get the alert by saying the hay

959
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:59,328
And the reason behind his back we realized that ultimate judgment ultimate decider is you

960
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:01,120
You're the owner of your home Georgia

961
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:02,144
The Protector

962
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,168
And you want to

963
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:05,216
Used machine learning and AI

964
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:06,752
To augment your intelligence

965
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:07,776
Not just

966
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:09,056
Give me the answer

967
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:10,080
Which is black and white

968
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:18,528
Would you also be able to do facial recognition on top of this because I know that I have the same UPS

969
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:22,112
A notification

970
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,904
From my outdoor Nest cam

971
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:30,048
That's a great question

972
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:33,120
As I mentioned early on

973
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:35,680
With this journey we've started about a year ago

974
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,776
Work that journey in this is some definitely something Vivint

975
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:40,544
Thinking about it

976
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:43,616
Trying to figure out what is the best way to provide the benefits

977
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:45,152
Can you set an alarm

978
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,456
Okay and then a question about spaces

979
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:49,504
What is the visual

980
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,528
Component is it

981
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:52,320
Actually the rooms of

982
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:54,880
An image of the rooms at the cameras in that I'm seeing

983
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:56,672
Or is it like an iconography

984
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:57,952
Groupthink

985
00:39:58,208 --> 00:39:58,720
Inspired rooms

986
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:01,024
So if you already have a nest

987
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:07,168
We have significant number of users with multiple next exercise their home then you will get the app

988
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:10,496
Show live view on the spaces that bus cameras belong

989
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:12,544
What's the weather in living room or backyard

990
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,104
I'll try and Yarbrough upstairs Loft

991
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:16,896
Thermostat does not have

992
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:17,920
The actual

993
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:19,712
Next time. Just be obvious

994
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:22,016
You have to use iconografia some of the rake

995
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:24,064
Create spaces and allow users

996
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:29,952
Can you control other Nest devices from that view or do you just see like

997
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:32,768
Oh there's a thermostat here and it said a text

998
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:38,400
You can easily tap on the same icons that you had the same

999
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:39,168
Concept

1000
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:41,728
Tap on it and easily

1001
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:43,520
Think about it

1002
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:44,288
Is that

1003
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:46,080
As you bring number of devices

1004
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:47,360
Number of connected devices

1005
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:48,384
For your home

1006
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,456
Lolly as a user you would want one app

1007
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:53,760
But you're going to want

1008
00:40:54,016 --> 00:41:00,160
But this is a really easy day for you sister navigate the various connected devices.

1009
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:00,928
If we

1010
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:02,464
Inside their home

1011
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:10,400
And there are many press reports earlier about Nest developing some sort of security home security hub

1012
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:15,520
And is that something that still under development or does this kind of

1013
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:16,288
Portfolio free

1014
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:17,824
JCPenney

1015
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:21,664
Different categories in brightness for all this evaluating

1016
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,456
Vegas

1017
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:26,784
Want to do what is right by customers on

1018
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,320

00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:39,328
Kind of working with nest

1026
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:41,376
You guys have so many partner

1027

Thinking about here it's

1029
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,240
Yasso Alden

1030
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:47,264
Converse with nest

1031
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,336
Integration that Nest cam indoor has but harness them as

1032

Protect

1036
00:41:56,735 --> 00:42:00,319
You know if there is a security man that's come automatically turns on at the court

1037
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:03,903
Regardless of whether you have a nest aware subscription or not

1038
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:05,951
We will do the same thing here as well

1039
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:07,231
In a similar fashion

1040
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:13,887
Philips Hue Philips Hue if there is an activity detected you can set your Philips hue light bulb

1041
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:14,911
Turn on automatic

1042
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:17,215
And it all the snack that 8tracks

1043
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:21,823
Integration that we already have into enough tomorrow
