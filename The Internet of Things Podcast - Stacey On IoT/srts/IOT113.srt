We got news from it

7
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:29,952
We've got some Amazon Echo Integrations worth talking about and

8
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:31,232
I'm going to do a little

9
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:33,024
The wrif on light switches

10
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:34,560
My God

11
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:37,888
Exactly

12
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,264
Is Michael Bell the CEO of Silver Springs who's going to talk about

13
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:45,312
Smart grid and what we can expect

14
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,640
Our Generation and our utilities in the future

15
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:51,968
And we have a message from our sponsor Arris

16
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:53,248
But first

17
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,904
Let's go to a message from another one of our sponsors to sponsor is be smart Kitchen Summit it is the old

23
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:33,952
Let me know

24
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:34,976
We can meet up

25
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:36,000
Okay

26
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:36,768
Kevin

27
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,352
Let's get started shall we start with Google or should we just start with something

28
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,120
Easy like Ikea

29
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,984
I kind of feel like we should start with Google because the last

30
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,336
Show we did we recorded a couple hours before the Google IO Keynote

31
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:52,128
And there's so much stuff

32
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,408
That was discussed

33
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:54,176
There was

34
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,200
First

35
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:56,736
Let's get

36
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,016
Your disclosure

37
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:03,392
Oh yes I work for Google as a full-time consultant not in there

38
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:06,976
Anything related to its smart home or iot or anything like that

39
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:07,744
Syria

40
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,024
Now we know Kevin

41
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,816
You get my honest opinion

42
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:13,120
How old is so honest

43
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,984
Are you going back that should tell you everything

44
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,288
At the

45
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,056
Keynote

46
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,848
With Sundar pichai and

47
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:23,872
The assorted cast

48
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:24,896
Google favorites

49
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:29,504
There was a lot of people who are like

50
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,528
That is true

51
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:31,552
I didn't think it was

52
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:32,832
Cuz there was a new

53
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,624
Processing unit

54
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,696
Really nothing gets me more excited than chips

55
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:38,976
So

56
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:40,256
Custom architecture

57
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:43,072
Fight for our audience

58
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:45,888
I went through and watched a lot of B

59
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:47,168
Presentations after

60
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:47,936
Edwards

61
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,728
I said I was super excited

62
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,520
This show is all about

63
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:55,360
Contacts so last year Google was all about artificial intelligence

64
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:57,920
And how that was going to be the foundation

65
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:59,456
For everything that Google does

66
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:01,760
This year they put that to work

67
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:07,136
In ways that are pretty compelling so the idea is when you have Computing everywhere

68
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,208
And we as mere humans are like

69
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:10,976
Well

70
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:15,072
How can we interact with this stuff without giving complex commands

71
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,864
Things without screens

72
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:18,912
The answer to that is

73
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:24,032
How did the computers figure out where you are or what you're most likely to do in that situation and then

74
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:26,336
Present a more limited kind of choice.

75
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,640
Is that a fair way of saying huge

76
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:31,968
I think it's a fair way saying that and I think

77
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:33,760
There were people that thought though

78
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:40,160
Keynote in the show itself was kind of boring because there were no devices and what those people I think have forgotten is that it's a devel

79
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,184
Ella prevention

80
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,536
Granted there have been new products released at Google IO in the past

81
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:48,608
But like you said this was really all about

82
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:52,960
Advancing the contacts that type of information right place right time

83
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:55,264
Kind of thing and

84
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,288
That's

85
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,312
Ingested

86
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:01,664
The future sokolov you were like other showing as a future that's always right around the corner

87
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:07,552
You got to start somewhere you know when you got to you got to put the platforms out there for the developers to take advantage of

88
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:12,160
In a sense they actually did really quite a bit so on a smartphone

89
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,720
I got really excited because they

90
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:17,791
Talk about how you can build apps easily

91
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:19,583
For Google Assistant

92
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:23,935
Which is the brains behind your phone it's

93
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:29,567
It might be in your car and it is most importantly the brains inside your Google home

94
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:33,151
A speaker that competes with the Amazon Echo

95
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,455
What they've done

96
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,223
Apparently

97
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:37,759
They've created

98
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,551
Smart home apps

99
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:42,623
Which is on the actions on Google platform

100
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:45,183
Going to be a lot of words about to happen

101
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:47,743
Actions on Google is

102
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:48,767
The

103
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,559
It's the platform for building

104
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:51,327
Things for the

105
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,351
Google Assistant

106
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:54,143
Basically

107
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:57,727
Short version of this is hey it's really easy now to build

108
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,263
Google

109
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,287
Home app

110
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,311
Creations

111
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,847
And they said they

112
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,639
Have now 70

113
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:11,295
App integration so if you go to devices for your Google home you're going to see a lot more stuff and he said that in the last 6 weeks most

114
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,063
Those were at

115
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,599
Which is amazing

116
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:14,623
So

117
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:18,975
Right now the Amazon Echo has over 10000 skills

118
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,511
Like / 200

119
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:22,815
20 of them are smart home related

120
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:25,887
And what I'm saying is like they're not there yet

121
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:26,911
But holy cow

122
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:29,215
They just need a really easy to do it

123
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:30,239
And they have

124
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:32,287
Nothing about this is

125
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:34,335
They've done it a couple different ways so they've got

126
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,871
Your device types

127
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,663
They got their overall structure

128
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:38,943
We just kind of like

129
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:44,063
What is this stick out the room they think of it in three ways so structure room into ice

130
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:45,343
Room is

131
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:47,647
A label you put on your device

132
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:49,439
And it knows what devices

133
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,463
In the quilting is

134
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:52,767
Devices are basically device schemas

135
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:53,791
So

136
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,583
What words will

137
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,863
Change this aspect

138
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:00,959
I said has trades that has state it has all of this information

139
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:03,519
And they got stuff for that already for lights

140
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,287
Thermostat

141
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:06,335
Cats and they're going to be adding a whole lot

142
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:11,199
Hopefully for locks too cuz I still can't see my locking

143
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:11,967
Google assist

144
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:13,247
Oh yeah you can

145
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,271
Isaac

146
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:16,319
Like I know

147
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:20,159
I asked the echo all the time and then

148
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,183
Same here

149
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:28,863
So this is really cool I really highly recommend you go check this out and

150
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:33,471
If your developer trying to build this stuff because it it almost looks so easy like I could do it

151
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,007
But probably not

152
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:38,591
And other nice thing is it's super easy to do this

153
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,711
But they also require you to send them a device but

154
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:44,991
Prove your

155
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:47,807
Integration and that's great cuz they're going to do

156
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,879
Lots of testing there testing for latency

157
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,415
Adjusting that works

158
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,719
And that can be kind of like a certified

159
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,487
Vacation

160
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,255
Program there

161
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:57,535
So

162
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:02,655
It's not just two apps it's actually bring assistant putting assistant invoices third-party devices

163
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:03,679
So yes

164
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,215
Status status

165
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:05,983
What I was taught

166
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,263
But yes

167
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:10,335
That is also a thing they talked about you want to talk about that

168
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,895
Google Assistant SDK in other devices

169
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,455
I didn't watch

170
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:20,831
No I don't want

171
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:23,391
I didn't I didn't have to I was working during the

172
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,695
I did not see that

173
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,719
I just knew about

174
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:27,743
Guess

175
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:29,279
So yes

176
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:33,887
Much like Amazon

177
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:35,679
Adesa KC

178
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:40,799
Plus they actually have done something with their microphones

179
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:44,383
So they have a hardware reference design so you can build your own

180
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,663
Echo like device

181
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,943
Google has

182
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,759
Beliefs and SDK so you can put Google Assistant

183
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,295
Other things

184
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,575
Thanks right

185
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,415
There was a lot about

186
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,439
Android

187
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:01,535
And I'm still actually thinking about some of this and I'd love to talk.

188
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,071
People so if you're working with Android pay

189
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,351
Come tell me

190
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,119
What you think

191
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,399
Because my goodness

192
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:07,935
There was a lot

193
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,215
And I

194
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,287
I didn't know if I should be excited about this

195
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:14,335
Or if it was just another kind of

196
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:17,663
Bifurcated universe that I don't really want to

197
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:23,295
Google home cuz it's like we will work with everything

198
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,087
Even they are not Android

199
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:28,159
Although Android things does seem to offer some

200
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:28,927
Ankle supports

201
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:29,695
Nice secure

202
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:30,463
Dirty stuff

203
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,839
And speaking of Google home working with

204
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:40,959
Lots of things Google Assistant did come to IOS as had been rumored

205
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:43,775
That was announced and launched a Tayo

206
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,055
So

207
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,335
Get an iPhone

208
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:52,479
Have you can use Google Assistant with your school and I don't know if you saw this but just some basic updates to home

209
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:53,503
Itself

210
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,807
Calendar appointments reminders

211
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:58,367
A proactive notifications are coming

212
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:05,023
Also interesting because we just talked about it for a week or two ago hands-free calls with Google home similar to what they are

213
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,047
Echo is doing

214
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,327
But like this

215
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:13,727
But I was going to save I think but better some could you could you could argue against that there's Simplicity in a

216
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,263
Echo to Echo

217
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,823
Video or voice call I get that

218
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:23,711
It's different than a phone call which Google home actually will do it will place a phone call

219
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:28,575
Hands-free to any of your contacts and you can choose to actually have your phone number

220
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:30,111
Sean today

221
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:33,951
Person before they pick up so you don't have to do that but that's always nice as well so

222
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,487
I would say it's better but

223
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:36,511
I don't know

224
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,559
No I I saw that and

225
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:41,375
That's way cooler

226
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,727
I thought so end

227
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:48,799
You know how the Amazons Fire TV

228
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,591
Platform if you have a

229
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:54,431
How to hook up to a TV and you use the voice search features

230
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:56,223
It shows you cards on the screen

231
00:09:56,991 --> 00:10:02,367
Assistant will do that on your TV with Chromecast later this year they're going to visual responses

232
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:06,207
So if you say what's the weather and it can actually show you the the weather cards on your

233
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:09,023
Screen via Chromecast

234
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,047
The Google home voice

235
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:10,815
Calling is

236
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:11,839
Later this year to

237
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,399
You are correct it's not

238
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,447
Out yet I think they showed it off

239
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:20,799
And some of the limitations it's going to be in the US or Canada

240
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:21,823
No cost

241
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,407
But you're right it in the coming months I'm looking at the official blog post now

242
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:26,687
Okay I was like

243
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,455
I don't

244
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,479
I don't have it

245
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:31,807
Yeah. We like to try the echo calling

246
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:32,831
But you're right

247
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,111
That's coming

248
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,903
In

249
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:38,975
When the rumors happened with the Echo Show

250
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:40,255
Which is the

251
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,023
The video

252
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,071
Touch screen screen

253
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,375
I said

254
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:47,423
I'm not super excited about

255
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:52,031
I bought one but I would be more excited if my echo screen

256
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:54,847
My Amazon Amazon released an echo

257
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:57,407
It had contextual awareness and sent

258
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:59,967
Data instead of to a dedicated screen

259
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:02,271
To the nearest or most appropriate screening

260
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:06,111
House in a way that's kind of what Google did

261
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,903
So like if you ask it for

262
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:12,255
Commute times it will actually end you can or directions to a place

263
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:14,047
You can tell it to send it to

264
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,071
Your phone

265
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:15,839
NFL

266
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:16,863
Which is

267
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,167
And same thing with the

268
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,983
Sending stuff to your TV

269
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,031
You can tell it to send it to your teeth

270
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,567
So it's not as automatic

271
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,615
Write this is bestie

272
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:28,639
And that's that's why

273
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:33,759
What I thought was super cool and super powerful

274
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:40,671
Again going back to this idea of context the Google home device can recognize up to six different voices

275
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:43,487
It's so when I tell it to call Mom

276
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:46,047
It's going to call my mom from my

277
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,375
When my husband says call

278
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,423
It's going to do something to

279
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,519
That is the kind of

280
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:59,359
Powerful interactions that we're going to need and that's all based on

281
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:00,639
Having

282
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,431
Contextual ability that they showed

283
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,479
This is the world guys that we

284
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:05,503
Waiting for

285
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,551
This is the world

286
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:12,671
You and I and many listed my family see that's the whole thing if I

287
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:14,463
Thinking about getting a Google

288
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:20,095
What you described I think is an awesome feature that multiple people can recognize

289
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,887
But nobody will talk anything in my house

290
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:22,655
Except for me

291
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:23,935
So

292
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,215
It seems like a waste

293
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:29,567
You have it you have it

294
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,103
Teenage daughter

295
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,383
White

296
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:38,783
He's in college so yeah he's he comes and goes but yeah

297
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,063
Nobody talks anything

298
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:47,487
That doesn't the voice recognition is really good it's not that good yet

299
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,255
It doesn't

300
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,279
Recognize wolf wolf

301
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:50,559
No

302
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,327
No

303
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,095
It's probably for the

304
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:58,751
Although I wonder I wonder what the the shortcuts feature in Google Assistant I wonder if I could

305
00:12:59,007 --> 00:12:59,775
Train it to Tucson

306
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,567
Let's talk about shortcuts

307
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,871
Yeah it's funny because

308
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,663
One of our listeners

309
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:08,735
Forwarded you I think the this information

310
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:11,039
And shame on me because I saw it about

311
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:15,391
Maybe week ago week and a half ago and I neglected to mention it

312
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,671
Yeah this is

313
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:22,303
But yeah it was the middle of May

314
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:27,167
This actually showed up and assistant I don't remember a blog post or any news about it but

315
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:30,239
Basically if you do have the assistant app and you open it up

316
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:33,055
If you go into your settings

317
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:37,151
You can actually see a bunch of options in there the bottom option for me anyways

318
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:37,919
Shortcuts

319
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:40,479
And what you can do is create what it says

320
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:43,039
But you crave faster easy ways to do your favorite things

321
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:45,343
And make a bunch of recommendations

322
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:48,415
Hilton already and I like you can say stock update

323
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,183
And

324
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,719
You would literally tell

325
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:54,815
Google what to do with a certain should do if you see a stock update to it

326
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:55,839
In this case

327
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:58,143
Talk to CNBC about the markets

328
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:04,543
So it's it's Ukraine custom shortcuts and actions for those shortcuts so

329
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,311
I haven't used it yet

330
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:08,383
I don't have a home and I hadn't sought to do it in my system now

331
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:12,223
Halibut actually you could for four like voice commands to your

332
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:13,247
Your phone too

333
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,271
Hi I just realized

334
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:19,647
So when this arrived I had broken my phone

335
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,183
So I haven't tried it

336
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:21,951
It out yet

337
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:25,791
Because I guess I should have downloaded I'm using an iPhone instead of my Android phone

338
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:28,863
But since I'm only using it for a couple days I did not download

339
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:32,703
All of my hundred and something out apps

340
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:34,495
So

341
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:36,031
I'm looking at the default

342
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:41,919
Shortcut examples that they give and maybe this is how I get my girls to start talking or something because they are

343
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:45,503
There always been watching Gilmore Girls I don't know why but they do

344
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:49,855
And one of the shortcuts in here is you know what to do and the action is

345
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:52,927
Start watching Gilmore Girls on Netflix on the TV

346
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,719
Yeah so it's kind of it look

347
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,487
Looks like a cut

348
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:56,511
The powerful

349
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:57,791
Malmo stringify app

350
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,071
Yeah

351
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,607
Exactly what I was thinking

352
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,495
Example that Derek sent us was now he is asked it to

353
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,775
Stop saying ask

354
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:08,543
Harmony

355
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:11,103
To Transit that's not Logitech Harmony to turn on the

356
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:11,871
MattyB

357
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,663
Sorry to change the volume

358
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:15,455
So now he can just say

359
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:16,991
Turn down the TV

360
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:19,551
Turn down TV

361
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:20,831
And

362
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,391
Turn down TV volume and all these other great things

363
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,927
Looks like he

364
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:25,695
Traded

365
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:27,231
Multiple ways to say it

366
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:29,023
To turn the volume down and

367
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,303
Cuz that's how you you

368
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,071
Usually asked

369
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:35,167
It's too loud is usually what happens

370
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,591
But there's a shortcut it's too loud

371
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:43,615
There you go

372
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,407
So I had to play with this once I get my

373
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:52,831
Exciting things will happen if I may have to get a Google home after all this now

374
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,879
Well you don't maybe you wait till

375
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,951
Maybe I don't

376
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,231
I'm not a waiter

377
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:06,399
Now you know again I feel like you should just be able to cruise through the Google offices

378
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:10,239
I see air fresheners all over there yeah

379
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:13,055
Now that's an interesting idea those in office environments

380
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,359
I'm like that's that's a little

381
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:23,039
All right that's for the recognition of his speaking really comes into play otherwise you'll be running in the Halls setting up everybody

382
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,063
Google home

383
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,135
Google

384
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:32,511
My bad

385
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:39,679
Hopefully because it was whispered and because it didn't finish

386
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,959
And I can do that to you

387
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:44,287
Other things so that's that's a lot of

388
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:45,823
La Taqueria

389
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,359
Let's move to

390
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,639
Ikea

391
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,199
Yes

392
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:54,271
Google and we were so excited about Ikea and there's more

393
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:56,831
Chad fee

394
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,879
I was wondering how you say it

395
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:01,439
Oh did you not listen to my Ikea home dude

396
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,999
I'm sorry I didn't

397
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:07,839
Stratford

398
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:12,191
That's the we also learned on that show that

399
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:12,959
They sell

400
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,263
2.9 Million

401
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,031
All today

402
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,055
Oh yeah

403
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:18,335
Tell me the biggest seller

404
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,407
Probably

405
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:24,223
Those products are going to work with

406
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,759
Gosh everything

407
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:27,551
If you don't talk to it it's going to work with it

408
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,319
So Echo

409
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,135
Are we should say

410
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:33,695
Before you ask that question

411
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:36,511
If you have Google assistant on your iPhone

412
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:39,327
You cannot talk to yourself without talking to

413
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,351
Siri

414
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,375
You just have to

415
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,423
That is correct

416
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,215
That is correct so you can't

417
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:49,311
Unlike an Android phone where you could set it that always be listening for the hot word and

418
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:51,359
You know hands-free all day long

419
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:53,151
You got to actually open that that's correct

420
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:58,015
I'm still Pro using

421
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:01,343
Echo and Google home over the

422
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:02,367
Cat stuff I have

423
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:06,719
TNN alot of the news of

424
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,743
Assistant

425
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,535
Coming iOS came out

426
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,559
I saw on a lot of

427
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,607
Sites that cover Apple stuff

428
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,655
I told her negativity that I

429
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,935
It's not going to be

430
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:18,751
It's not native you have to open it

431
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:20,799
You know it's not going to sauna catch on

432
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:24,639
I begged a differ because

433
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:28,991
If you look at what Google photos has accomplished on iOS in 2 years

434
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:34,879
I think it's is a 500 million users and like 1.2 billion photos a day

435
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,439
A lot of them from IOS I mean

436
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:39,743
I don't see it as a barrier

437
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:40,767
But we'll see

438
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,047
Well end

439
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:47,167
It's a great way to try it out and I think if you really like it and you want an always-on out

440
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:49,215
$129 which is

441
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:50,495
Cost of the Google home

442
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:51,775
That's not

443
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,311
Crazy

444
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:58,175
Especially if you've already linked stuff to your

445
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:00,735
Right right right

446
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,367
So you were going to say something

447
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,671
I was going to ask you a question

448
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:12,511
How is this going to work with homekit is homekit certified

449
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,279
Well

450
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,559
It must have

451
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:17,631
A special chip inside saucer chip

452
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:20,447
I don't recall seeing

453
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,471
On the

454
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,519
The device has a

455
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:26,079
That's where I'm going I don't

456
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:31,967
This just seems like this week news that I would be leading with this product if that was the case and yet

457
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,247
I'm not saying that

458
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:36,319
Any homekit device

459
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:42,719
Should have on the back of sticker that has like the little homekit logo and a number and that's what you used to actually hook it up

460
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:43,999
Wi-Fi network

461
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,791
Alright so

462
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,839
I don't have a truck for you

463
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:51,423
Because Ikea is like an hour away from me and I haven't gotten out there yet

464
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,471
To pick one up

465
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:57,055
You don't look on the back of yours if you have one and

466
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:59,615
If you do then sure as homekit certified

467
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:01,663
I don't know Kevin

468
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:04,479
I'm at a loss I mean I rather

469
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:10,879
Official press release and then they allude to working but they say that it's going to work with the home app is going to work with Siri and they say

470
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,159
Home cats

471
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:13,695
But it's other

472
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:15,743
The wording is just odd to me

473
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:18,559
I just wonder are they going to have some kind of bridge device

474
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:20,095
Coming later

475
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:21,631
You know I'm a big

476
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:29,567
I felt so much better

477
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:31,359
Once I bought the

478
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:34,687
Are actually Lutron sent me a smart

479
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,735
Home their Bridge which is at

480
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:37,503
Think $80

481
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,599
Cuz I had I have all these Lutron lights in

482
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:43,647
Having the bridge makes me feel like

483
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:50,047
They're very serious despite having a really awesome proprietary protocol about integrating with other products

484
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:55,167
So once I bought that I was like sweet now I can buy a whole bunch more Lutron lights

485
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:57,215
So that's just by thinking

486
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:59,263
So if I was going to go all in

487
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:01,567
Platform that wasn't using Wi-Fi or

488
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:02,335
Bluetooth

489
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:05,663
Having that bridge I feel gives me a lot of

490
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:13,855
No it's okay I mean this but this is why I prefer like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth on other devices you know

491
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:16,416
Yeah. I just gravitate towards them because I don't want

492
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:18,208
Bridges in the hub center lappin

493
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:23,328
Totally understand I'm really thinking they're going to offer some kind of bridge products by I just not clear

494
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:25,376
But coming this summer or Autumn Place

495
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:28,192
You'll be able to do this

496
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:32,032
Alright so other immigration

497
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,568
The Amazon Echo

498
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:34,592
What is kinetic energy

499
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:35,872
Dish

500
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:41,248
I thought this was cool because it's going to be this sort of thing where you say

501
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:43,296
Hey

502
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:45,344
Change the channel to ESPN

503
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:48,160
Find The Big Bang Theory

504
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:50,720
And all of this is just going to happen

505
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:51,488
If you're disgusting

506
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:55,840
I would love to see

507
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:56,608
Every

508
00:21:56,864 --> 00:22:03,008
Provider like Comcast has their Xfinity home and they have a speaking remote where you can talk to the remote and do this

509
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,800
Supposed to the echo

510
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,152
Why not

511
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:13,248
I think I should I should play a little bit more with the Nvidia Shield

512
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:16,576
Android TV that I use I don't use the voice kids

513
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:21,696
Well yeah sure I don't use the voice capabilities and part of the reason I bought it was because they were going to offer

514
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:22,720
They still plan to

515
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:24,512
A shield spot

516
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:25,536
$50 mic

517
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:26,304
Earphone

518
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,888
That basically let you talk to it like you talk to a Google home and then

519
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:30,912
Would interact

520
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:31,680
The TV

521
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:34,496
I just don't know if they're TV controls yet for any of that

522
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:35,520
So

523
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,080
I should

524
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:38,848
Does the Nvidia Shield

525
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:42,944
Well I don't know if I don't have a good one

526
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,552
I don't know what the remote itself has a microphone on it

527
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,088
Oh yeah that it does

528
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,440
Yeah yeah sure so I should use it more

529
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:56,768
To do list

530
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:02,400
Okay

531
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,168
Let's see

532
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,448
What else do l

533
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,984
If this then that

534
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:10,080
Every time I say that I do a mental

535
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:14,432
It's his lunch it's

536
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:15,456
Megaplex

537
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:21,088
And they were sponsoring the show a couple weeks ago and I actually used to make a platform to create the

538
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:23,648
Internet of Things podcast channel on if

539
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,672

You know sometimes I don't

555
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:52,832
Question is always

556
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:56,416
Publish

557
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:58,464
There we go now we're thinking

558
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:02,304
And my hope is I'm trying to figure out how to

559
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:08,192
Launch a channel that actually will send you a notification if I mention in the tags a certain

560
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:09,216
Hair product

561
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:11,008
Which everybody who's like

562
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:13,824
I really want to listen to it when you talk about you know

563
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,384
These light switches cuz he's are what I have in my house

564
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,920
Then that would be good for you

565
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,320
That was like a little ad within the show sorry I'll but

566
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,088
Ifft

567
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:29,440
Is doing its own maker Channel and this is kind of cool because a couple

568
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:33,536
Well I was a year ago a while back that they took out the ability to like

569
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,584
Publicly share

570
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:36,864
Applets that

571
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:40,704
Yeah late last year I think it was

572
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,472
Disappointed cuz I I

573
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,288
Stop

574
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:46,336
Hey don't bother me I'm making Annapolis

575
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:49,920
They took that away but now

576
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:55,040
New capabilities that used to be that you could only like tie two things together right which is fun

577
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:55,808
Yay

578
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:59,904
But now you can build applets with multiple actions

579
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:02,208
Turnt

580
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:05,024
And that's actually pretty exciting cuz you can do some of the

581
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:07,072
Some of the more

582
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:08,352
I don't know

583
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:11,424
When this happens turn off the lights and do this

584
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,216
So

585
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:14,240
That's going to be fun

586
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:15,520
Will be playing with that

587
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:16,800
And

588
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:22,944
One other feature that's probably interesting to you guys is you cannot create a tablets that work on any connected device

589
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,992
Even if you don't own it

590
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:26,272
So

591
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:28,832
It used to be that you had to link your device before you

592
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:30,112
Create an applet for it

593
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,392
Which

594
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:35,744
Sense but sometimes your wife you want to expect like for this show for example

595
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,024
We want to experiment with

596
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:41,120
Can I possibly do this if so I'd like to buy this device right

597
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:42,144
And so

598
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,192
This lets you see all the triggers and

599
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,472
Play with the

600
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:48,544
Full Outlet before you actually maybe go out and buy a device

601
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,336
You can see it it works for you

602
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:53,152
Can you actually test without device or no

603
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:53,920
It can run it

604
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:56,736
If it's like

605
00:25:58,528 --> 00:25:59,040
Yeah

606
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:02,880
But it's nice because there a couple times when I'm like

607
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:05,952
Oh I'm looking for a particular trigger like one

608
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:09,024
Popular thing that I like is I have a netatmo

609
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:09,792
Camera

610
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:13,120
And I can use that to see it recognizes people

611
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,912
Because it recognizes people

612
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,240
I was hoping to build something that was like basically

613
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:20,032
If you see the following people

614
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:21,312
Do this action

615
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:24,128
Right or if you haven't it more and more

616
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:25,920
Reliably I want to do if you haven't seen

617
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:26,688
The following

618
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:29,504
That wasn't actually a trigger

619
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:31,552
So that netatmo has it

620
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:32,320
Gift

621
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,088
Immigration

622
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:36,416
But it didn't actually include people recognition is what

623
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:37,440
By the trigger so it's like

624
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,208
Hummer

625
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:39,488
But I would have been able

626
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:40,256
Will see that nessus

627
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:42,304
All right

628
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:43,584
All right

629
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,352
That

630
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:45,632
Is that

631
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:46,912
And

632
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:48,192
If you make something really cool

633
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:51,264
A big name brand might pick up your applet and showcase it on there

634
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,592
Hey make something for the iot podcast

635
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:55,616
Maybe I'll publish that

636
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:56,896
Hey hey hey

637
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:58,944
That's about it on the issue

638
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:01,504
I don't know I feel like we've done

639
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,528
Hutong a good show today

640
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:05,600
Lots of news lots of nudity

641
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:06,880
Leinenkugel Lodge

642
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:11,488
WeMo dimmer Wi-Fi light switch

643
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:12,512
It is

644
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:13,792
Pretty

645
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:15,328
But it's $80

646
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,632
Which is a life coach

647
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:21,472
Especially because I had just tested the Leviton

648
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,776
Wi-Fi light switch

649
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:25,056
Which was

650
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,080
I think it's like

651
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:27,872
It ranges between 45 and

652
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:29,920
$50 and that is both

653
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:35,040
Google home and Amazon Echo capable and it's got dimming functionality just like

654
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:41,184
This is why I go bulbs every chance I get not switches

655
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:43,488
Switch off I know you are

656
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:46,304
All right we're going to argue about that next show

657
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:51,424
Because I have his massive mapping projects where I'm actually swapping out lots of light switches

658
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,192
So

659
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:53,984
Real talk about what that means

660
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,264
And how much that costs

661
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,800
And either time or dollars

662
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:02,176
After that our guest

663
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:04,224
Michael Bell CEO Silver Springs

664
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:06,272
Who is going to talk about

665
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:09,344
The smart grid

666
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:12,672
And they have over 25 million devices

667
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:13,696
Added to their net worth

668
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:14,720
Which is a lot

669
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:24,704
Hey everybody we're taking a quick break in The Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor this week sponsor is

670
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:29,312
Eros and I have Evan whitelock who's a product marketing manager at Eros

671
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:35,200
How to talk to us about iot and Healthcare so Evan what is aris doing in health

672
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:41,856
As a connectivity been a connectivity management provider what we're really providing to a lot of customers that are there

673
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:46,720
New solution providers that are entering into the healthcare space are really how to fold I think

674
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:51,072
The first is at 4 customers that today have an unconnected product will there be

675
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:54,144
A sleep apnea machine or in-home medical device

676
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,192
They're moving from an unconnected product

677
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:59,776
QA connected service adding extra value of that service

678
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:03,360
Enable them to increase their revenue from the devices that are already selling

679
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:07,200
One of the challenges there is to keep those operational costs as low as possible

680
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:11,296
Given this new connectivity that there including into their product so the tools it

681
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:17,696
Customers are leveraging from our connectivity management platform really help them bring their operational costs to level to the lowest

682
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:18,976
Possible to ensure that

683
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:25,376
The margin that they're gaining from the other revenue on these new recurring Services it is great as possible and then second

684
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:29,984
We look Beyond into the larger scope of the iot world in and where these Solutions

685
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,520
Can become ocean pack for

686
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:37,408
We have a lot of partners that are working to bring Advanced Healthcare Solutions into the maybe some of the underdeveloped

687
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:40,736
Parts of the world for example sweet scent is a customer of ours

688
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:44,576
It is leveraging our Global connectivity to bring Water Treatment Solutions

689
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:46,624
Various parts of the world specifically in

690
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,416
In underdeveloped areas where

691
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:54,048
Where water quality is a very very large issue

692
00:29:54,816 --> 00:30:00,960
I think when we look at what I can do for the healthcare space specifically it opens up exponential advancement

693
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:07,360
In-N-Out only the efficiency of Healthcare systems for example reference the ability to provide a connected Home Health Care

694
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:13,760
Solution for patients with chronic conditions can actually have a device that that allows them to communicate directly with their health care provide

695
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:20,160
Lighter instead of having to schedule trips and leave the house and oftentimes for patients with disabilities or chronic conditions that's amaze

696
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:24,256
Adopting iot by making it connected solution

697
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:30,656
They're able to provide a much more efficient solution for that customer I think what it also does is it enables healthcare provider

698
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:37,056
Riders equipment manufacturers to move from just selling Hardware to a recurring Revenue model opening up a

699
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:43,200
Brand new Revenue stream for their services that they provide what are the most rapidly growing markets

700
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:50,112
Beyond health care we see tremendous growth still in in the automotive Market even though that's been one of the drivers for

701
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:56,000
Form a society adoption with connected cars and consumer Automotive but as we moving towards a more autonomous

702
00:30:56,256 --> 00:31:02,400
The world which is one of the buzzword there that's why we've invested a lot into the bleeding edge of autonomous and consumer

703
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:08,800
Technology but even beyond that we see a large possibility just about every vertical for every device that's previously been

704
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:15,200
Non-connected possibilities are really endless there for a Wiens who historically provided non-connected products to move

705
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,480
Toys that are connected world

706
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:18,016
If I want to learn more Evan

707
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:19,040
Where should I go

708
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:25,440
You should definitely head to our website eros.com that's a e r i s.com podcast

709
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:31,840
Hey everyone welcome back to the

710
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:38,240
The Internet of Things podcast this is your host and today's guest is Mike Bell the CEO and president

711
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:39,776
End of Silver Spring Networks

712
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,568
Hi Mike how are you doing

713
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:47,200
Free Stacy how about yourself I am super well and I am excited to talk to you today about

714
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:48,992
The smart grid

715
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:50,784
Smart Energy

716
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,808
And

717
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:53,088
How you guys

718
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,904
Because you've been doing Smart Energy for so long

719
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:56,928
Are more like

720
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:58,976
A top industrial iot company

721
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:01,792
This is the case you're going to try to make and you're also going to tell me about

722
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:03,584
Energy generator

723
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:04,864
Nothing too hard

724
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:12,800
Alright so let's get started you guys have been doing this for a while and you told me you now have 25 million devices

725
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:13,568
In the field

726
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:14,336
Which is crazy

727
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,104
That's a lot

728
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,152
Absolutely

729
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:20,992
Cisco's predictions for Lake Tahoe

730
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:22,784
Exactly

731
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:27,392
Take me through kind of because this is I think a really good microcosm for iot

732
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:28,672
And where it can take

733
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:29,440
The rest of the world

734
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:30,976
Give me energy mark

735
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:36,352
Can you take me through what it was like in the late 90s then smartcric came out and then

736
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:37,376
Tell me where were

737
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:42,752
Mercury little people think about smart. And they're like oh you know you read my meter for me in

738
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:44,032
I sure that that's

739
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:50,176
Probably where it started you know it's it's easier to automate meter reading than sending armies of people on the field and

740
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:51,200
You can argue that it

741
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:52,992
Who's better for the consumer it was better for the

742
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:54,272
Utilities because it took

743
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:58,368
It made the process easy and it took you know trucks off the road and that was great

744
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:03,232
The really we're headed I can't imagine a modern utility right now

745
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:07,328
Without having a smartphone implementation I mean it would be like the Stone Age because

746
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:10,400
It's going so beyond your once-a-month reading meter

747
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:12,448
I mean if you live in a part of the country

748
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,520
It gets hot and experiences brownouts aureus

749
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:20,384
You live in a part of the country with bad weather I mean right now the smart grid is responsible

750
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,176
Keeping your lights on when things happen

751
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:23,712
Or keeping your lights on when

752
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:26,784
Electricity demand get so high to the otherwise

753
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:27,808
The blackout

754
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:28,576
Areas

755
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:35,232
Modern utility lives and dies by the data they get off their smart grid Network and that's how they're able to function

756
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:39,072
It's such a complex environment we have including things like

757
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:42,144
Micro generation from solar and other things in Electra

758
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,424
Vehicle charging I mean

759
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:45,216
Utilities have a really

760
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:50,080
How to deal with a lot of stuff since you know even even the past 20 years I'd say their job

761
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:51,616
Keeping the lights on has become more and more

762
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:52,384
Complex

763
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,688
As we've added a lot of these new technologies

764
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:58,784
To what was otherwise a pretty stable kind of business for a hundred years

765
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,552
So

766
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:05,952
If I'm a utility and I'm looking at I'm using more of my data and my deploy more sensors like

767
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:07,488
It used to be smart meter

768
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:10,048
2 point x end

769
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:11,328
Now what are they playing

770
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,352
Wait a second

771
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:14,912
Yeah you know it's actually a couple things

772
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:20,800
So it turns out that your your smart meter is actually a sensory know and it and knows all the other information

773
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:25,152
And it's kind of like your people talk about crowdsourcing so I'll call it crowdsourcing for meters

774
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:26,944
When you're able to take a look

775
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,480
Look at the data coming off

776
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:34,880
Thousands or millions of beaters you can put together some really interesting information so you can tell whether you're properly balancing

777
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:36,928
Voltage across your distribution area

778
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,280
You can tell if there are trees on the line but they're about to take out the power lines

779
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:42,048
Ephrata area

780
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,328
You can't even tell

781
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,144
If the electric socket it's somebody's house is something

782
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,472
Call the hot socket so corrosion build up over time

783
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:55,872
Resistance goes up in Franklin you can actually have a fire because of the socket being dirty Based on data coming from the meat

784
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:57,408
Either you can actually tell us a problem

785
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:58,688
On top of that you can

786
00:34:58,944 --> 00:34:59,968
Deploy other sensors

787
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:03,552
To take a look at it other areas of the grading and something even worse.

788
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:04,320
Mating

789
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:11,232
Call distribution automation we're essentially tell you this big electric grid and a storm happens that takes out part of the grid

790
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:13,792
The reason your lights flicker and come back on is

791
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:14,816
The electricity

792
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:16,096
Rerouted in a minute

793
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:17,120
Instant

794
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:18,912
The smart grid technology does

795
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:25,312
Only read your meter and tells you when things are going to go bad and by the way when storms happen

796
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:26,336
3 is what actually helps

797
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:31,456
All right but this is still despite the intelligence that is being deployed

798
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,736
Utility Networks

799
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:39,136
It's still a really tough business maybe a little bit boring how can this kind of intelligence start helping

800
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:43,232
Utilities maybe add new Services is that something they're interested in

801
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:46,048
Yeah you don't think so our Utility Partners

802
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:52,704
It turns out that they really do want to help the consumer figure out how to save energy although you know what that makes them look crazy but

803
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:54,240
They really do they really treat

804
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:57,312
Customers more as consumers and not repairs

805
00:35:57,568 --> 00:36:00,128
So Princeton utility customers

806
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:01,152
Instead of reading

807
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,688
Kneaders once a month

808
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:09,344
15 minute turns out if you read the meter frequently enough there are a few startups out there they can take

809
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,368
Look at that data

810
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:12,928
And tell you exactly what's running in your house

811
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:13,952
So why your bill so high

812
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:14,720
So you

813
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:18,560
Call up your local utility and say in a why is my bill is $1,000 this month

814
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:22,400
If they've done the right thing with a smart meter they can say what with your permission I'll tell you why

815
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:23,680
And they can go in and say well

816
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:26,496
It looks like you have a old

817
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:28,800
Refrigerator from the 1960s

818
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:32,896
Someplace in your house and it looks like it uses about $250 worth of electricity a month

819
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:34,944
Spelling Magic

820
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,992
Promise of service marketing

821
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:38,784
People look like in that big data

822
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:43,136
It's real you know there's there's actually something if you have enough of this kind of day that you can

823
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,416
You can do things for the

824
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:45,696
Server that the same like that

825
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:50,560
So let's talk about demand response because this is an area that I think there's

826
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:56,192
I live in Austin so Texas has its own utility grid so worried of a special special

827
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:56,960
Case

828
00:36:58,496 --> 00:36:59,264
It gets really hot

829
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,032
And

830
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:04,128
There plenty of times in the Summer where you know my Nest thermostat on eco B thermostat is low

831
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,408
Hey guess what

832
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,688
Utility is like

833
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:08,224
We're going to turn you up a notch

834
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,272
And I'm thinking about places where

835
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:12,320
God how can we make that

836
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:13,088
I don't know

837
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,880
Better more efficient

838
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:17,696
Maybe less disruptive cuz I notice

839
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:20,512
Almost immediately when my AC goes off at 4

840
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:22,560
You know summer day when it's a hundred and ten degree

841
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:24,864
But maybe I wouldn't notice like my water he

842
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:26,656
Shut off my dryer

843
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:29,216
For your pool pump

844
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:35,872
Silver Spring I demand response has always been an important part of what we've done and there's there's two really interesting things

845
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:38,944
News about it as you mentioned right the ideas that you shave off

846
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,272
Why is it important while the first thing is because

847
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:43,552
It's tops potentially up

848
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:44,832
Rolling blackout right

849
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:47,904
The other thing which is kind of cool For Those About to work in this space is

850
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,464
One of our big customers is Oklahoma Gas & Electric

851
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:55,328
Are they little they have the same issue gets really hot everybody comes home before they turn the record

852
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:58,144
Turn the air conditioner on

853
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,448
Quantify

854
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:05,824
They've been able to quantify that they have avoided building two new power plants by implementing grandeur

855
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:07,872
Cedar Point

856
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:10,944
There's no reason actually why you couldn't hook up

857
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:14,784
The same technology to a pool pump or to a hot water heater and in fact

858
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:20,416
It's one of the things we're advocating we could easily put this technology on your hot water heater or your pool pump it really just

859
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:22,464
Takes a utility to say hey we want to go do

860
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:27,584
Okay I was going to say how did what do we need to do to make this real because I had it you know

861
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,608
I Dubai

862
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:33,216
Do I need to buy connected washing machines or

863
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:37,312
Take me through the largest energy consuming products in a home

864
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:38,848
Tell pool pump Maybe

865
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:45,248
Yep pool pump you up to some extent washer and dryer that person hot water heater

866
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:47,808
Here for the most part it depends what you have gas or electric

867
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,648
But yes that's released a lot of electricity

868
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,440
Yo it's interesting so

869
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:57,536
The reasons man response is usually done with the thermostat is because it

870
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:59,072
Easy to talk to the thermostat

871
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:00,352
The thermostat controls

872
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:01,632
Thing that uses electricity

873
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:07,008
As you say if you had something like a pool pump or another device like a washing machine or something

874
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:10,336
You would have to actually you know have some way to control that but honestly

875
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:16,736
Technologies come to the point where you can pretty easily build a little box it's not that expensive that you know plugs in between

876
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:19,808
Device of the electric grid and that we turn it on and off

877
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:23,392
It's not really a matter of Technology at this point it's really a matter of just

878
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:24,160
Wanting to do it

879
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:26,464
Is it worth doing I mean

880
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:29,792
Obviously turning off my lights

881
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:30,560
Sephora

882
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:31,584
Even if they're on

883
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,864
Probably

884
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,424
Machiavelli Deez Nuts

885
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:38,752
In the fancy

886
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:45,408
Exactly so it's something like that or is it

887
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:48,480
Will you know I tell you

888
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:54,880
Certainly if if you live in one of those affected areas you are remembering in California some years back when you're having rolling blackouts rolling brownouts off

889
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:56,160
Samurai

890
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:56,928
Technology

891
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,720
Yeah I think

892
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:04,352
I think it all depends if you take a look at that return it's a lot cheaper to roll something like this out than it is to build a power plant

893
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:05,120
Okay

894
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:07,680
And let's let's talk about two other challenge

895
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:08,448
Just that I can think of

896
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:10,240
1 is

897
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:11,776
Microgeneration oral

898
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:14,080
You know my solar panels on my roof

899
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:15,360
But if I did

900
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:16,640
Excited

901
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:20,480
How should we see like solar is becoming so cheap now

902
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:21,248
Now it's awesome

903
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:23,808
Jeff when we get more of this sign

904
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,600
How should we think about

905
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:27,904
How we've architected our Energy System

906
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:33,792
Cuz now it's like push out to the home as opposed to like the homes pushing up and maybe this isn't a deal I don't know

907
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:39,168
It's interesting solar generation in general is this points most

908
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:46,336
Presents the same sort of issues to it to utility reverse that they were talking about with the mannerist

909
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:48,128
Because imagine is safe

910
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:49,664
Sear in Hawaii

911
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,688
Crazy penetration

912
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:54,528
Every day at UNO

913
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,808
7:40

914
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:57,856
3 the Sun goes behind a volcano and

915
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:59,904
It's like a light switch shopping so you have

916
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:04,000
All of this energy is being put on the grid solar power plants are kind of idling

917
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:08,608
Literally it's like somebody flipped a nice switch boom it's gone demand suddenly spikes

918
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:12,448
And suddenly that utility has to figure out how to jam enough

919
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:15,264
Energy generation from traditional sources of the grid

920
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:16,800
To prevent blackouts

921
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:17,568
Spell

922
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:21,664
Take a look at the kind of Technology we provide you know you could imagine a case where

923
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:23,968
Utility says I know that

924
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:25,504
Time

925
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,296
Today because we know what it is

926
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:28,832
A sense of going to happen

927
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:30,368
We will gracefully

928
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:32,928
Turn off some of people solar so it stops

929
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:34,208
Putting stuff on the grid

930
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:37,536
Double ramp up our production at a reasonable pace

931
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:39,584
So there's if not like this race

932
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,656
To see if you're under the grid fast enough to go get blackout so

933
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:49,056
Really you need a smart grid to manage the sources said his back for the same reason you viewing is smart grid

934
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:54,943
To manage the number of EV Chargers there going to be put on the grid over the next 5-10 years because those

935
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:56,479
Considerably more electricity

936
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:58,015
Send

937
00:41:58,271 --> 00:42:02,623
That was my next question for you so I don't

938
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:04,671
Like 2 years ago I had

939
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:07,743
Power plant manager for Austin Energy

940
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:12,607
On my show and we talked about the coming EV electric vehicle crisis

941
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:13,631
And so

942
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:14,911
How does

943
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:15,679
Having

944
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:16,703
Connected

945
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:17,727
Utility

946
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:19,007
Help with that

947
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:20,543
Mitigate some of that

948
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:23,359
Yes it was so having a connected utilities

949
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:24,383
EV charging

950
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:27,199
Really there are a couple ways to look at it the first one is

951
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:30,271
Able to quantify having the Chargers be connected

952
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:31,807
You know when they're coming on and off

953
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:33,087
So that the utility can

954
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:35,903
Balance the voltage or wrap up the power delivery or what have you

955
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:38,207
Is required to really provide

956
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:39,231
Seymour service

957
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:40,511
The people going to expect

958
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:44,095
But frankly there are places in here in the United States a lot of them

959
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:47,679
Set the current design really just

960
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:50,239
Going to handle the fact that you went over your neighbors

961
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:53,311
How would he be charged with it everyday at 6 you get on at home

962
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:56,639
Unplugging your supercharger and suddenly you know the demand

963
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:57,663
The Roots

964
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:00,735
I would argue that there probably in order to

965
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:02,783
Balance disease the needs of

966
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:06,879
All TVs that are becoming online or the next few years you're going to need to have these Chargers

967
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:07,647
Be smarter

968
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:08,671
It's height

969
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:09,439
Utilities

970
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:13,535
So that they can make sure that everyone gets their fair share of electricity and it doesn't create

971
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:16,095
Sir problems nearly tries to charge their car

972
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:19,679
What else do we need cuz you need more than just a smart grid

973
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:22,751
Or connectivity on the grid in these sensors

974
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:26,591
Or smart Chargers you also need some machine learning algorithms to understand

975
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:27,615
Habits

976
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:30,175
You need probably some business rules put in place so

977
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:32,991
Consumer can override it let's go beyond just

978
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:34,015
Activity on the grill

979
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:40,415
Utility used to work with us now they're all at the Silver Spring Network and the smart meter is in the

980
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:41,439
And the ways

981
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:43,999
Did the censors of quantify what's happening

982
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:47,583
The fascinating thing to me is you know everybody that there are two big buzzwords

983
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:49,631
These days right internet of things and Big Data

984
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:51,679
So if your Internet of Things Big Data company

985
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:52,447
You're flying high

986
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:54,239
I think there's a huge up

987
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:55,007
Opportunity

988
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:55,775
Four companies

989
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:58,079
Need to come in and apply machine learning

990
00:43:58,335 --> 00:44:01,151
To the data generated by the utilities to really provide

991
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:03,199
Unique services and provide

992
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:06,527
Even services for the utilities themselves that'll really help make

993
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:13,183
He's probably just talked about much easier to deal with that I think it's a kind of a very lucrative space I think right now you know that

994
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:19,327
There are a few companies in the space but I think it's it's something that they really has been overlooked and it could be a fantastic business

995
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:20,095
For someone who

996
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:21,631
You'll has a machine learning

997
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:22,399
Algorithm

998
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:24,191
Swift's attic

999
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:26,495
Keys to apply to something good boy

1000
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:28,031
Really have a pretty big impact

1001
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:30,591
But utilities make pretty lame customers

1002
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:34,175
Your startup because they've got these incredibly long sales cycle

1003
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:36,991
Obviously very risk-averse

1004
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:38,783
Because you know you don't want to mess with somebody's life

1005
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:44,927
What should a startup have how should they think about trying

1006
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:46,463
How to get into the space even if

1007
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:47,231
If they are

1008
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:51,071
Well I tell you don't like her the horror stories of the utilities

1009
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:57,471
And you know how slowly move it so on and so forth I have to tell you I think many of the kill he's certainly ones we work with have gotten the relay

1010
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:58,495
And

1011
00:44:59,007 --> 00:44:59,519
We have

1012
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:02,079
We're lucky enough to win ConEd

1013
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:05,151
Building New York utility for for York City

1014
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:06,431
This past year

1015
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:08,223
And I tell you today are really

1016
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:09,247
Pulling up

1017
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:10,271
For pushing us

1018
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:15,903
To come up with these carsolutions I just talked about it I mean they understand that they look at all the things we just

1019
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:16,671
Disgust

1020
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:21,279
And understand what their customers expect and understand the challenges going forward and

1021
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:23,583
The fact that you know the generation

1022
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:25,887
Is goody limited so they have to do more with

1023
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:26,655
With what they have

1024
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:27,935
Other believers

1025
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:28,703
So

1026
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:31,007
I would actually say that some of the more

1027
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:34,847
For looking utilities are really right for this technology and immuno

1028
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:39,967
We are actively looking to work with partners

1029
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:43,039
Help create solutions that we can jointly go to market with

1030
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:46,879
Let's shift the conversation just a little bit and talk about

1031
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:47,903
What it takes

1032
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:48,927
To deliver

1033
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:50,975
More than 25 million connections

1034
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:55,071
In an industry that is so risk-averse and so important to like

1035
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:57,631
Our economic well-being and even our physical health

1036
00:45:57,887 --> 00:46:00,447
Electricity is the lifeblood of Industry

1037
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:06,335
How do you think about issues like security resiliency

1038
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:10,431
Walk me through some of the architecture and Technology decisions you guys have made

1039
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:15,039
There's a couple things about the technology Silver Spring provides if that's kind of unique

1040
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:16,575
We like to talk about

1041
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:20,671
If you don't even called Smart Energy these days with sparkly Because The Internet of important things

1042
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:24,511
As opposed to the internet if you know connected talkin

1043
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:26,559
Animatronic dogs remember people

1044
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:27,583
For selling these days

1045
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:29,119
When it comes to

1046
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:30,143
Wake up to something like

1047
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:30,911
Smart grid

1048
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:31,679
Security

1049
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:33,727
Is Job 1 2 3 4 and 5

1050
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:36,287
Yeah you can't just put stuff out there and you know

1051
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:38,847
Was it help a couple months back were a bunch of

1052
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:41,663
Security cameras with half the denial-of-service attacks I mean

1053
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:44,223
You can imagine if that was a smart created with just being a

1054
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:45,247
It would be

1055
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:46,783
You just said so

1056
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:47,551
For us

1057
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:51,391
Do we have built multiple layers of security and it's not just

1058
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:53,439
One thing that you start with

1059
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:58,303
Secure hardware and secure software then you layer on top of that encryption that you layer on top of that

1060
00:46:58,559 --> 00:46:59,839
Medication

1061
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:01,119
From the beginning

1062
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:04,703
Our entire set of Technologies has been based on

1063
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:05,727
Standards-based

1064
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:08,543
Things that are the same technologies that the internet

1065
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:09,823
Was created on

1066
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:10,847
So

1067
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:12,639
You know I love the joke that the

1068
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:16,479
Graveyard of networking Technologies littered with the dead bodies of people

1069
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:18,015
Thought they were smarter than the internet

1070
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:21,855
We've taken with all the founders of the internet for together and we have essentially

1071
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:24,927
Put them together into a very reliable very

1072
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:25,695
Cure

1073
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:27,487
Wyteria

1074
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:29,535
So not only do we have this

1075
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:31,071
Security layer we also

1076
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:32,351
How to apology

1077
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:34,911
That is different than most people be called a mesh Network

1078
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:38,239
Essentially

1079
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:42,079
So unlike your your cell tower yourself at work

1080
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:43,103
Result hour goes down

1081
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:44,127
You lose connectivity

1082
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:47,455
Our devices all talk to each other and they talk to multiple

1083
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:48,479
List all the facts

1084
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:49,759
Points

1085
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:53,087
So is anyone touring number of them goes down

1086
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:54,879
Home network

1087
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:57,183
Switches over and find a different way to communicate

1088
00:47:58,207 --> 00:48:00,511
It's a very lowest level we have this

1089
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:01,535
Picture highly

1090
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:02,559
Reliable

1091
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:03,839
Way of communicating

1092
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:05,887
Against all completely standard space

1093
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:12,799
That sounds really good and it even sounds like it might be applicable beyond the smart grid and I think you guys are working

1094
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:13,567
Ninesome

1095
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:15,103
Optical smart cities

1096
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:21,503
I hate PetSmart in front of everything but. Where else can you take what you guys

1097
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:22,271
Size of done in

1098
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:23,039
Utilities

1099
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:25,855
Do you think about this so we've designed this

1100
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:27,391
Highly secure

1101
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:32,767
Highly reliable why your area always on networking technology that connects the most critical things on earth

1102
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:37,631
Why not connect everything else we've made a big push into smart lighting we have

1103
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:41,215
If you go to Paris all the streetlights in Paris are controlled by our hardware and soft

1104
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:43,007
Many of the boroughs in London

1105
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:45,055
I'm cooking in Glasgow Bristol

1106
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:47,359
Closer to home like Florida

1107
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:48,639
All right I like your good

1108
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:50,431
Let's talk about more goodness

1109
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:51,967
Let's talk about

1110
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:54,783
Actually the reason that I kind of got excited about talking to you

1111
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:58,367
You guys have this really cool project town in Florida do you want to tell me a little

1112
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:04,255
And I think you're referring to the story Which Wich know they love to tell which is kind of cool so they

1113
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:08,095
The rolled out not only our smart Grid in our distribution Automation and

1114
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:09,119
Everything else that we

1115
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:09,887
We make

1116
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:11,935
They rolled out our smart Street lighting

1117
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:13,983
Every kind of tissue

1118
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:17,567
We're apparently turtles hatch at some point of the year and

1119
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:18,591
Before

1120
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:22,175
We humans came around with lights the turtles hatch

1121
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:23,711
See the moon and

1122
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:24,479
And walk

1123
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:26,271
Into the water and all would be good

1124
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:28,831
And apparently what's been happening in parts

1125
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:29,855
The Florida are

1126
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:30,879
Turtles with hats

1127
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:33,695
And see the street lights on the other side of a highway and walk across a

1128
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:35,231
The end would be quite as good for them

1129
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:36,255
So

1130
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:37,535
You know you wouldn't put

1131
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:40,351
A smart streetlight the Flaming out necessarily to

1132
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:42,655
Safety rules alone chemical thing to do

1133
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:44,191
Will be really expensive things

1134
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:50,847
But it turns out you know one of the nice things about technology Is You U2 play a technology and then smart people kind of figure out

1135
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:52,127
Really cool uses

1136
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:53,407
And somebody said you know

1137
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:57,247
Turtle hatching season we could turn those lights off between

1138
00:49:57,759 --> 00:49:59,807
Say 980m at 4 a.m.

1139
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:02,623
My gosh guess what happens but Turtles don't get squashed

1140
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:07,999
So again it's just one of those unintended consequences of Technology you know you you find a great use for it

1141
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:09,791
And smart people will find things to make and eat

1142
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:13,119
That's why I'm really optimistic about the internet

1143
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:14,655
Work

1144
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:16,703
All of what we're doing here is

1145
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:20,543
Once you add sensors and connectivity so sensors actuators

1146
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:22,079
To the world

1147
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:25,151
We start looking at that data we can actually start making some

1148
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:26,431
Really cool things happen.

1149
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:30,015
Either one of those things so I

1150
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:34,111
Yo it's it's kind of funny at the other thing FGL did I just want to make sure this way quickly you know

1151
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:35,391
Hurricane Matthew hit

1152
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:37,951
Karbolyn this Devastation like that

1153
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:41,279
The factory of the smart grid let them get the electricity back on

1154
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:42,047
Record

1155
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:43,583
You look at it when you

1156
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:46,143
You just talked about you know I don't know what's going to happen when you

1157
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:47,935
Suddenly have enough sensors

1158
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:51,263
There are two environmental sensors tell you something

1159
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:52,799
When you have hundreds or maybe

1160
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:53,823
Thousands because it

1161
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:54,847
It's easy enough to do that

1162
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:56,895
I think we're going to start seeing

1163
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:59,455
Do donuts have to be just can't picture today cuz

1164
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:00,479
Your people just

1165
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:01,759
Can't imagine

1166
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:04,575
Yet what they can do when that kind of date is available

1167
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:10,975
So optimistic that the enabling technology you know iot is getting table all these things that we just can't imagine kind of like

1168
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:12,767
It would smartphones were first day out

1169
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:16,607
I don't think people ever imagined because ecosystem the speedometer on that

1170
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:18,143
I think you're going to see even

1171
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:20,959
Yoga is great that I'd argue that maybe it isn't

1172
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:24,287
Critical for life I think you'll iot could actually

1173
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:26,591
Improve my little baby live backup of Steel

1174
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:28,895
Some of the challenges that are coming with

1175
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:31,455
All right Mike

1176
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:32,479
Thank you so much

1177
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:33,247
For coming on the show

1178
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:39,903
Anytime that's it for this week show thank you so much for listening and if you want

1179
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:46,303
