We've got

7
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:22,016
Ransomware

8
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:22,784
We got

9
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,064
An ISP

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,368
Defending against the butt

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,184
We got Intel has a new boss who is

12
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:32,256
What are the devices is the same as the old boss

13
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:34,560
We got a DHS iot

14
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:35,328
Tea report

15
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:40,704
We've got Amazon news and we've got some experience with some connected devices that we play

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,472
Like to talk about

17
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:44,544
And we have an ad from the Bluetooth Sig

18
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:46,080
And I guess this week

19
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:48,384
Nick feamster who is a co-editor

20
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,920
On the beach

21
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:52,992
Iot security report that came out last week

22
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:55,552
And we're going to talk about how to secure the Internet of Things

23
00:00:58,112 --> 00:00:59,904
Let's have a word from our

24
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:07,584
Do you want to learn more about how to connect a building your home or even a battery Samsung sartaq platform

Makes it easy for you to get your devices online and connected to each other you can build new Services make your office more efficient

26
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,384
And start generating a return on your iot investment today to learn more visit Arctic. IO build

27
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,760
BS by to download a free paper explaining how to connect your business

28
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:26,784
Give it a whirl

29
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:31,136
Alright Kevin we are back and ready for the show after a wonderful

30
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:32,416
Holiday

31
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:38,048
Yeah lots of security stuff this we could talk about

32
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:40,096
So let's get it

33
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:44,960
Ransomware hitting San Francisco

34
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:45,728
Muni

35
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:50,848
I picked the story out because it

36
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:54,944
It's a trend which is as we start connecting things I think the biggest

37
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:59,040
Danger we're going to see is actually ransomware starting to

38
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,064
Effector

39
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:02,880
Devices

40
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,928
The ransomware I mean it

41
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:07,488
Obviously not new it's not a New Concept

42
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:10,560
It often helps individuals maybe you

43
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:15,680
Get a message on your phone saying I have control of your phone and all your data if you want to

44
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,472
$1000 whatever maybe

45
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:19,520
It gets really concerning

46
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:20,288
When

47
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,336
A municipal system

48
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:26,176
Thousands of people use everyday is taking over essentially

49
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,712
And that's pretty much what happened here

50
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:29,760
It is and it was infected

51
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:30,528
Theater

52
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,832
Computer so this it wasn't like a hijacking

53
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:33,600
King of

54
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:34,624
An actual thing

55
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:37,440
So keep that in mind but

56
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:43,584
Play with it was a ticket the ticket machines essentially it's not like they took control the buses are not like that like we have for me

57
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,120
The movie Speed

58
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:49,216
Let me write that could happen to us I'm not going to go there but

59
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,240
I don't think

60
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,544
Next true

61
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:56,640
Okay so what happened was

62
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,968
A lot of Bitcoins 100 Bitcoins

63
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,528
Which is about $70,000

64
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:03,808
They actually did not

65
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:05,856
End up paying for it because they had

66
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:07,904
Haha

67
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,464
Yay back up there like you know what

68
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,000
Take her date in Scrabble

69
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:12,768
What's the scrap yard

70
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,048
So

71
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,168
Plus one for backups and then the other interesting thing about this story is

72
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,984
Actually there's lots of interesting things about the story

73
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,544
Brian Krebs had a security researcher

74
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:28,640
Email him with information after he had accessed

75
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,408
The

76
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:32,480
Account of the extortionist basic

77
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:36,320
And so by reading these emails we discover things like

78
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:37,600
Oh hey

79
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:42,720
Most of these attacks were against Americans and those in the building industry

80
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:46,560
You can apparently negotiate with your Ransom

81
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:52,960
The folks someone actually was like you know what I can't pay you 10 Bitcoins to get my computer unlocked if I give you points

82
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:53,728
5 Bitcoin

83
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,848
A person said they settled

84
00:03:59,104 --> 00:03:59,616
So

85
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,408
Yeah I told

86
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:03,968
At least a reasonable people

87
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:06,528
People taking your computer

88
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,856
It was interesting

89
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,904
Apparently some of the people who were attacked

90
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,440
With the ransomware

91
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:15,232
Basically said oh by the way

92
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:18,559
How to get in here and do you have any advice so this doesn't happen again

93
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:23,935
I got to stay asking the guy who mugged the situation

94
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,215
May not be the best idea

95
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:32,127
We'll set up a monthly payment plan a subscription fee if you will we promise not to hack you if you keep paying

96
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,223
So basically the the world of the

97
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:36,991
Cyber

98
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,015
Looks a lot like

99
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,807
Mob rule in Sicily

100
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:40,831
Yeah

101
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:41,855
Yeah basically

102
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:44,159
It's concerning that way

103
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:46,975
I think we're joking about it but it is a serious issue and

104
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:52,351
I don't think about it personally that much because I feel like I've got my stuff lockdown but

105
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:57,983
Services that I use I don't know if they're lockdown you know if I live in San Francisco probably be riding Muni

106
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,519
It's very concerning

107
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:00,799
Yeah well every time I

108
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:01,567
Created

109
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:03,871
Password forever

110
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,407
Two bit

111
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:07,199
Random sign up that I have to

112
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:08,735
I like

113
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,015
How secure is the

114
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:13,343
I mean every every time I'm like

115
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,623
And this could go

116
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:22,815
Yeah like that and if we talk more about smart cities and we see initiatives for that and mean

117
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:25,375
Again you could individually be attacked

118
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,911
For ransomware

119
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,959
But more than likely

120
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:31,775
Attackers will probably look in the future towards

121
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:32,799
Bigger

122
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:35,871
Audiences with bigger checkbooks

123
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:38,687
All right speaking of attacks

124
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:42,783
Deutsche telekom actually its customers on internet outage

125
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,063
Because

126
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:46,623
Deutsche telekom was actually attacked

127
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,927
To get access to its

128
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,719
Customers routers

129
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:00,191
And what happened

130
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:03,519
And they tried to do a reset and when they did it they bricked

131
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,335
Shut them all down

132
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:09,407
What do we learn from this we learn that

133
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:12,223
Isps will pay attention if

134
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,527
Their devices are all attacked on mess

135
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:19,391
And two it's probably still not easy enough to over the air update

136
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:21,695
Millions of devices all at once

137
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:28,607
You know they got a big user base saying they said about 20 million text line customers

138
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:29,887
Panda

139
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:32,703
Although he's only 4.5% that were

140
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:35,519
British actor that still 9000

141
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,287
Houses

142
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:37,823
Minutes

143
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,871
That's not easy to manage.

144
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,455
I'm curious if they

145
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:47,807
Routers like many isps to here

146
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:50,111
They do they do

147
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:53,695
And I'm also wondering not to lump them all together here but you know

148
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,743
How many people choose to use their own

149
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,535
Which I highly recommend

150
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:58,815
Yes this is

151
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:01,119
Let's let's put it a plug right now

152
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,423
Buy your own router

153
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:08,287
And then make sure it is secured by changing the password

154
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,311
Not just

155
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,615
For your SSID

156
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:14,943
And whatnot but also the password on the physical router

157
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:16,991
Demonstrative account yes

158
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,319
Donut people

159
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,671
This will help you

160
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:26,719
All right

161
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:27,999
We also have

162
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:32,351
Intel has a new internet of things boss

163
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:34,399
And they also created

164
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:36,703
A new automated driving

165
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,471
What do we call that

166
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:39,775
The automated driving group The adg

167
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:40,543
Yes

168
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,335
Self-driving cars

169
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,359
So

170
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:49,759
Where is the head of pets self-driving car group is done

171
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:50,783
Tyree the end of the year

172
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,343
That's what I thought back in April

173
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:57,439
Doug who was the former head of the Intel iot group

174
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,207
Was like

175
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:00,511
I've been here long time I believed it

176
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,303
I'm ready to retire

177
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,583
So you know

178
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,119
We're like right by Doug

179
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,423
But

180
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,983
Not retiring postponed retirement

181
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:14,335
He's going to be the SVP and general manager of the automated driving group

182
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:15,359
So

183
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,383
Yay

184
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:19,967
He said it was such a great opportunity

185
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:20,991
Stuck around

186
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,783
We'll see if that's

187
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:26,111
That pans out until is probably

188
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:28,927
It got a lot to do in cars with automated driving

189
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:29,951
Because

190
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:34,559
Nvidia has been kind of the big brains behind a telematics here because

191
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:35,839
Napping

192
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:38,143
Are self-driving cars requires a lot of

193
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,679
Visual processing

194
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:43,519
And then other car companies like Qualcomm

195
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:46,079
Qualcomm actually buying an exterior layer

196
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,103
The season

197
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:50,175
Was a deal for the sensors in the such

198
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:53,503
In the car's so Intel hasn't really had a huge role to play

199
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:57,599
As you said and you mentioned video and I remember it had to be at least 5

200
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:59,647
Years ago at CVS they started

201
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:03,487
Give me the Keynotes with Automotive companies do no glue

202
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:06,303
Audi in and others inside every year they made

203
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,351
Have another automotive-themed

204
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,631
Intel's

205
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:11,167
Behind here

206
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:15,007
Video has wanted to be in the cars and it's getting in the cars now

207
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:19,103
Intel says hey we can bring fide 5G connectivity to the car as well

208
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:23,455
You're fighting against the clock arms and the others that are already in that space

209
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:27,295
Then they're just behind some curious to see what she brings to the table

210
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:28,831
Me

211
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:29,599
2

212
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,647
You know I am

213
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:33,439
Of the opinion that Intel is

214
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,975
Rapidly undergoing a chef

215
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:38,303
They're really trying hard

216
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,583
2

217
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:42,143
Branch out into other processors

218
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,191
Other architectures

219
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:47,519
And really rethink what it means to be in till

220
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,287
Kelso

221
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:52,639
I agree with you but one quick question and I could be wrong so I let you correct me

222
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:55,711
Did they just scale back or even get out of

223
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:56,735
There

224
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:59,551
Wearables and iot stuff

225
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,319
Officially

226
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,087
Commented

227
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:04,159
Service reports

228
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:06,463
Reports that they were going to get out of

229
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,487
The wearable space

230
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,071
I would say make sense they

231
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,351
I've got nothing to offer

232
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:16,959
It's a very crowded Market lot of startups that

233
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:21,311
The morning bull has come to Market been very successful so I agree with you there

234
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,359
We should talk about

235
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,383
Tom

236
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,151
Which

237
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:29,503
Who is actually going to be the head of Intel's iot

238
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:34,623
He is actually from armed he spent 10 years at arm doing strategy

239
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:38,207
There at least bringing in people

240
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:41,535
That have the expertise and experience in

241
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:45,887
Market connections so if they can actually develop something that's

242
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,423
Compelling is a product here

243
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,031
That relies on Intel saying

244
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:55,359
Hey maybe x86 isn't the right architecture

245
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,383
Care for a small battery

246
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,175
Right

247
00:10:59,455 --> 00:10:59,967
OC

248
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:04,575
Maybe they'll keep trying to shove them into that

249
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,111
But we'll see

250
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,647
I am excited

251
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:11,999
Two kind of I hopefully will get Tom in to talk to us at some point in time

252
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:15,071
To talk about Intel strategy here and that would be awesome

253
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:17,887
Ride Along

254
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,935
I don't have a snood Segway here

255
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:23,519
This is a difficult on a Segway I2

256
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,799
But it has to do with security

257
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:25,567
It does

258
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,103
Security

259
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:28,639
Industrial internet

260
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:31,967
And the Department of Homeland Security

261
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:37,087
Chess issued this was actually November 16th is when this came out

262
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:39,135
We did not get to it until now

263
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:44,255
They should report all about iot security and it's not

264
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:48,095
It's not a long report it's about 17 Pages willing to in the show notes

265
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:51,679
And you know I was looking for something exciting here

266
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,215
Like

267
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,495
How to do it all

268
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:59,615
If they had listened to any of our shows we talk about security I think

269
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:02,175
They would have found we've already said a lot of what they're saying here

270
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:07,039
You know that I appreciate what they're doing now I don't want to dismiss it by any means but

271
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:11,391
You know they're overview of strategic principles is kind of like a list of steps on

272
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,183
Iot security such as

273
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:15,231
Incorporate security at the design phase

274
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:20,351
Advance security updates in vulnerability management and Bill on proven security practices

275
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:24,447
Again a lot of things themes that we talked about before but

276
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:28,543
It is important that their outline and it readily available for people so that

277
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:31,615
That message keeps getting hammered home for device makers

278
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,151
Yes

279
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:37,503
And you know I got there last point so that got six

280
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,527
Points

281
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:42,367
But the last one was connect carefully and deliberately

282
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:48,767
Consumers particularly the industrial context should deliberately consider whether a continuous connectivity is needed

283
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:52,863
Given the use of the iot device in the risks associated with its disruption

284
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,679
Most companies

285
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:57,727
Probably do this automatically

286
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:00,031
Play because you got the IT department saying no

287
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:02,847
Every time you like snow

288
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:09,247
No but I would say for consumers this is actually a worthwhile thing to think about and I know that

289
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,527
It's going to sound strange coming

290
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,551
For me who buys like

291
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:12,831
Steelers

292
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:13,855
But

293
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,159
Think about

294
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,439
What you're buying

295
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:20,767
Do you need the connectivity here cuz in some cases

296
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:24,863
Connectivity is a one-off thing just to set up the device and then you can get o

297
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,911
Turn it off most of the time

298
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:31,775
If it's a good device and then you can you know turn it on every now and then for updates

299
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:37,151
So something to think about especially as we're getting into like connected sous vide cookers can

300
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,175
Connected ovens

301
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,711
Connective toys

302
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:42,015
Does it have to be online all the time

303
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,039
And if so

304
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,575
Is it worth

305
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,343
The risk

306
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,391
Expressing

307
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:53,023
As they say the intended purpose of any network connections to Consumers is something that I can see more of

308
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,351
Device makers that with our guest

309
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:58,143
Rihanna

310
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:01,983
Hi.

311
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:04,287
Amazon

312
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,591
Amazon UK

313
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:08,895
5

314
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,687
Million echoes

315
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,735
Since I bought mine back in December of

316
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:13,759
2014

317
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,807
According to the

318
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,855
DIYs to get the acronym all back

319
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,391
It is B

320
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:22,719
Consumer intelligence research

321
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,487
Partners

322
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:25,535
So

323
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,327
This is not an official Amazon number

324
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,167
It's an estimate

325
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:33,471
So they say it's about 5.1 million Amazon

326
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:38,079
Echoes including two million so far this year and that includes echoes

327
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,103
Datsun

328
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:40,895
All kinds of other crazy

329
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,431
And that number

330
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:46,015
Beers going to go up big time I suspect based on the holiday season now

331
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,295
Yes

332
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,831
Because my gosh

333
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:50,367
Didn't you buy a new Echo

334
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:52,927
I bought another one

335
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:57,279
I bought a. That but this is my 4th Echo device I bought a. I did it

336
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:03,935
Through my echo by voice on Cyber Monday because a it was $10 off to begin with because they were discounting everything

337
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:07,263
And I think I got a $10 credit because I ordered

338
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,031
Through

339
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,311
The Echo by voice

340
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:10,847
So that's a.

341
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:11,615
30 bucks

342
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:13,663
Is that deal still going on

343
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,967
I do not know

344
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:21,343
Not no we're not surprised me because I think they're calling this Cyber Monday week or something on Amazon

345
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,391
Give it a whirl

346
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,719
I'm checking now I got it I got it

347
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:33,887
And no it is not it is 4999 interesting they're all not on sale

348
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,727
Want more

349
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:41,311
That was your Cyber Monday deal did you buy any other connected things on

350
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,847
Over the holiday shopping

351
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:48,735
I bought a car this is the first

352
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:55,135
Black Friday / Cyber Monday that I almost didn't buy anything but. Was at 8 p.m. on Cyber Monday

353
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,415
Did not even buy that

354
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:58,207
And I got my volt on Friday

355
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:01,535
Did you get a great deal on that pulled on Black Friday

356
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:04,351
Actually I did

357
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:08,447
I even got a great deal on my tray they valued my trade higher than the volt

358
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,495
So sales tax was

359
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,519
Nonexistent

360
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:13,823
On the car that saved a ton of money

361
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:18,431
I got my federal tax credit coming next year and I found out

362
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:20,735
The state of Pennsylvania go PA

363
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:25,599
We have $2,000 cash rebates for the first 2,000 people that buy

364
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:26,623
An Eevee

365
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:30,207
Each year and they were still 44 eBay stuff when I bought mine

366
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:34,047
Tell Pennsylvania get on the horn

367
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:36,095
Yeah I agree I agree some

368
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:38,143
Happy very happy

369
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,167
Sweet

370
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,703
I'm trying to think.

371
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,007
I almost bought Arlo's

372
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:45,055
Netgear Arlo

373
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:46,335
Decided

374
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:48,127
Against it because I wanted

375
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:48,895
The

376
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:51,199
Rechargeable ones and those were not

377
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:52,479
Grand sale

378
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,063
And so I cuz I I've been kind of in

379
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,343
I also thought

380
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:59,391
Maybe I should wait

381
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,159
4

382
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:05,279
Outdoor capable connected camera that has 4G

383
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,071
Because I thought

384
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:12,959
How awesome would it be to like park your car right and then be able to like set up a little camera in the Dasher

385
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:13,983
Somewhere in there

386
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:17,567
Monitor people coming up to it or anything like that

387
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,895
Maybe it's just because my car keeps getting hit in pek

388
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:28,319
What are we just talking about limiting or understanding connectivity and devices

389
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,135
Ficu

390
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:34,719
A camera in a car on be like what's up with that person

391
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,303
Okay

392
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:39,583
You're right

393
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,351
Okay

394
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:42,399
I will I will have to practice what I preach

395
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:46,495
It's your car you do what you want I'm just not going to walk around it

396
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:50,591
I wonder if I'd have to put a sticker on save these premises are monitored

397
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:51,871
Makes you wonder

398
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:52,639
Privacy

399
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,223
Or let it go anywhere you go anywhere these days

400
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:58,527
We have one more Echoes story

401
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,319
Speaking of privacy

402
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,343
Possibly

403
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:05,695
It's not about that it's about a possible new Echo device

404
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:14,399
With a screen which is soon as you say that I'm like we'll wait you know you have fire tablets that can do

405
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:19,007
Alexis stuff neighbor screen so why do this but

406
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:22,079
Story told to make sense to me to have like a

407
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,103
Very

408
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:25,407
Kitchen Eeyore bedroom me

409
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:27,199
Screen device width

410
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:30,271
Alexa voice service isn't sorry for saying her name there

411
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:35,903
Antenna better speaker which is the report better speakers I should say so it sounds like a 7in

412
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:39,999
Touchscreen device with better speakers and obviously will have all of the

413
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:42,303
Smartcell she who shall not be named

414
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:44,863
So remember when the wink relay came out

415
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:49,215
One of the things that we talked about with Nathan Smith

416
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:49,983
Quez

417
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:54,335
That there's some things that you just want to see it makes more sense

418
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,383
So like your Fitbit step count

419
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:58,175
Actually that might be really embarassing

420
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,199
Plastered on your

421
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:02,271
Although if it's right by your fridge that would be really smart

422
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:04,831
So there's some

423
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:08,159
Weather data there's a lot of data data plans

424
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:11,231
Capability and plus when you ask the echo.for cert

425
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:14,303
Things like Allrecipes recipe skill

426
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:16,863
It would be great to shove that to a screen

427
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:17,631
Actually in you

428
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:19,423
Kitchen so you can see it

429
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:26,335
I don't disagree in fact I've had some of this experience already because the Fire TV is I have three of them in the house cuz that's

430
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,871
How we get our TV content

431
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:33,759
There are the echo cards that show up on your screen when you use the voice remote to ask question

432
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:35,295
And it is Handy

433
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:40,927
So we'll see if that comes out it'll probably be more expensive

434
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:42,719
$80 cuz

435
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:44,511
Hey

436
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,047
Awesome

437
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,119
Alright here's a device that I'm a little unhappy with

438
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,911
The August doorbell

439
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:53,471
Earlier this month

440
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:55,775
August basically said

441
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:58,079
Hey we're launching our

442
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:01,919
Rick Cloud recording service so you get a week free and then

443
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:03,455
You pay for

444
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,735
Sudo access

445
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:06,271
Which month for cloud recording

446
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:11,903
Basically what happens is you get 6 months free if you're an existing customer of the August doorbell

447
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,463
And then after that you get a week free

448
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:15,999
With all of your

449
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:22,655
Recorded history and your video recording service is available for $5 a month or $50

450
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,423
For one year

451
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:26,495
Here's my issue

452
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:31,103
Basically they're taking away functionality that people have had now for like a year

453
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:38,527
I feel like August was opened that they would create some sort of cloud storage service

454
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:43,391
But if you bought into this you have no idea and they're kind of taking away this

455
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:44,671
Functionality

456
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:47,231
Not to mention that

457
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:49,791
They actually advertised a functionality

458
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:51,583
With the motion detection

459
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:53,631
Did they didn't actually offer

460
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,167
/ 9 months

461
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:56,703
Amman

462
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:57,983
I feel like

463
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,263
From a consumer

464
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:01,055
Like as an early adopter

465
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:01,823
These things happen

466
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:06,431
As a consumer and if I were

467
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:09,247
The FTC are consumer Watchdog agency ID

468
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:11,295
I be looking at them a bit Escape

469
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,575
Because

470
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:14,367
When you're selling a device

471
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:16,672
That also has a service associated

472
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,464
Suddenly charging

473
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,232
4

474
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,768
A service it was

475
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:21,536
Is once free

476
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:22,560
Feels

477
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,608
I understand why they're doing

478
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:25,888
I just think

479
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:29,216
Bad planning this is kind of one of those things don't get caught up

480
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:36,896
I almost wish they would rethink this and say you know what because we were going to have this before took us nine months to

481
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:37,920
Get it

482
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:40,992
And I will give you six months for free or something like a week

483
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:42,784
So they're giving

484
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,064
People six months

485
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,856
Of free service basic

486
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:47,392
Six months of clouds

487
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,160
Recording for free

488
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,744
Everyone gets a

489
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:56,608
If that makes sense so if you bought it today

490
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:58,144
You would get a week free

491
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:58,912
No matter what

492
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,448
And then you would have to

493
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:04,800
If you wanted access to those files after a week you would have to pay

494
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:05,568
$5

495
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,848
Right

496
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:10,688
It's tough I mean I think it comes back.

497
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:16,576
You're coming about planning any of planning ahead as a company with your product and your service then

498
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:17,856
Cuz they're at their going

499
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:19,904
Forever

500
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:22,208
In the minds of the consumer and

501
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:24,000
You know if you buy a product

502
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:27,840
You should know your bare minimum should be what you buy on day

503
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:29,376
Right you can't just

504
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:30,912
Clawbacks

505
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:31,680
Functionality

506
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:32,960
I guess right

507
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:35,520
So that's my take here

508
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:36,800
I could be wrong

509
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:42,176
I know that August was kind of floored by how difficult it was to make a doorbell and get everything working

510
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:42,944
So

511
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:44,224
Eric idle

512
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:45,504
Okay

513
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:49,600
This is Kevo

514
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:51,136
The Kevo lock

515
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,672
Which is a

516
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:53,440
Touch

517
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,464
To open Bluetooth

518
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:56,768
I didn't really like it

519
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:58,816
Initially

520
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:02,144
I thought it was the last time was pretty

521
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:04,192
Some tight like in a few

522
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,472
Had to come back and

523
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:08,288
Unlock a door that you just lost had to wait if

524
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,056
A few seconds

525
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,104
I didn't love it

526
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:14,176
Well now haven't if this then that in

527
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:14,944
Immigration

528
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:16,480
And

529
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,272
Because

530
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:19,296
That's my job

531
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:23,648
And I have to say that the lag time on the if

532
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,440
Integration was about

533
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,208
4 minutes

534
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,768
Which was what

535
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,048
I know

536
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:34,400
So this is may be fine if you're wanting to so it's a

537
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:37,472
Your options are door unlock door lock

538
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:39,520
Or you can trigger

539
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:45,152
I did a light thing so if my door you know was unlocked

540
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:47,456
Let's turn on a light downstairs

541
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,224
Just

542
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:49,504
Seems practice

543
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,528
Right because

544
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:51,296
It's late

545
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:55,136
Yeah

546
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,672
4 minutes later

547
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,512
That was that was not so lights

548
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:01,536
Just don't do lights in it

549
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:03,840
That's going to be the moral of all lifts

550
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:05,120
This should be like

551
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,912
Higginbotham's law

552
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:08,448
But

553
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:09,216
That's okay

554
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:11,776
And then if you're doing like a

555
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:12,800
Set up

556
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:14,848
You know like a different command

557
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,152
I was trying to think of other commands that my

558
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:21,504
Be useful even if there is a 4 minute delay and maybe like an arming the house

559
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:22,784
Lightworks

560
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,320
4 minutes is still kind of

561
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:26,112
You know

562
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:26,880
That varies

563
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:29,696
But it's especially with something like a lock

564
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,000
I mean that if you think about it

565
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:35,328
Take all the smarts out of it all the IRT out of it

566
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:36,096
A lock

567
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,912
Works when you use it immediately

568
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,216
So any delay

569
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:43,776
Even if it's two seconds in my opinion is

570
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:44,800
Making me

571
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:45,824
Experienced worse

572
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:47,104
Not better

573
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,920
Right here you're basically looking at a trade off of instant

574
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:52,224
Instant unlocking to I don't know

575
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,248
Have to get the convenience of

576
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:55,296
Right right right

577
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:57,344
Which is why I'm a big fan of keypad locks

578
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,136
Because you don't carry keys and

579
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:01,184
You basically punched to keypad

580
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,488
That's what we do

581
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:04,768
That's how we use our connect

582
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:06,304
90% of the time

583
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:09,120
Yay okay

584
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:10,144
And with that

585
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:11,168
It's time to

586
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:16,032
Close the door

587
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:17,824
Yes it is

588
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:19,360
Oh my God

589
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:20,384
Where.

590
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:26,016
State auditor of this

591
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:27,040
Report on iot

592
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,576
Security you're going to learn a lot of good stuff

593
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:32,416
And for a word from our sponsor

594
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:38,816
Hey everybody we're going to take a break from the podcast for a message from our sponsor this week sponsor is Bluetooth

595
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:39,584
Yes.

596
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,448
Hagenderfer director of developer programs

597
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:45,216
About what

598
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:45,984
Everyone has

599
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:46,752
Has been talking about

600
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:48,032
Bluetooth 5

601
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:49,312
So Steve

602
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:50,848
When is Bluetooth 5

603
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:53,152
That's the million-dollar question

604
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:59,296
Stacy you and everyone else wants to know that's we've got 30,000 members in the Bluetooth signal 107

605
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:03,904
But the good news is that we're still very much on target for late 2016

606
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,232
The working group is putting the final touches on the spec as we speak

607
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:10,304
Okay so I know why I'm excited about Bluetooth 5

608
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:11,328
Why is everyone

609
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:12,352
When else so eat

610
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:17,728
It depends on who you are but there's a little bit of something in Bluetooth 5

611
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:18,496
For everyone

612
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:24,896
Lucy V going to get developers new features such as quadrupling the range or doubling the speed of a low energy

613
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:27,968
Connections it also has increased capacity for advertisement

614
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,016
Our connection state of broadcast

615
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:32,320
By 8 extra 800%

616
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:34,112
Achieves all this stuff

617
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:35,904
Alongside its industry-leading

618
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,440
Time Performance so

619
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:39,488
Hello energy still low energy

620
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,792
It was the major boost in broadcasting message

621
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:45,120
Capacity of the data being transferred can be richer

622
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,960
Great but as a normal end-user what does that mean to me

623
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:53,568
Bluetooth 5 actually going to transform the way consumers experience IRT

624
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:56,128
Weather at longer range for things like

625
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,432
Whole-home coverage for Smart Homes

626
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:00,480
Weather at faster speeds

627
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:03,296
For let's say updating firmware on your Fitbit

628
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,064
Instead of

629
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,856
You waiting for your device

630
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:08,928
It's done right the device waits for you for things to happen

631
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:12,512
The really interesting part for me is with the Advent of

632
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:14,304
Huge advertising package

633
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:18,400
We're taking beacons to the next level so you can have a much richer

634
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:19,168
Deeper

635
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:24,288
More involved experience with beacons in this kind of connectionless iot

636
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:25,824
Then was possible.

637
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:27,360
So let's talk about me

638
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:28,896
What is that going to

639
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:34,272
This is actually Stacey one of those things that excites me the most about 5 beacons today

640
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:40,672
Provide really interesting rich and immersive experiences for people to connect the physical

641
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:41,952
Digital worlds together

642
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:44,512
Almost everyone has experienced beacons in

643
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:46,048
And the traditional

644
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,864
Retail sense where you going to a store

645
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:55,264
And you got a message that pops up on your phone that says hey look we've got something that's 50% outside

646
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,312
Ford Beacon to give me much more interest

647
00:27:57,824 --> 00:28:01,408
Because Bluetooth does so well and beacons do so well with proximity

648
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:04,480
Figure out kind of where you are in relation to something else

649
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:08,832
The types of snares at Beacon knable are huge think of

650
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:09,856
Asset tracking

651
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:12,928
In Process Management in transportation and logistic

652
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:16,768
Where you want to be able to track and ask if I'm

653
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:19,072
Play say to play speed in relation to

654
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:23,424
Other things that stay on your shop floor or in your office building or your fax

655
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:24,448
Beacons

656
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:28,800
Are a perfect solution for those types of problems of those taxes

657
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,896
I really look for beacons to actually explode

658
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:34,432
Where can I buy listeners learn more

659
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:36,480
You can get more info on Bluetooth 5

660
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:39,552
Vault developer toolkit and resource for building with Bluetooth

661
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:41,600

Man has so many things but he's on the show because he helped

667
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:09,248
Co edit a report from betag a government creep on security practices for The Internet of Things

668
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:11,808
And before you think that he's just some random

669
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,088
Policy walk

670
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:14,368
He's also a professor

671
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,136
Computer science

Thanks Stacy thanks for having me

679
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:29,728
It's exciting to be able to talk about

680
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:30,496
Stop it today

681
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:31,520
Man

682
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:33,568
So you guys produce

683
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:37,152
Is it 40 pages there's a lot of footnotes in there and actually dies

684
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,992
You should read it or at least give it

685
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:45,600
But definitely check out the because they are actually kind of scarier than the report itself

686
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:48,416
So this is a 31 page report so not

687
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:51,488
It's all about how to secure the internet

688
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,560
How long does it take to put together

689
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:57,120
Please report to take about six months

690
00:29:57,376 --> 00:30:00,448
Producer even working on this one for for the better part of 20

691
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:01,216
16

692
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,520
And I love this guy

693
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:06,336
I love the idea that we have actual people

694
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:10,688
With technical expertise in these the people who are working these are not

695
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:11,712
Like feet

696
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:14,784
Government lawyers at the big companies are actually

697
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,088
Technically Savvy people at the big companies

698
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:18,880
I'm working with policy groups ever

699
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:19,648
Everybody's so

700
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,184
I really like them

701
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:21,952
Because

702
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,024
Yeah one thing I think I'll highlighting

703
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:26,816
Because we're going to talk about this in the condo

704
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:27,584
Facts about the reports

705
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,912
As well as this the end of the report has

706
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:31,680
Quite a list of

707
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:32,448
Contributors

708
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:35,776
Twenty-odd contributors in

709
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:40,128
Therefore is committed by myself you know I'm an academic than the other co-editor

710
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:44,480
Is Jason Livengood who's the vice president engineering at at Comcast

711
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:45,248
So

712
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:48,576
That kind of gives you a flavor for the broad range of

713
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:52,160
Perspectives and stakeholders that come to the table and producing a consensus

714
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,184
Support like this

715
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,000
Let's get started with

716
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:57,792
Holy cow

717
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:00,096
What are the

718
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:01,632
Most important

719
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:02,400
Things

720
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:05,728
That can be done to improve iot device secure

721
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,264
Or iot secure

722
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:09,568
Just jump straight to this

723
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:11,360
Observations and recommendations

724
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:12,128
Can switch

725
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:18,528
You don't have to read all 30 40 some-odd cages of the reports to get their some of this is actually well summarized

726
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,320
In the first couple pages of the

727
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:21,344
Executive summary

728
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:22,624
So

729
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,160
Let's just jump

730
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:26,720
Best rated a high-level cuz you wanted the most important thing

731
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:28,256
The report talks about

732
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,280
Employment barriers

733
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:30,304
Portable desk

734
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,840
Current software practices

735
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:35,168
As well as various things related to in a supporting

736
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:37,216
Operation under disruption

737
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:38,240
Attacks

738
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,056
Other things related to

739
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:42,080
Preserving

740
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:43,104
User privacy

741
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,384
As well so

742
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,688
Any kind of jump into each one of those a little bit

743
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:52,832
Best soccer practices that mean some of these actually Echo some the other reports that have recently come out including

744
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:55,392
I want some Homeland Security that involves

745
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:56,928
This also recommends

746
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,512
A shipping with recently current software and another thing

747
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:01,280
Actually that

748
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:04,096
Did the we going to we going to a number of additional

749
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,632
Point that other reports

750
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:06,912
Touching a little bit less

751
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,472
Including deploying mechanisms

752
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:11,520
For automated secure software updates

753
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:14,336
Using straw strong authentication by default

754
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,104
And

755
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,152
Testing in hardening configurations

756
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:17,920
Dental abscess

757
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:18,688
Before there

758
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:19,712
Before they deployed

759
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:21,504
All of those I think like you said

760
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,552
They should happen quote about first

761
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:25,088
Meaning of things are harder than

762
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:28,160
They sound aminos as a computer scientist

763
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:28,928
Speak to

764
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,512
The difficulty of implementing secure software update Mac

765
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:33,536
For testing

766
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:34,304
Configuration

767
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,120
One of the things I think under the covers here is that

768
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:38,144
These recommendation

769
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:42,240
Is the group stands by then but there's a lot of work to be done actually 2 to realize

770
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:48,640
This I thought was really good as it wasn't just the ability to have over the air updates it was also the ability.

771
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:49,408
Authenticate

772
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,992
That the update was coming from a legitimate source

773
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:54,528
And then tracking kind of

774
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:57,344
The lifecycle I guess which I thought was

775
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,392
Way more deaths than I have seen in any of

776
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:05,024
Right exactly and I think that particular issue is quite nuanced

777
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:08,096
I mean you basically mention some of the challenges there

778
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:11,424
With regards to like pushing security software updates

779
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:17,056
There's a whole bunch of practical challenges which I can speak to for my own personal experience deploying

780
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:18,592
Frontier home routers

781
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:20,640
Many challenges come up there

782
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:21,408
1

783
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:22,944
For example is

784
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,480
It relates to no recommendation

785
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:25,504
In the report which is

786
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:32,160
You can push a software update but if you don't do it properly there's a risk of breaking the devices that are in the field in other words

787
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:33,184
Rendering those devices

788
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:33,952
Inoperable

789
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:37,792
And once your deploy devices are inoperable it's tough to recover from

790
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:39,584
So having mechanisms

791
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,864
Play Store test

792
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:42,656
Roll out of those updates

793
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:43,424
Is critical

794
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:45,728
Another thing that's like really tricky

795
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:46,752
Is

796
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:51,104
More and more a lot of these devices are relying on open source software

797
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,664
In particular open source software libraries in operating

798
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,504
One of the things of course that we need to

799
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,784
To sort of balance

800
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,088
Is the nature of these open ecosystems

801
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,112
Winston

802
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:08,512
Potential that a particular Library might have a security vulnerability or a back door and how do you want it how do you want a basic

803
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,560
Master check for those things

804
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:12,608
Alright let's get back to your list

805
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:14,400
Because I I took you off topic

806
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:16,448
Let's see one of them was

807
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,752
Privacy vs security I believe

808
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:20,800
Or understanding what your devices are sending

809
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:22,592
Jamming to privacy

810
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:25,920
What are the other recommendations that the report talks about

811
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:29,504
Is that the devices should ship with the privacy policy

812
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,296
It is easy to sign in under

813
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:37,696
Stand the report kind of stops there and I think basically that sounds like a little bit motherhood and apple pie

814
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:41,792
I still hard to disagree with the script

815
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:44,096
Insert talk about my own personal opinion on this

816
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:44,864
I think

817
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,400
Privacy policy

818
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:47,936
Infamously

819
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:49,472
Is Inderal cannot read byte

820
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:50,240
Consumers

821
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:52,288
I think this one actually is is

822
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,568
Interesting because

823
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,872
In a broader than the topic of iot

824
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:57,152
Python requests

825
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:58,176
Why we have private

826
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:59,456
I see policies in the first place

827
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:02,016
One of the reasons of course touches on

828
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:03,296
What is potential audience

829
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:07,136
For this report is groups like the FTC or industry consorcia

830
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:09,696
Who may have put into place best practices

831
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,768
One of the reasons have a privacy

832
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:14,048
A policy is that

833
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:20,192
If a manufacturer said something about how they're going to collect user share their your data and they do something else

834
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:22,240
Then maybe there's recourse

835
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:24,032
Through one of the structures that I mentioned

836
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,824
It'll be arbitrated

837
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:28,128
That's always in there too

838
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:29,920
Yeah exactly

839
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:36,320
Another thing that did personally interest me very much I know both of us have a little bit of history and in software-defined networking

840
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:42,464
To not to put people to sleep too much but you could take for example part of a privacy policy

841
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,816
By the way this is again my my personal can you this is not something we talked about in the report

842
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:50,144
It's certainly something at 7 like myself reading or recorded Direct

843
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,192
Say

844
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:53,984
Take a privacy policy

845
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,008
Data device

846
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,544
Exposes Brighton

847
00:35:57,056 --> 00:36:01,664
Supposing that that is either machine-readable or could be encoded and something is machine-readable

848
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:05,760
You could consider doing something like dropping that policy

849
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:07,040
Into a firewall

850
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:11,648
Brighten the test will this device my thermostat says or less actually take

851
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,976
Let's take a different example let's take the DVR cameras

852
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:15,744
Write that work

853
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,048
Part of the Massive denial-of-service Attack

854
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:18,816
A few weeks ago

855
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:22,912
Well it goes DDOT cameras are only supposed to be talkin to

856
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:25,728
A very limited number of Internet destination

857
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,032
Right that could very easily be encoded

858
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:29,824
And such an encoding to be dropped

859
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:30,592
On the firewall

860
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:32,384
And it's all of a sudden we

861
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,432
We see those devices talking to

862
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:36,992
The dying DNS servers

863
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:38,272
Then we know maybe something

864
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:41,088
In addition to a privacy

865
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:42,112
A policy that

866
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:43,648
You know that encodes

867
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,208
What types of data is collected in

868
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:47,488
Where it should be shared

869
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,280
Manifest about

870
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:50,304
Like what types of

871
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,072
Communications

872
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:52,096
These devices

873
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,888
Are or should be having

874
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:57,216
Could be used also to improve the security of the network

875
00:36:57,472 --> 00:37:03,616
Will it I know that some companies who make very popular connected devices actually run things like

876
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:05,664
Network operation centers where they

877
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,736
They see what their devices are talking to and if there.

878
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:09,760
Devices start

879
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:13,088
Connecting to weird IP addresses they notice it

880
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,112
And they investigate

881
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:20,256
Yeah exactly right I think basically it again this isn't something that the report talk

882
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:21,024
2

883
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,304
All that much

884
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:25,632
But I'm certainly another aspect

885
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:26,656
Basically

886
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:29,472
Is the is providing the visibility

887
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:30,752
That you talked about

888
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:32,544
For example a consumer

889
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:34,080
May want to

890
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:35,616
Be able to

891
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:36,384
2

892
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,920
Easily see

893
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:40,480
The internet destinations data devices

894
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:41,504
Communicating with

895
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:43,552
The consumer may also

896
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:44,832
Want to

897
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:48,416
I make decisions about which of those Communications are okay

898
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:49,184
Or not

899
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,512
One of the things that the report does mention

900
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:55,584
Play this is a good opportunity to get to mention another one of the wreck

901
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,352
Commendations

902
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:57,376
Is that

903
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:58,656
Iot devices

904
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:01,472
Continue to function and internet connectivity is disrupt

905
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:03,264
What that's getting at is

906
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:06,848
Your thermostat or your security camera or your door locks

907
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:07,616
Shouldn't have to

908
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:08,896
Assume

909
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:11,200
Continuous internet connectivity

910
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:12,480
Because

911
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:15,040
Broadband internet service may be interrupted

912
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:17,344
Another aspect is that

913
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,904
Which the report doesn't go into is that

914
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,184
Proxies devices

915
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,232
Continue to function even when

916
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:24,512
Consumers make decisions

917
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:25,792
About

918
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:27,840
They want their data shared or not

919
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,656
Is that something like

920
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:37,056
I don't accept the privacy because one of the things that drives me absolutely Bonkers is I purchase it

921
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:40,128
Something I read the privacy policy

922
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:42,432
Holy mackerel

923
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:44,224
I don't want

924
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:47,552
Change the device back

925
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:49,088
Can paying like a restocking fee

926
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,648
Feeding tube

927
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:57,280
Kind of invasive policy or privacy issues and just kind of going on because I really want to use this

928
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:58,048
Make a doorbell

929
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:03,424
Yeah that's it that's absolutely the kind of thing that that I'm talking about end

930
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:09,824
Just in a little bit more detail about that some things that maybe someone covered by the report's recommendations and then other thing

931
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:10,848
Things that aren't

932
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,664
As far as the recommendations write the recommendation

933
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,432
Talk about

934
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:16,224
Having a privacy policy

935
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,784
That is easy to find and understand

936
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,856
There isn't a lot of like you know it doesn't expand too much on that

937
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:24,160
But we can certainly talk about what that means

938
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:26,720
Right sounds like you've read somebody's privacy

939
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:28,256
Policies nearby

940
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:29,792
Probably putting you in the minority is

941
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:30,816
Consumerist

942
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:35,680
Oh man I read them all and let me tell you my favorite won the most recent what I had that was just

943
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:39,520
Terrifying was I had a smart connected oven I was testing

944
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:42,848
And the privacy policy I had to agree to it

945
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,640
The actual

946
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:47,456
4.5 LCD screen on the oven

947
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:50,016
I was like oh

948
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:53,600
That was exactly the type of thing that this

949
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:54,880
Did the dis recommendation

950
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:56,416
Getting it right is like

951
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:58,208
The authors of the report

952
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:00,768
Nice that many of these devices don't have screen

953
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:02,816
There are at least

954
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:04,352
Speedo screens that are large enough

955
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:05,888
How to display a privacy policy

956
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,728
In addition to like all the challenges we face is privacy policies

957
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:12,032
You know outside the context

958
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:14,080
The biote just on a laptop right

959
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:16,128
Now you put into the universe

960
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:16,896
Is the next piece

961
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:23,552
Really constrained devices with very constrained or sometimes even non-existent graphical user interfaces and the need for

962
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:25,088
Recommendations here is is

963
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:25,856
Pre-clear

964
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:30,976
There's three ways that people seem to talk now about privacy policies

965
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:32,256
Data usage basic

966
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:36,608
One is to create a nutrition style label for how your data might

967
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:37,632
Houston

968
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:40,960
Another is creating Lake

969
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:42,240
Oh this is for Sakura

970
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:43,520
This is

971
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:47,616
Like a lead style or a 5-star crash test rating for 6

972
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:51,456
Where someone doesn't actually know what it means but a group such as

973
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:53,248
Tiger something comes up with

974
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:55,296
Something that is reasonable

975
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:56,320
Can give it

976
00:40:57,344 --> 00:41:00,416
And the final is like a Good Housekeeping security seal

977
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,208
Or a privacy Shield

978
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:04,256
I'm curious

979
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:07,584
You don't feel free to throw out another idea here or just

980
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,608
What are your thoughts

981
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:10,656
And the report itself

982
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:15,008
Facts about the third a little bit to the recommendations

983
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,800
The iot device

984
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:17,568
Industry

985
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,640
Consider an industry cybersecurity program

986
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:24,224
An industry back program under which some kind of

987
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:26,784
Secure iot device

988
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,112
Seal of approval or notation might actually appear

989
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:31,136
On retail pack

990
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:36,768
Quite get your question like I I I just wanted to mention that the report talks about the

991
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:37,536
Third option

992
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:40,096
The others are interesting to

993
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:42,912
Let me speak a little bit about the nutrition label

994
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:44,192
Idea

995
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:46,240
With regards to data flows

996
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:52,895
From a technical perspective like as a scientist I should say I'm quite interest

997
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:54,175
Sit in that particular

998
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:55,199
Angle

999
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:57,759
Tracking data flows is something that we have

1000
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:02,367
Computer scientists do a lot we've done this in the context of online privacy

1001
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:03,391
In terms of

1002
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:05,695
Information flow and data leak prevention and

1003
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:10,559
One of the big challenges.

1004
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:11,583
It will face

1005
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:12,351
I think

1006
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:13,631
For that kind of in

1007
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:14,399
Plantation

1008
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:15,679
Is

1009
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:17,727
Presenting something that

1010
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:20,799
Users can reasonably Digest

1011
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:21,823
And want to interact

1012
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:23,871
Cuz if you think about

1013
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:29,247
The number of devices that we already have or are going to have in our homes right

1014
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:32,063
And now each one of those devices is going to have

1015
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:34,879
A privacy policy and data flows and

1016
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:37,951
Things that we might want to say yes or no to like yes this is

1017
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:45,119
Yes my my Internet connected oven can talk to you know these places but not others and you going to do that for everything

1018
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:47,679
Google device in the home

1019
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:51,775
Technically we know how to how to do a lot of what you're suggesting

1020
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:53,823
The challenge there is is

1021
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:56,127
Presenting it in packaging in a way

1022
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:59,199
That consumers can both understand

1023
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:01,503
And recently act on without being

1024
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:02,527
Incredibly annoyed

1025
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:04,831
I'm annoyed by

1026
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:06,111
Just having to deal with

1027
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:10,975
Having to understand where all my data flows from each of those

1028
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:11,999
Kind of scares me

1029
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:13,535
What's going to

1030
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:15,071
The roles of different

1031
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:16,351
Parties in the system

1032
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:17,119
So

1033
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:20,703
This was one of the first reports where I saw a kind of a little bit

1034
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:22,495
From the is peeperspecs

1035
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:24,543
Maybe it was Jason your

1036
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:26,335
Your colleagues are talking about that but

1037
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:29,663
They have to kind of interesting roles one is

1038
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:31,711
With the Mirai botnet

1039
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:33,247
You know any time there's kind of a

1040
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:37,599
Device has become part of a botnet you can see the traffic spike in

1041
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:40,927
You know isps probably can tell that that's happening

1042
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:41,695
If they want

1043
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:42,463
Pay attention to it

1044
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:43,999
So there's a rule that

1045
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:45,279
May or may not be

1046
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:47,839
Applicable to them there the other is

1047
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:49,119
A lot of Americans

1048
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:52,191
Get their routers from their ISP

1049
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:56,287
And I think routers have a kind of unique place in this ecosystem

1050
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:59,359
Kind of hear what you have to say

1051
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:02,687
Why you guys focused in on the role of ISP in

1052
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:03,967
What that role might be

1053
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:08,319
The ISP plays as potentially very critical role in

1054
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:09,599
Securing

1055
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:13,183
The rest of the internet in light of the fact that many of these devices

1056
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:14,463
Maybe

1057
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:16,767
Participating in or perpetrating

1058
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:20,607
Attacks such as the denial of service attack that we saw

1059
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:21,887
A few weeks back

1060
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:23,423
I think a couple of things to

1061
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:27,519
Isps have been facing

1062
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:29,055
Botnet threats for

1063
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:31,103
More than 10 years

1064
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:33,663
The cost structure is there in our challenges

1065
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:35,199
Right because

1066
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:37,503
The isps for reasons both

1067
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:39,807
Technical and privacy-related

1068
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:43,647
They can see certain types of traffic coming out of user homes

1069
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:47,999
Can't always determine what devices are initiating

1070
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:49,279
The traffic

1071
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:50,815
Stacy right because

1072
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:51,583
There

1073
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:54,143
Observing traffic at the granularity of the city

1074
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:55,935
What that means

1075
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:57,471
Essentially is that

1076
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:59,007
By the way this is public

1077
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:00,287
Informational given example of

1078
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:04,639
Comcast right they have a product or a service called Constant Guard

1079
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:08,991
Where they can notify subscriber that there's some kind of infected devices

1080
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:11,551
That notification just tells the

1081
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:12,575
Driver's ed

1082
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:13,343
There's infect

1083
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:14,367
It doesn't tell them

1084
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:15,903
What the device is

1085
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:17,183
Potentially how to fix it

1086
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:17,951
So

1087
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:18,975
That kind of notice

1088
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:21,023
Location of course it imposes a

1089
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:22,047
The significant cost

1090
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:23,583
On the internet service provider

1091
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:26,143
Not just from the potential attack traffic at

1092
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:27,679
Itself but also

1093
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:29,727
The potential cleanup job there

1094
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:32,799
So what happens when a consumer gets that kind of notification

1095
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:34,847
They basically don't know what to do with it

1096
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:36,127
So what are they do

1097
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:37,919
Next they call tech support

1098
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:38,687
They say hey

1099
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:40,735
I fear have an infection

1100
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:41,759
What do I do

1101
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:43,295
Can you help me clean this up

1102
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:48,159
And now that becomes like a significant cost center for the internet service provider

1103
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:51,487
Partially due largely due to the fact that

1104
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:54,303
Consumers are plugging in insecure devices

1105
00:45:54,559 --> 00:46:00,703
Provided by vendors that often have little to no hiding shall we say as far as best soccer practices

1106
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:02,495
Is that security

1107
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:04,031
Axis security

1108
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:06,591
So I think this brings me to like

1109
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:12,991
Sitting here with that as context I think this brings me to sex at 6 the reported refer people to that

1110
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:15,039
And in the second part of your question

1111
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:17,087
Just like hey wait a minute last piece

1112
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:20,671
They provide users that you know they often provide users the

1113
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:22,207
Show called customer premise

1114
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:22,975
Equipment

1115
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:27,071
Couldn't they do something with that technology to help the scanner mitigate

1116
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:27,839
Is attacks

1117
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:29,631
And the report talk

1118
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:32,191
A lot about the possibilities there and

1119
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:33,727
I'll talk a little bit about what

1120
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:35,519
Report says but also called this

1121
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:38,079
The same person again as it as a

1122
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:39,871
As a computer scientist who looks at

1123
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:43,711
Network security I think there are a lot of interesting future Direction

1124
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:45,247
Sincere for what what the role

1125
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:46,271
Technology might be

1126
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:49,087
Let me just throw a couple possibilities for what that

1127
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:50,367
You know so-called

1128
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:53,439
Supercharged home router if you will might might do

1129
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:55,231
Right it might do things like

1130
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:55,999
Automatically

1131
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:57,535
Discover an inventory

1132
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:59,071
The devices that use

1133
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:00,863
Connected to your home network

1134
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:01,887
I think

1135
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:03,935
Brand of your listeners I challenge them

1136
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:06,239
If can you list it

1137
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:07,775
Please can you provide it

1138
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:08,543
Complete list

1139
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:11,615
Every device that's connected to your home network

1140
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:17,503
Oh and by the way can you can you provide that list for anything that might even connected to the network over the last 3 months

1141
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:19,039
Including any guest

1142
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:21,343
State might have visited and so on and so forth

1143
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:23,647
Devices that you connected and

1144
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:26,463
Phased out or thrown out and give it away

1145
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:28,767
This inventory becomes

1146
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:30,303
Just by itself sounds

1147
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:32,095
Simple but it's incredibly complicated

1148
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:34,143
Obviously knowing what's

1149
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:34,911
On your network

1150
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:38,495
In the first place is the first step to take to providing better security

1151
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:43,103
I think it's far as privacy such a you know in home network device could

1152
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:44,383
Could provide mechanism

1153
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:46,943
Set present the user with clear information

1154
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:48,479
About what date of the device

1155
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:50,783
Setting to the rest of the internet and what other devices

1156
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:51,807
Devices

1157
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:55,135
Two smartphones in browsers have done this in

1158
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:56,159
I think it's

1159
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:58,975
It's almost a no-brainer that our home router should

1160
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:02,303
Need a scented house that kind of visit visibility

1161
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:04,095
Should be providing that kind of

1162
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:04,863
Information to convey

1163
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:05,631
UC Merced it

1164
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:09,215
When you were I plug a toaster and oven or a thermostat

1165
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:09,983
Internet work

1166
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:13,823
We should have information at our fingertips as to what

1167
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:16,639
Other places on the internet and what other devices

1168
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:18,943
That thing that we just plugged in is trying to

1169
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:23,551
And it's finally this comes back to something that we talked about a little bit earlier in the

1170
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:24,319
In the show

1171
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:30,463
I'm not home router could provide mechanisms that allow the user to prevent or disable

1172
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:31,231
Communication

1173
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:32,511
You know that they are

1174
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:35,071
They're not comfortable with or willing to

1175
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:35,839
Permit

1176
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:38,143
So like you said if I don't want that

1177
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:41,983
I've been communicating with other devices in my house or with other

1178
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:43,775
Destinations on the internet

1179
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:45,823
I should be able to say that

1180
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:48,127
And make this decision then have my home router

1181
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:50,175
Force those decisions that I'm making

1182
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:51,711
Importantly

1183
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:54,271
Without impairing the primary functionality of the

1184
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:55,039
Device

1185
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:57,087
Technically possible to make those kind of

1186
00:48:57,343 --> 00:49:00,671
Things happened in the customer premises equipment of the routers that the isb

1187
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:01,439
Please provide

1188
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:02,463
OKC

1189
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:03,743
That was a lot

1190
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:09,375
A lot of cool things that we talked about we didn't even get to the lifespan of devices but

1191
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:11,679
We are out of time and I

1192
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:13,215
So appreciate you

1193
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:15,775
Coming on the show to talk to us about this

1194
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:23,199
Oh absolutely thanks Stacy and I should mention there's a there's a lot more in the report as you alluded to things on

1195
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:25,247
The lifespan of devices and

1196
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:27,551
The lifespan of a which vendors should should

1197
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:30,367
Support things like software updates I encourage your listeners

1198
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:32,159
To go check out the report this lawn mower

1199
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:38,815
Interesting stuff in there so that's it for this week's show thank you so much for listening and we'll see you again

1200
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:45,215
