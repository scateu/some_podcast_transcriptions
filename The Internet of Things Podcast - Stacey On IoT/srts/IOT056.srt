00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:09,728
Hey everyone welcome back

2
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:12,800
To The Internet of Things podcast Stacey Higginbotham

3
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:14,080
And this is my co-host

4
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:16,384
Kevin tofel we have

5
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:19,456
Care about light

6
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:24,576
Everyone cares about lighting

7
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:25,344
Without it

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,440
Alright so we're going to get started with

9
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,488
Smart home stuff for you because

10
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,304
A big part of what whatever

11
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,096
There are

12
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:37,120
Three things happening

13
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:41,472
One is Phillips has updated its app we warned you in advance

14
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:43,008
This is going to happen

15
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:45,056
You don't have to use the new Philips Hue

16
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:45,824
New apps

17
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:46,848
But if you want

18
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:51,456
What this Windows is basically turns the Philips Hue app into

19
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:58,112
I don't know an app that was good like 2 years ago it gives you all the functionality that you kind of expected the original Philips Hue

20
00:00:58,368 --> 00:00:58,880
Got to have

21
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:03,232
So it's things like being able to divide your lights up in two rooms and control them

22
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:06,816
So it's very nice it's very

23
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:12,192
It's very fast on my Android phone so I am enjoying that I've got a test version of it so

24
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:13,472
I'm not sure if

25
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:14,240
The actual version

26
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:17,824
We spoke last week about the six

27
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,384
Security updates in the Philips app

28
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,432
Which kind was the precursor to

29
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:23,200
The new app

30
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:24,224
And even

31
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:30,624
Prior to that we talked about some permissions challenges on the Android side for the Philips Hue at those are already fixed as well so those are non

32
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,904
Known issues for this new app

33
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:35,488
Right in the security issues was basically

34
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:37,536
Third-party apps

35
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:38,304
Authenticate

36
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:39,328
Right so

37
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:41,376
Many of the third-party apps

38
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,656
That she was worked with

39
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:43,680
Most of our favorites

40
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:44,704
Have already done this

41
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,984
Proceso nothing

42
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:50,592
Should be back in changes nothing to see here

43
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:51,360
There are

44
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,896
Few apps that did not work

45
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:55,200
Phillips on this that will not have

46
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:56,480
Security token

47
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:58,016
It's like four of them

48
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,808
And two of them I've never even heard

49
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:02,112
So you can find all that until

50
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,184
But with the new app in the new features

51
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,464
So you can

52
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,256
Like I said there's there's rooms

53
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,024
So

54
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:09,792
Yay

55
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:15,168
There's also routines you could set alarms and timers in the original Phillips app

56
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:17,728
But you couldn't actually sit like full-on schedule

57
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:21,312
So now you've got they've made that process a little bit.

58
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,104
And there's a

59
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:25,152
A widget teacher that gives you

60
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:26,176
Access

61
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,200
From home screen

62
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,480
That you can

63
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:31,040
Program up to 10 scenes to do something like

64
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,320
Super fast like

65
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:34,368
All the lights in this room on or off

66
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,904
I actually cut

67
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,208
Created a bunch of those things using the Hue tap

68
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,024
The physical Hue tap device cuz it has

69
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:44,352
Five settings I believe four five settings

70
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,888
So you just press a button

71
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,192
So now you can do it

72
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:54,592
And that is good to hear on both counts scheduling I think it's very important for the lights and

73
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:56,128
I love love love widget

74
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,152
Sportsmart home

75
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,944
Controls that have the wink one

76
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,272
With all my shortcuts right on my home screen to one tap in your good to go

77
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,088
It also does home and away

78
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:07,136
Is it done geolocation

79
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:10,464
And then it also Phillips has a tie in with nest

80
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:12,512
A works with Nest integration that

81
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:14,816
Ideas to do home and away so

82
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:16,096
I didn't really

83
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:18,400
Feel a lack in the previous app

84
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:21,216
But you know it's nice for people who don't have all that

85
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:24,544
That the Philips Hue app is finally becoming

86
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,336
Really what it should have been in the beginning

87
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:32,992
That's the update there the other update is for those of you guys who really love colored lights

88
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,296
There is now a

89
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,832
Outdoor safe

90
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:38,880
Colored light from ilumi

91
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:45,280
And these are the guys that are doing Bluetooth lights they have an indoor BR30 and an indoor a19 which

92
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,304
Just a normal light bulb

93
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,584
And now this

94
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,120
Outdoor flood

95
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:54,752
I'm excited about this cuz I have a rooftop Deck with lights

96
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:59,616
I would love to be able to do some cool color changing kind of things up there when we have parties

97
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:01,664
The light bulb is $70

98
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,432
And it

99
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:04,480
Will begin shipping in summer 2016

100
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,528
So it's not a cheap lipo

101
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:13,440
Noble and to be honest when you first told me about it right before the show as I can with a lot of money it doesn't use a hug which means that uses and

102
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:16,512
Use Bluetooth on your phone through the app

103
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:20,095
And it wasn't too keen on it but you raised a good point that I think is worth reiterating

104
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:26,751
If you're having your party on rooftop deck and you're not going to give out like access to your yourhub so people control the lights outside

105
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:30,079
The rapper. So if you want to give them Bluetooth access

106
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,359
Stewby's lights you can do so

107
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,383
Pretty easily

108
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,663
And the fact that it's

109
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,223
Outdoors ip64 rated

110
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,527
46 rated I believe I can double-check

111
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:39,807
Stereo 60

112
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:44,415
So it's you know dustproof and and can handle water and all that I know

113
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:47,743
Don't like you said too many outdoor lights that you can control like this

114
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:50,303
WeMo actually had a string of outdoor lights

115
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:53,887
That was the only other one

116
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,983
This is actually this is disco lights

117
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:00,799
Super stoked

118
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,847
The other thing is I tried

119
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:08,735
I think somewhere in my Twitter page you can see a picture of my dog dancing

120
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:09,759
Colored lights

121
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:12,319
I'm in that was actually

122
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:15,135
And there's a setting on the app that lets you

123
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:19,487
You don't have them changed with the Beat of the Music that you're listening to which

124
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,767
You know it's kind of fun

125
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:27,167
I'm not sure which I'm more impressed by though that they lights can actually change their color and all to the beat of that or that your dog Acts

126
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:30,239
We should know

127
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:33,311
Okay then she is a dancing crazy.

128
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,871
I think these are Nate I am probably be

129
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,407
Because I'm a sucker for lighting

130
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:42,783
Smart Home Technology I'm probably going to buy one or two of these just a test them out

131
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,063
When they're out on the market

132
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,599
And I will let you guys know

133
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,903
And maybe shoot another video of my dog dance

134
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:49,695
Who knows

135
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:52,767
So

136
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:54,303
That's that

137
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:55,839
Check those out of here in the market

138
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,887
And the final thing is

139
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:59,167
I had talked about these

140
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:01,727
Lights about a month ago these are the stack light

141
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:02,751
From

142
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,031
Company called stack labs

143
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,055
And

144
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:08,639
They actually announced this week that they've got an a19 bulb

145
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:10,687
Which is again that normal bulb

146
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,991
Cool thing about the stack lights

147
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:17,087
Is there a design with the idea that you will never have to touch your light switch

148
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,367
They're what they called

149
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,135
Responsive

150
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,415
Or say anything

151
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,439
Or do anything

152
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:22,463
Yeah you just

153
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,487
Well you do have

154
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:28,095
Walk into the room that's correct. They have a presence in Decatur

155
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:30,655
They do they have a motion sensor in there

156
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:34,751
Both types of lights they have a BR30 that I've been testing out for over a month

157
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:37,823
And then they have the 819 both have emotion

158
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,847
Detection

159
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,895
They both have an ambient light sensor

160
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:44,735
Supper ideas if you walk into a well-lit room the lights just one

161
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,759
Turn on his break

162
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,295
The sitting you energy

163
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:53,183
In practice I didn't see a lot of that it had to be really super bright for the lights not to turn on at all

164
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:55,231
It is always awesome

165
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,023
And have the lights

166
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:02,399
Obviously they've been light switches with motion sensors in the decades

167
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:04,959
But this is actually moving at sensor to the bulb

168
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:10,335
Interesting thing here is and I think was I don't this was just announced today or recently

169
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,103
It was

170
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:15,455
Do you think basically an ultrasonic

171
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,991
I guess I'll call it a sensor

172
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:19,039
To act like radar

173
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:19,807
So

174
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:24,927
What that means is these lights can actually sense your presence even if there's a lampshade in the way

175
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,487
Right cuz most motion sensors are

176
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,511
Parc

177
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:29,279
Passive infrared

178
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,423
They send out sound waves

179
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:37,471
They basically like a bat

180
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:40,799
Figure out what's in front of them or what's around them based on

181
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:41,823
Sonic

182
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,591
Picture they're getting

183
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,383
Also like radar

184
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,407
Like you said

185
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:49,503
So I have not tried the a19 with the new type of sensor but

186
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:53,343
I'm very excited about this this is research that actually

187
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:55,647
A bunch like the University of

188
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,671
Has been doing a lot of

189
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:59,743
Things with this in Wi-Fi for understanding gesture-based commands

190
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:02,047
So it's possible that we could see

191
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,583
You know what a couple of years

192
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,887
Better gesture recognition for

193
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,423
In home control

194
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,215
Based on this technology

195
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:10,751
Excited

196
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:11,775
Replied so early

197
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:15,615
Another bit I mean this is kind of a new technology involves

198
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:19,967
What surprises me is that it's not adding a ton to the cost of the bulb

199
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,295
The standard a19 I believe it's $28 a bulb

200
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:28,927
The symphony 19 is $28 but these bulbs do have a hub so you got to buy a starter packet first

201
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:31,487
Oh, and the initial starter pack for

202
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:33,791
39 teens is 8999

203
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,583
And I could Chuchu bulbs

204
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,351
Github

205
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,655
If you want to do the BR 30s

206
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:41,471
Those that's a $10 more for the starter pack

207
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,495
And it's

208
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,519
$60 a bulb

209
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:46,335
Differential

210
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,871
Big difference

211
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,151
I should also note

212
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:50,943
The $28 is the pre-order price

213
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:52,991
But

214
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,527
I would say

215
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,551
Based on my

216
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,343
Using these lights

217
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,111
It's in

218
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:00,671
I actually want to get a couple of 819

219
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,951
Because

220
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,743
I want to install them in my

221
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:04,511
Closet

222
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:07,839
Rate for rooms where

223
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:10,911
They're closed off so I have an open floor plan of my house so these

224
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,447
Decent work super well

225
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:16,543
In those rooms but any room that's closed off like your office

226
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,567
The laundry room

227
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:18,847
The study

228
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,383
Oh that's also the office

229
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,967
Closet

230
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:25,759
Really well I thought for this so

231
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,039
In hallways

232
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:31,903
Everything was always because they have like a daytime mode in a nighttime mode so you can

233
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:40,607
They probably need walls to bounce off of an if you have like a very open concept floor plan it may not be the best area is what it sounds

234
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:42,911
Actually if it just that you

235
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:43,679
Trigger them all the

236
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:50,079
So they are really really good

237
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,127
It's just that like

238
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,919
I pace around a lot

239
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:55,711
My daughter Paces so ghetto

240
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:56,991
You're walking in front of

241
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:04,159
Curious and I'm sure you can't answer the question since you can get a chance to try that da9 teams

242
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:07,999
I'd be curious if you can modify the sensitivity of the Ultrasonics

243
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,535
So that way

244
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,863
Going to hit you are here

245
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,911
Right ahead and they're going to actually

246
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:15,935
Later on

247
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:18,751
Like newer versions of the BR30

248
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:19,775
Should have

249
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,055
Ultrasonic

250
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,335
Sensors in them

251
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:23,871
Chris just like

252
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,663
Hey we have this idea we might implement

253
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,199
It's great so

254
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,783
I am probably going to buy some

255
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:33,087
I'm not sure how many yet but

256
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,623
Once I figure out like

257
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,927
My whole home lighting plan on share it with

258
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,463
And the integrate

259
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:45,119
Thank you answer my question I don't want another Hub if I have to have it what else can I work

260
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,911
4 piece with this what I'm going to say

261
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:47,679
Right

262
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:49,983
Cuz without Bluetooth there's

263
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:53,823
Okay so

264
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,615
Music on four lights

265
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:57,151
But this week is like there

266
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,711
I forgot about that

267
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:01,503
How Could You Forget About Me

268
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,295
Should I tell you how could I

269
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,415
They also

270
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,951
Has a circadian rhythm

271
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:15,583
Whatever time of day do you trigger them they're going to be in their circadian rhythm for that time of day

272
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,607
Which is kind of me

273
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,375
If you're into

274
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,727
For the closet Maybe

275
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,287
Four bedrooms in offices

276
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,079
Okay

277
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:29,663
So what else do we have we have

278
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,431
Wearables

279
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,479
Wearables Nokia but

280
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:33,759
Whiting

281
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:38,367
It makes sense in hindsight most these things do but I was surprised when I heard the news

282
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,135
7

283
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,927
Nokia has done a lot of different

284
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:45,279
Things to try and get into the the Health Market in the past either through apps or

285
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,071
Or whatnot bedtime

286
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:50,143
Here it's just a flat-out acquisition of life things

287
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,679
And

288
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:58,335
I forget how much they paid with something like almost 200 million dollars I got 290

289
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,103
1

290
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:02,431
Yeah we're good for why things

291
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:06,527
They've always seemed like an underdog in the space and for people who are not familiar with the name

292
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,063
In today's

293
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:10,623
Health wearables section or sector

294
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,647
You can have a lot of

295
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:12,671
Digital

296
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,719
Smartphone e like type

297
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:15,487
Devices

298
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,535
Bicycle with with digital screens and so on

299
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,583
Why things takes a very analog approach

300
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:21,631
To all the tile tracking and

301
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:23,167
They make devices that look like

302
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,703
Traditional watches

303
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,751
4 things that you want to wear bracelets inside

304
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:29,823
And they just have like an indicator like a sweeping hand

305
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,615
4 steps for example work

306
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:36,735
Arepa calories burned it mean to have apps as well as I don't want to say they're completely analog cuz they're not but

307
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:39,551
It's just always thought there an underdog here

308
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:42,111
So I think why things feels like an underdog for

309
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,159
What is there French

310
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,351
50%

311
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:56,703
In in 2015 I believe it was that they said that about 50% of their sales come from

312
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:59,007
And then the rest

313
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,287
Come from your opinion

314
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:02,079
Like 10% comes from Asia

315
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:02,847
So

316
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,639
Right there you know

317
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:05,663
Probably

318
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,431
A bit more

319
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:09,247
Global in their scope but the other thing is

320
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:12,063
They have a lot more than just the activity K-pop

321
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,087
They have

322
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:13,855
Pulse

323
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:14,879
Which is

324
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:21,279
Activity tracker that also at the heart rate sensor and it was actually one of the first to have those of have a heart rate sensor on

325
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:22,303
Like that type of

326
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,071
Activity tracker

327
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,119
They have

328
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,399
A bunch of devices

329
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:28,191
Like a baby monitor

330
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:31,519
A smart scale for weighing your baby they have

331
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:32,799
A scale for weight

332
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,847
Normal people adults

333
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,895
They have a blood pressure monitor

334
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:39,199
And a couple of

335
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:43,551
It actually worked really hard like it getting FDA approval for their more medical devices

336
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:47,391
Are they actually at CES were showing off a new thermometer in New Canaan

337
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:48,415
Thermometer to

338
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:53,791
Broad range of products and and that makes it even

339
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,839
A better fit for Nokia in my opinion

340
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,375
Yes and that's what I was going to

341
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:03,519
Which I don't think they cornered the market in it all

342
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,103
Holistically about

343
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:09,663
Quantified Self data in there trying to get it

344
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:12,223
To where it actually abused for the medical

345
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:16,063
A profession where some of like Fitbit and Jawbone they're kind of like

346
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:22,463
We don't really care what David pay those companies tend not to want to deal with the FDA here in the states

347
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:25,535
Yeah and I also I think

348
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,327
You're not as focused on

349
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:28,863
Bridging the Gap

350
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,143
In-N-Out

351
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:32,191
4 V bucks in parables

352
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:38,847
Money in healthcare is for the insurance firms

353
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,895
To a point where things are FDA-approved

354
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,223
Simplethings

355
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:50,623
Yeah but probably better or more aggressively than most of the others in the in the space I would agree

356
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:52,159
It's all about the data

357
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,183
And what

358
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:55,487
You can do with it how accurate is it end

359
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:58,047
Frequent use it you know in healthcare industry

360
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:01,887
So I was kind of shy but the purchase price was a little small

361
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:08,543
Just to put that in context for a 2015 reported 1.86 billion

362
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,311
10 in Revenue

363
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:11,359
Not all of that

364
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,639
Miss from device sales

365
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:15,199
Diesel Service as well

366
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:17,759
Yeah so true if you think about that

367
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:19,295
From that perspective you know

368
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,831
190

369
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,111
Almost 200 million is

370
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:22,879
This is nothing

371
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,927
Thinking about their actual Revenue

372
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:25,695
Agreed

373
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:32,351
28 2015 they sold 21.4 million connected Health and Fitness.

374
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:34,143
So

375
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,727
They are the leader

376
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:41,311
That's kind of where we are

377
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,359
Here do you care to think about like

378
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,383
Nokia

379
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,919
Backing devices

380
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:51,551
Oh I mean it's in their DNA has been minnow for a while I'm in a company

381
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:54,623
What hundred sixty-seven years old and started out

382
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:56,159
With the

383
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,439
Yeah exactly

384
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,975
I just turned into

385
00:15:59,487 --> 00:15:59,999
Youku

386
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,535
Conglomerate of many different

387
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,071
Businesses

388
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:06,143
But either they don't have a true device

389
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,983
Group you stay is considering the whole Microsoft purchasing

390
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:13,311
And all the phone business and so on so

391
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:15,871
That's more people there they have investment funds of money

392
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:18,687
And then enter the good folks

393
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,735
Don't know what to do I think

394
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:23,551
With Y things to add to continue growing it so

395
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:27,391
I think it's it's nice to see Nokia in a return to

396
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:31,231
A segment that gives them some play on the device side but also on

397
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:32,767
I'm on the outside as well

398
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,303
Got it and they said that Cedric

399
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,863
Hutchings who is currently the CEO of why things will lead

400
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,399
They're digital Health business

401
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,167
That will be great

402
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:44,287
Anderson proximately 100 R&D people that Nokia has working on digital health

403
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,567
MLB part of that

404
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,639
And I'm not going to say where he's probably going to be

405
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,663
Cuz I say it wrong

406
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,687
In Finland

407
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,455
Take the city

408
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:57,599
I want someone to actually put I know what a print of one of her listeners corrected me and now I forget

409
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:03,999
It might be us but like I forget but whoever it was thank you for correcting me

410
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,279
Yes we appreciate it

411
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:07,071
Even though we have not put that knowledge to

412
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:10,143
I'm not going to lie

413
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,679
Whatever you know Act

414
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:12,703
She sometimes

415
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:13,983
We like to get it right

416
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:17,055
The other story I thought worth mentioning this week

417
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:18,079
Questyle

418
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,871
Which I should just bought one

419
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:23,711
Tile is a Bluetooth tracker that you stick on things

420
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:24,735
And

421
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:30,111
That sounded like an ad did it because did you buy one because you lost one

422
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,391
No

423
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:33,951
If I spent $25 on my

424
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:34,975
My tile.

425
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:36,767
$12 water

426
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,815
That's what it was so

427
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,119
Lust

428
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:41,887
2 $12

429
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:42,655
Water bottles

430
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:45,983
What's the title run gymnastics

431
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,519
What's the title cost these days

432
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:52,639
The tile is $25 if you buy just one and 1750 per tile if you buy a

433
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:55,711
Triton T2 Bluetooth tag for folks are not familiar

434
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:57,247
Yes

435
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,271
To your phone

436
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,295
The cool thing about tile

437
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:02,111
And why were I'm so excited about it

438
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,391
Is that

439
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:05,439
It has the potential

440
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:08,255
It's kind of become a poor man's GPS

441
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:09,023
I think

442
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:12,607
I say this because what happens is when you lose

443
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:16,447
Your device or when you actually when you buy a tile you install the app on

444
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,215
On your phone

445
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:19,519
And from then on your phone becomes

446
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:22,079
Able to detect other tiles

447
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,615
So someone says

448
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:27,967
I lost my bike and there's a tile on it and so they Mark the tile

449
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:28,735
Is lost

450
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:32,831
If you're walking by that stolen bike without missing bike

451
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:33,855
With your

452
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:35,647
Phone in the tile apps on it

453
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,695
That your phone will actually

454
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:40,511
Seamlessly to you you don't see it happen will send a notice

455
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:41,279
Vacation out

456
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,047
To the service

457
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,679
It's like a crowdsourced device GPS thing hits

458
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,959
Weather in

459
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,007
It's great so

460
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,055
They actually do this not that I bought

461
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:57,407
The actual actually reported their revenue for the first time this week

462
00:18:57,663 --> 00:19:02,527
And they in 2015 sold 43 million dollars worth of tiles

463
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,063
Salat times

464
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,855
A lot of Trials

465
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:11,487
When I looked on my app I had 15 almost 15000 Tiles near me

466
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:13,023
Which meant that there were

467
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:13,791
I know

468
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:15,583
Oh sorry no 1500

469
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:17,887
Still alive

470
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:20,447
What's a 15 + I'd say a lot but

471
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,727
Kitchen

472
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:24,031
Yeah so that's people Oliver Austin that if

473
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,567
You know I leave my water bottle

474
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:27,359
Somewhere maybe

475
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,199
I haven't left this water bottle

476
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:31,967
Anywhere yet just

477
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:33,759
The test this out but we'll see

478
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:34,783
I probably will soon

479
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:37,343
And is part of actually making money

480
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,879
They're kind of going

481
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:41,439
Not a different direction but they're adding on to their business

482
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:43,999
They could have deal with

483
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,791
Integrate tile into

484
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:46,559
The car

485
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:50,655
So this is interesting because now your car is basically like

486
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,447
A walking tile

487
00:19:55,775 --> 00:20:00,895
SSO is this to help you find your car or is it for the car to remind you that your device with a tile

488
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:01,919
Is it with you

489
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:02,687
Both

490
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:04,991
Double bus

491
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:10,623
Mike Farley who is an executive

492
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:16,767
He told me that this next year tiles going to focus on these integration so you should see more

493
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,559
More tiles integrated

494
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:19,327
Other device

495
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,887
Actually with an umbrella in it

496
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:24,959
Which you know you'll never lose your brother again was kind of idea

497
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,007
I don't think that went

498
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:27,775
Very far

499
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,591
Because it was a very expensive umbrella

500
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:32,127
Yeah

501
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:34,687
Yeah when you're talkin about adding tile to

502
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:37,759
The cost of an umbrella versus adding tile to the price of a car

503
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:38,527
Micardis

504
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:41,087
Sucks that price right into it so it's not a big deal

505
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:42,879
Seattle

506
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:46,463
I was excited by this I was excited by the fact that I get connected device come

507
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,487
He is making

508
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:48,255
That much more

509
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:52,351
Good on tile

510
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:54,143
Which brings us to

511
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:56,959
Tencent

512
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:58,751
If you want another in your life

513
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,799
Let's talk about what you should get

514
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05,663
Has by golly I got an ass

515
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:06,943
Nest

516
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:08,991
Pebble

517
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,015
Pebble Hill

518
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:11,039
I don't know how

519
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:16,416
I think the Pebbles not a bad by because it's not that expensive and adds a lot of value

520
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:21,536
Well I mean

521
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,400
I mean the regular Pebble that I would say just

522
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:29,216
You know what gives you the basics it's not that expensive

523
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:30,240
Okay so the regular

524
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,008
Pebble

525
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,568
Alright then

526
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:34,592
I'm sorry

527
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:37,664
I have one

528
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:39,712
So you know it's out there

529
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:43,552
Is it like $75 can you get it for less than that I bet you could get

530
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:45,856
It's about right though

531
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:47,904
So so that's the basic Level Kevin

532
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,976
I was going to suggest a title

533
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:52,768
Because it's great to put on

534
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:53,792
Yorkies and it's like

535
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:54,560
25 bucks

536
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:55,840
And

537
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:58,656
Also if you're younger and you lose stuff

538
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,424
Often

539
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,240
You can actually like make your mom to have to look for it as often

540
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:03,776
Hypocrite

541
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:06,336
It's like the gift that you give yourself the gift to her

542
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:09,664
You know I I thought about you

543
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:13,248
Putting one in my purse or something like that though the other thing is from the app

544
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:15,296
Make the tile beep and it'll tell you where

545
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,064
Your stuff is

546
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:20,160
That's always nice it's nice if you are not the type of person who

547
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,184
Sister phone

548
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,720
My mom kind of is so so

549
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:24,256
That's wassup.

550
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:27,584
All right so other things for your mom

551
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,120
Do you think you buy your mama knows

552
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:31,936
Or Barb

553
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:32,704
Your wife who is also

554
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,520
I mean they don't really

555
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:36,544
Like we have a nest

556
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,336
If we didn't I would buy one

557
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:42,176
They wouldn't be like very enthused by it at all honestly

558
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:43,456
When they sent me that.

559
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:44,224
Campaign outside

560
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:45,248
You know

561
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,528
Connected devices

562
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:48,320
But if my family bought me a thermostat

563
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,088
For Mother's Day

564
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:49,856
Be kind of like

565
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:53,952
Yeah I don't I don't think that would go over too well

566
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:56,000
There are devices

567
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:57,536
Could go over

568
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:59,072
So if your mom likes

569
00:22:59,328 --> 00:22:59,840
To cook

570
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:04,704
I'm going to recommend maybe one of the automated sous vide so the Anova sous vide is out there

571
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,728
And

572
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:06,752
That's pretty

573
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:08,544
Cool cuz they have both Wi-Fi and

574
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:10,592
About to drop scale

575
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:11,616
There's

576
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,176
That is actually $100

577
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:16,224
And it makes both

578
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:16,992
Cocktails

579
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:17,760
Aunt

580
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:19,552
Baked goods will any kind of

581
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,672
So the Anova cooker is about 180 bucks

582
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:26,208
So that's kind of expensive

583
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,744
But you know your mom she's nice

584
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:29,792
Let's see what else

585
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:30,816
The echo

586
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,608
I was going to say it

587
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:33,376
But

588
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:34,656
How you know

589
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:38,752
I don't want to overdo it cuz I know we tweak we are third fix fans of the echo

590
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,312
It's an easy-to-use consumer device

591
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,616
Cuz remember if you buy your parents

592
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:44,640
How to connect a device

593
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:46,432
You're going to support them

594
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:52,064
Would you would you actually go with an echo or would you go with something like the.

595
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:52,832
Ter

596
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:54,112
Roughly half the price

597
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:55,648
I would go with the echo

598
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:57,696
Because

599
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:00,000
Like a Sonos or something like that so I think my speaker

600
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:00,768
Capabilities

601
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:02,816
Gotcha

602
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:04,096
That's that's my rationale

603
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:05,376
Makes sense

604
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:07,936
They both do the same thing

605
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:16,384
If you're Stacy Bettis

606
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,920
Brings us full circle

607
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,528
Cuz my mom

608
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:23,552
She was established

609
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:24,320
Takashi super nice

610
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:26,368
And she's like

611
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:29,952
Cash like anything so the only other thing I would suggest for

612
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:32,512
Video doorbell

613
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:33,536
And

614
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:35,584
I'm going to say that because

615
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,680
You know if your mom is worried about like security she can see who's at the door

616
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:41,216
That's always nice

617
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:42,752
And

618
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:45,312
I don't disagree with you.

619
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,848
I was thinking to do

620
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:48,128
Dimension lights

621
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:50,432
There's a lot of moms out there who

622
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:57,088
You know they like to lie in bed and read or whatnot I actually don't know that we get a connected light but I would get a maybe I can I get switch like the

623
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:58,368
Inside switch

624
00:24:59,392 --> 00:24:59,904
Oh

625
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:01,952
Because you can you know that

626
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,256
Region free phone and

627
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:06,560
Say shut off and it shuts off you can schedule it

628
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:09,376
1011 at night whenever you're done reading

629
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:10,400
If you were

630
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:15,776
Super generous and bought an echo as well as at the echo.and

631
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:17,312
Now Mom can say

632
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:18,592
Shutter down

633
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:20,384
Lights

634
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:22,176
Okay so I will go for that

635
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:23,456
Maybe you and your siblings

636
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,224
Can all get together

637
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:28,832
So those are kind of some things that we that we thought about from the bombing

638
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,112
That would be

639
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:32,416
Kind of nice connected devices

640
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:33,696
For your mom

641
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,328
Golf devices

00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:40,864

Hans vestberg who is the CEO of Ericsson

647
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:55,200
You may have heard of their giant Communications infrastructure company

648
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:57,248
And I talked to Hans

649
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:59,808
After the company reported earnings last week

650
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,344
Which actually

651
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,416
Their stock drop 10% after they reported earnings

652
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,696
Wall Street did not like

653
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:08,768
And they announce the restructuring of their business

654
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:12,096
The reason he's on here he's going to talk about 5G

655
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:13,888
He's going to be talking about

656
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:20,288
Turning your company into kind of an iot Focus company so the digital transformation that a lot of businesses are facing right now

657
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,568
And

658
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,104
A little bit about that

659
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,408
The carrier kind of perspective on I

660
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,456
It's okay

661
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:29,504
So

00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,272

671
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:17,632
I'm finally

Great but I bet you guys

673
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,472
Doing better

674
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,264
Ericsson

675
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,848
Actually when we're recording this reported earnings and

676
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,384
What street was

677
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,152
Was not impressed

678
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,432
So

679
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:34,016
I'd love to talk to you because you guys are great

680
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:39,648
It is trying to adapt your business to it

681
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:41,952
Let's start off with

682
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:44,000
What you saw coming when you saw it

683
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:45,792
And what you guys decided to do about

684
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,056
Until the next Generation the old networks in a little. But I think we

685
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:59,104
We thought it of course having a baby

686
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,688
The network switch deal is very important

687
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:16,512
Cloud it needed

688
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:19,328
Drake's net worth

689
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:28,544
Based on our anchor Core Business web developer Jason B students.

690
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,360
And of course honey much more soap franchises in Thailand

691
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:32,896
That was sort of that

692
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:34,176
Epaystub

693
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:39,552
Area

694
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,344
The structure that

695
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,648
Support

696
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:44,672
Okay

697
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:46,720
So judging by your results

698
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:49,280
This is a difficult transition

699
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:52,096
You're really trying to thread the needle here as your

700
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:54,144
Core Business Network

701
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:55,680
It stack meaning

702
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:58,496
It's their consolidation in the industry there

703
00:28:58,752 --> 00:28:59,776
Traders are buying

704
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:03,872
Bus stuff they're transitioning to sdn which means they're going to require less

705
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:05,152
Of your gear

706
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:07,968
So how are you guys thinking about

707
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:10,272
Adding Services it how is that going

708
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:15,392
How to say I'm looking for structure

709
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,184
Market

710
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:39,968
Dramatic transformation

711
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:46,112
Then of course

712
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:48,928
Which one you think

713
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:55,072
Based on our strength on the telephone side

714
00:29:57,376 --> 00:30:01,472
Growing plant

715
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:05,824
I cannot pillow sets

716
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:06,848
Step ladder

717
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:07,872
Slower pace

718
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:11,712
Okay

719
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:16,320
Let's talk about some of the services

720
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:17,344
Units

721
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,648
Cloud computing

722
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:22,464
Media network products and then services

723
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,232
So

724
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:29,120
The service aside I'm guessing that's the side that's probably most related to the internet

725
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:31,936
You can say that we are

726
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:34,240
Gearing up for a structure for real helicopter

727
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:36,032
America movie

728
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:39,872
Products and services

729
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:49,344
Using If It Don't Let It Go

730
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,624
We're coming from

731
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,648
I think no

732
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:55,744
And it will work with transport companies Affiliated companies

733
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:58,816
Gearing up the organization to will dust

734
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:02,912
How Port will those new Services be to Ericsson

735
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:08,032
After we have a patient up 20%.

736
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:09,312
Geico customers

737
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:14,176
Meaning yet

738
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:16,736
Even though

739
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:20,320
Patent portfolio

740
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:28,256
Giving up on orientation

741
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:29,280
Okay

742
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:34,400
What are the things that I'd love to ask you about is

743
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:37,472
Network Services

744
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:40,032
The actual providing connectivity is going to be

745
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:42,080
A small part of

746
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:46,944
Curious

747
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:49,248
How you think your customers

748
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:51,808
As the carriers are going to kind of

749
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:58,464
Are these new businesses are they

750
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,560
Think about that

751
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:03,584
Netflix

752
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:08,192
Then you have some

753
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:11,008
Service enablement that they need to put together

754
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:13,312
Mexico

755
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:15,872
Pasadena

756
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:19,712
It makes your drive more efficient something like that

757
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,064
And then everybody needs

758
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:25,088
Shoes

759
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:27,392
Eureka Pizza

760
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:28,928
The area so we can get

761
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:33,536
Concrete sandwich

762
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:37,376
We're not doing applications Bautista

763
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:43,008
Organization

764
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:47,616
1013

765
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:50,944
Money Services Company

766
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,808
I think

767
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:57,088
Ultimate doing yet

768
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:59,648
Cathay pacific application

769
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:02,464
Got it

770
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,512
Alright let's talk about 5G

771
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:06,048
Because everyone's keep

772
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:09,632
Throwing that term around and I've heard it apply to Wi-Fi to

773
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:11,168
Cellular

774
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,728
Even millimeter wave technology so

775
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:16,544
Tell me what you think of when you hear 5 G

776
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:23,200
Card games that are different

777
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:24,736
Define developed

778
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,552
That's nothing

779
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:29,600
5 years olds a different

780
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:33,696
Thinking of you the whole network

781
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:37,792
Where you need to orchestrate the whole network dealer in Utah

782
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:42,656
Let's say you have the wrong tonight or if I connect what's up with you girl

783
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:45,984
Let's say that you have another sniper

784
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:48,288
That is delivering a letter

785
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:58,016
Show on you can go with different type of slicing in the network

786
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:03,904
Four different type of

787
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:09,792
And when you talk about

788
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:17,472
We will embrace

789
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:22,080
What technologies are you most

790
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:24,128
Because right now there's

791
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:27,200
A dozen different kind of low-power wide area Networks

792
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:28,224
Running around out there

793
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:34,624
Millimeter wave stuff from like even Facebook and Google are getting it on this moron delivering actual

794
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:36,160
Backhaul and access

795
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:40,000
Players that are not traditional

796
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:45,888
I think that's the most exciting is that there this time

797
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:47,936
What you said

798
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:48,704
Very sexy

799
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:53,568
Even if

800
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:56,384
I need to compression

801
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,968
Tri-State mobile network in the world

802
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:02,272
Which is older

803
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:07,136
Because you guys

804
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:13,536
Are over in Europe and I always feel that Europe is way ahead of the US

805
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:14,304
Cities

806
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:18,912
Businesses between smart Manufacturing

807
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,960
Radio Networks

808
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:23,520
Businesses

809
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:26,848
Is that true do you view Europe still is kind of more advanced

810
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:30,944
Yeah I would like to compare like that but of course

811
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:36,576
We have seen them knowing that you were being in Baltimore

812
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:43,232
Everything problem

813
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:44,256
Even though

814
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,608
Development

815
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:55,008
They will have the best donuts

816
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:03,456
Marcus like the USA Korea

817
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:08,832
UEFA Euro

818
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:10,112
Adidas

819
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:13,440
To do these type of things

820
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:14,976
Should be worried about

821
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:21,120
Spectrum

822
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:27,008
Cellular

823
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:30,080
How should we be thinking about

824
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:31,872
Allocated Spectrum

825
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:33,664
And then

826
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:35,968
Between licensed and unlicensed bands

827
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:39,808
First of all I think that's all they needed

828
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,344
Both lights

829
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,720
And we build you can actually move a thing between them

830
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:50,816
I think that's going to be important.

831
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:52,608
Men of quarter Circle

832
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:56,704
Would make

833
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,240
Honda cheaper

834
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:00,288
Add devices sheet for essay

835
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:06,432
But that we will need to use

836
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,040
Accident 78 Highway

837
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:17,440
When we talk about slicing

838
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:18,976
Slicing and dicing

839
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:20,000
Wireless networks

840
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:20,768
Spore

841
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:22,304
Kinecta cars which needs

842
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,840
You know different application

843
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:25,376
Next Level service levels

844
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:26,656
So that versus

845
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:28,192
Voice call versus

846
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:31,776
You know delivering data from a sensor out in the middle of a field

847
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:34,592
Do you think this

848
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:35,360
Getting

849
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:38,688
The network neutrality debate started up again

850
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:42,784
I hope not because it benefits our society

851
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:49,440
Need some different type of used AC

852
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:51,232
I'm in that everybody should have access

853
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:53,792
Internet

854
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:57,376
Henrico

855
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:06,080
Main attractions in Arkansas

856
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:08,896
I need some candles use technology

857
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:13,760
Sew-in talking to Wall Street about this transition

858
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:16,064
It feels like you guys have been looking

859
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,856
Forward for a long time

860
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:22,208
You're trying to prep and do something that's a long-term plan

861
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:24,768
Does Wall Street understand

862
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:26,816
Are you able to communicate or how do you

863
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:28,608
Communicate this to Wall Street

864
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:35,008
I wish I could walk or to communicate with her go away so I'm not

865
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:40,384
I hope that

866
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,176
Transparent

867
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:43,200
The way we have been

868
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:47,552
Finding Oreo or businesses

869
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:48,576
To be transparent

870
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:51,136
You can pull up the nest

871
00:38:55,232 --> 00:39:00,608
So what would your advice be to other Executives who are in the middle of a digital transformation

872
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:02,912
So fast

873
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,960
How do you say

874
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:06,496
Do you have any advice for how they should

875
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:08,288
Communicate to shareholders

876
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:09,312
Customer

877
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:16,480
Define where you want to be young

878
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:21,344
Then you need to see that you going to have me for dinner

879
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,904
Turquoise and pink

880
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:35,936
Like the books

881
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:36,960
That's what we are

882
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:39,264
Going through

883
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:41,568
And you guys actually

884
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:42,592
Over the last

885
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:44,896
Like 3 years or so have actually

886
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:45,920
You've let it

887
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:47,712
A bunch of jobs go

888
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:50,528
You actually brought in a bunch of people with new skills

889
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,344
Actually really good

890
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,880
Example of kindness

891
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:56,672
How you're having to adapt

892
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:58,464
Can you talk a little bit about that

893
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:02,048
Yeah if you just give the number

894
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:10,496
On the basis of hunger Pizza Dalton at base of course

895
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,312
Very big transformation to have the right

896
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:14,592
Open Android Market

897
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:17,664
