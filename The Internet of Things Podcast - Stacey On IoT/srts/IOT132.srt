A brand new os4 wearables that can track what you eat

16
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:37,632
Possibly

17
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:39,424

Who is the CEO and founder of open sensors

23
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:58,624
And she's got talked about how to scale infrastructure this is really good for

24
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:02,464
Your boss

25
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,256

So

29
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:11,424
Let's get started with a message

30
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:14,752
This week sponsor

31
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:15,776

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,464
Bacnet my bus and more so if you work with these protocols you're going to want to work with clarity

38
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:40,864

Slash advert

45
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:03,392
Okay Kevin

46
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:06,720
Let's get started with security

47
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:07,488
This week

48
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,512
Ring

49
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:11,840
Watch it security system which we were totally expecting

50
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:12,864
And

51
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,400
I find myself a little underwear

52
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,168
What about you

53
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:22,080
You know it seems like everybody's got their own security system coming out now or maybe they're partnering with somebody to

54
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:24,128
Panther security offering

55
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:30,528
Hey with an ounce compared to everybody else last week we talked about the new Nest secure

56
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:31,296
Security system

57
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,832
And another one

58
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,880
But later I kind of like

59
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:37,696
Ring is doing her because it's not expensive

60
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:40,256
Some of the details

61
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,792
Their home system is called

62
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:45,120
It retails for 199

63
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,912
A cheat code for arming and disarming

64
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:49,472
A contact sensor for a window or door

65
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:52,544
Passive infrared sensor for detecting motion

66
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,616
And a Z-Wave extender for adding range to smart

67
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:57,920
So

68
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:58,944
It's not a ton of stuff

69
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,968
Get you started

70
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:03,808
Yeah there's not a lot of sensors now in contrasting Nest system

71
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,344
Cost

72
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:06,368
Includes

73
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:09,952
I don't know what to call it

74
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,256
But it also has sensors

75
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:15,072
Serious and you can tags that let you

76
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,352
Swipe in and out of

77
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,752
Motion sensor

78
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:24,544
What column to extra fancy

79
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,312
Sensors

80
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,104
And then

81
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,176
There is another thing out this week SmartThings

82
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,968
Is working with ADT

83
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,040
BestBuy to Launch

84
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,160
I almost don't want to because this is really disappointing

85
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:42,208
And keep them

86
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:48,352
Samsung has you said working with ADT is an ADT monitor do-it-yourself security

87
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:52,960
Solution Power by SmartThings it'll be available exclusively at Best Buy

88
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:59,360
On October 29th you can pre-order it now if you're going to pre-order it's going to cost you 504

89
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,640
$49

90
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:05,504
And it's kind of basic to you don't get a ton of stuff and it's a starter pack

91
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,904
What's got a panel touch panel so that you can check in and check out the arm disarm etcetera and as far as sensors

92
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,208
Comes a 2 door and window

93
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:16,000
Sensors are detectors and emotion

94
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:21,887
Base station serves as a SmartThings Hub work with other SmartThings devices

95
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:22,655
Just great

96
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:25,471
Buy 4999 for olives

97
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,263
That which is not a lot

98
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,031
Seems

99
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,823
Like a lot of money to me and that's

100
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,639
Again that's the starter pack does not include monitoring

101
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:39,039
Get back to the ring monitoring and then talk about Nest modern as opposed to but if you want to have ATT professionally monitor

102
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:43,391
It starts at 1499 and safety

103
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:49,791
Meyering and then 2499 a months is for security services so I kind of thought for 5:49

104
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:52,095
The monitoring service for maybe a year

105
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,631
But I don't see it that way

106
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:58,239
Appear that they are don't know what Nest will charge for monitoring

107
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,519
Ring is going to charge

108
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,847
100 a year

109
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:05,663
Serene's pricing is actually really good

110
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,967
Get $10 a monthly fee gets you

111
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:09,759
All of your video

112
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:12,319
According

113
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:14,111
If you bought into the system

114
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,391
You probably wouldn't pay much

115
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,159
4 month

116
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,463
Highly significant

117
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,231
Compared to light

118
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:21,791
ATT offers or even something

119
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:22,815
You know like

120
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:26,399
SimpliSafe they have monitoring to I think that's 10 or $15

121
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:28,959
That's all so different from the nest

122
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:31,775
Security monitoring because it's

123
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:37,919
Going to be separate from the nest aware subscription which is now $10 a month for my recordings and such

124
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,711
Right the nest security

125
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:40,991
I think that's going to be

126
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:42,783
It is

127
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,599
Funtimes okay

128
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:49,183
So I was talking to somebody in the industry cuz I have written a lot

129
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:52,511
About how security is the Gateway

130
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:53,791
To the Smart Home

131
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,583
And so it makes sense that

132
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,887
ATT would get in on this

133
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:00,447
Pulse was home automation Plastics

134
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:02,239
Security really didn't do much about

135
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:04,543
And they also were suing

136
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,567
Because

137
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,127
To help integrate

138
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,407
With the security system

139
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,175
And

140
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,711
Ring was like

141
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:14,015
We Investments are not taking her IP

142
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:17,087
And so that lawsuit is still I don't know where that is it's still

143
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,623
Glasses take long time

144
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,159
It's worth noting

145
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:22,975
Employees

146
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:23,999
But they didn't buy the

147
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:26,559
It's very complex

148
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:27,583
Fairy wax

149
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,887
But having those people on board

150
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:30,655
Means

151
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:35,263
They're going to connect with other things so the ring security system

152
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,311
Additional outside

153
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:40,895
We don't know what those actually really encouraging

154
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,735
Don't do it right so

155
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,759
Yay

156
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:49,599
This is a lot of confusion there's a lot of

157
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:51,135
Stuff happening in the market

158
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:53,183
Are because security issues such a

159
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,719
Place to start selling

160
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:55,743
Hannah smart

161
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:58,559
Most the time I hear the stat

162
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,863
The 20% only 20% of America

163
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:01,631
Let's have some fun

164
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:02,911
Sakura

165
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,447
Which is really low

166
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:08,031
It is it is but I think you're right as far as a gateway drug

167
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:08,799
Because

168
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:14,431
It's something that people can equate to easily make security systems have been around for years and years and years

169
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:18,527
Where is the Smart Home Smart Home is a relatively new phenomenon

170
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:24,927
So I guess people can quite understand what it is I think they're also used to paying a lot of money for security system

171
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:29,535
And I wonder if that is playing into some of these packages and pricing plans

172
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:34,655
If I just securing my home

173
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:38,239
A security system

174
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,519
Nestor smart

175
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,311
Are things you know plus the

176
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,335
150

177
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,103
Dr200

178
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,639
Camera

179
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,919
Yes

180
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,455
Crazy but it's also

181
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:55,135
It's also going to cover your whole home if you're going to spend that much money you're going to get a ton of sensors right

182
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:58,975
Where is if you start with one day is like the ADT SmartThings package

183
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:02,303
For $500 you're monitoring one or two maybe three things

184
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,327
So you have to

185
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,375
Then spend hundreds more on top of that

186
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:08,447
We should also say that there's been companies doing this for a while

187
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:11,007
SimpliSafe is probably

188
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,031
Smartest

189
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:15,103
A friend of mine the SimpliSafe

190
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:20,991
Effect and basically they're saying hey SimpliSafe

191
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,271
Plus monitor

192
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:23,551
Very little

193
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,087
And

194
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:30,719
Another company that does very excited about

195
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,511
But they love their boats

196
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,839
354 the basement a moment

197
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,887
They can go out from there

198
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,239
I feel like there's one other company

199
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,007
Worth mentioning

200
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:43,775
I can't remember

201
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,335
Well that's okay while you're thinking about that I've got

202
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:51,711
What is this due to like the canaries and all the others that are

203
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:53,759
Home security cameras

204
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:56,831
I'm glad you asked because I'm very worried

205
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:59,135
About them so

206
00:08:59,391 --> 00:08:59,903
Canarian pipe

207
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,951
Where to home security come

208
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,743
I love to pieces

209
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,535
You brought them into your house

210
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,583
Camera and a bunch of sensors

211
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:08,863
You

212
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:11,167
Punch it in and if it noticed something

213
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,703
You no emotion it would

214
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,495
Notify you in

215
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,775
Oh my gosh

216
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,311
Someone's at my house you could check the

217
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:19,359
The Cameron say yes there is a person

218
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,383
Could activate lyca

219
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,687
Really loud siren on the device

220
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:23,967
I thought those were really

221
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:26,015
Interesting and they were actually

222
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:29,087
Like they felt like a step forward

223
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:30,623
Home Security

224
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,671
Leslie

225
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:35,743
Let's let's insertion

226
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:36,511
Device

227
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,047
Think about how your home

228
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,327
Behaves and let you know

229
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,351
When something is different

230
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:43,423
But I'm not sure they're doing well for example just this week

231
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:46,751
Canary

232
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:50,591
We saw a lot of video on the cloud and it's not really tenable financially

233
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,127
Play for us so we're going to have

234
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:52,895
To ask

235
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:56,735
We're going to roll back some pictures and I thought this was really

236
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:57,503
Unfortunate

237
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,039
Because nobody wants to

238
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,319
Teacher's butt

239
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,087
Also

240
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:05,183
If you don't have a business model that sustainable

241
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:08,767
Business

242
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,327
So there is

243
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,375
In the future there rolling back

244
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,167
Is always

245
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:15,935
Recording

246
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:18,495
They said that they chose that one

247
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,799
Because

248
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:23,359
Most people turn their canaries to private

249
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,663
I would imagine so yes

250
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,271
It is probably the least

251
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:36,671
Sure I can understand why they're doing that and I just think in the long-term day and

252
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:39,231
Similar products are going to be more in a niche

253
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:43,071
Market than those who are teaming up and coming out with their own Solutions

254
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,607
Broader Solutions I should say

255
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:48,959
Security space

256
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,239
What do you think

257
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:53,311
Alright so lots of new things

258
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,615
What's up

259
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,663
Speaking of Piper

260
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:58,943
Which is one of those security

261
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:01,759
Piper Russell

262
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:02,783
Yuri

263
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:03,807
I don't know

264
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,855
The score podcast

265
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,183
Russell

266
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:10,975
Meet the piper

267
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:13,279
He left when Piper was sold to

268
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:18,143
And now he's doing a comedy called Clash

269
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,167
Works and

270
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:21,983
They make a product that will be out next year

271
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:25,823
Just a quick thing about this this is going to be a product that you stick on your

272
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:31,711
Car dash like the piper it takes a picture it also has sensors that plugs into the OBD port

273
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,247
Your car too

274
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:35,807
Gather location in Geneva

275
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:40,415
The idea here is to understand what's happening in

276
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:45,535
Around your car so you can check in on people as they're driving so

277
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:47,327
Tesla

278
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:49,119
Where's my husband and daughter

279
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:52,447
Are they are they stopping to get dinner let's see

280
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,215
Where they parked

281
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,751
You can also

282
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:55,775
Check in

283
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,823
See the road from

284
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:03,199
And then it also when your car is parked it has like glass break monitoring sensors and

285
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,223
Like Notifier

286
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:04,991
You something

287
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:06,527
So

288
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:12,159
All of that comes it's 299 for the device and then there's going to be a subscription fee for the LTE

289
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,439
Connectivity associate

290
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,463
It's going to be

291
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,487
At its lower-end

292
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,255
$5

293
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:17,791
No idea how high that

294
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,095
No I think this is actually really

295
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,119
Cool device

296
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:24,191
Mostly because I like getting my car data

297
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:24,959
And also be

298
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:28,031
Because I like the idea of having a camera in my car

299
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:32,127
Car that can turn on when something happens around it so late

300
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:34,175
I want to test it because unlike someone

301
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:39,551
Right I agree I think that's the

302
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:40,831
Most attractive

303
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,111
Here to this product

304
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:48,255
Plug-in modules that you can just get your car data today without module for a hundred bucks

305
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:59,263
Data coming everyday on my efficiency

306
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,359
See if somebody thing me when I'm parked or something like that I like the idea that

307
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:05,407
Are you going to pull the trigger unless you were actually look

308
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:10,015
You know I don't know about the T-Mobile syncup Drive

309
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:10,783
Yes I am

310
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:16,671
So I actually stumbled upon the syncup drive from T-Mobile

311
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:23,071
I noticed that this is not April OBD plugin module for car

312
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,863
Arsenal to check to make sure your car is

313
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:31,263
Actually compatible with my phone is not I was shocked to see that so all of our other cars are

314
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,079
Same thing it's a breeder that diagnoses vehicle issues

315
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:39,967
And so on other things as LTE built-in

316
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:46,367
You will pay for a 2 GB data plan per month for this and that lets you turn your car into a hotspot for

317
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:52,767
Idevices again to share

318
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:55,071
I don't need that aspect of it

319
00:13:55,327 --> 00:14:01,471
The device itself also includes with the to get you get roadside assistance

320
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:03,775
Vehicle and

321
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:09,663
A support service from Allstate Motor Club so that's included in your monthly fee

322
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,711
It's only $2

323
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,479
A month

324
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:18,879
For 24 months for the data plan that includes the roadside assistance as well as all the time

325
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,159
Getting an app on your car

326
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,695
I think that's a heck of a deal

327
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:23,743
I don't think I've ever used

328
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:27,839
Nice piece of mind for people who don't have Roadside Assistance

329
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,215
So they have

330
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:35,007
It's the same sort of thing

331
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:41,407
Roadside assistance

332
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,687
Different

333
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:46,527
It is a subscription starting at like 10 bucks to Fifteen bucks

334
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,831
Plus that Verizon activation fee

335
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,111
Just makes me want

336
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:53,439
And then there's like a $30 and

337
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,511
So wow

338
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,559
That sounds like a smoke

339
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:02,399
Alright guys so connect your cars

340
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,423
No

341
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:08,031
A crazy light bulb because it's been a long time since I've talked about lights

342
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:11,615
This guy is worth talking about this is the he light

343
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:13,407
It is a Kickstarter project

344
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,711
And this is a smart bulb that does two things

345
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,527
It listens to you

346
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,575
And then to

347
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:23,391
It has easy pre-programmed

348
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,695
Including things like Halloween

349
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,719
Because it's October

350
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:28,255
Makes it close

351
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,279
Flickers into

352
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:31,327
Astro be effective

353
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,375
A spooky flickering can

354
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:34,655
And my

355
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,703
Personal favorite which is

356
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,727
The romantic

357
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,031
Witches

358
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,055
A pink

359
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,079
Elsa coming

360
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,663
So I think this is cool but I kind of

361
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:46,943
Freak out

362
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:50,783
Why because it listens to everything that you just got to pounce it

363
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,879
Azure making noise

364
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,671
Slickers from

365
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:59,231
One kind of pink to a stronger type of

366
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:00,255
FaceTime

367
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:03,327
Which

368
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,143
Curtains

369
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:13,567
I don't know I personally would not but I think it's an interesting

370
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,103
Melding of

371
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,639
A different type of sensor you don't

372
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:19,967
Often have with a lightbulb right you don't typically have sound

373
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:20,735
Is the trigger

374
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:26,367
A candlelight mode and then you can actually blow on the light

375
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:29,183
Just like a candle and it will cure your breath in

376
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:31,743
Shut up like a regular Candlewood if you've got

377
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,791
The music playing it can

378
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,631
Colors and whatnot.

379
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:40,959
Shoe People

380
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:43,775
It's not as interactive right this is

381
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,567
Cuz you got to use your smarts

382
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,103
The sound 2

383
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:49,919
Music translations

384
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:50,687
On your smartphone

385
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,711
Your smartphone has to be

386
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:58,623
So this would be smartphone free because the sound module is built into the bowl itself

387
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,719
Crazy sensors in

388
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,071
60

389
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:07,839
Bucks

390
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,119
Oh that's that really

391
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:13,215
So that really 60 bucks for three bulbs problem

392
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:15,775
More realistic pricing is going to be

393
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:17,055
130

394
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:17,823
4

395
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,871
No that's that's still not realistic

396
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:26,271
Now the 3-pack it looks like the estimated retail price of a 117 or roughly $40 of

397
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:30,111
Color changing

398
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:34,207
Yeah Usher assassin

399
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,743
Some of this is also

400
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:39,071
Really interesting so it looks like his blue toothpaste

401
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,095
Because

402
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:44,959
You actually it doesn't have a hug when you change the bulbs color you're doing it by sound

403
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:47,007
I'm not says without Bluetooth Wi-Fi

404
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:49,823
You can do it with or without from what I can see

405
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:52,383
It isn't

406
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:54,687
I'd be curious to see

407
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:57,503
If I had watching a movie or something

408
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,807
There's like a door makes a like a movie mood

409
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:06,207
Kind of like what she was dumb a certain television shows I remember I didn't have Hue bulbs at the time but I was watching some things on

410
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:09,535
Syfy

411
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:14,655
Change the lights in your room to match the scene

412
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:15,679
And all that

413
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:19,007
That would be a cool mode I don't see it

414
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:24,639
You know she was actually doing that they have a hue entertainment features and they're working

415
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:26,943
With entertainment companies

416
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:27,711
2

417
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,735
By providing them

418
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:30,015
STK

419
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,039
And

420
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:33,087
It will actually allow

421
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:33,855
Companies to

422
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:34,879
Basically created

423
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:36,671
Surround sound for

424
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,975
I don't know what entertainment company is

425
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:41,023
Yeah let's make that have

426
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:43,583
I will admit that I watch Sharknado

427
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:46,399
Set the Hue Lights on and it made it like that much

428
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,703
So when that was in the water

429
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:50,239
My lights would turn

430
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:51,263
Red

431
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,543
Which I was like

432
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,079
Yeah

433
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,103
My other favorite

434
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,127
Was when it was thundering and

435
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,431
Lights with strobe

436
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,455
What article

437
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,479
Wasn't cheesy

438
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:01,503
Oh yes

439
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:02,783
Did it work with the movie

440
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:03,807
Definitely

441
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:05,599
They also did it with us Syfy channel

442
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:08,927
The show that was actually much less

443
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:14,047
I don't recall which it show I was watching on Syfy

444
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:20,191
Syfy

445
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:24,287
You can possibly look for it

446
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,615
So cool Kickstarter

447
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:28,895
Fun lights

448
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,687
Let's talk about

449
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:32,991
Passive information collection

450
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:33,759
Because

451
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:35,039
I don't we love that

452
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:39,135
So there's a company that just launched this week called clue

453
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,159
It's clear with a k

454
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:43,999
And for the Apple watch

455
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,535
This software

456
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:46,559
Magic

457
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,327
It

458
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:52,191
Isn't all software Magic

459
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,983
Software is Magic

460
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:55,263
This one's especially Magic

461
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,103
So these algorithms

462
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:02,175
Basically detect the Motions of your hand

463
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:04,223
And use that to determine

464
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:05,247
You're eating

465
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:07,807
If you're drinking and slightly more specific

466
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:10,879
Versus

467
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:11,647
Cutting steak

468
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,183
Braces

469
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,207
Reading Eggs

470
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,231
Super sandwich

471
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:20,095
So I can tell those kind of things that also tell based on how you're holding the glass if you're drinking

472
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:20,863
Water or

473
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:24,703
Grant

474
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,239
Kevin

475
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:30,847
Kevin and six-year-olds everywhere

476
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:32,383
Using a straw

477
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:33,919
It's my juice box

478
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,223
So I thought this was

479
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:38,783
Cool because I love that ideas

480
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,111
Having something at the ideas that would promote mindfulness around

481
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:44,159
It's less about calorie count

482
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:45,951
You can get

483
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:49,023
You know you can't log exact foods but you can get a sense of life

484
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,071
Wow you know what you eat a lot of food

485
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:52,607
It can also

486
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:53,375
Act

487
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:54,399
To vibrate

488
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:58,239
You're sitting there eating tortilla chips

489
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:01,055
What else does this but you know you just got

490
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:01,823
Reaching the bag

491
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:06,687
Yep during football games

492
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:09,247
Yashow she didn't want that to happen

493
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:12,063
I could tell you you like by the way you're still eating

494
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,599
You like oh so I am

495
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:17,184
This is an interesting Twist on like behavior modification

496
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:20,512
It reminds me of some of the early SmartWatches that would just eat

497
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:21,536
Text what

498
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:24,864
Exercise you're doing or some really intelligent algorithms

499
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,144
Detectamet doing a push-up

500
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,592
You're doing it maybe you shouldn't be doing it as much

501
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:41,248
I think it's a very interesting concept because

502
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,528
And see what I can find out about it

503
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:45,088
Excellent well I will say I'm a little worried about it

504
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:46,112
Not because of

505
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:48,160
This particular thing I have no

506
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:52,000
Problems and I talked to the CEO and she is wonderful and she is like

507
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,304
It stays with us when

508
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,328
Elsewhere

509
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,864
Your data

510
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,144
I look at this and I'm like

511
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,192
My hands

512
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:02,496
And you know some things I don't know if I want

513
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:04,032
People to know about

514
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:07,872
You know I don't know if I want that logged forever and software somewhere

515
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:09,920
Think about what you do with your hands

516
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:16,576
Every year it's a good point and it brings me back to the not-so-long-ago episode of

517
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:19,392
People are the police using data from

518
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:20,928
President Echo

519
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:22,208
Or a Fitbit

520
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,744
To determine

521
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,512
If somebody

522
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:27,328
I've been home when their spouse have been killed and so on

523
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:29,120
I mean that's just more data that could be used

524
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:30,656
Against you not that I'm saying

525
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:32,192
People are worried about that

526
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:34,496
Inherently good

527
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:37,312
You're right that's the tricky sticky

528
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:39,616
Situation Sticky Wicket

529
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:41,152
Latest hits

530
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:42,432
So that's that

531
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,200
I

532
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:45,248
Just throwing it out there but

533
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:48,064
Transiting about here privacy

534
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:50,112
So software running on

535
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,648
Like an app model for

536
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,440
Wearables cuz that's kind of what this week

537
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,208
Depends on

538
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:55,488
And then three

539
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:57,024
Passive data collection

540
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:57,792
Switch

541
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:58,816
As ye

542
00:22:59,072 --> 00:22:59,584
And also can

543
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,656
I will also say

544
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:03,680
Before I move off

545
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:04,448
Devices

546
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,288
Too much I ordered the Amazon Echo Plus with

547
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:11,872
That will arrive

548
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:13,152
October 31st

549
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:15,712
Which is a Tuesday you guys which means

550
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:17,760
The first podcast in November

551
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:18,528
We can be

552
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:23,904
Works I'm dying to know how and what it works with

553
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,440
Me too

554
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,208
Will let you know

555
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,232
All right

556
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:28,256
Driverless Tech

557
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:36,448
So this is just a quick news item because we know the alphabet has its way more division for self-driving cars information says that

558
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:40,288
So is getting ready to bring driverless taxis

559
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,592
Resume actually in Arizona

560
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:46,944
Specifically I think they're looking at the Chandler area which is a southern suburb of

561
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,760
Phoenix they're having some issues right now

562
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:51,808
In that the cars are struggling with left

563
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:58,208
Turns and not every intersection has the left

564
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,328
Yeah gonna make it

565
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:05,632
Obviously I've always made it but you never know

566
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:08,192
So they're looking at doing this in the Phoenix suburb

567
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:10,496
Actually saw these

568
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:14,336
When I was out in Scottsdale Arizona and back twice in one day I saw

569
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:16,128
Self-driving waymo car

570
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,480
We're at visiting ASU so they've been trying this for a while and

571
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:25,856
Arizona's pretty light on regulations with self-driving cars

572
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:27,136
Testing and

573
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:30,464
I guess implementing an actual business model

574
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:33,792
Taxi so I'm sure the Lyft and Uber drivers are not happy

575
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:35,584
Because they won't be needed

576
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:41,216
It'll be interesting to see if people actually take WeMo up on these when they don't become available in the very near future

577
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:43,008
I would

578
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:43,776
Yep

579
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:45,568
Courseware are freaks

580
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:47,616
I mean if we think about what we've done to our houses

581
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:49,920
Just by virtue of

582
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:53,248
We're out there

583
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:54,272
All right

584
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,296
Let's take

585
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:58,880
A voicemail from RI

586
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:01,696
Kevin

587
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:03,488
You want to share that number with everybody

588
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:07,840
Absolutely please call us with your questions or comments leave a voicemail at

589
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:11,936
623-7424

590
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:13,472
Unless you're coming as Stacy

591
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:15,264
Cuz I'm just not

592
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:18,848
I leave that one all the time she just delete it so don't bother

593
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:20,384
Kevin Kevin

594
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:22,176
So this week

595
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:23,200
We have a question

596
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:24,480
From Charles

597
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:26,016
Sacramento about

598
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:29,088
Hey Stacy and Kevin

599
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:32,416
Charleston Sacramento it's okay to use my message

600
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:33,696
On the podcast

601
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:34,464
Thanks again

602
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,000
For this wonderful podcast

603
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:36,768
You guys make

604
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:39,072
And the one question I had is

605
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:40,096
Withhold

606
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,888
Switches

607
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:45,216
Are all home get approved

608
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:45,984
Switches

609
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,032
Controllable when you're away from

610
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:48,800
From the house

611
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:49,824
Thanks for

612
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,104
Taking the question

613
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,384
And have a wonderful day

614
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:56,736
Oh alright Charles this is a great question I bet a lot of people wonder this

615
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:58,016
And the answer is

616
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:02,368
Remote access to any homekit

617
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,136
Devices

618
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:04,416
You have to have one

619
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:05,696
Thanks either

620
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:06,976
An Apple TV

621
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,024
Or an Apple iPad

622
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:11,840
And I think it has to be running what does it have to run Kevin

623
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:14,400
IOS 10.3 or later

624
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:15,936
On an iPad

625
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:22,336
I do not know what the Apple TV version is but I do know that the Apple TV must be

626
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,360
Duration

627
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,128
Better

628
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:26,432
Which is the most recent one

629
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:32,320
So you have to have one of those things you also have to enable in this is actually where I got tripped up at first on my

630
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:35,392
Annotation iCloud

631
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,416
The kitchen

632
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:37,696
And you

633
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:38,720
For example

634
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:43,328
The iPads are using as somebody else's iPad your going to have to

635
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,352
So

636
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:45,376
That iPad

637
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:46,144
Can talk to

638
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:46,912
Like your device

639
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,240
So that's a little wrinkled are once you get all that set up though

640
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:51,264
It works like a charm

641
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,544
And

642
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,592
You probably don't want this to be an iPad that your

643
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:55,616
Your kids play with

644
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:57,152
Because

645
00:26:57,408 --> 00:27:01,248
You have to leave it on all the time and you're going to want to leave it plugged in most of the time

646
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:04,832
Obviously, Apple TV is for most people

647
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:11,232
What purpose would be plugged in all the time it might be in sleep mode but it's still on for all intensive purposes

648
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:14,816
If you shut it off and that's your gateway to your home kit

649
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:21,216
You can't remotely access because the Gateway is effectively down so you can leave that iPad

650
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:22,240
Yeah

651
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:25,824
So this is all done through the iCloud

652
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,104
Account

653
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,896
That's what ties all this together

654
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:31,968
And then again yes iPad must be powered on

655
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,552
All right so suggest about switches I just thought I'd throw in a

656
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:38,368
Couple quick switches so because

657
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,648
I have tested mosto

658
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:41,440
Thought

659
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:43,488
So if you're going to do a home kit

660
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:44,256
Installation

661
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:47,328
Want to swap out some switches I still love

662
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:48,096
Lutron

663
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:49,376
They have a bridge can

664
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:51,168
The bridge

665
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:52,192
It's 80 bucks

666
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:53,728
Turn on the switches which are

667
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:56,800
I think they're perfect r65

668
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:59,872
Are between 65 to 10

669
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:01,664
And if you can buy some

670
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:03,712
So that's my

671
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:05,760
Favorite but if you hate the Hub

672
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:06,784
Which people do

673
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,320
Spell. Oeave

674
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:09,856
Oak snake

675
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:12,672
Switch it is only on off it is not a dimmer

676
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:14,720
Lutron that is $50

677
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:16,768
Actually works with Bluetooth

678
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,328
Capacitive touch screen I tested it

679
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,864
I found it a little

680
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:22,400
There was sometimes

681
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:23,424
Possibly because

682
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:24,704
Bluetooth

683
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,776
All in all I thought it was beautiful it was very pretty

684
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:28,800
And it were

685
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:30,080
So that's that

686
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:31,872
Idevices makes a dimmer

687
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:33,920
Or a switch so you could buy either on or off

688
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:37,504
Where the dimmer functionality for a hundred bucks I haven't helped

689
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:42,112
But I devices is worth noting because they have a Bluetooth based

690
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:44,672
Kemper remote switch that you can actually use

691
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:45,696
Three way

692
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:46,464
Lights

693
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,280
I don't think anybody else can use theirs for 3

694
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:54,912
So keep that in mind there and then Levitan

695
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:57,728
Makes a Decora iOS switch that you

696
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,056
That's actually $50 for the gym

697
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,848
I think it's 65 for

698
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:04,896
I don't love

699
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:06,944
Without switch

700
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:07,712
It's

701
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:11,296
Kind of feels sticky when you toggle it and then the dimming function

702
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:13,856
Is a tiny little knob on the side that

703
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:14,880
Just doesn't do it

704
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:17,952
Switch ratings

705
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:21,792
I have not tried any homekit switches although based on

706
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:23,072
Charles is questioning

707
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,864
Probably should so I can

708
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,632
Do that

709
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:27,936
Go grab ones I think the Leviton Maybe

710
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,984
I'll send you something

711
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:32,800
Okay okay

712
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:35,104
That is the news this

713
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,896
Weak but stay tuned

714
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:38,432
Because

715
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:40,736
Yodit Stanton

716
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:41,760
Talking about

717
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:44,576
How to build out a scalable sensor Network

718
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:46,880
A lot of these things felt

719
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:49,696
How do I common sense but there were a couple of them

720
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:50,720
I would have thought of that

721
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:55,072
Before that you have a message for this week sponsor Qualcomm

722
00:29:55,328 --> 00:30:01,472
Hey everyone we are breaking into the Internet of Things podcast with the message from our sponsor this week

723
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:04,288
Welcome and I have Raj talluri Whois

724
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:05,312
What's the SVP

725
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:08,384
And GM of iot at Qualcomm

726
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,432
How to talk to us about the edge

727
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:11,200
And AI

728
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:12,224
Rush

729
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,248
What is

730
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:14,784
Edge

731
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,088
Post NC weather industry hasn't quite

732
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:21,184
Definition of the edge easiest way to think about it is the counterpart to the

733
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,256
Cloud this is Canada last box on the last

734
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:27,584
Do I spell the internet terminates in your house on an officer

735
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:28,864
And we

736
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,656
Typically referred to Edge computing

737
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:31,424
As a price

738
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,984
Testing and Analysis that's done on this last

739
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,056
Devices so that they're much closer to where the sensor

740
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:39,872
What are the benefits of Edgecomb

741
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:41,664
What is Qualcomm doing there

742
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,480
What's the benefits of computing something at the edges

743
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:46,528
You know when you have a product that's connect

744
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:47,296
Think of the clouds

745
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:49,088
You can't usually wait

746
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:50,368
For a long time

747
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:52,416
Information to the go to the cloud and come back

748
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:53,952
Turn your computer on the edge

749
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:55,488
You know you got much shorter later

750
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:02,144
How to make X users don't want to send all the information to the clouds like for example if you had a camera that's in your house

751
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,960
Depressing locally and not send all that with you in for

752
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:08,544
Back into the clouds that's another advantage of crossing a ditch

753
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:10,592
And lastly it reduces

754
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:12,896
The total cost

755
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:15,712
Because sometimes starting all this video and I don't

756
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:17,248
Information on the cloud cost a lot of

757
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:19,040
What is qualcomm's roll

758
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:23,392
Easter think ahead of this kind of problems and make

759
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:26,720
Chips that have a lot of processing can really in them

760
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:30,560
So that we can do things like artificial intelligence and machine learning and

761
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:31,328
Camouflage

762
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:32,864
On this Edge devices

763
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,912
So the customers can take advantage of

764
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:38,240
Can you maybe give me an example of a consumer product

765
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:39,264
That uses Edge computer

766
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:42,592
Yes I recently one of our customers Nest launch

767
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:44,896
The camera and discounted Ugg a lot of Frost

768
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:45,664
Sing at the edge

769
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,432
For example

770
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:49,760
Discount on looks for things like motion listens to

771
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:54,112
It just sounds like a crash up a window breaking I think like that

772
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:54,880
And then

773
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:57,952
You know you sent a message back with another 20

774
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:59,232
Things happen also

775
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:00,512
It's going to look nice

776
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:06,656
If your family members are the ones that came with your house then it doesn't send you an alert what's this someone who's not

777
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:08,192
Houston to San Diego

778
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:09,728
Daddy's doing a lot of process

779
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:10,752
Sitting at the edge

780
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:12,288
Do give intelligent

781
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:16,640
This sounds great so we're can listeners learn more and get started using caulk

782
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:18,176
Sportage computer

783
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:24,576
Go to qualcomm.com Coyote and get a lot more information about Edge computing

784
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:38,400
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your house Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest

785
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:39,936
Yodit Stanton

786
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:43,008
Cheap CEO and founder of open sensors

787
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:44,544
She is amazed

788
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:48,128
Thank you so much for coming on the show this week

789
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,688
Thank you Stacey tramvai senior honors

790
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:52,992
I am super pumped

791
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:53,760
So

792
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:55,552
You are here this week

793
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:56,576
Because

794
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:59,648
You have built actual sensor Networks

795
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:02,208
Know how to do this

796
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:04,000
Tell us a little bit about your history

797
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,560
Yeah sure is so

798
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:07,840
I guess my history

799
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:12,448
Music careers

800
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:13,984
Muslim time

801
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:16,032
Manchester United

802
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:17,568
Came from.

803
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:23,968
What happens when the whole everything physical

804
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,272
Has been around for about three years

805
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:27,296
Started as

806
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:29,344
Pretty much a community project

807
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:35,744
I started publishing

808
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,792
Name of thing in an organization in business

809
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:39,328
So we kind of came

810
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,864
From the environment

811
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:46,496
Need nowadays we focus on helping people to Troy

812
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:48,800
Manage

813
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:49,568
Switches

814
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:53,920
Start

815
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,200
Category

816
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:01,088
Buildings mostly

817
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:05,184
A bit about what you guys do

818
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,464
What you've learned

819
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:08,512
Deploying sensors and environmental

820
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:11,840
Air quality sensors in buildings

821
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:13,120
Play all kinds of

822
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:18,496
You have said if someone calls you hey

823
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:20,032
Give me a price

824
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:21,056
Is customer

825
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:21,824
Prayer for us

826
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,360
Talk to me about what you're trying to

827
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:25,152
To get to when someone calls you up

828
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:25,920
How should people be

829
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:26,688
Be thinking

830
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:27,456
About

831
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:30,784
There's a lot of hype and froth around.

832
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:32,576
It is very cool

833
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:35,392
But when you're investing rs 50000

834
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:38,720
You know what that has to be clear

835
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:40,768
What are you going to do what is the value of thought

836
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:44,608
Even like $10 percent

837
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:49,216
And this year investing people kind of stupid

838
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:50,496
That's not a trivial thing

839
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:51,776
To do

840
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:54,336
First question is actually like what is about

841
00:34:55,616 --> 00:35:01,248
How does that change what you do now so beautiful commercial projects is really like how does it make

842
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:06,624
Ferocity how does it make you more efficient and I think there's a lot of inefficiency

843
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,648
That are hot

844
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:10,976
And the physical world

845
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:13,024
Trade-offs Roi

846
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,072
So the second question is do you really need

847
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:16,352
50000

848
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:19,936
People have some other dataset

849
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:23,776
The weather information can we use that exist Within

850
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:26,336
And then layer the sensor data over

851
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:29,152
Business

852
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:31,200
You know it doesn't really make sense

853
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:32,224
2

854
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,504
Always keep the train

855
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,088
Infrastructure

856
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,880
Can you give me an example of something

857
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:42,976
So wooden buildings

858
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:44,768
Already some sort of

859
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:47,584
Temperature sensor

860
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,888
Actually happened instruments

861
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:52,960
You see what happened

862
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:59,360
Maybe the landlord has access to it

863
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:00,640
They might have life

864
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:08,320
When people come in and out and so this already

865
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:09,856
I'm making a little bit of

866
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:14,464
Supplementing What's missing

867
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,000
With the sensors

868
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:17,024
Is probably like

869
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:17,792
The right thing

870
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,376
So it sounds like so far first I need to clear

871
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:22,656
Yusuke Circle

872
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:28,032
Then I've got to think about

873
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:29,312
What resources

874
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:30,336
Already have

875
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:31,872
4M like

876
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:33,408
Yes

877
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:35,968
And then when you read it

878
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:38,016
Actually like thing around

879
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,392
Like one small control site

880
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:46,720
Just a few sensors

881
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:50,048
Initially we tested

882
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:54,912
Sui generis

883
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:57,728
Depakote to walk across it

884
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,640
He's such a huge deal

885
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:06,688
Verifying

886
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:07,712
The information

887
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:12,576
With five sensors 10 sensors or whatever saves you so much headache

888
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:17,696
Because that's so everyone

889
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:20,512
I'm going to test elasticsearch

890
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:23,840
Cats cats cats

891
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:26,912
Testing

892
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:27,936
Independently

893
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:28,704
Verifying

894
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:32,032
Do you do that to expect my consultant

895
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:32,800
Firing someone

896
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:35,360
We do that a lot

897
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:36,384
So there is

898
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,664
A number of

899
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,688
Things we test

900
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:44,064
One is the data quality like

901
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:47,392
Another

902
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:55,584
The difference of your testing weather

903
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,608
Is sampling

904
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:59,936
Parts per billion

905
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:01,472
Doing obvious changes

906
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:05,824
People breathe on a air quality

907
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:08,896
And you see the CO2 readings go up and so forth

908
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:13,504
Is not like a defined way because they're so many variables for the day

909
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,784
One thing she's next

910
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:16,576
Does it say

911
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:19,136
In terms of if it's like Nora certified

912
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:21,184
Or Plainville organic

913
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,256
Does it actually perform in the way that you expect

914
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:27,584
Does a join in a correct way

915
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,120
You know what happens when

916
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:33,984
Gateway goes down

917
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:38,336
Because this matters because

918
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:42,688
To go down and then there's other stuff which is a little bit more nebulous around

919
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,736
Battery life

920
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:46,784
So does it it's a real

921
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,344
Live performance

922
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,160
Kind of confirming the specs versus the

923
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,464
Let's talk about this

924
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,744
Concept of scale

925
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,512
Because

926
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:57,536
People don't

927
00:38:58,048 --> 00:39:02,912
I feel like people are like

928
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:05,984
How many sensors can I put on a single Gateway soda

929
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,008
405

930
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:09,056
But they don't think about it

931
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:10,592
The boring stuff

932
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,128
What configuration management

933
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,176
So let's talk about

934
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:16,224
Even something as simple as

935
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,504
The Personnel cost

936
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:18,784
Flying sensors

937
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,344
When we start talking about operating the sort of

938
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,624
Infrastructure at scale

939
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:23,648
How should we think

940
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:27,488
There's two sides does the deployment cost

941
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:33,888
Of the personal and the maintenance cost like how much is it going to cost me and how many times do I have to get the battery change

942
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,936
You know in a given year

943
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:38,240
What we had

944
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:39,776
To do

945
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:46,944
Training programs for

946
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:49,248
Facilities manager

947
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:53,344
3D abstract away the

948
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:57,696
So our aim is to get the sensor install time

949
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:58,976
Down to

950
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:00,256
Around 30 seconds

951
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:01,280
And I think

952
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:05,376
The last assignment we got to round 20 seconds but I'm not

953
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:10,496
Counting my chickens

954
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:14,080
Somebody's going to have to physically take a Gateway put it all

955
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:17,408
Way to know at work

956
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:18,432
Because they're not

957
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,736
Software engineer

958
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:22,784
That are going to be the joint

959
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:26,368
Support

960
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:27,648
And training

961
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:28,672
Software

962
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:30,464
The people need to know this kind of

963
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,744
Make these projects

964
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:38,144
Because myself eating house like the health and safety certificates to be able to go up on a roof

965
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,448
But I think

966
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:45,056
The IRT from my perspective is going to be much more operational facing them

967
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:48,384
So you really need to be able to

968
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:50,944
The operations guys your friend

969
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:55,296
Deployment size

970
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:56,576
And it's a lot of detail

971
00:40:56,832 --> 00:41:00,672
So we have to upload things like the drawings in the schematics of build

972
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:06,048
Next

973
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:11,168
If you don't know if a sensor is

974
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:13,984
Go badly wrong

975
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:18,848
Moschino that needs device ID once in a particular corner

976
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:20,384
The interface is that

977
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,432
Triple-A batteries

978
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:26,016
Country Queen to Real by through other than people trying to figure out

979
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:28,064
Clients are getting

980
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:32,416
Looks like PCS on phones in my mind

981
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:38,048
Expense because who hasn't run around their house at like 6 in the morning are actually more like 2 in the

982
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,608
Are smoke detectors going off and they're like

983
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:42,912
Standing in front of one going at this one

984
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,472
CNN

985
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:47,264
Going to the next one until you find it

986
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:51,104
Celtic Women in a giant building with sensors

987
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:51,872
Need a battery check

988
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:54,175
Where can I find this

989
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:54,943
Let me just look it up

990
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:58,271
Rather ideally when I get a notification of a battery go

991
00:41:59,039 --> 00:41:59,551
It's like

992
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:00,319
It's this one right

993
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:03,647
Right ear and then think of this scale

994
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:06,207
Where it's usually not going to be in one

995
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:12,095
Location is going to be most of our clients have multiple kind of in different countries

996
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:16,703
So really challenging

997
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:17,727
Maintenance

998
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:19,263
It is that custom

999
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:21,823
For every client because that feels like

1000
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,359
Seeing a scale that

1001
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:25,919
For any of this just

1002
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:26,943
Can't scale yet

1003
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:27,967
Because it's just

1004
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:28,991
It's too custom

1005
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:31,551
I mean that's all we had

1006
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:36,415
The decisions that we made around what problems do we end up solving

1007
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:37,695
Rainy drawings

1008
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:38,719
Dockside

1009
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:41,279
How to do stuffed crust

1010
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:42,047
Because

1011
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:43,839
The cost just goes out of

1012
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:46,399
Also

1013
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:49,215
You know we focus on buildings asset mantri environment

1014
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:50,495
You know how to do this

1015
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:52,287
In a repeatable way

1016
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:05,087
That's for me the realization.

1017
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:06,879
A lot of variety players are going to

1018
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:08,415
Define themselves

1019
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:11,487
Just pick a vertical

1020
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:13,535
Make it work without vertical

1021
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:16,351
We know exactly what to do

1022
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:17,887
Boiler Room

1023
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:19,679
Factory

1024
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:26,847
Northam Healthcare application or widen of the other million and one things that people are doing

1025
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:28,639
So where can you stay

1026
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:30,175
Let's think about

1027
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:31,967
Like what kind of Technology

1028
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:33,247
Have you guys develops

1029
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:35,039
Actually helps you streamline

1030
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:36,063
What matters for

1031
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:36,831
Making these

1032
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:39,391
Hundreds of sensors

1033
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:40,159
Thousands

1034
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:42,207
It's really been about

1035
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:44,767
The deployment

1036
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:47,327
Maintenance

1037
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:49,375
So I mean

1038
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:51,423
What the Ensign ends up saying is

1039
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:54,239
Considerations in analytics and they're like

1040
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:57,055
The effort

1041
00:43:57,311 --> 00:44:00,895
That we put in around

1042
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:02,431
Maintenance

1043
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:03,199
Because

1044
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:06,015
It is just me or even for

1045
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:07,807
End up doing 20

1046
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:10,367
Really hard tonight

1047
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:12,159
When you got so many moving

1048
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:15,999
And so we've taken

1049
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:18,559
Should be people that have

1050
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:20,351
Deployed you know these

1051
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:23,423
The old phones and PCs

1052
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:25,983
The 90s and early 2000s

1053
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:32,639
Super streamline

1054
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:35,711
We need the drawings in the schematics of

1055
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:38,783
The floor and we're going to kind of Sanju

1056
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:40,575
Set register's office

1057
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:41,855
The project is done

1058
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:46,463
Life

1059
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:51,327
Because that status information you should be able to look at

1060
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:53,119
Battery status

1061
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:56,447
That's integrated into your slide

1062
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:58,751
Or you're going to hell

1063
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:02,079
Comes from experience

1064
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:08,479
Because I need to head line items for iot

1065
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:09,247
Super hard

1066
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:15,391
Let's talk about

1067
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:18,463
Who is going to be doing this and there's two reason

1068
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:21,023
You mention this is operational

1069
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:23,071
Operationally focused

1070
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:26,143
But then there's also the concept of how to

1071
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:28,959
Network and security sensors that

1072
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:30,239
Becomes maybe relevant

1073
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:31,263
Pick 4 SC

1074
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:34,591
Or anxiety side so I'm very curious

1075
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:36,383
How we should be thinking about Mary

1076
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:37,407
Those two things

1077
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:40,479
Yeah for sure so funny stories in the early days

1078
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:44,831
Using kind of short-range rf4 stuff that connects to the

1079
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:48,671
What we had was

1080
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:49,695
What is

1081
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:52,767
Like are you serious you want to have like

1082
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:54,303
1000 sensors

1083
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:56,607
Connect to the human network does not never going to

1084
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:58,911
So it has been

1085
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:00,191
Interlock

1086
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:03,775
At least four 2017 something like 60 or 70%

1087
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:07,615
So what Laura gives yuan standalone

1088
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:10,943
Gateway has a

1089
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:12,735
We have furniture

1090
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:14,271
A couple of tacos

1091
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:16,319
Remotely manage the Gateway

1092
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:17,343
Defense

1093
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:20,159
So that's kind of a private Network.

1094
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:21,695
Basic workouts

1095
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:23,487
Everything else

1096
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:27,327
Probably much more

1097
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:28,351
Common

1098
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:29,631
Now you might have

1099
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:32,959
A situation where the sensors talk to some monitors

1100
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:33,983
Laura net worth

1101
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:38,079
Fox network Whatever Bud like you know you can have the human hour

1102
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:44,479
These sensors cuz security

1103
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:45,503
It's just a nightmare

1104
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:49,855
I suppose built-in security

1105
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:51,391
Makes sense

1106
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:55,487
Keys and all that kind of stuff so you can

1107
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:56,511
Elise

1108
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:58,047
Take steps to war

1109
00:46:58,303 --> 00:46:59,583
It is secure

1110
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:02,399
Well even if you've created the separate

1111
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:05,983
Network so it might be Laura it could be a season

1112
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:08,543
All your devices eventually something

1113
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:09,311
Costume

1114
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:10,335
Talk to it

1115
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:14,431
Information has to hop from one network to another and maybe it's over

1116
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:15,711
Gold and that's more secure

1117
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:17,503
Kind of seems like

1118
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:20,319
That's going to be a really interesting area

1119
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:21,599
Pay attention to

1120
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:22,367
Yes

1121
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:25,695
Perspective I think the way I look at

1122
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:27,231
Securities

1123
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:30,303
A friend of mine

1124
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:31,327
Describes

1125
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:37,983
The way she describes it as you look at security

1126
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:39,007
There's mold

1127
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:44,127
The different elements

1128
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:45,663
The layer between

1129
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:52,319
The unnoticed the sensor to the Gateway and that would be appropriate security like for fedora

1130
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:56,671
You'll have more than one day

1131
00:47:57,183 --> 00:48:00,255
And then you have stayed over between

1132
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:02,559
Gateway's for example

1133
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:04,095
Those gateways behind

1134
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:05,375
And then

1135
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:07,935
There's a security from the gateway to

1136
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:14,847
One appropriate

1137
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:17,919
Suppose that industry wire Industries not having

1138
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:19,199
The conversations of

1139
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:21,759
The best practice

1140
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:24,831
Just because I see people doing

1141
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:25,855
Funny things

1142
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:28,415
Approach to security

1143
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:32,767
Could these layers are correlated are they industry-related are they

1144
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:35,327
Sensor

1145
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:37,375
The way I look at it is

1146
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:41,471
Sofa Laura for example where so their teeth

1147
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:47,615
And you're not necessarily Reinventing

1148
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:50,175
Create like the running joke

1149
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:52,735
Somebody trying to roll their own crypto wishes

1150
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:53,759
AB really bother

1151
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:56,319
There is a consideration of

1152
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:58,367
You know how much memory is done this

1153
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:00,671
Like what is the

1154
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:01,695
Worst-case.

1155
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:03,743
Maybe they can get

1156
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:05,535
Access to

1157
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:06,815
Doxycycline

1158
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:10,911
Answers I mean

1159
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:11,679
Access to the

1160
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:22,943
Then on the Gateway level is again

1161
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:24,479
What is atopy

1162
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:29,855
In your mind

1163
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:32,671
Architect sing Against what is possible

1164
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:34,207
And how people are going to

1165
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:35,743
Lesser interfere with it

1166
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:37,791
Alissa Hopkins

1167
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:39,327
More sensitive it is

1168
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:42,911
Put in a lot more effort around

1169
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:46,495
Tamper proofing like people can manually touch it

1170
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:52,127
Is Larry's but it was appropriate there is based of what is going to be gone

1171
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:59,039
Security stocks I can cover all these use cases

1172
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:00,831
What's a wearable just very different

1173
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:03,903
Architecture

1174
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:09,791
Because

1175
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:11,583
People just one

1176
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:13,119
That's a bracelet or something

1177
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:20,287
To a very dumb sensor last

1178
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:22,079
10 to $20

1179
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:31,807
Thank you so much for coming on the show this week thank you very much

1180
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:38,207
That's all for this week's Internet of Things podcast remember if you want more iot news

1181
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:44,607
