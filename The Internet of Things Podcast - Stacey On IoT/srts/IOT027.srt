00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:11,264
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast

2
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,312
I am your host Stacey Higginbotham

3
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:15,872
And today we have for you apron

4
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:17,408
Cohoes

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,688
Andrew allemann

6
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:19,456
That's right

7
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:23,040
This is a special occasion Kevin will be back with us next week

8
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:25,600
But Andrew is my husband

9
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:29,184
And today he would be playing the role of a smart home skeptic

10
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,208
Which

11
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:32,768
Actually I drew that's the role you play pretty much everyday

12
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:33,536
Right

13
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:36,352
ICandy eye candy around this household

14
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:38,400
It's hard not to

15
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:39,168
Skeptical

16
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:45,568
So Andrew just so you guys know in addition to my husband he is also a blogger and a podcaster himself

17
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,152
He blogs over at domain name wire about the domain industry

18
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:50,432
And he also has a podcast

19
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:51,200
Just about the same time

20
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:53,248
So let's get this started

21
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:56,320
You came on the podcast probably about nine months ago

22
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:58,112
And at that time

23
00:00:58,624 --> 00:00:59,392
You're pretty

24
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:03,232
I meant to say ambivalent but you were kind of down on all the stuff that I brought into the house

25
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:07,584
You actually only like one thing I believe if I recall correctly and that was

26
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,680
The SmartThings home hub that I brought in and programmed with our blinds

27
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:12,704
And had them going

28
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:14,496
Up and down on a schedule

29
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:16,800
And since then I've taken that away from you

30
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:18,592
Yes

31
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,640
You have sorry about that

32
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:21,664
But

33
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:23,456
I'm hoping that

34
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:25,248
We brought some other Gadgets in the house

35
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,576
Are there any things right now that you actually like

36
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:29,600
About her smartphone

37
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:34,464
Well to me the whole game changer the thing that shifts this to something that

38
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,024
Is practical is the Amazon Echo

39
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,816
For me being able to

40
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:40,096
Use voice commands

41
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:42,400
To control lights for example

42
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:46,496
Is great compared to having to open up

43
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:50,848
Right if you have to press a few buttons or find your phone and kind of losses

44
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:51,616
Its effectiveness

45
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,152
I mean that

46
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:53,920
Huge

47
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,456
I frankly think that

48
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:58,784
As far as this ecosystems concern that could be a big game-changer

49
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,088
You've got the Hue tap

50
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:04,416
Which is nice because you can control Smart

51
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:08,000
Device without a game getting out your phone

52
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,792
That's like the Amazon Echo is

53
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,328
Is that it's a big deal

54
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,608
All right and

55
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:14,912
In our house we mostly use the echo

56
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:15,680
Go to

57
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:17,472
Turn off the lights downstairs

58
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:18,240
But

59
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:19,776
Do you ever use it or could you

60
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,056
You see using it for any

61
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,944
Oh yeah those are the main things and again it's one of those things that works part of the time I don't know if that's

62
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,224
Alexis salt

63
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,248
Echo

64
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:30,272
Corset

65
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,040
Lights

66
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,064
Are we having

67
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:36,160
I could see myself using it to for example control the fly

68
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:37,952
It's on the other side

69
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:38,976
Just be lazy

70
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:42,048
And tell it to do that so if there was a way to cook that into the

71
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,144
Do the blinds make them clothes when it's hot out or son of your whereabouts

72
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,168
Watching TV

73
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:50,240
I think that could be valuable as well really AT&T

74
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:51,520
Smart

75
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:55,104
Connected devices if you can control them from that

76
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,384
Voices just much

77
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,688
Easier in most circumstances

78
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,712
Then

79
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:04,832
Using multiple table menus on a phone to pull up what you're looking for by that time

80
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:06,368
You may as well have

81
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,904
Found the remote

82
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,672
Or

83
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:10,208
Dundee accent

84
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,232
Got it

85
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:12,768
Alright so

86
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,096
Any other things that you're kind of like

87
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:19,424
Thinking oh this is a nice to have in the house lissy

88
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,728
Connect two thermostats

89
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:22,752
I feel like

90
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:26,848
You may not touch the nest every day but I feel like that's a device that

91
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:28,384
You certainly use and

92
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,480
Yeah and it's very useful

93
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:34,272
2f say you're out of town

94
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:35,552
I'm at the office

95
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,624
I mean obviously it'll go to auto away but

96
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,904
But you know the program that

97
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,952
And then when I'm about to head home program

98
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,232
Again

99
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:47,840
On the phone change its go to a cooler temperature I think that's

100
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:49,120
That's valuable

101
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,912
I'm so certainly the

102
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:52,448
The thermostats are good

103
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:55,520
What else we have the blinds when you actually had to look up

104
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:58,592
I actually

105
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,384
Can hook them into Alexa

106
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,944
Cynthia boe's wink or SmartThings

107
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:03,968
Okay

108
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:05,760
See I am I pulled it out

109
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:09,600
It's going to be a birthday present book

110
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:12,928
Looked work again

111
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,000
I was often very long time

112
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,071
You hate keys

113
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,351
And

114
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:24,447
I know where front door doesn't really work with a lot of smart locks out there

115
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:29,823
But do you have a sense of would you prefer to have a lock that just opened when you got

116
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,639
Near it with your phone in your pocket or would you

117
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:34,431
I know you like keypad lock

118
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:36,735
So do you have a sense I know how you feel about

119
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:37,759
Kind of connected lock

120
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,295
Here's the thing

121
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,831
There's got to be

122
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:43,391
In addition to having that

123
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:45,695
I don't know what you called but what you walk up to today

124
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:46,719
Automatically

125
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,999
Locks unlocks

126
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:54,399
There has to be a way to do it manually without having the kids while so a great example would be the Locklear downstairs

127
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,423
We had to keep an eye on

128
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,191
And you can do it

129
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:58,495
Is there a number of times I run down to the garage

130
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,287
I don't have my phone

131
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:03,103
You know and so and I don't have the key

132
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,383
So I'd like to build

133
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,479
It's super fast and easy ride to type in a four-digit code unless your hands are full

134
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:11,807
So I also question and maybe there's an answer for this but

135
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,855
Take for example our garage

136
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:14,879
Not our

137
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,671
Electric garage door right

138
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:17,951
Butter other

139
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,231
The door to the garage

140
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:26,143
Okay so if it unlocks things for when you pulled into the garage at automatically unlock the door

141
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,935
Where that went from our garage to our house

142
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:32,543
It did now I'm going to tell everybody right now we have the Kwikset Z-Wave

143
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,567
Connected locks

144
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,591
With a keypad

145
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:35,359
So

146
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:37,151
They're both connected and they have to keep

147
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:41,759
Spencer Locke and yes we did have it hooked in through SmartThings

148
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:45,599
And you had a presents tag in your car so when you drove up

149
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,135
The present stag

150
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:47,903
Triggered

151
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:48,927
That lock

152
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,207
To the garage

153
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:50,975
To unlock

154
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,255
So that was helpful

155
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:55,327
Why do you always take away the things that I like I said I don't get it

156
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,351
It's not because I hate you

157
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:59,423
On the presents tag actually ran out of battery

158
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,727
And I didn't know

159
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,775
I could I could put that back on

160
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,055
Because the locks are back on

161
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:09,407
And the other thing is

162
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,175
I took

163
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:10,943
The

164
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,015
That the blinds are controlled by a Z-Wave controller

165
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:16,063
It is a bit gimpy

166
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:18,367
To install it's not actually

167
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,671
It's not recognized by a lot of

168
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:23,999
Of the hubs that we have is not recognized by any of them

169
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,791
So it's hard to install

170
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:29,631
And so I uninstall whenever I uninstall it to reinstall it

171
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:30,399
Takes

172
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:32,447
A little more time and effort and

173
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,471
I usually

174
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,031
End up unprogramming are blinds and that

175
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,055
Cost $8

176
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:38,335
Come back and fix

177
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:41,407
And then you get sad and grumpy

178
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:47,807
Yeah yeah I was a little suspect on

179
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:49,087
Idea of

180
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:52,671
Yes I guess in as you walked out the door was unlocked and

181
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:54,719
When your presence wasn't there

182
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:55,999
It's interesting

183
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:56,767
You know

184
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,303
I don't know

185
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,327
Tesla

186
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:04,447
Now that I've seen how that works for the Tesla or you just leave then

187
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:06,751
Turns off and takes care of all that.

188
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:08,031
That's kind of Handy

189
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,567
The other thing I like

190
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:12,127
In-N-Out in its being skeptical at first week

191
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:13,663
The Chamberlain garage

192
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:14,687
Or wear it

193
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:16,479
Where you can turn it

194
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,783
That's one item or being able to shut

195
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,063
The door or open it

196
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:21,599
From the phone is help

197
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:24,159
For to use cases first of all in our case

198
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:24,927
Beef cuts

199
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:27,487
The garage downstairs and then you walk upstairs

200
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,511
The house

201
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,047
And so

202
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:34,143
Getting alert that you forgot to shut the garage door and not having to go down

203
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,423
Outside of stairs again

204
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,191
To shut it

205
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:36,959
It's helpful.

206
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:37,983
And any other thing

207
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:40,287
Someone needs to get inside the garage for some

208
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,359
Be able to grant them that access when you're not home

209
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,127
Fat is healthy

210
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:45,663
All right

211
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,479
See so now discuss the things you do like

212
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,527
What are the things that you're like

213
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,295
Stacy

214
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,343
You try this out or

215
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,415
You know maybe if you can purchase it and I still don't know why you

216
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:59,999
I think my main gripe is the same it was

217
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:02,047
Before what you see things just don't work out

218
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:02,815
In the Box

219
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:06,143
There's some there's something that doesn't work and maybe

220
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:06,911
Because our house

221
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:08,191
This is a test

222
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,983
Items interior made lyrics

223
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,519
Fighting with each other

224
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:12,287
Redfin

225
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:14,847
Even for a while it seemed like our lights

226
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:15,615
You're working

227
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:20,479
Then the ones that were connected into those GE light bulbs that are connected into

228
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,015
Weak now

229
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,063
You know how they work

230
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,087
Part of the time

231
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,879
Well the one where I guess

232
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,927
They actually were connected through the

233
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:31,999
Shoe-in for some reason the Hue connection

234
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,535
To the GE link bulbs

235
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,839
Through the Amazon Echo

236
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,631
Suddenly didn't

237
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,935
And I'm not sure actually

238
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:41,471
Savannah

239
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,751
Switch them over

240
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,031
To the wink

241
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,591
Except for that one

242
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:49,151
Wish weekend

243
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:49,919
Broken

244
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,967
Defective so you've got

245
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:52,991
3

246
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:55,039
You spend 20 bucks on these balls

247
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:56,831
Which is a lot cheaper

248
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,367
Hughes but then

249
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:01,183
He's got three months later one of them the Z-Wave

250
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:01,951
Stop

251
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:05,279
Thankfully Home Depot is really easy

252
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,815
It was

253
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:08,095
Nicki sorry

254
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:10,655
I told the lady at Home Depot the Wi-Fi

255
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,703
I don't think it matters

256
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,727
Any idea

257
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:16,543
But I was talking about she just wrote as return light

258
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,567
Turn on

259
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:23,455
Please work now right I mean

260
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:26,271
If we say Alexa turn off living room lights

261
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,551
I mean it seems like

262
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,367
20% of the time it doesn't work

263
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,903
I would say

264
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,951
That's too high I think it's like five

265
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:36,767
5% of the time it doesn't work but I think

266
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:37,791
They just didn't

267
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:38,559
Update

268
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:39,327
That should help

269
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:42,655
So I haven't seen it not working

270
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,703
But yes you're right

271
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:49,823
No voice recognition seems to be

272
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:50,591
Getting better

273
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:51,615
I member at first

274
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:53,919
Understand what we were saying but

275
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,967
That really anything to me on

276
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:58,015
On Alexis we're going upstairs and Beyond

277
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,063
Turn off downstairs

278
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:02,111
And at that point we're halfway up the stairs

279
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:06,719
Light from upstairs we can see so we don't trip and everything downstairs goes off

280
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,279
So

281
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:11,327
What would your advice be to someone

282
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,095
Like

283
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,887
If you're hanging out with your friends and

284
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:19,007
And someone mentions like hey I think I'm going to buy a connected device or I'm interested in home automation

285
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,287
I'm other than

286
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:23,103
Maybe you tell them talk to Stacy or maybe sick God don't talk

287
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,663
What would you tell them about

288
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:26,943
What they should buy

289
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,479
Cindy Pickett

290
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:34,111
Open and I think that use are cool and

291
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,391
They're fairly simple

292
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,695
I mean if you do have a hug

293
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,719
That you have to plug in

294
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:41,279
But they're fairly simple underneath party

295
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,303
If nothing else

296
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:44,863
Yes there are some cool practical things

297
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:48,191
Having them go on when you're out of town

298
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:52,031
And be able to control them when you're walking away it's on

299
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:54,079
But I think those are nice

300
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:56,127
And it's kind of all in a box

301
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:59,199
Solution to try to get that wet three bulbs in the hub

302
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,735
So that's interesting

303
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,783
And then the other would probably be locked

304
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:06,367
I think we did some presents check but then then you're getting into

305
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:10,719
SmartThings in a hub as well so it gets complicated there but I know people that do like

306
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:15,327
Short-term rentals on houses or have people come in and eat them to be able to come in

307
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,607
To do something real quick

308
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:20,447
I get them you know one time use passcode or something like that

309
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,471
Status Seekers

310
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,239
Practical

311
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:23,775
But I probably start

312
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:29,919
And I know you say you're just get frustrated when he talked about light bulbs all the time but it's the simplest easiest example

313
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:30,943
Okay

314
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,223
Not like a thermostat

315
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,015
You don't feel like we're getting there

316
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,087
Value out of are connected thermostats or anyting

317
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,623
Well that's a good point

318
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,927
Yeah I forgot I forget about those beans

319
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,207
Connected and maybe that's

320
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,231
Because they judge

321
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,511
Is worthwhile

322
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:45,791
Right I don't

323
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:47,839
The only time I log into the

324
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:49,631
Is from same iPhone in

325
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:54,239
When something is happening right

326
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,823
That's a good point that's a fairly easy

327
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,919
On ramp ends well I guess it worked sort of easy to install

328
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,711
We had to get a little bit of help there

329
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:07,039
You know anyone can do that right anyone can

330
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,831
Screw in a lightbulb with a lot of jokes

331
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,367
Anyone can

332
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,159
And I think anyone could just

333
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,439
Put the

334
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:16,255
Plug it into the back of the router

335
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:19,327
I really think that's easier right you're not

336
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,351
Installing sump

337
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,119
10%

338
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:21,887
Okay

339
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:22,911
Well it looks

340
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:25,215
Let's go back to the thermostats and

341
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:28,031
My latest thing because it has been

342
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:30,079
The hotter months of the year here in Texas

343
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:32,127
We've been talking about different

344
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:35,199
Products that help you optimize your

345
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:35,967
Air conditioner

346
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:38,271
Sing in bioptimizers I'm not talking about

347
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,319
Not like in the nest

348
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,903
More in the way of making sure that you

349
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,951
Your air conditioning is running most efficiently

350
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:49,279
So there's a product from Everson called Comfort guard

351
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:53,375
And what this is you have to have a professional installer coming out

352
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,423
And what they do is

353
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:59,263
They install about $100 worth of sensors into

354
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,567
Your furnace your docs and your

355
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,127
Air conditioning unit that sits outside your house

356
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,711
And then you pay like an 8 to $10 monthly fee

357
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:10,271
And Those sensors gather data

358
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:15,135
And it's like a Predictive Analytics kind of service for your home so it's supposed to be

359
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:22,047
Checking all of the data from Those sensors and saying hey it looks like your air conditioner is only running at 60% a fish

360
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:22,815
Efficiency right now

361
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:25,119
You should call someone and have them come out or

362
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:28,447
Maybe because the installer who installed it as hell

363
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,471
Contract with you

364
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,751
Movie they come out

365
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:32,543
Come out and look at it

366
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,615
There's also

367
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:38,431
Some kind of interesting new things tied to data coming out

368
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:39,711
Soon

369
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:40,991
I can't talk about all this

370
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:44,575
But then we also had our HP AC guy come out

371
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:47,135
Just the other day for a regular maintenance check

372
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,671
And he told us some cool stuff

373
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,463
So angry when I talk about some of that

374
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:54,047
I think the more interesting thing about what he's obviously he has

375
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,839
Incentive

376
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,167
This guy doesn't think about it that way right

377
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,191
Attack but

378
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:04,031
I think it was interesting what you said and I think it's interesting because we

379
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:06,079
I feel like some of the things you tell me about

380
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,103
Smart Home

381
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:09,151
Connected devices kind of get ahead of them

382
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:12,479
Sounds right they aren't solving a huge problem and so

383
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:15,295
I would question in this case is like well

384
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:17,855
Love you so

385
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:20,927
Almost two years at the guy at 250

386
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:23,487
Right is everything is working fine

387
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:26,303
Cleaning jobs outside

388
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:29,631
Lead staff into the each of our units

389
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:30,655
He's like well

390
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,447
You know installing something

391
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,471
She just get

392
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:36,287
If you just get fairly regular maintenance on these you're going to

393
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,055
Catch it

394
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:37,823
In advance

395
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:41,919
You don't even a leak on something isn't something that overnight

396
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,967
You know it loses all its power

397
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:47,295
Or something like that so I guess the question is how much it cost

398
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,575
And how much

399
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:50,879
It's ongoing

400
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,439
And having a professional come out and install it

401
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:55,743
Ali really fixing that big of a problem

402
00:14:57,023 --> 00:15:02,655
Also said the fact that we had both an ecobee n&s so we had connected thermostats he was like

403
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:07,007
Is news things detect a problem or an anomalous use

404
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,823
They will also let you know

405
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,103
Which I thought was kind of

406
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,383
As well

407
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:13,407
And then

408
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,687
Yeah I haven't I haven't

409
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:15,967
If they would actually

410
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:16,735
Do

411
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:21,599
I was I was a little curious about that myself I was like

412
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,135
I did not think they would do that

413
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,415
But

414
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:26,207
We also running the

415
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:28,255
Bruker things from curb

416
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,303
So we're checking our energy usage

417
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,071
Can real time

418
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:33,375
And that actually will send us a notification if

419
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,143
Fitzy's vet

420
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,679
Were using

421
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,775
In the curb is need but you know there's another one where

422
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:46,431
You know you have to have an electrician come out I'm sure I don't know how much it is but I'm sure it's expensive and it's like well even from

423
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:48,479
Cost savings perspective right eye mean

424
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,503
Maybe it's cuz we don't

425
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,271
Use a lot of

426
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:52,319
Energy relatively speaking by

427
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:54,623
How much are you going to say versus how much

428
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:55,647
Does it cost

429
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,183
Is one of those things that

430
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:59,231
I think when I see some devices

431
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:00,767
Ashley

432
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,047
Prevent something

433
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,839
Mildly bad from happening or

434
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:04,863
We save you money

435
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,167
It's felt like a back.

436
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,447
5 years

437
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:10,239
I'm probably not interested

438
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:12,799
Wow C on an air conditioning I feel like

439
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,103
Because those things are like $9,000

440
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,639
It feels like well

441
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:22,015
If something was to go wrong that would actually break it and make you have to replace entire thing will that's one thing

442
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:25,087
Oh look it's not working as well

443
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:27,135
Needs to be even if you don't have anything

444
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:29,951
Is my utility bill

445
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:34,047
So much higher than usual at that point then you pick up the phone you have someone come out

446
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,839
And they say I'll look that's because of this

447
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,887
This is dirty or this isn't working

448
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,423
Air compressor sailing

449
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,703
IFixit

450
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,471
You know most

451
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,775
Townhomes for 500 bucks

452
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:44,799
In that

453
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,335
Wehrli

454
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:47,615
Did something happen

455
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,943
Replace buffer units especially

456
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,735
If it's on older ones

457
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:54,527
Is Tommy going to happen anyway

458
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:59,647
That's true and I get very excited about

459
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,439
Possibilities of all of this data

460
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:06,047
Because I'm looking so far ahead but you're right as a homeowner it seems very

461
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:07,839
It's a very difficult

462
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:09,887
So I guess we'll see

463
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,679
So any final thoughts

464
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,727
481 in this industry

465
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,263
You is a guy

466
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:16,543
2

467
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,311
It's kind of like

468
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,079
Probably

469
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:21,407
Way more mainstream buyer of all of this Tech than anybody

470
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,687
Spike especially me

471
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:23,711
And Kevin

472
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,991
What is your advice to

473
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:25,759
People who are

474
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:26,783
Building this in

475
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:29,343
I say make it simple

476
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:33,439
Make sure there is a very easy to understand rli

477
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:35,231
And then make it work out of the box

478
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,023
By the time it ships

479
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,047
It just has to

480
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:38,815
Castaway

481
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:42,143
You know I think it seems like an and I know you get plenty of Alf

482
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:47,007
Test your first words have been said

483
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,847
I got to ask what about your data private

484
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:51,871
Are you worried about that

485
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:53,407
Particularly

486
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:59,807
You know the only thing it cameras are the one thing that concerns me a little bit I like the idea of cameras on the outs

487
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:00,575
Dial home

488
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:06,207
Because you have some breaks on or something then hopefully you can get the picture then that doorbell we have is kind of neat

489
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:08,511
Morrison walks up to it at

490
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:10,559
He could take some video of them

491
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,863
I mean I don't know what the nest

492
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:13,887
Is going to get

493
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:16,703
That is going to really cause a privacy issue

494
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:24,895
I guess I could see one of these being used in a court case when someone says they were somewhere and they weren't

495
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:28,479
Yeah it's mostly cameras and making sure that my

496
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:29,503
Privacy

497
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:31,039
You know nothing

498
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:34,111
All right

499
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:36,671
Thank you so much for coming on the show today and

500
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:41,279
I'm glad to be a fill in for Kevin but I'm sure your guests will be throwing

501
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,047
USAC next week

502
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:44,607
Oh nonsense they love their perspective from

503
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:45,631
Guy who doesn't

504
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:47,935
Sincerely. I was going to say no much

505
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:49,215
But that's not the right word

506
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:51,007
The guy who doesn't necessarily

507
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,287
Love the Smart car

508
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:59,967
Alright just let me know

509
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:02,783
And I appreciate you inviting me

510
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,319
There you go I'd like

511
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,087
Your paycheck

512
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,367
It's in the mail

513
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,391
All right

514
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,415
Thank you

515
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:09,951
Stay tuned for

516
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:12,255
Our Guest this week who is

517
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:18,911
Nandini Nayak who is going to talk to us about building Living Services and how big companies and

518
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:25,311
And small companies are going to have to adapt to having connected devices everywhere

519
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:34,271
Hi everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is Stacey Higginbotham and today my guess

520
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,807
West Nyack

521
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:38,623
She is the design strategy leader at

522
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:39,391
Yours

523
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:43,999
And she's also for the time being heading up there San Francisco Design Studio

524
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,791
Hainan how are you doing

525
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:47,839
I'm good baby how are you

526
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:49,119
I am awesomeness

527
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:51,423
So I'm really excited

528
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,471
Need to talk to you because you have actually

529
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:57,823
When I met you a couple months back you actually put into words very eloquently

530
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:02,943
A concept that I've been thinking about for a while which is this idea of living service

531
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,223
Do you want to

532
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,503
Kind of talk about what that is

533
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:07,295
Let's read

534
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:09,343
You don't Living Services in

535
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,903
Fjord has talked

536
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,231
I mean all of you guys talk about the internet

537
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:18,559
And you know the fact that you know you can have

538
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,935
But I think what

539
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:24,959
We believers

540
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:27,007
The more interesting aspect of

541
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:30,079
Is technology it should be a fun holiday in April

542
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:32,127
A new kind of service

543
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,919
A new kind of living

544
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,455
My dad

545
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,991
Give me about

546
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:41,087
Digital Services becoming more human-like

547
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:44,159
You know more responsive to contacts more

548
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:45,951
A meeting with Kim and expect

549
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:49,023
So we called it the era of living service

550
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:51,839
Galaxy

551
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:56,447
Age of nginx where you know finally he had access to.

552
00:20:58,495 --> 00:20:59,775
Assign you think

553
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:01,823
Computing has become

554
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:03,103
So every day

555
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,127
Double X back

556
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,151
Have

557
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:06,687
Everything

558
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:09,759
Begin to kind of connect together to help us live

559
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:10,527
Better life

560
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:14,879
Okay and that's

561
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:16,928
That's a very nice overview

562
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,000
And I think one of the things that I thought was really

563
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:21,024
Compelling about it

564
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:24,864
Is that it offers this kind of sense of customization

565
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:26,912
So this idea that

566
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:30,240
You not only design a product to put in people's homes

567
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:32,032
But what you're doing is your

568
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,824
Again building service

569
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,104
And the service is

570
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,128
Unique 4

571
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:41,504
Maybe individuals maybe it's a family that lives in the home and consumes the service

572
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:44,320
I guess it could be a corporation we can talk about that

573
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:46,112
So you're developing this

574
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:47,392
Service but

575
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:50,208
It doesn't what what I think is kefir

576
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:52,768
Businesses is that it doesn't end

577
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:53,792
With a purchase

578
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:55,840
The product is going to exist

579
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,888
Far and Away Beyond

580
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:58,912
Purchase

581
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,448
So it could go

582
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,496
To be a washing machine that I

583
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:03,264
Can I buy

584
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:04,800
But I'm also going to

585
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:05,568
Consume

586
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:09,152
Some sort of maybe it's a replenishment service with it

587
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:10,688
Or maybe it is

588
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:11,968
I don't know

589
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:15,552
Maybe it's a warranty that's actually a little bit more Interactive

590
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:18,624
Can you give us an example of some of these

591
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,648
Living Services

592
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:20,416
As you see it

593
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:26,816
Anything fundamentally living from 2:40

594
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:28,864
Talking about is the digitization of a

595
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:29,888
Which means

596
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,728
Yak everyday devices of washing machine your strength

597
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:40,128
I'm eating your counselor your fork me have some level of ability to change the environment

598
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:43,712
To capture some data and also respond in

599
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:47,552
And that's what your he's object by themselves

600
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:49,088
Are not the product

601
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,928
Human in Chinese

602
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,720
Big service

603
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:57,280
Let's talk about the washing machine

604
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,584
You know whenever I'm in

605
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:02,656
Add doing laundry

606
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:10,336
Weather I have all the different detergent I use for different

607
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,384
Imagine of

608
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,712
Washing machines in the future.

609
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:18,016
Determining whether I have enough

610
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,624
That I am running out of something one of them

611
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,672
I'll be able to on again

612
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:25,696
Kind of

613
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,792
To my shopping list

614
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:32,352
Signal the brain to send it over to me

615
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,960
I don't even have to

616
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:37,984
Drink about

617
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,264
Odoo I have enough

618
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:44,640
Magically

619
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:48,224
Is alternates a mundane task

620
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,784
Add button to my day-to-day life

621
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:53,600
Austin & Ally I Think About You

622
00:23:57,184 --> 00:24:01,536
All you may think about whether my mother is out of

623
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:03,328
Not because she's a diabetic

624
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,168
I'm so I need to make sure

625
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:14,592
The truck after the hard product

626
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:17,920
Rubbish

627
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,808
Participation in my life not just in the washing machine

628
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:26,368
Help me deal with e

629
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,208
Cast of Walking Dead

630
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:33,024
Eventually you may even think about whether the

631
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,352
The interface that that washing machine has could do other thing

632
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:42,496
Like in my laundry room I have other things going on like how often do I need to do laundry

633
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:46,336
Why do not be with my son.

634
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:52,224
Don't we have settings that he does everything in one pile

635
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:58,880
I want you to point to what you were talking about

636
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:01,952
Lutetia Vision specialize themselves to individual

637
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,488
Do. You know

638
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:06,048
When I walk into the room

639
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,608
He decided settings for how I might

640
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:11,168
You can imagine how this

641
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:13,984
Would extend into the future in terms of

642
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:15,008
How

643
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,288
The environment

644
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,568
The ecosystem

645
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:18,592
Begins to

646
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:21,408
Connect to individual to a present

647
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,688
Iron Sheik

648
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:24,224
Skin challenge around

649
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:25,760
Okay

650
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:28,064
In these examples sound very

651
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:33,184
Consumer-oriented in maybe you cannot just consumer but consumption oriented

652
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,976
It's so I'm picking Amazon Dash

653
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:37,536
For example are Amazon's replenishment services

654
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:39,840
Are very

655
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:41,376
Nascent maybe steps to this

656
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:45,984
But let's think about can you bring Living Services outside of

657
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,032
Me buying more stuff

658
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,312
If that makes sense

659
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:51,360
Because right now this feels very much

660
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:52,384
Align

661
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,432
Buying things that I need right now but

662
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:55,200
Let's take it

663
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:55,968
To something else

664
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:58,016
Let's think about the working

665
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:05,440
Doing people are working today you know most companies have

666
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:07,488
Songs about the future

667
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:12,608
Practices you know you're coming into second time and time you should have certain types of

668
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,144
Are you doing

669
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,680
Differentiate between

670
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:19,264
How I like to work which is how they see me like to work

671
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:25,664
A weather alert during the morning times where I think he likes you

672
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,272
Standardized

673
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:32,320
What please

674
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:35,392
Luminosity be helping productivity

675
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:39,232
50 company

676
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:43,328
How people need to be supported

677
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:46,912
Highly cognitive

678
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:50,752
And you know how you be set up for that type of work

679
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:54,592
14 ammo

680
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,688
Begin to have dentures in

681
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:09,952
Doing a certain type of what

682
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:15,072
It's not too much consumption oriented it's actually

683
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:17,888
What might be the cops number

684
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:21,728
Even in the washing machine

685
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:23,520
Ecosystem for back

686
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:26,592
I think you think about it as

687
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:28,384
What is a human intentions

688
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:29,920
Supported

689
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:31,712
And how do you support them

690
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:36,064
Catching that I take notes about that person that have it

691
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,112
That College

692
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,392
Tossed and turned

693
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,928
And you'll begin to see

694
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:43,488
You don't work environment adjusted.

695
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:48,608
Think about it

696
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:50,400
Audrey

697
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:54,240
Printing Supplies similar to house washing machine

698
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:55,520
Usher

699
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:57,312
And I can think of in the home

700
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:59,360
Do you want to leave the laundry room which

701
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,920
Crazy specific

702
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:03,456
But you can even think of

703
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:04,480
Gosh is

704
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:07,552
It's my my home can read my contacts

705
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:08,832
Clues appropriately

706
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:10,624
It could figure out o

707
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:15,488
Josh Stacy right now is getting ready to cook time I'm reading the symbols she's

708
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,816
She's coming into the kitchen she's turning on her work lights right above the

709
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:19,584
The counter

710
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,888
You know she's she's washing her hands

711
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:26,240
She's made like six trips to the refrigerator and then to the pantry

712
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:28,544
Those are all pretty indicative of

713
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,104
Setting her prep getting her prepped together so then

714
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,408
My kitchen can start adapting itself

715
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:35,968
My kitchen

716
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:37,248
Settings which is

717
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,784
In addition that lighting there's

718
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,808
Music I like

719
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,160
Be awesome if Mike my robotic Butler could bring me my glass of cooking wine

720
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:47,232
Yeah but you know we'll get there my Amazon

721
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:50,816
Echo could start you know pulling up the recipe that I sent

722
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:53,632
And you know I can see these

723
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:54,656
Kind of things start

724
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:57,472
To develop and that is not consumption that is purely

725
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:59,008
A service that would help me

726
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:01,056
It leads to consumption

727
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:03,360
Hopefully the consumption of delicious food

728
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,664
And in 20 minutes or less

729
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:10,272
And I think that one of the important things you like to do

730
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:13,344
Stop thinking about Industries

731
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:18,720
Louisiana find them today right

732
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:20,000
Unhide products

733
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:25,632
I just because we are talking about supporting human pattern

734
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:29,984
You probably think about ecosystems off services that make Carson

735
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:33,312
Okay so like in that example and ecosystem

736
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:36,128
Is it a kitchen ecosystem so then I might need

737
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:43,040
Because I don't have all appliances from one Bender I would need my Samsung refrigerator to talk to my Bosch dishwasher

738
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:44,576
In my Delta faucet

739
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:46,112
And my

740
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:49,952
I don't know who makes my pots and pans they're not connected but

741
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:50,720
You know

742
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:57,376
Getting all that plus I'm going to want my cookbooks and recipes to be communicating also it probably to

743
00:29:58,144 --> 00:30:00,960
My fitness stuff but also to my family's because

744
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:05,824
It would be nice to know what they've been going through that day or maybe what they got on track

745
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,872
Cuz if my husband is planning on a

746
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:11,200
13 Mile run tomorrow to help train for his Marathon

747
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:14,016
Maybe I can cook something that helps him prepare for that

748
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:18,880
And you may know that he's planning for a dirty mind even before he

749
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,280
Like you might be going on the lunch tomorrow

750
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:31,936
And I guess you're kind of also means that you know that

751
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:35,520
H-2b

752
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:37,568
On that allows you to connect

753
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:39,872
Steve individualized

754
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,504
Based on what

755
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,808
Specific intent

756
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:50,624
But then how did it connect to all of the others

757
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:51,904
In the context

758
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:55,488
Destiny Achievers and what is the band what is

759
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:57,792
What is blinding

760
00:30:58,304 --> 00:31:00,352
I think that's going to be an interesting

761
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,888
Evolution of

762
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:05,216
What brand small atomizer

763
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:15,712
Taking that you're going to be an interesting time to examine how landing page

764
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,064
Well let's talk about that because right now I see

765
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:24,160
If I think about Brandon that context especially in the home I've got like

766
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:26,464
We'll just works with x

767
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:28,512
So if that works with homekit

768
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:29,536
Works with nest

769
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:31,840
It works with whatever brand is out there

770
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:33,888
But if I'm Ge

771
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:35,168
Or if I'm bi

772
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:35,936
Or

773
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:41,312
And that's in the consumer space if I'm in the Enterprise space if I'm IBM or if I'm Cisco

774
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:42,848
How do I build

775
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:43,872
A brand

776
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:44,640
Around

777
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:46,176
These experiences

778
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,272
Do I build a brand around experiences or do I build a brand around

779
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:51,296
Products

780
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:53,088
Or servicer

781
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:54,880
I don't even know Nan help

782
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:55,648
My God

783
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:58,720
Yeah I think I can

784
00:31:58,976 --> 00:31:59,488
Interesting question

785
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:04,864
If you want to bring the Vans and I think we've talked a bit about

786
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:05,888
You know how many

787
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,704
True blance can a human

788
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,240
Have a relationship with

789
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,520
Did she was in the vacuum

790
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:17,152
Don't believe any money Branch services

791
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:19,200
And sometimes it's not

792
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:25,600
Shingles

793
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:29,440
That's media

794
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:33,024
So I can if you depend upon what

795
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,304
Platforms in Ark

796
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:37,120
And whether branding becomes

797
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:39,936
Important enzyme the recognition of a concussion

798
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:44,800
Method of how you do things

799
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:47,104
Is the collection of brands that

800
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:53,760
Show me Product brands have to figure out how they become

801
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:56,320
Experience branch

802
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:57,600
Experience brands that

803
00:32:57,856 --> 00:33:00,160
DD's Connections in the mostest

804
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:04,512
Recognize

805
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:07,328
Rachel's example

806
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,776
Infuriating that donkey

807
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:16,800
Competing products

808
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:19,104
Guess what

809
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,248
Not going to be

810
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:31,392
That DJ Jason sees the connection

811
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:34,208
The collections of services that you recognize

812
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,536
Add something that participates in your life

813
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:40,608
So we can be have answer to that

814
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:42,656
Yes but I think you do

815
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:44,960
Transformational time when

816
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:46,752
So we're going to have

817
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:48,288
A reduction in the value

818
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:49,568
Brands that sounds like

819
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:51,360
And what's going to happen is we're going to have a

820
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:53,152
Quote unquote living brand

821
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:55,456
It's going to be kind of experiential

822
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:57,248
And it's going to be

823
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,040
These brands are going to be these

824
00:33:59,296 --> 00:33:59,808
Curated

825
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:01,600
I guess we'll call it a platform

826
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:03,648
Of these atomized services

827
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:04,416
An experience

828
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:06,976
So then my question to you

829
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:08,000
Is

830
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,792
As I'm building out these Platte

831
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:10,560
Forms

832
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:13,376
Does this living brand sodas

833
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:14,656
Monolithic

834
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:15,424
Platform

835
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:17,728
Are they choosing

836
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,264
Who they play with

837
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:25,152
Is there no like real interoperability or are they going to be doing the hard work of making

838
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:26,432
Things in Rockford

839
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:30,272
And as the consumer does that mean we're going to have to choose between

840
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:32,064
Establish cluster

841
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:32,832
Brandon

842
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:33,856
Experiences

843
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:36,160
As opposed to kind of building our own

844
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,232
Yeah I think more and more you know

845
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,256
Even though

846
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:43,072
Number of Living Services.

847
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,144
I'm available

848
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,936
You want to have

849
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:49,472
Knowing Translate

850
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:51,520
Cuba Cuba

851
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:55,104
Play similar to

852
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,152
Think about it like a travel agent

853
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:00,992
I need you to delete all the time

854
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,528
Travel

855
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:04,576
Arby's song

856
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:06,624
Booking on a

857
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,904
Locations

858
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,184
Looking on this device

859
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,464
Travel

860
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,488
Some point to point

861
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:18,400
My home travel experience of going to a particular

862
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:25,312
You may begin to see Airbnb may become

863
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:26,080
Because

864
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:27,872
Deactivating a

865
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:30,944
Part of that experience but they are beginning to look at json

866
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,992
They may combine with other

867
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:37,856
You may think about Airbnb

868
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,464
Maybe have some flexibility in picking

869
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,256
Chuggington from different brands

870
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:46,048
I think it would be interesting to

871
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:51,680
Experian

872
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:53,216
And then how you

873
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:54,240
Ida

874
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:56,288
Give up control to one of those bands

875
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:57,312
Insecurities

876
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:58,080
Kayaking

877
00:35:58,336 --> 00:36:03,200
Ultimate Ninja potions that you want to have some flexibility of control over

878
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:04,480
Chess master

879
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:08,064
I think it would be interesting to see how this notion

880
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,368
Living Brands come to life

881
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:14,976
Where your total expense maybe a combination of brand with one or two

882
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:17,536
Okay that makes sense

883
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:18,304
It does that

884
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,072
Make sense

885
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:21,888
All right into if you're an established company

886
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:23,680
As opposed to

887
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:24,448
A startup

888
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,984
How do you kind of

889
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:27,776
If you want to

890
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:29,568
Develop a living service

891
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:31,360
How do you canoe

892
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:32,384
Get there

893
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:38,016
And then do these companies established companies have an advantage in establishing a living brand

894
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:39,296
Orteza startup

895
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:41,600
Don't you think about it

896
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:43,904
Create a living cell

897
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:48,256
Creative Living Services that fundamentally is that you have

898
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:49,024
No

899
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:51,072
I'm going to beaches

900
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:52,096
The contact

901
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:56,192
Read how the service was rendered

902
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:59,520
Who is being deported

903
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:03,104
You know how do you know the contacts on an ongoing basis

904
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:07,712
She knows nothing about individual

905
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,760
How they connect you to other

906
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:13,344
One aspect because at the node

907
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:14,880
The other dimension

908
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:16,672
How do you been

909
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:18,720
Lexor adjust your service

910
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:20,512
To take the signals

911
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:21,536
That you're getting

912
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:30,752
Dimensions the intersection of them

913
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:34,848
You can think of about 15 ground for the diesel

914
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:41,504
Pokemon company I think it may be a bit

915
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,576
May not have the history of how they have

916
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:45,344
Known

917
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,904
If you would like to disappoint their customer base

918
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:51,232
But I think.

919
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:52,768
Juanita Jackson would be

920
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:56,096
Is that they should not just think about themselves

921
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:58,144
Show me things about

922
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,472
How is that correct laying into a human

923
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:03,008
Experience in Iowa

924
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:06,080
The education Keys Lounge

925
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:09,408
Amal Fuller capabilities

926
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:15,552
It allows you to even have an API on a connection

927
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:16,576
Something more

928
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,624
Xiamen company

929
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,672
Think about

930
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:22,464
Something Beyond

931
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,000
What I'm trying to design

932
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:25,536
Designing

933
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:31,680
Born in a warm environment

934
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:33,728
Jupiter Center in to figure out

935
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:36,800
You know how warm is going to be

936
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:38,848
Pikachu

937
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,640
Adjust

938
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:42,944
So if you are going to be

939
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,016
Maybe I can offer you at

940
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:50,624
Starting a new company

941
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,160
Begin to think about

942
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:58,816
Products in terms of services on living furniture

943
00:38:59,072 --> 00:38:59,584
Benefits

944
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,608
Ashanti

945
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:05,216
For more established companies I think the challenges they have

946
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:07,008
Lots and lots of data

947
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,056
And absolutely don't know

948
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:10,848
How to extract the patterns

949
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:15,200
The one of the things that job to think about

950
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:17,760
Understand how to

951
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:21,344
Understand what in the data

952
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,112
Are there

953
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:25,696
Insights from the data that can be used to create new living

954
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:29,536
And you could also ask yourself

955
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:36,448
What contextual information to enhance the product or service that

956
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,984
I'm already creating

957
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:44,896
Because the tunnel vision into this is how I think about

958
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,856
Think about how to

959
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:56,672
Change the Viewpoint of how they think

960
00:39:57,696 --> 00:40:00,512
So I think there's more transformation

961
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:06,144
Big companies that can be done from the start

962
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:08,448
That makes sense

963
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,472
And

964
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:11,008
When it comes to building

965
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,288
A living

966
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:13,056
Brand

967
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:15,872
Do bigger companies have it

968
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:16,640
Easier

969
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:22,528
I think because we have an established brand it would seem that they may have an advantage

970
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:25,344
Depend upon with the keeping up with the

971
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:26,624
Straight Talk

972
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,976
I can think of companies are beginning to see that the Conte just got to come

973
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:36,864
Experience

974
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,144
Movie back in action

975
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:41,472
Where did beginning to do mashups with smaller

976
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:47,616
A new version of intellij idea

977
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:49,920
Can you use that brand Treasures

978
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:51,456
Stewie evil tulip

979
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:52,736
Dog in the state

980
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:54,784
I think that extends

981
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,576
Are you conceited a positive

982
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:57,600
On the other hand

983
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:58,624
If you don't

984
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,184
Expected Market that you're beginning to do that

985
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:04,512
Go lights

986
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:06,816
Late shows to be a benefit

987
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:07,840
As well as

988
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:10,912
How fast you're moving

989
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:13,984
