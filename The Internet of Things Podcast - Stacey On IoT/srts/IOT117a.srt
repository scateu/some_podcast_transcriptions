00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:28,160
A new ring doorbell

10
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:30,464
An acquisition in the smart home space that

11
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:32,256
Caillou were talking about

12
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:33,792
New lights from hue

13
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:35,072
They're pricey as heck

14
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:36,096
And

15
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:37,632
Tesla got a new

16
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:38,400
Do head

17
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:39,936

Some Amazon news because it's not a week without Amazon

20
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:49,152
After that we have a message from our sponsor TE Connectivity and then

21
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:53,504
An awesome guess Paul Brody who is a principal at NY

22
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:55,552
And

23
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:59,648
He is going to talk about using blockchain to Build a Better World and better IO.

24
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:00,416
Tea business mod

25
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:01,696
Now

26
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:02,720
Let's go to work

27
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:04,000
From another one of our sponsors

28
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:05,280
Affiliated monitoring

29
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:12,448
If you're hunting for a subscription Revenue model for your iot business you need to hear about Affiliated monitoring

30
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:18,848
In response to a trigger from any connected device Affiliated to professionally trained live agents can follow

00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:31,648
Hundreds of smart home security help and other iot businesses visit affiliated.

33
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:38,048
Iot to read a case study on how they helped a connected car startup turn an idea into a thrive

34
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:43,936
Having business with a 100 million dollar exit that's Affiliated. Com

Flash IOD

36
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,312
Alright Kevin

37
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:50,592
Here we go

38
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,128
Chips Ahoy

39
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:54,176
Laxative news that's okay

40
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:54,944
So

41
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,992
It was Intel

42
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,784
They're going to discontinue their

43
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,552
Jewel

44
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:02,112
Edison and Galileo product

45
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:04,416
And for those big eyes were like what

46
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:06,208
Edison was there additional May

47
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,000
Bored Galileo was

48
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:08,768
Another one

49
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,816
And Jewel with the really

50
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:11,584
Anyone that you

51
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,192
No word on what's going to happen to that chip I did ask

52
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,752
Until did confirm that all of these products

53
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:19,776
Are being disc

54
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,336
Set me a very nun

55
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:25,408
Exciting States

56
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,688
Things

57
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:29,504
Theme statement as it stands

58
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,272
AR

59
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:33,088
Iot remains an important

60
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:34,880
And we are committed to

61
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,160
To the iot market segment

62
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,464
Access analyze and share data

63
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,536
These include retail industrial automotive and video

64
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:42,304
All right

65
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,680
I would expect them to say that however however

66
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,984
That we should clarify all these

67
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,264
End-of-life by

68
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,568
The end of this calendar year from the mistaken

69
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:54,848
Yes

70
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:55,872
They are ended

71
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:56,640
This calendar year

72
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:59,456
Yunnan discounts

73
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:02,784
You might see some discounts that put it in the right so the challenge here

74
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,832
In my

75
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:05,600
My humble

76
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:07,136
Is that

77
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:12,512
Intel put a lot of money into these boards that you can actually fun to that TV show the Great

78
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,072
Movie show

79
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,096
And

80
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,888
These boards were

81
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:18,656
Expensive

82
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:22,240
By comparison by comparison to things like the raspberry

83
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,008
Reply

84
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:27,872
Yep still because Galileo when it first came out with like $70

85
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:30,176
And then the version 2

86
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,200
Was $80

87
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,016
Yeah I'm in the other the competing boards

88
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:37,088
10 to go down in price while adding features and such

89
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:41,440
That's one issue but I suspect you're going to raise that but I think it's the second issue in a minute

90
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,464
Man they're hot

91
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:45,536
Bingo we have a winner

92
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,584
I was at a Maker Faire and you know

93
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,864
Of course I walked over to that

94
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,632
Intel Edison

95
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:50,912
Because it was Giant

96
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:51,680
So much marketing

97
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,216
And

98
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,496
You know I was I was

99
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:55,520
Feeling these

100
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:57,312
Boards that we're running these projects

101
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,592
Holy mackerel

102
00:03:59,104 --> 00:03:59,872
Very warm

103
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:06,528
In fairness I will give until credit that they have really scale down the power performance why

104
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:09,600
What are the past couple years with their chips

105
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:12,928
They do have many fanless design winds right now

106
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:16,000
With core M3 and such so

107
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:21,119
That's a given credit there but they've been behind the 8-ball so catching it

108
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,911
It's a constant catching up battle

109
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:28,799
And they got to figure out when to stop trying to catch up you know and that's what I guess they're doing on these boards

110
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,591
It's just not worth it to them right

111
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:31,615
Exactly

112
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:32,895
They also have this

113
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:36,479
Problem last year when they discontinued their wearables

114
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,271
The bassist

115
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:39,807
Purchase

116
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,599
It was basis was the name of the

117
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:49,535
I think was peaked Peak was the company they bought in 2014 which was making the basis watch it

118
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,559
One of the best

119
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,607
Health tracking watches

120
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,887
I would say at the time

121
00:04:56,191 --> 00:05:02,335
They discontinue that they got out of wearables in one thing that you're going to notice about the categories they're still in retail and

122
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,615
Industrial Automotive in video

123
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:04,639
Those are

124
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:06,175
All categories

125
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,455
Exception of automotive

126
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:09,503
That are going to require

127
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,271
A gateway

128
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:11,807
Device switch

129
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:12,831
Can pack a lot of computing

130
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:13,599
Empower into

131
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,159
It's going to be plugged in

132
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:17,439
You have to worry about

133
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,463
I'm too hot and

134
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:22,303
They're going to analyze and share data which

135
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,327
Again is great

136
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,607
For the general

137
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:25,887
Computing that in

138
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:26,911
What does

139
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,191
So that's

140
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,983
Basically these are going to be computers

141
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:31,775
They're going to keep

142
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:32,543
Selling

143
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,311
Switch

144
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,103
But

145
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,663
In this world that were entering into

146
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:40,223
That's going to become a smaller in

147
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:40,991
And smaller

148
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:41,759
Segment

149
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:48,159
And they're also catching competition on all sides now on the server side on the automotive side

150
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:53,791
Where are those they're still actually in wearables is that they're there in the tag are connected watch

151
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:56,095
But not many other watches right now

152
00:05:56,351 --> 00:06:02,495
It's just the competition know when I look at an Invidia or something like somebody like that but it's just intensified for men

153
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:04,287
Honestly

154
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,567
Coming out with a new service

155
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:09,663
You know I covered AMG for over a decade

156
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,199
Okay so I'm not going to like

157
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,039
I'm not going to count until out because AMD always know

158
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:15,807
Conciliating

159
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,855
Awesome designs

160
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:18,879
What you know

161
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:23,487
Snatching Victory from the

162
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:27,839
Also though in in this will give you some perspective alarm

163
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:29,375
Actually arm witch

164
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:31,679
Is a company that lets you license

165
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:32,703
Their design

166
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:34,751
4 tiny tiny low-power chip

167
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:35,519
Chips therein

168
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,287
Your phones

169
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,311
Wearables therefore

170
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,103
They even have some

171
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,127
Powerful ones

172
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:40,895
They're trying to put the

173
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,199
And they don't run is hot

174
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,807
Arm has expanded their design start

175
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,879
To include the arm cortex M3 processor

176
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,671
In addition to the cortex

177
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,439
In 04

178
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,999
If you guys are like what what is a really tiny

179
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,791
Tiny very very

180
00:06:59,327 --> 00:06:59,839
Tips for where

181
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:07,263
But what this does is you don't have to pay a licensing

182
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:10,335
Fee to start tinkering and playing around with the design

183
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,407
This is really important for some of these markets where

184
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,199
Form factor

185
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:17,247
Matter so if you're designing a wearable

186
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:20,063
Being able to design your own SOC

187
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:20,831
Lets you

188
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:21,855
Hey

189
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,903
Reduce the surface area of

190
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,439
Have your bored but it also let

191
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,463
Lets you tweak

192
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,231
Like designs to

193
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,255
Consume as little

194
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,023
Power is pasta

195
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,303
You can do this

196
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:37,471
Right until what you can do all that design work without paying any money but then if if you do bring a product

197
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:41,055
To market after many generations for free so to speak

198
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:43,615
Then you would pay your licensing fees per product

199
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,919
Yeah it's kind of like getting hooked on drugs

200
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:52,575
I'll take your word for it

201
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:54,111
You'll pay for ever

202
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,135
Alright so

203
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,183
Couple things to note here that I thought were

204
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,719
When was

205
00:07:59,487 --> 00:07:59,999
These process

206
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,815
Have shipped more than 20 billion units

207
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,631
He's a pain in the last couple years

208
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:06,399
With the internet

209
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:07,935
So

210
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,727
Ye into

211
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,007
Kevin you want to say

212
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,031
Talk about what some of these

213
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:20,991
The m0 is more it's not powering a computer or a phone or anything like that this is really for my crooked

214
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:21,759
Controllers

215
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,295
Atm3

216
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:28,927
Would be in something that I think everybody knows and that is the Apple A9 chip

217
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:34,303
Apple tweeted and they call it their M9 motion coprocessor so

218
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:40,703
I suspected him more than just like the black iPhones on such because you know iPads also use a chips and

219
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:41,983
So

220
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:44,287
I don't know how many

221
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:48,895
Devices have an A9 but I mean it's couple probably a couple hundred million right off the bat

222
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:55,295
I'm also Samsung's Exodus their 7420 processor which isn't some of their phones also uses

223
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:59,391
The M3 so those are just two simple examples of the scope and reach of this

224
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,183
Yes and

225
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:05,535
It's not just for wearables I should tell you this because arm gives his lovely example

226
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,839
Industrial control application

227
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:10,143
So a company called S3 group

228
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,167
Developed an army base

229
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:13,983
Custom SO3 for that use case and

230
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,775
Cuz they were allowed to

231
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:16,799
Mess around with

232
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:17,567
Hair Design

233
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,335
They reduced

234
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,359
The power requirements

235
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,383
By 70%

236
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,663
Custom parts

237
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,431
80%

238
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,711
And the board size

239
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:24,735
Spice 75

240
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:28,063
Which in that was for a valve controller for the oil and gas in

241
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:29,599
So

242
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:31,135
That's actually really

243
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:33,951
And it also gives

244
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:36,255
When you do a custom board that means

245
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,303
Harder for other companies to

246
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:40,863
Function

247
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:41,631
Competitive

248
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:42,399
Differentiator

249
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:43,423
So right

250
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:47,263
I know most of you guys especially if you're just here for the like doorbell review

251
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,079
Like I don't care but this is

252
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:53,919
I just noticed the Arduino due board

253
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:55,199
Due

254
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:57,247
I also has the cortex M3

255
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:00,063
At the it runs it runs in at MailChimp

256
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:02,879
For the soc but they integrated in cortex M3

257
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,695
Get your maker on

258
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:06,719
And then

259
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:07,999
If you like what you've done

260
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:08,767
You can start

261
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:09,535
Messing around

262
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:13,375
All right now that's a doorbell

263
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:15,679
Ring

264
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,471
There's actually two pieces of doorbell news

265
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:18,495
Ring has

266
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:19,519
A

267
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:22,079
New doorbell video doorbell 2

268
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:25,663
It's basically a little bit bigger than the lower end

269
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:26,943
Welders

270
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:27,967
It's 3 now

271
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:32,319
So the initial ring doorbell is still there it is notable because it is big

272
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:35,135
It is both wired and Battery powers

273
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:36,671
Either way

274
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:42,047
720p camera on that one that's one key difference

275
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,351
And then the

276
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,911
Ring Pro is a skinnier doorbell

277
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,007
Patio doors

278
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:57,407
Right it's it's $250 as opposed to 179 and that get you full HD and it's hardwired

279
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,199
Yes

280
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:04,063
So now we have this they're actually going to sell that for $200 Which is less than the

281
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:07,391
The big changes you can swap out

282
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,159
Your battery pack

283
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,463
Right so it's hardwired

284
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:13,535
Removable battery or rechargeable battery or recharge

285
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,327
And it has 1080

286
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:18,655
Corral if you were going to buy the older version

287
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,447
You might as well just

288
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,471
By this is

289
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:24,287
20 bucks more

290
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,079
Also

291
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,103
The ring

292
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,383
Pro which is the

293
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,919
$250 one

294
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:30,943
Is

295
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:32,735
Actually that

296
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,271
It's going to be home

297
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:38,367
So they either built ecert chip in there

298
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,391
Or

299
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:41,183
This is part of apples like

300
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:43,999
Cryptic remarks about making it easier to add

301
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,023
Products to hump

302
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,559
So I'm not sure what is going on

303
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:47,839
What happened this won't happen

304
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:52,191
Winter Shield

305
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:54,495
Harbor Gateway fire

306
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:58,335
That is a possibility that's one way to do it

307
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,359
Interesting

308
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:05,759
I'm leery my eyebrows up I know it already cannot see it but my eyebrows raised right now because

309
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:09,599
You come out with a new product and it's going to be homekit compatible

310
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,391
Well this is not the new product

311
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:13,439
Crow the existing

312
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:16,767
Well even so

313
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:19,071
That makes the case even more

314
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:19,839
Yeah

315
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:25,471
Unless there's a retrofit here just Papas little security shipping your doorbell now and you're okay compatible I don't think that's happening

316
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,263
No I don't think Apple wants a

317
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:30,591
William Security Agency

318
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:31,871
So if you have one

319
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:32,895
You know

320
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:34,175
Good news for next year

321
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,711
Also in doorbell news

322
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:37,503
This I'm just going to talk about briefly

323
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:38,783
Because

324
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,575
I have been testing for bells

325
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:41,599
For the longest time

326
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:45,183
And my doorbell transformer is not up to speed

327
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,463
So most homes come with a

328
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,487
18 volt

329
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:48,767
Doorbell

330
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,815
Between 16 and 24

331
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,399
My challenge was I was running to video doorbell

332
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,959
And experiencing some issues

333
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:59,519
So I upgraded my doorbell transformer

334
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:00,543
24-volt

335
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,311
And now

336
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,359
Working like a charm

337
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:08,735
So I'm going to tell you that if you are interested in these video doorbells

338
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:09,759
Check

339
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,039
Former

340
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,063
Especially if your admin

341
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:14,111
Warehouse a lot of them say 16.

342
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:15,903
And that's

343
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:16,927
Willie Morris

344
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:17,695
Probably better in the

345
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,255
Cuz I was I was having some

346
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,023
Real

347
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,071
Charging

348
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:31,775
And did you do the Transformer swap yourself electrician to come out

349
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:32,543
Located wiring

350
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,359
It was basically like while you're here

351
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:38,943
So it cost I think $35 plus the

352
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:39,711
Cost of the trance

353
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:42,271
So it was not expensive

354
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,551
It is something you

355
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,575
You could do yourself

356
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:47,647
YouTube there plenty of instructions online I just

357
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:48,671
The guy was there and

358
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,047
So that was

359
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:58,911
Just DIY project especially if you're experiencing troubles with your doorbell charging

360
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,447
And pulling up

361
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,239
Video really quickly that could

362
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,519
People to Wi-Fi but it might be

363
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:04,543
Our issue

364
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,079
So there you go

365
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,359
Let's talk about

366
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,383
Smartlab

367
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:10,943
Because we put this in the newsletter last week

368
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,247
But you didn't read that you don't know that

369
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:22,975
Yes a lot of people don't know the name smartlabs how much they do know insteon which has made

370
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:25,279
Iot Smart Home Products for years

371
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:27,071
I'm smart

372
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:33,215
Parent company of behind insteon and they also have a retail site called Smart Home

373
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:39,871
Which is where you can buy a lot of these insteon products so I use the many times before spending a great resource in a great site for

374
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:45,503
But you're right they have a new CEO Rob and I may get his name wrong willingness

375
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:50,367
He was the CEO of mideo systems that was later

376
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,647
Taking over by

377

Gets insteon and smart home has as part of that deal

381
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:03,679

00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:08,543
Richmond Capital which invested 7.3 million dollars in smartlabs

383
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:13,663
Which is based in Irvine always has been but now willingness is looking to

384
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,431
Make

385
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:16,735
A second presents in Seattle

386
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:21,599
Previously were from Microsoft so I'm not surprised he's going to be in the Seattle market so

387
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:25,439
New owner and CEO for all of the

388
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,463
Insteon products

389
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:28,511
So maybe we'll see some new

390
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:29,535
Products are made

391
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:32,351
Radiosai I don't know new things from insteon

392
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:39,007
I don't know I mean I guess he saw I don't know if he has plans to you no bills out the product line or

393
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:42,079

395
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:50,015
Back in 2010

00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,807
Before I'm getting

397
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:54,623
All the other fun stuff we have today so

398
00:15:54,879 --> 00:16:01,023
What I liked about insteon was it was a lot of do-it-yourself and you could you could have control when you didn't have to have a server in the cloud

399
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,815
Carolina service and such so

400
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:05,375
Baby troll control over the system which was nice

401
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:06,911
Yay

Pollo piano

409
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:24,831
Birthday for your chandelier but also every time somebody says candy

410
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:28,415
I just think Liberace I'm sorry

411
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:30,719
Okay Be Our Guest

412
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:37,631
Traffic

413
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:38,655
Trying to light up

414
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:42,751
This is an option it is a ambient white light

415
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:43,519
Light

416
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:45,823
And it is thirty bucks above which

417
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,383
I've got a chandelier that has nine bulbs in it

418
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,407
And I will not be

419
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:50,943
Instead I can

420
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:51,711
Nextbit to AC

421
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:52,735
$5

422
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:53,759
$60

423
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,295
Lutron switch

424
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,063
And that

425
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:57,599
Can just fine

426
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:58,879
Yeah

427
00:16:59,391 --> 00:16:59,903
But

428
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,183
You know if you got

429
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,719
You know maybe some sconces

430
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:04,255
Something exciting

431
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:08,095
And these lights will be available we don't know

432
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:13,983
They're available for pre-order now and I think I called them C12 and if I did there actually E12 lights

433
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:16,543
My bad if that indeed

434
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,103
All right moving right along

435
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,127
Other

436
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,175
Shall we talk about

437
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:29,087
Well yeah it's exciting not in a good way for Tesla they actually it hired away

438
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:30,623
Play somebody from Apple

439
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:33,183
Chris lattner about 6 months ago

440
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:38,303
And if you don't know the name Chris lattner that's understandable he's in a lot of behind-the-scenes stuff such as

441
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,143
Contributing to the xcode developer platform that

442
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:44,703
Used to develop Apple apps

443
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:50,847
But I also development companies Swift programming language so I mean this is yeah this is

444
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,127
The smart dude

445
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:53,407
And he went to Tesla

446
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,687
And January

447
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:59,295
And they made him the VP of autopilot software for the car company

448
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:03,647
And he just announced this week Twitter yesterday in fact

449
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:08,767
He's leaving his tweet says turns out Tesla isn't a good fit for me after all

450
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:13,119
I'm interested to hear about interesting rules for a seasoned engineering leader so

451
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:19,519
I don't know what that means for Tesla I mean obviously got other smart people they're working on their autopilot project

452
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:23,871
We was going to work on it before Chris lattner no continue working on it but

453
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:27,711
Now I don't know what the skinny is on that one why he left

454
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:30,271
Yeah that's pretty public waves

455
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:33,343
So

456
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,367
Lot of weirdness

457
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:35,647
I still have mine

458
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:36,671
Tessa I'm not worried

459
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:38,719
MattyB

460
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:42,815
The money and the frothiness around

461
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,607
AI in autopilot

462
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:45,887
Self-driving cars

463
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,423
Executives

464
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,191
To run it is

465
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,519
Small number of people have

466
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:52,543
Skills needed

467
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,407
So all right

468
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,199
Bayou Vista news

469
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:05,343
We can't do a show without talking about on Friday

470
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:07,391
What does tell you about that you know that already

471
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,951
I wrote a little thing about what I think it might mean for

472
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:11,743
Pursued I do realize that this is

473
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:13,023
All about

474
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,559
You know the last mile Disturbed

475
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:15,327
Navigation

476
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:16,607
Amazon

477
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:18,399
But there really some cool options

478
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,679
How about one of those

479
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:20,447
Because

480
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:22,495
The Amazon Dash wand is back

481
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:23,775
Its back

482
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:27,871
This is a tiny little $20 stick that can scan things

483
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:28,895
Your groceries

484
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:30,175
Talk to it and tell it what to

485
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:30,943
Put on your list

486
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:33,247
And if you're in an Amazon Fresh area

487
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:34,783
What are them for you

488
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,319
If you ask it to

489
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,599
It also has

490
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:38,879
Natomas

491
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:45,535
She does speak bacteria so you can ask you could ask questions and such and I can play music on this thing

492
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:48,863
Honda this thing and whatever comes with like it does not play music

493
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,655
Looking at it it's like this tiny little

494
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:51,935
Metal wand

495
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:56,543
Not everything needs

496
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:01,151
No no did you order one

497
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:02,943
By the time I was in Costa Rica last week

498
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,479
Wake you guys and I was not ordering

499
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:08,575
Products sold by the time I ordered it it was on backorder so who knows when I'll get mine

500
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:12,671
I did see that the echo show is going to come

501
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:13,439
Next week

502
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:22,655
So you pay $20 cuz they're subsidizing this you paid $20 for it or you will pay 20

503
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:26,751
And then you'll get $20 back on your eligible for social purchase

504
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:33,151
She registered it so again just like the dash buttons and all its all subsidized

505
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:34,943
Runs on 2 AAA batteries

506
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:35,711
Convenient

507
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,479
I think

508
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:41,087
Yeah be tested something called the Haiku it was a grocery store product.

509
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:42,879
It was 2 years ago

510
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:44,159
And you know

511
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:45,695
I don't buy the groceries in my house

512
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,999
We had fun because

513
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,023
Press the button

514
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,071
What are bananas

515
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,095
Or

516
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,375
You can scan things

517
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,143
Scanner

518
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,935
My husband felt it

519
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:58,239
Sometimes it did not pull the right stuff

520
00:20:59,007 --> 00:20:59,519
For the grocery

521
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,127
We also meal plan

522
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,407
And so

523
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,479
It was great for tracking stuff that

524
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,783
We ran out of but it was kind of

525
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,063
A pain to sit and talk

526
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,087
Order the grocer

527
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,367
We wanted to order

528
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:15,903
Basically

529
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:16,672
Ended up with two

530
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,720
Right right

531
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:24,608
Yeah that's not good so I wonder I mean it's obviously very early since this thing just came out

532
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:31,264
But I wonder if the response is positive and Amazon will know if it's positive cuz they have all the Analytics

533
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:36,896
I wonder if you start seeing this integrated into refrigerators in like a

534
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:38,944
Connecting pain kind of thing

535
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:42,016
Just like some of the dash buttons are in somebody appliances now

536
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:43,040
Yeah that would be

537
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:48,416
I don't want to talk to your fridge is opposed to your

538
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,184
Echo a lot of

539
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:49,952
Those are in the

540
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,000
Pusher

541
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:52,768
Let's do it

542
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:54,560
There's also trash can

543
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:55,328
Scanner

544
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,096
You can buy that

545
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:57,632
You know as you throw some

546
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:58,400
Take away

547
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:00,704
Barcode on it

548
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:02,752
Clever

549
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:04,288
There's a lot of things out there

550
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:07,104
All right and now we have a surprise for both

551
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,384
The audience and myself

552
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:12,736
Yes cuz you don't know what my favorite new Amazon Echo skill is

553
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,016
I don't Kevin

554
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:20,160
What is it it's not that exciting but I'm excited I don't know maybe I'm the only one

555
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:22,464
But I remember saying multiple times

556
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,792
What are the reasons I wasn't too keen on getting in trust me this relates

557
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:28,352
Getting a Google home was that

558
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:31,424
It doesn't work with the music services that I subscribe to

559
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:38,080
And one of them is SiriusXM and sure enough there's a new SiriusXM skill as of yesterday so I can just

560
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:44,480
Tell my echo to play The Beatles channel on Sirius XM now when she link the accounts it's good to go

561
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:45,248
I'm so happy

562
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:50,368
Nice I didn't think people this actually gets Sirius XM out of the car to

563
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,160
Which is probably do that for

564
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:53,952
I listen to

565
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:57,024
SiriusXM more out of the car than I do in the car

566
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,840
I pay extra for that it's an extra five bucks a month I think

567
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:00,864
Oh yeah

568
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:01,888
Awesome

569
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:05,472

00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:25,440
Hey everybody we are breaking into this week's Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor

580
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:30,048
This week sponsor is TE Connectivity and I have Paul Lachlan

Who is the CTO and VP of engineering

582
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:38,752
For the appliances business at TE Connectivity first off let's remind everybody what TE Connectivity does

583
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,568
The range of solutions

584
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:43,360
For the home appliance industry

Everything from

586
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,944
Dishwashers microwaves ovens

587
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,224
Refrigerators

588
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,296
And nowadays unless else

589
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:56,928
Small appliances hitting smart devices in the home think about us smart doorbells

590
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:59,232
Smoke detectors thermostats

591
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:04,096
We are working on a range of solutions for many of those types of products that involved

592
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:08,448
Three endings challenges much difference to us relations convention Association

593
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:11,776
Iqiyi within the conventional home appliances industry

594
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:14,336
Got it and you actually talk to me about some of these

595
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:16,384
Challenges he mentioned moving from

596
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:18,176
Iot 1.0

597
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:19,712
So now we're in iot

598
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:22,272
2.0 can you talk to me about what you meant by

599
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,088
Blake on iot 1.0

600
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:31,488
Consistency of Simply connection discreet devices to the very limited functionality you have made the ability to Country

601
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:37,888
Light switch and Appliance or other device through your phone to a calculation why that was interesting it was not really significant

602
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:42,240
However nowhere in treating what I'd like to call your TT 2.0

603
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:48,384
Brady Industries Inc ESPN a large part in the Essence alternative to the fundamental connectivity issues and challenges

604
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:53,504
We know a t e have the capability of combining json and unique ways

605
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,296
Our customers

606
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:58,624
Develop incredible solutions for end consumers

607
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,744
This will allow them to enhance improve and learn more about their

608
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,280
Behaviors

609
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:10,656
Etc in the home this will create a really meaningful difference and generous

610
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:12,960
Play with color true value proposition

611
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:15,008
So you mentioned some challenges

612
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:17,056
Associated with iot 2.0

613
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:19,104
How is TE Connectivity

614
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:20,896
Alvin companies adapt

615
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:26,784
In terms of challenges security is a very real concern for many of our customers

616
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:33,184
There's too many stories of device isn't a site being hacked with heard stories of video feeds and security cameras and baby monitors

617
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:33,952
Being hijacked

618
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:40,352
So she eats for taking great care to ensure all solutions we provide to our customers are making the strictest standards in the industry

619
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:44,448
All the factors of importance for Tes performance in harsh environments

620
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:46,496
We're playing intelligence into our devices

621
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:48,288
Turn off in your typical

622
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:49,312
Consumer products

623
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:53,408
Open washing machines dishwashers Etc this is what I believe

624
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:59,808
GE has a fundamental advantage over other competitors and sweep and sometimes Heidi reliable Solutions into harsh environment

625
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:01,344
Patience for many years

626
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,416
I don't know which option best expertise for the Smart Home

627
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:08,768

Welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest is

633
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,528
Paul Brody

People who has been listening to the show

641
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:49,472
For like 4 or 5 years might remember Paul because he came on

642
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,056
To talk about

643
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,336
Building

644
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:56,128
Blockchain payment model

645
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:56,896
Pause for iot

646
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,200
Yikes

647
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:01,760
Today we're not going to talk about that actually

648
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,040
Because

649
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:04,064
We're going to talk about

650
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:06,624
Building a better world and

651
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,184
Building business models that work

652
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,464
For consumer iot

653
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,280
Let's see where this goes

654
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:15,328
Paul Ekman

655
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,376
What topics should we tackle first

656
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:20,704
Helix jump on this question of

657
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,264
How we build consumer models for iot

658
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:29,152
Promoted because I am feeling really down in the dumps I feel like we're about to see a lot of products

659
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:31,968
They'll get acquired are they won't be able to support

660
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:32,736
Their customers

661
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:34,016
Because they can't

662
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,552
Ongoing costs

663
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:36,832
Security

664
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:37,600
Software up

665
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:41,184
How do you spell that

666
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:45,536
Why don't know for sure how we completely solve it but I think this is actually

667
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:51,936
It's actually an amazingly not new problem and it I think it stems from from a couple of things one of them is it what I like

668
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:53,216
Make a call business model Envy

669
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:55,008
So a lot of companies in the space

670
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,080
Want to have a razor and Blades business model

671
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:01,408
And I think one of the problems they're having is an expectation

672
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:07,040
From consumers their hope of having a razor blades model is running smack into the desire of consumers

673
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:10,368
Not to have to pay a subscription fee to use their door locks

674
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:14,720
And so it's little things like that are in a mismatching expectation

675
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:16,768
Has meant that in general

676
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:21,376
Iot consumer it business models have had not as much revenue

677
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,912
On the one hand

678
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:23,936
If they had help

679
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:25,984
And on the other hand they're discovering

680
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,800
It's darned expensive to maintain

681
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:34,688
Over the long-term the software and the technology infrastructure required to support smart connected devices

682
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:37,248
Let's first talk about the subscription model

683
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,272
Challenge

684
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:39,040
And then we'll get in

685
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,064
Check back in

686
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,856
Cuz there's there's different answers

687
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:42,880
So

688
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:45,184
When I think about subscription model

689
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,464
If I'm a company

690
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:47,488
Trying to charge

691
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:48,512
People for

692
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,584
I don't know access to Cloud video storage is a

693
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:53,376
Another popular one might

694
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:55,168
Security or

695
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:56,192
Parental controls

696
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:57,472
Rules for like your router

697
00:28:58,752 --> 00:28:59,776
Some of those seem like

698
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:00,544
Something I

699
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:01,824
Hey

700
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,128
So where do you think a company can get away with

701
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:04,896
Subscription

702
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:10,528
I think we're companies can get away with their subscription Melissa live they're providing something

703
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:11,808
That is

704
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:15,392
Meaningfully more valuable than the base functionality

705
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,160
So

706
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:22,560
I want to have a door lock and I want to have an electronic door locking that that's great there certain basic simple things that I want with the door lock

707
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:26,912
But then there's perhaps more advanced functionality does like to have as well

708
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:31,264
I think a freemium model works best where you don't have to be locked into it

709
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:37,664
And then to figure out what the additional services are right so a very simple model that just threw the allows

710
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,736
Unlock door with your phone and is electronic unless you replaced it

711
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:47,136
Physical key with a n d Marco Torres thumbprint maybe that's a no subscription model but if you want to have

712
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:51,232
A door lock that is directly connected to VRBO or

713
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:56,096
Allows you know ups and others to deliver packages and brought them inside your hallway

714
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:58,400
And record the video of them doing that

715
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:00,192
Then that's kind of a perfect

716
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:02,752
Example of where you could add some additional value

717
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:08,384
So I think one thing for opportunities for companies to think about what is the base functionality

718
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:14,784
But I'm going to provide for everybody and it's going to be simple and it's going to be a One-Shot deal you buy it you use it forever

719
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:21,184
What are the extra features that some subset the possibly pay for and that will help fund some of my ongoing up

720
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:26,560
Beyond devices I spend a lot of time thinking about

721
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:28,352
What happens when everything be

722
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:29,120
Becomes a service

723
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:35,008
I actually kind of mean everything because right now I buy my music as a service I buy

724
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:37,312
All of my entertainment and television

725
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:38,848
I guess my book scitech

726
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:39,616
Download

727
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:40,896
Candles soap

728
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:43,968
Service but there is that Kindle reading service

729
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:45,760
And I look at that as we move out

730
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:47,040
The cars or

731
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:48,064
I don't know

732
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:51,904
Wells Fargo customer service for sure coming right in

733
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:56,512
Vacation rentals as a service all of these things anything that can be fractionalized

734
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:58,304
Is likely to become a service

735
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:02,144
So what does that mean for wealth creation and

736
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,168
How people

737
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,448
I just think about

738
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:06,496
It used to be if you bought your home

739
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:07,264
For example

740
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,800
That was a way to

741
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:11,360
Create wealth and now it feels like if I buy

742
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:13,408
Several homes I might be able to generate

743
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,176
Wealth rule

744
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:16,992
Airbnb or those kind of options

745
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:21,856
But for people who don't have that option it feels like it's just going to get wider and wider and they're going to be

746
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:23,136
Slowly like

747
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:25,696
Paying out all of their income and having no chance

748
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:26,720
Instasave just to me

749
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:27,744
The basic services

750
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:30,816
Really

751
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:31,840
Dystopian

752
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:32,864
I do think

753
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:40,032
So do I write I worried about that as well and I try to think about is there some Flipside benefit and I think

754
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:44,640
We are headed towards a world where there could be some significant benefits for people

755
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:50,784
Who are not in the top 1% right so the people who have ordinary incomes and have ordinary aspiration

756
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:55,904
And one of the ones that I think we're going to see most immediately is in fractional vehicle ownership

757
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:57,696
So today

758
00:31:57,952 --> 00:32:03,840
We all need a card has won the most essential things you need especially if you live in the United States we don't have a lot of public transport

759
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,120
You have to have a card

760
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,144
To work

761
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:10,496
Today we'd be happy to buy cars but they actually sit idle most of the time

762
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:13,056
And so in the future when we have

763
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:13,824
Self-driving

764
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,128
Cars in that future is very close by

765
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:19,712
You know if we drive our cars on average 10% of the day

766
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:22,272
We only need about 10% of a car

767
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:24,320
But today we have to buy a whole car

768
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:30,720
Because it impractical to share your car on a daily basis you know sharing keys and stuff like that if you can't go in and out of

769
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:33,536
So what's fractional vehicle ownership

770
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:37,888
We can have self-driving cars to take us to work and then they go and they will they work for others

771
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:40,448
We believe and we're working very hard on that

772
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:41,728
It's fractional

773
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:47,104
Ownership of asset not only does it hugely reduce the cost that individual people have to pay

774
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,968
This is a very good application for blockchain technology where we can make these

775
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:55,040
Decentralized autonomous organization

776
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:57,088
The future could be full of

777
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,880
Cooperative

778
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:04,256
Entities right nonprofit Cooperative that allow people to share assets very very fish

779
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,304
Okay now

780
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:07,840
I like that vision

781
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:09,376
It sounds really awesome

782
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:10,400
But I look at

783
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:11,424
Like things like I think

784
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:14,240
Tesla had a good example of this they had in there

785
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:15,264
Contract with

786
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,800
If you win do you buy the car

787
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:20,384
They don't want you driving that for anybody else except

788
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,920
For them and it's

789
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:25,504
Almost done clear if you would actually get the benefits

790
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,528
Of owning that Tess

791
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:27,296
Tesla or

792
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:28,576
If Tesla would

793
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,624
So it feels like there

794
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,928
Might be in the midst of this subscription

795
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,720
Subscription ization of every

796
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:36,256
Did the

797
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:37,792
Companies who are building these

798
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:38,560
Products

799
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:40,352
Might try to grab as much of

800
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:41,632
Revenue app

801
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:47,008
They're definitely going to and what's really interesting about this to me

802
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:49,824
Is that we are seeing a replay

803
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:53,664
Previous big industrial Transformations and I

804
00:33:53,920 --> 00:34:00,064
I didn't study history at school but I become a bit of a history buff because I love looking at these past examples and what do they want

805
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:06,464
It was really interesting to me is that many people don't realize this is that United Airlines used to be the bow

806
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,280
Going consumer air Transport company

807
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:12,096
Right they used to be the passenger service Division and

808
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:15,936
There's a trend here that we see over and over again which is in times of

809
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:18,496
Significant transformational technology

810
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:23,360
Companies pursue high levels of vertical integration because they're capturing that value

811
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:26,688
And typically what happened in the past with antitrust authorities

812
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,528
Forest unbundling of those services to improve competition

813
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,856
And for sure I think we're not many years away

814
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:35,904
Potentially from some kind of

815
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:40,000
New antitrust Authority looking at those kind of digital integration

816
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:44,096
But we have something new and different that exist today which is

817
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:45,632
The open-source software

818
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:51,520
And even though Tesla for example is extremely far ahead of a lot of companies in this capability

819
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:56,384
Lots and lots of open-source activities going around around machine learning

820
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,712
And image recognition and autonomous vehicles

821
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:03,040
That I think maybe not right away but over time

822
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:04,576
Will empower

823
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:06,368
Consumers Cooperative

824
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:08,160
To build alternative

825
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:10,976
And to create the kind of it a new

826
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:14,816
Cooperative culture that's built on digital collaboration

827
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:18,144
Let's talk about what that needs and how that might

828
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:21,984
So I think

829
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,032
The Prototype the model for this

830
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:26,080
Is in the world of software

831
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:29,408
If you look at blocked and unblocked him is a really good example

832
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:35,808
Almost all the big Innovations in blockchain and all of the foundational capabilities have been built in an open sore

833
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:42,208
Forest Manor and open source technology is at the foundation of almost every major kind of digital technology

834
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:42,976
Platform

835
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:44,256
What's been missing

836
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:47,072
Is the translation of Open Source in a

837
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:51,936
Technology industry into open source and collaboration as a

838
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,728
Physical product

839
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:58,848
And I think that that is the next step in the next big opportunity for people

840
00:35:59,104 --> 00:35:59,616
Is Frosty

841
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:06,016
Create a open-source collaborative or cooperative movement that brings it into the physical world

842
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:12,672
So with that look like my neighborhood Co-op we're like 50 of my closest friends and neighbors get together and we

843
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,208
I don't know

844
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,232
A car is an asset

845
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,048
Cars

846
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:20,096
The cars are good example trucks

847
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:24,704
Solar panels

848
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:28,288
So we creep is Co-op we all Buy in

849
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:30,336
We put our money into this and then

850
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:33,408
We would need to buy some sort of software or

851
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:35,968
I assume it's open source so we would then have to

852
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:36,736
The download

853
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:39,040
We would have to pay someone somehow

854
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:40,064
Management

855
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,344
Attain this cuz that's a field

856
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:42,880
Not a lot of people

857
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:43,648
What have

858
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:44,416
And

859
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:45,184
Then

860
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:46,464
We would allocate

861
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,488
The resource

862
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:48,512
Watching like

863
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:52,352
So we could do a couple of things first of all we can raise the money

864
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:54,400
For this Cooperative venture

865
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:57,984
Through things like an initial coin offering right initial coin offering

866
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:04,384
We can talk about later and we're experiencing a little bit of a kind of an explosive bubble of excitement around them

867
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,224
They are a very cool blocking base way of crowdsourcing

868
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,504
New initiative

869
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:16,160
And so you could imagine raising the money for a community solar farm through an initial coin offering that pays for the solar farm

870
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:18,720
Farm and then you can imagine managing that

871
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:24,096
Through a blockchain based system that met that's attached to your home electricity meter

872
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:25,376
And so did.

873
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:26,656
From your bill

874
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:30,240
The amount that was generated by the solar farm at the time that you can

875
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:36,128
And that all of the software required to maintain that and manage that process is part of a

876
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:37,408
Open source

877
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:39,968
Community-supported software program

878
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,296
And chances are if you have something a very high volume

879
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:45,344
Like a community solar farm

880
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,392
Or a neighborhood car sharing service

881
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:53,792
You're going to have huge number people around the world and think it's a great and you know very rewarding about open source

882
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:54,560
Software

883
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:58,656
50 or 75 or a hundred collaborators around the world working together

884
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:01,984
Create infrastructure that's used by millions

885
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:03,520
And

886
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:06,848
That would be their job or do you think that's something they do in their spare time from

887
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:14,016
Many of these are supported by people who do work in their spare time you know are people at ey they do a ton of

888
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:16,064
Contributions to non-profit

889
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,344
And open stores

890
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:23,744
Communities we actually inform me when I hire developers one of the chief thinks that I look for is a track record

891
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,048
Contributing to open source environment

892
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:30,144
Because the standard of coding is high the level of inspection is high

893
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:36,544
And it kind of just the spirit of community involvement is a great signal that you know what you do with your spare time

894
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,336
Means a lot about how you approach your work

895
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:40,128
So now I got this

896
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:41,664
Managed that feels like

897
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:44,736
Model for sharing assets

898
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:46,528
Maybe a strike against

899
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:47,296
Stay

900
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:48,320
Scarier

901
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,392
Corporate-owned

902
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:53,440
Let us go back

903
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:54,464
2

904
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:57,792
Which was

905
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:59,072
How to build

906
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:01,376
Sustainable business models for a connected device

907
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:02,656
So

908
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:03,936
The first thing was

909
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:06,496
We talked about subscription but you also talked about

910
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:08,800
How do you build iot

911
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:09,824
In a way that makes

912
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:10,592
Cheaper Tumi

913
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:11,360
Maintain over

914
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:13,152
And I think we're going to get back to

915
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:20,320
We are and there's a bunch of key issues at the top of the list is first of all there's a cost of the infrastructure required to

916
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:22,112
To support this large-scale

917
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:23,648
And that infrastructure costs

918
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:25,696
Comes in a couple of ways first of all

919
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:28,768
You need data centers and CDN for Distributing content

920
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,096
And secondly overtime what's interesting is

921
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:34,400
As devices and asset age

922
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:36,448
One of the problems that that

923
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:42,848
You got if it's sometimes the infrastructure that supports them ages as well it may age faster than the devices in

924
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:43,616
In the field

925
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:46,944
So for sure we believe a big part of this is

926
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,248
As much software as you can

927
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:51,296
You should be building on open source

928
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:53,856
Especially if it's got a robust Community because then

929
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:57,440
All the cost of maintaining that software is not falling on your shoulders

930
00:39:57,696 --> 00:40:00,256
And that's really important especially when it comes to security

931
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:01,536
You want a

932
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:03,328
Robust community

933
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:06,400
Are people who are looking for bugs and 0 day

934
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,960
When it comes to the

935
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:12,288
Infrastructure kind of cost in architecture as a whole

936
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:15,872
I think we're still architecting things in a way that's a little bit out of date

937
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:17,408
Retreating

938
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:22,784
Computing cost especially the edge of something that still cost money but actually it's basically free

939
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:27,392
And these devices that we have out of the ads are very very powerful today and they're not

940
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:29,952
Especially for ones that are sitting in a car

941
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:34,816
Bar connected to Mains power they have a lot of compute power and in many cases they have quite a bit of bandwidth

942
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:38,912
As well I'm a big believer in and one of my original interest in blockchain

943
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:41,216
Came around this idea of taking

944
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:42,496
The workload

945
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:48,896
That has traditionally been centralized in an expensive data center or through a CDN and distributing it out to the edges

946
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:53,760
The network as a blockchain based distributed computing infrastructure with peer-to-peer

947
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:55,296
IMessaging and transfer

948
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:02,464
That is a mouthful sorry yes but the bottom line kind of key bottom line that we found out with that

949
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:08,864
From an infrastructure standpoint it can be up to 99% less expensive to maintain a distributed infrastructure

950
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:11,680
Compared to a centralized Data Center

951
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:14,496
Now that's not all of your cost but it's a meaningful chunk

952
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:15,776
I feel like we're

953
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:16,800
Getting there

954
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:19,872
Perhaps maybe not in the consumer side as much but

955
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:21,408
I'm looking at things like

956
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:25,248
This month AWS just announced AWS Greengrass

957
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,296
And that's going to be pushing

958
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:28,832
Services to

959
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:29,856
A Gateway device

960
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:33,184
Microsoft has kind of iot at the edge there's a lot of cops

961
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,208
He's building the super

962
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:34,976
For powerful

963
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:36,256
Devices that

964
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:37,280
They're so it feels like

965
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:39,840
There's interest at the edge but it is not

966
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:40,608
Blockchain

967
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:42,912
So I'm kind of curious

968
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,448
If those two things

969
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,472
Might somehow

970
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:49,824
Are they will definitely meet if you look at all of the major players in this base

971
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:54,687
Every single one of them is in the process of experimenting with our thinking through

972
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:55,967
Blockchain technology

973
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:57,759
At the end of the day

974
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:03,903
I'm not sure that it matters so much what the technology is so long as we move some of the stuff out to the edge

975
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:08,767
What I can tell you is we had an interesting debate back when I was at IBM

976
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:14,143
As we started digging into the use of blockchain for iot and we kept asking ourselves

977
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:16,959
Do you say lots of different distributed computing Arkansas

978
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:23,359
Why do we care about blocking why we doing this are we just doing it because like every time you say Bitcoin somebody

979
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:25,407
DNR compliance Department freaks out and

980
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:26,431
Fun to watch that

981
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:29,247
Or is it because we have a better reason

982
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:32,575
And what we settled on the better reason that we settled on

983
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:34,111
And I think it's a good one is

984
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:35,903
It came back to this question

985
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:37,951
What is the internet of things for

986
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:42,303
And at the end of the day if it's not on the consumer side if it's one the business side

987
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:46,399
The Internet of Things if design some how to create economic value

988
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:48,959
And with need about blockchain as a

989
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:50,751
Distributed computing architecture

990
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:52,543
Is there Heritage in Bitcoin

991
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:55,615
Which is all about moving and storing value in a network

992
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:57,407
And at the end of the day

993
00:42:57,663 --> 00:43:01,247
Whatever we do with with the are distributed iot infrastructure

994
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:07,391
We wanted somehow to be involved in generating money making payments and the economic exchange of value

995
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:08,927
And that's why

996
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:10,463
I think blockchain

997
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:14,303
Will become over time a very attractive choice for companies

998
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:17,631
That want to build high-value hbase empress

999
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:19,935
I like that that make sense

1000
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:21,215
And now

1001
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:26,847
Let us move Beyond value and subscriptions and into this idea of blockchain for social good

1002
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,639
You brought this up in

1003
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:31,199
I feel like we spent a lot of time talking about data

1004
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:31,967
Send money

1005
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:36,063
Business transformation but we don't actually talk about how we can make the world a little bit better

1006
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:37,087
So

1007
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:38,367
Expound on your idea

1008
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:41,439
Creating a network of social good are people who care about social

1009
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:51,423
Yes I feel like such a silly parody of the TV show Silicon Valley every time I say we just want to make the world a better place

1010
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:57,567
But it's funny in part because so many people believe it's true and I for one think of blockchain sare

1011
00:43:57,823 --> 00:44:01,407
And nice unique opportunity for us to read decentralized

1012
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:04,735
The internet and I didn't coined that phrase but I think it was

1013
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:06,271
Icori doctor or somebody

1014
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:12,671
The elf very famous but it's a great idea right at the internet we started off with thinking this is somehow away

1015
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:14,975
Giving people more control

1016
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:16,255
Over their lies

1017
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:17,535
More autonomy

1018
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:21,887
And in some ways it's become a powerful tool of social control

1019
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:24,191
And high level of centralization

1020
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:26,495
And I think we should remember that in fact

1021
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:28,287
In many cases

1022
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:32,127
What's powerful and empowering is to give people the tools

1023
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:34,943
And access to assets that they couldn't previously

1024
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:38,271
So why change Railway Distributing at work

1025
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:42,111
And sharing it out either work or assets or other things

1026
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:43,391
In a way

1027
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:46,207
That seems as efficient and integrated

1028
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:48,767
Centralized infrastructure

1029
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:50,815
But without all of that overhead

1030
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:52,095
Or centralization

1031
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:55,167
And another analogy here is in a Bitcoin

1032
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:57,727
Got a bunch of people who don't know each other

1033
00:44:57,983 --> 00:45:01,311
To work together collaboratively to create a reliable digital banking

1034
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:03,615
We can do the same with

1035
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:04,895
Sharing assets

1036
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:06,943
Building digital infrastructure

1037
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:11,551
Sharing responsibility for ownership of things or maintenance

1038
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:14,367
Right we have the ability to create shared infrastructure

1039
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:15,903
It has no

1040
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:17,439
Central Authority

1041
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:19,231
No sgna

1042
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:22,303
Right it's community-based Cooperative types

1043
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:23,327
The business model

1044
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:25,375
Bradley successfactor

1045
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:27,167
It's how many people to be served

1046
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:28,703
How much profit get

1047
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:32,031
Then how are we going to make money

1048
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:34,335
So not everything has to be about making money

1049
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:35,871
Right and I I think

1050
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:40,991
One of the things that has been great about the USS I think we have an incredible so anthropic sector

1051
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:45,343
Right and I think about for example how Charities raise money

1052
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:51,999
Write initials coin offerings for Charities blockchain tokens for charity the ability to raise money for Charities to help manage

1053
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:55,583
Charitable contributions of product and service to a blockchain

1054
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:56,607
Has huge

1055
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:58,655
Because of its ability to get rid of

1056
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:01,727
A lot of administrative overhead and distribute money efficient

1057
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:02,751
Okay

1058
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:06,079
Man that feels like a lot Paul we have we have solved the

1059
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:07,871
The iot subscription problem

1060
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:08,895
We have

1061
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:09,919
Apparently solved

1062
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:13,247
The problem of dealing with assets

1063
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:14,783
In our shared asset

1064
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:15,551
Using

1065
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:16,319
Watching

1066
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:17,855
And anything else

1067
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:20,415
That's a lot of problem solving for one day

1068
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:22,719
No one can accuse us of lacking ambition

1069
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:23,743
No

1070
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:25,023
So I

1071
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:28,607
Appreciate you coming on the show and giving me a lot of food for thought

1072
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:29,887
Thank you

1073
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:35,263
It's always a delight to be invited me huge fan and I send around the link to your show

1074
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:41,663
To all of my colleagues at ey every time a New Edition comes out that's it for this week

1075
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:48,063
Thank you so much for listening and if you want more iot news you can sign up for my newsletter Stacy

1076
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:54,463
New things at Stacey on iot. Cam will see you next week
