Sidewalk labs news

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,952
Wi-Fi changes and I wrote a thing on doorbell sound

10
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:31,744
.22 and then finally

11
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:33,024
We're going to have

The CTO of

00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:35,328
Wink

14
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:36,352
Nathan Smith

15
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:40,448
Come on the podcast to talk about the new relay switch and everything else

16
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:45,312
Hookah prices new and we'll talk about that in a few

17
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:50,176
Let's talk about the news from Amazon with

18
00:00:54,528 --> 00:01:00,672
Well so what happened Amazon is making a big to-do about their skills so what

19
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:03,488
What did Amazon announce Amazon is

20
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:04,512
Celebrating birthday

21
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:05,536
The

22
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,328
I'd say her name but I'm going to do it

23
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,144
The Alexa skills kit has turned

24
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,960
1 and there are now over 1000

25
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:15,008
400 Alexa skills

26
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,384
Which is pretty quickly I'm not using any sand I want to talk to you a little about if you are using them

27
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:24,992
But the catalog of skills has grown by over 50% in just one month

28
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:27,040
And

29
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:31,648
Yeah you can now also search for skills are you skills by voice which is

30
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:32,928
New and interesting

31
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:34,464
And they change their

32
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,512
There's two other things they said that

33
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:37,280
There

34
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,304
Smart Home

35
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,608
API usage is up by five times

36
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:41,888
And

37
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:42,912
That's great

38
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:47,776
Because I have started out with lights

39
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,312
A couple other things now

40
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:52,128
To it and the other thing they did was

41
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:53,920
If you go to the

42
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:59,296
The library online you can actually organized the skills Library so it's a little bit easier to navigate

43
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:00,064
Which is important

44
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,856
Because of the 2000 skills that is

45
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:10,048
Yeah also in one of their stat they say Amazon says customers that made over 3 million request using the

46
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:12,864
Top 10 most popular Alexa skills

47
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,496
Cuz you're right there are a lot of them in there some of them I would never use some of them seem very useful

48
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:20,288
Make sure not using any at all

49
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,056
Really

50
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:23,104
Yeah and I don't know why

51
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:26,176
I don't know why maybe I just haven't found in one

52
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,712
Looks like I Gotta Have It

53
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:29,248
I'm going to use it everyday

54
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,784
I got to get this thing on here

55
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:33,856
So I don't use any everyday

56
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,672
I've enabled quite a few

57
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,768
My biggest challenge is actually been remembering the

58
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:43,840
Q words like so the semantic keywords that you have to

59
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:46,144
To use that's why I'm not using them

60
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,936
So I think

61
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:51,776
Play Jeopardy will will help me out a little

62
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:58,688
Cuz we use it we use it to play games we I'm trying to think of what other skills I've enabled the 7th

63
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:01,248
Workout skill although I think I've only used it twice

64
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,064
When she talks

65
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:05,344
It is

66
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:06,880
Not very

67
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,160
Inspiring you're not like

68
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,696
Let me jump

69
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,256
Jump give you a bunch of jumping jacks really fast

70
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,024
Oh

71
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,560
Push-ups yeah

72
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,656
I really really need some A to Z Astic coach boys screaming at me

73
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:19,680
And she's pretty

74
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,752
We also have tried the farting one

75
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:24,288
I'll be honest lyrics

76
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:32,736
I could see that I could see that I do like how you can now enable them by voice the thing is unique again you need to know that

77
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:34,272
That keep it the skill keyword

78
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,808
You could just guess to me

79
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:39,136
Like you know alarm has a skill alarm.com

80
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:39,904
Has a scale

81
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,672
And

82
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:42,208
That is

83
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:44,000
Enable alarm.com

84
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:45,280
So

85
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:49,376
And there yeah okay and there's a there's not going to be hopefully one alarm.com

86
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,144
Skill

87
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:53,216
Is very specific because it's time to their website

88
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:56,544
The name but I don't know maybe I need to go back and look

89
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,104
And see what new skills are available it's

90
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,128
It's easier now

91
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:04,224
It is easier yeah because it's categorized so that helps

92
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:10,624
I don't know just using a cigarette at an app by voice and having another very specific keyword

93
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:13,952
Just doesn't seem very natural language to me

94
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:14,976
It's not

95
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:15,744
And that's

96
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,024
Best part of Lake

97
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,559
That's a limitation that

98
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,583
Yakko has

99
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,655
I talked to them so I wrote about

100
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,447
The echo being Amazon

101
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,471
App Store

102
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:26,239
Possibly

103
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,287
The next gen App Store

104
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:31,103
I asked him if they were going to

105
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:34,431
Office of Revenue generating opportunities for companies

106
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,455
And

107
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,223
They're like

108
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,271
Baby

109
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:43,391
So I'm still waiting to see like maybe the next thing we'll see is something about like

110
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:44,415
Hey

111
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:47,231
This is how you could pay up cuz there are skills like there's the

112
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:48,511
The nutritions

113
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,047
The Foot Locker app

114
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:51,583
Sorry food lockers

115
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:57,215
I'm not using that now because it doesn't tie and anything that I use bit

116
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:58,751
Something like that would be amazing

117
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:03,103
It would it would I'm sure developers would like to see some kind of

118
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:06,943
Revenue stream here I don't know that Amazon cares

119
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,735
Edward wants to monetize this

120
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:14,111
I just I think it's more of let's build at this ecosystem then let's sell the hardware and

121
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,415
And gather information you know

122
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:19,999
That's they're doing a lot of that I'm in for obvious reasons so

123
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:22,303
Yeah and if that's true so

124
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:24,607
We shall say Amazon also did

125
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,679
More than 50 new Dash buttons

126
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:31,519
Yeah nerve Play-Doh

127
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:35,615
Fiji Water Milano cookies which I like Clif bars I love Clif bars

128
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:36,639
Who is ordering

129
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:44,319
I imagine if your kid found it I hit this button Play-Doh comes to my door and I'm sure if I would like

130
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:47,391
6 years old I be bang bang bang hitting that button every day

131
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:53,791
Trident gum I mean I'm more interested in getting a dash button you know that the hacker version or getting one of these and

132
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,327
Andre jiggering it to do it

133
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,351
I wanted to do

134
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,911
Yeah yeah

135
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:04,031
I don't I just haven't been sold on this either I know what Amazon trying to do a trying to

136
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:06,079
Remove any possible barriers

137
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:10,431
Between you and the goods you want to shop for that Amazon can send you

138
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:16,831
But I'd even I've seen a lot of people complain like I don't use it anymore because I don't even get get the guaranteed best price you know the

139
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:19,647
The price variances I can't tell because I hit the button and just

140
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:21,695
You know I don't know what the price is

141
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,231
And it does vary so

142
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:24,767
I don't want to chat

143
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,303
It's kind of a step

144
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,887
Surge pricing

145
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,215
So

146
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:35,263
Amazon

147
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,311
Amazon is famous for making up stats

148
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:40,383
That sounds awesome but really tell you very little about their business

149
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,687
Saudi - stat

150
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,223
Kishore is that

151
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,247
Twice every minute

152
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,271
Someone

153
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:48,063
Order something using a dash button

154
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,879
That sounds kind of cool right

155
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,415
You're like oh that's like

156
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,207
One point

157
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:57,023
It's a little over a million x 1.05

158
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,559
Takes a year

159
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,839
That's a lot of Play-Doh

160
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:02,655
What is a lot of Play-Doh but it's not a lot of an Amazon order

161
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:08,287
There was a story over at Gizmodo in 2013 that said that people in the Amazon warehouse

162
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:11,103
We're basically trying to process 35 orders

163
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:11,871
Second

164
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:12,639
Which

165
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,479
Make that two minutes or two orders per minute

166
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,503
What kind of lame

167
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,831
And I know in the Christmas surge Seasons they get up to 400

168
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:27,231
In 20 I think was also 2013-2014 they said they were processing like 400

169
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,279
26 orders per second

170
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:31,583
So it was like it's a lot of orders

171
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,119
It doesn't get

172
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,143
Batman

173
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,167
3 -

174
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:40,543
And I'm kind of curious how it how it interacts with their subscription business because that's probably what the stakes from

175
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:41,567
Is my cat

176
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:48,479
Yeah I mean if you're in on a recurring delivery schedule for something you don't need a dash button I wouldn't think. For that way too many

177
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:51,039
Maybe this gives you more control

178
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,575
For something fake

179
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:57,183
Then you can just order it when you need it as opposed to being on the recurring

180
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,975
Down for life

181
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:01,023
2 weeks and you're not going to use as much

182
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,095
I would be

183
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:09,983
Curious if any of our listeners are using Dash buttons or have tried them and then no longer use them or still use them

184
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,031
That would be kind of interesting feedback

185
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:14,335
Tell us about your dash at

186
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,127
Question

187
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:18,687
At iot podcast. Com

188
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:27,391
Okay so that's the Amazon news. Exciting we also have weird to talk about this later in the show

189
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,927
But we'll talk about it a little bit now

190
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,463
On Tuesday

191
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:31,487
Week

192
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:34,559
Daymaker The Hub basically said that

193
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:35,839
They had

194
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:38,399
Dummies Partnerships with Uber if this then that

195
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,167
And

196
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:39,935
Fitbit

197
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:41,727
And it also

198
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:46,079
Talked about something that actually have been going on since June 11th

199
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:49,407
They've been selling their relaced light switches

200
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,431
4

201
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:54,271
You know 149 for 2 or 99 for 1

202
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,551
Which is a big deal

203
00:08:55,807 --> 00:09:01,951
Yeah because I looked at the wink relay way back and for those who are not familiar I think it's the

204
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,743
Been around since 2014

205
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:06,047
It kind of looks like a little

206
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:11,423
Almost like a little smart phone a touchscreen smartphone embedded into a switch

207
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:15,007
And there were two hardware buttons to the side of it

208
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:21,151
And basically it replaces a light switch and add smarts to whatever is on that circuit for that light switch

209
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,431
Plus it has

210
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,991
Wi-Fi and I think 60 connect connectivity

211
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:30,367
Okay so it's hardwired to take the place of a

212
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:32,159
Traditional light switch add smart

213
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:34,975
I'm the screen against a touch screen

214
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:41,375
So we can show you almost there I can show you the short cuts like you might have set up for a wink in your wing cap for example

215
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:48,031
But now with these new Partnerships bring up a Fitbit I can see my Fitbit stats and such on there

216
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:51,871
And I forget how much it used to cost I want to say was closed at 2

217
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:55,199
Yeah I was like I've talked to hundreds or 249

218
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:58,527
It was a non-starter for me because of the price but now

219
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,831
It's 99

220
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:04,671
And I'm thinking especially cuz I'm moving next week and I'm taking my

221
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:08,511
Wink Hub with Maci actually only smart home stuff I'm taking with me

222
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:11,327
I'm thinking about getting maybe two of them

223
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:17,727
I know you are more because it will broadcast your

224
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:20,287
But we should say it has a microphone

225
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:22,847
Present sensor speaker

226
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,895
Temperature yesterday

227
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:27,711
You getting a bunch of sensors you're getting connectivity

228
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:31,807
You're getting the ability to access your wig shortcuts

229
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:38,463
And at smarts to whatever is on that circuit where you put the light switch so yeah I think I'm going to grab

230
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,743
That maybe two of them

231
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,815
No I've I'm actually thinking

232
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,095
Same thing you do have to

233
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:46,143
Install them you need a neutral wire

234
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:47,679
Which is

235
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:50,495
I mean I've never seen a Smart Switch that doesn't require one

236
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:54,079
Which is unfortunate for people in old houses by

237
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,871
Okay so yes

238
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:56,639
In

239
00:10:57,151 --> 00:11:00,479
Will wait for Kevin to move and then install them and tell us how many thing

240
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:01,759
Meantime

241
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,551
I'm actually looking at

242
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:09,951
Plum which is another wifi-enabled smart switch for a while we didn't have great options in the wifi-enabled smart

243
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,231
Which we have WeMo

244
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,047
So both of these

245
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,351
You can set up dinners for

246
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:19,423
And Plum is really interesting because this is

247
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,447
This actually

248
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,519
Launched like two years ago was called a booby

249
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,287
Actually like

250
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:30,687
3 years ago or maybe even in 2012 I cannot remember it's been forever this is a Kickstarter project that what happened was they

251
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:33,247
Did the kickstarter without even having the product

252
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,527
I don't think the product was Eva

253
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,647
And then they realized

254
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:42,207
Oh no this is not the way we want this to go

255
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,487
And so they

256
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:44,511
Basically

257
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,303
Went back to the drawing board

258
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:47,327
And

259
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:52,703
Read it the whole thing and so now these are light switches with a touch-sensitive

260
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,263
Panel in the front they look just like a light switch

261
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,311
Looks like a toggle switch almost

262
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,079
Looks like a toggle switch

263
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,103
And

264
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:01,151
Can you see the pricing on their is it

265
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:07,039
99 for a single unit a three-pack is 289

266
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:13,439
And then you can buy 10 packs and 20 packs if you want to go hog-wild it resemble a 20-pack would beat 1807

267
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:16,255
That's for when you're building your own house

268
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:18,303
Or someone else's building your house

269
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,095
So

270
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,631
This product is

271
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:26,495
Cool because what it is is it's got processing power and each light switch

272
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:28,799
It runs up Applegate runs

273
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:35,199
Honor language is a programming language used in distributed computing and the idea is that each of these switches is

274
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,223
It's going to be

275
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,503
Part of a distributor cap

276
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:40,319
Computer network that actually is acting as your Hub in your home

277
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:42,879
I was just going to say so this is a hubless solution

278
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,415
It's it's a hubless

279
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,439
Solution

280
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:47,487
Using Wi-Fi and Bluetooth

281
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:50,047
I don't believe it has the mic and speaker

282
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,607
I do not believe it does

283
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:59,007
My immediate issue is that it requires an iPhone 4S or higher or iPad

284
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:03,359
IPod Touch that's right this is iPhone only

285
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:06,431
It's not actually I think it's just shipping to the kickstarter

286
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:08,479
People there they're getting ready to do

287
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,247
More stuff

288
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,551
So I'm just saying this is out there

289
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,855
Minkus actually really out

290
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,415
If you want a Wi-Fi switch

291
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,695
Mad at that price

292
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:22,047
Wink is owned by Flex

293
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,839
So it was on backwards

294
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:24,607
Bankrupt

295
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:25,631
Hip flexor

296
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,399
She's not going to do

297
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,703
Definitely not

298
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,471
Definitely not

299
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:32,543
We'll talk more about that cuz we're talking about design stuff

300
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,591
I think you'll also hear about the sensors again

301
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:36,639
Yeah go get a drink of water

302
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:43,295
Okay

303
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,063
So

304
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:46,367
Other news that was. We've got

305
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,135
Wi-Fi

306
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,671
So the WiFi started

307
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:54,559
The Wi-Fi Alliance has a new Wi-Fi certified AC

308
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:56,351
Addition or enhancement

309
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,399
Right in AC is the most

310
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,679
Recent one

311
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:01,727
Is it Wireless

312
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,007
Version of

313
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:07,103
Wi-Fi so it's the most recent one for routers and others they also have Wi-Fi Halo

314
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:11,967
Which is actually the new aspect but it's not actually certified or standardized yet

315
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:13,503
That's for that

316
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:15,807
Low power

317
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:18,111
Hard to get to places

318
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:21,695
So what's new with the

319
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:22,719
AC

320
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:24,767
So they've added multi-user Mimo

321
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,071
Which for all of you for going

322
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:33,727
Basically means that your Wi-Fi it's a tennis can send the data to more than one device at a time

323
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,519
Which ads

324
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:36,799
Basically makes

325
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,847
Connection for reliability

326
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,383
Is make it faster Kevin

327
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,967
Can I get faster on certain devices

328
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:44,991
I'm going to use

329
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:48,063
An example I think it still applies

330
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:54,463
And a lot of older networks you could be slowed down if you had one slow device because made

331
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,231
Maybe it was a

332
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:59,839
How to say nato to 11. B and everything else is a 211. G

333
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:02,911
You know there was there ways around that to fix that but

334
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,447
You just kind of stuck

335
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:08,543
With your slowest device slowing down everything but now that should not be an issue

336
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,591
And then they also increase

337
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,359
Grease the channel

338
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:14,175
Yes maximum Channel bandwidth

339
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,199
It's going from

340
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:20,831
80 megahertz to 168 Channel switch they say potentially doubles transmission speeds obviously

341
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:21,599
We can do the math

342
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:24,671
But that is good at catching I remember we had

343
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,719
20 megahertz channels what is like

344
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,999
Super fast so this is

345
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:28,767
Fantastic

346
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:29,791
Yeah

347
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:33,119
So ye better wi-fi last week we got better Bluetooth

348
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:36,703
This week better wi-fi in this actually Albion devices in the coming

349
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,471
Weeks

350
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,239
So sad

351
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:40,799
Wi-Fi lights

352
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,335
I wonder

353
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:46,175
Yeah I guess this is not just a simple software

354
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:52,575
Upgrade meeting older 802 11ac devices will see this I think this is hard because

355
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:54,367
They're actually break me up 5

356
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:58,719
Of the first sip Wi-Fi certified AC price to support the new features

357
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:02,047
And comprise a test bed for interoperability so

358
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,351
I think this means new hardware

359
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:06,911
I'm not seeing everything about older devices

360
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:12,799
If I make sense cuz implementing multi-user

361
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:14,335
I believe

362
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:16,895
Yeah

363
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:19,711
From an antenna perspective as well as others yeah

364
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,247
Radio

365
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,271
Yep

366
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,807
So free wifi

367
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:27,391
Little bits of news Columbus Ohio

368
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:29,439
Was the name to be

369
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:33,791
Winner of a grant from the Department of Transportation

370
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,327
Say

371
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,887
40 million-dollar grant for the.

372
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:39,679
10 million from Vulcan

373
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,471
Capital Paul Allen's company

374
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,007
Basically this is a

375
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,543
To build a smart City

376
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:45,567
And

377
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:49,919
I'm a little sad because Austin was also in the running for this 11

378
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,455
Casey and some other cities

379
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:57,087
Columbus apparently had the best plan and they also brought in another

380
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:59,903
140 million + local

381
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:00,927
Crimson

382
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,207
Can I help

383
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,231
So

384
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:05,279
It's a lot of money going to improve

385
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:08,351
Transportation with bike smart cities

386
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:13,983
Smart passes for traffic Lanes I think it's that got autonomous buses is something they're looking at 2

387
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,263
What interesting stuff

388
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,031
Coming out of Columbus

389
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:18,591
Yeah but they have

390
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:20,383
That's part of the project they have

391
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:23,967
Cars that are kind of have that lidar and radar sensors like a

392
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:28,575
OK Google Maps car and they actually go around all the time in theory

393
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,599
And see where

394
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,879
There is open parking

395
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:34,719
NFL communicated to the people live there that way they can get to the

396
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:35,999
The closest

397
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:40,095
Open parking spots that are driving around in circles for 10 minutes and so on so

398
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,119
Kind of dressing

399
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,143
I would totally

400
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:48,287
Play I wonder how much extra traffic that adds I putting those

401
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:54,175
Cars out there to actually check the parking spot so I wish there were sensors in the parking spots where you can say it

402
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:57,247
I don't have three times on on top of me so it

403
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:02,367
Yeah I would think you'd want to do it cameras just because he wouldn't have to change the batteries in Those sensors and

404
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,647
That's

405
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:05,183
More bang for your buck

406
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,207
Anyway

407
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:09,791
The reason why we bring this up is because ye Columbus but also

408
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:13,375
Because we heard from sidewalk Labs which is Google's

409
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:14,399
Well

410
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:16,191
Which alphabets alphabets

411
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:18,239
What are the alphabet

412
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:22,079
We should also say right now right here

413
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:22,847
Kevin

414
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:25,407
What's for now that company called Google

415
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,687
There you go

416
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:28,223
But he has nothing to do with

417
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,015
Unfortunately

418
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,319
Kevin you can't do everything

419
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:36,415
Santa Claus is

420
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,695
Google Smart City

421
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:42,559
Santa Claus is alphabet Smart City ever

422
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:43,327
And

423
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:46,655
What it's apparently do and nobody really knows a lot about what it

424
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:47,423
It's doing

425
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,191
So

426
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:49,471
We

427
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:55,871
The guardian got papers saying that it is going to run Public Safety or public transportation Networks

428
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:56,895
In Columbus

429
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:59,199
So, this is part of its effort

430
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:02,527
To implement all of this kind of traffic

431
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:03,807
Stuff

432
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:05,855
It's using sidewalk labs

433
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:06,879
Software called

434
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:07,647
Flow

435
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:10,207
To help manage its transportation

436
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:10,975
So

437
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:12,767
I'm not sure exactly what that mean

438
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:14,303
But that could be part of the public

439
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:18,655
I've been pretty sure that it is Court will that's according to the guardian

440
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:20,703
Which found this information

441
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:24,543
I thought that was interesting

442
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,335
I'm very curious I'm hoping to get someone

443
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,871
Sidewalk Labs podcast

444
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:28,895
Because I Got High

445
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,431
I want to know more

446
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:32,735
Alright other news of the week

447
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:33,503
Let's see

448
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:37,599
I will let you guys know that I did a review for The Wirecutter on

449
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:38,879
Connected doorbells

450
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,671
It came out very nice

451
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:41,951
It did it

452
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:42,719
Took forever

453
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:44,255
So I have had

454
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,535
The skybell

455
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:46,815
HD

456
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:48,095
The August

457
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:48,863
And the

458
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,399
Ring

459
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:53,727
Not the pro cuz that wasn't available for reviewers yet

460
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:56,031
On my door for like

461
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:56,799
Months

462
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:57,823
And

463
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:59,359
They live through

464
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,919
Torrential rain they look through all kinds of stuff

465
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:02,687
And

466
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:04,479
The review turned out to

467
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:06,783
I said the skybell HD was my favor

468
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:11,135
Actually change cuz beforehand I thought the August was my favorite in fact I

469
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:13,183
I now own two August doorbells

470
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:20,351
And finally we have some news from CD insights who actually this week put out a report saying that smart home

471
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,119
Funding

472
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:25,215
Is up for the first time since the last quarter of 2014

473
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:26,495
And

474
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:28,031
I thought that was kind of

475
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:30,335
Worth noting although the biggest eel

476
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:31,359
It seems like

477
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:32,639
A lot of that was

478
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:33,407
Was due to

479
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,175
Ring racing

480
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,199
61 million

481
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:38,271
That was a good chunk of the of the quarter here

482
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,063
So

483
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:42,367
In the first quarter of 2016

484
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:45,951
24 companies raised 114

485
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:47,487
Million dollars

486
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:49,279
The peak was in

487
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:53,375
The fourth quarter of 2014 when 36 companies raised

488
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:56,447
251 million

489
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:57,215
$10

490
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:02,591
Is that a drop precipitously as often as the case inventor world end

491
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:04,127
It'll probably come back up again

492
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:04,895
Yeah

493
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:08,223
In part of that funny

494
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:10,783
Is it less smart home but it is iot

495
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:13,343
Ala raised 39 million dollars

496
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,111
Which was a

497
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:16,672
Endura

498
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:18,720
Which is a company that's actually providing

499
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:24,608
Back in kind of machine learning and intelligence for smart home devices raised 11 million

500
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:27,680
There is a really interesting company it's kind of seeking

501
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:29,984
Three you know houndify

502
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:32,032

00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:34,848
A easy way for developers to add voice

504
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:35,872
To there

505
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:36,640
Products

506
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:40,224
You're a kind of wants to make it easy to add machine learning and

507
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:43,040
Context-based intelligence 2

508
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,064
Products

509
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:44,832

Yeah it is all right so

511
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:49,696
That's kind of

512
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:52,000
All the News That's fit to talk about this week

513
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:52,768

Why I chose the radios and sensors he chose and all about the kind of design efforts that they're making their

520
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:20,928
Hey this is Stacy breaking into the podcast with a message from our sponsor today sponsors

Hit the market

533
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:03,936
How to evolve as an ecosystem I think the Internet of Things is an incredibly complex

534
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:04,960
Challenge

535
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:07,520
Different things work things is important here

536
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:09,312
They want to come together from

537
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:13,152
The fight side to networking to Cloud application

538
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:18,784
On our side we partnered very closely with chip vendors these include Tommy's like Renaissance

539

Broadcom Qualcomm Marvell mediatek

540
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:26,720
And also work with companies like apple and WeChat in China to make sure that these

541
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:28,256
B2c applications

542
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,536
Seamlessly work

543
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:33,632
With the devices in the cloud together

544
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:35,168
So who are you guys working

545
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,240

00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:42,848
Companies like Hunter Fan

548
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,688
They're launching a homekit enabled fan on or service later this year

549
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:53,088
Air conditioning companies like Fujitsu I sent TCL bunch of Chinese companies door lock

550
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,696
Pretty much if you see something in your home today and it's starting to get connected somewhere

551
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:00,768
We have a custom on our platform that's doing the same thing

552
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:03,072
All right and if I want to build

553
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:09,472
Some sort of seamless software experience in the cloud how can I find you

554
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:14,336
Www.netflix.com and that's a y l a

555
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:20,736
Network s.com

556
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:27,136
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast

557
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:32,512
I'm your host Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest is Nathan Smith the founder and CTO of wings

558
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:36,352
I'm doing really well thanks for having me on

559
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,144
I am super excited to have

560
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,496
Because I have almost completely gone

561
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:50,944
What what do I do with my week

562
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,480
But so far it's been work

563
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:53,504
Awesome

564
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,296
And it sounds like you guys are getting

565
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,320
To make it even better

566
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:58,368
Yeah absolutely Flex been in

567
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:01,696
Incredibles parent company in such a cool company and and

568
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:04,768
We've really been able to focus on on the product and and

569
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:07,072
Making things even better than they were before

570
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:09,632
You guys are here

571
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:10,400
Because

572
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:11,424
You announce

573
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:16,032
Partners for the relay switch which I didn't even realize was actually back on the market

574
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:20,640
Your new partners why don't we quickly run to the news so who are your new partners

575
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,456
So we made Partnerships with

576
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:25,760
Marquee brands does Brands art

577
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:26,528
Uber

578
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:28,064
Fitbit

579
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:29,856
I love if

580
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:34,464
You don't control things from

581
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:36,000
My wink

582
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,328
Ecosystem is

583
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:40,096
Is NASA

584
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:44,704
That's so much cool stuff you can do and we really see this is the first step of

585
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,544
You know I'm starting to integrate them with them a little more deeply

586
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,104
And so you know right now you'll be able to use

587
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,896
Is the relay button says that if

588
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:54,688
Component of the

589
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:55,712
The knot recipe

590
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:57,248
And so you can say you know

591
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:58,528
If this button

592
00:25:58,784 --> 00:25:59,296
Express Tax

593
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,320
He said maybe you can

594
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:03,648
Can use that as an alert to text you if you when your kid comes home

595
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:04,416
School

596
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:06,464
Another thing you can do it on this way sign in

597
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,232
Is that you can use

598
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,512
Using with the Logitech Harmony

599
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:14,144
You don't have a physical button that turns on your entire a view system in the

600
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,168
Transit off at night

601
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:15,936
When you go to bed

602
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:21,056
You need at the real and I think it's more convenient than trying to like menu dive to your remote

603
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:26,432
That's true although I can actually control my Logitech Harmony through the echo

604
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:28,480
Which crazy

605
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:30,528
Superfund

606
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:35,392
Let's go because when you guys at

607
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:38,208
Gosh like a year-and-a-half ago was it

608
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,328
Yeah so bad thing was $250 you had to

609
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,912
Install it in your wall the relay guys is a

610
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:51,264
Your light switch goes

611
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:53,824
And it also has an income

612
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,128
Chanel

613
00:26:56,384 --> 00:27:00,224
What looks like the wink interface on a touchscreen on that switch

614
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:03,040
Came on the market

615
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:05,600
In my humble opinion

616
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:09,184
But now it's only $149

617
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,208
2

618
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,816
For what we are really committed to

619
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:17,888
Continuing to update this product so you know

620
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:19,168
Without having

621
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:21,472
To buy new hardware or anything like that

622
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:23,520
With the intercom with these new service

623
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:26,848
Substantially upgrading what the weather be like

624
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:29,152
And you've mentioned that like

625
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:31,712
It's sort of like an interpretation of of

626
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:32,736
Wink you know

627
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:34,016
On your wall

628
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,832
What we really wanted to do it this was

629
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,880
Not so much even about

630
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:40,160
The wink out itself

631
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:40,928
It was more about

632
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:44,512
Like what how would we reinterpret the light switch for the dish

633
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:46,816
Like what makes sense

634
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:47,840
What's more

635
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:51,936
When we're Gods with it is that we think that it's B

636
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:53,472
Becomes really nice coffee

637
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:54,496
Fermented things

638
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:56,544
Like Amazon Alexa

639
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,312
Internet

640
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:59,360
It's a sleek and

641
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,896
Unobtrusive

642
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:02,176
Implants

643
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:05,248
Simple interface and that makes sense for certain use cases

644
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:08,832
You might order an Uber through

645
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:11,136
Your Amazon Alexa

646
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,952
You know voice control device I cannot go or something

647
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:16,768
You like that where you might order it through your cell phone

648
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:18,304
But you know you can see

649
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,864
See how long how far away the car is

650
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:21,888
Anyang

651
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:26,496
Relay and I think that that makes a lot of sense and that interaction between like the active

652
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:27,520
Blake The Voice

653
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:29,568
And the passive like the relay

654
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:32,384
When am I actually on my

655
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,480
Original ecobee was that I could literally just walk by and see the weather

656
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:39,040
It's not like the stupidest thing but it was awesome

657
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:46,720
Yeah we have weather on relay as well and not yeah I use it every single day I rarely ever open up the weather app anymore

658
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:48,768
So that makes a lot of sense

659
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:54,400
And you guys have actually been working hard at Integrations why are you doing this focus on

660
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:58,752
All of these other services and what do you think the wink platform provides

661
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:00,544
Wink is all about connecting things

662
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,104
I sometimes think about it as

663
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,128
Like an operating

664
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:05,408
For the home

665
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:10,528
We have this Mantra internally a twink that is use wink more but use the app less

666
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,576
And what we mean by that is that like

667
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:13,856
Like we love connect

668
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:14,880
Together two

669
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:18,976
Create the sort of futuristic experiences that I think that we

670
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:20,768
We all want from

671
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:22,560
He's connected products and

672
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:23,328
You know

673
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:25,888
It takes a long time to for everything

674
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,168
Immature and

675
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:28,448
For everything to

676
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:29,472
You know

677
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:32,800
Potential but we feel like rely just on the precipice.

678
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,592
And so

679
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:35,616
We think about

680
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:37,408
The smart home is something that

681
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:40,480
It's it's more than just like physical Hardware

682
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:42,528
It is also be services

683
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:49,184
Earlier today you told me that you guys kind of don't believe there's going to be a central Hub in the home and that's kind of

684
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,464
Fyu designs

685
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,488
The relay

686
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:53,792
You designed the relay to act is that hub

687
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:59,168
What should we take from this given that he don't double A has fewer radios

688
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:03,008
Better than the walls design in it

689
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,288
Thinking about

690
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:05,568
Biscuit future

691
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:07,360
Hub replacement

692
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:10,688
We think that there's going to be a house in the future but we think they're going to

693
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,480
Piggyback on other devices

694
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:13,760
Especially as

695
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:15,296
Low energy

696
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,576
The chair is National

697
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:19,136
We thank God

698
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:20,672
It makes a lot of sense

699
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:22,208
Combined

700
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:26,304
Browder's a game consoles and like white switches with hub

701
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:28,352
Yunnan places where you have power you have

702
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:30,144
Wi-Fi already

703
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:31,424
And so

704
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,240
The reason that we put we take zigbee for the

705
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:36,288
The relay Hub is that

706
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:37,312
We feel

707
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:38,592
That's the real Isaac

708
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:40,640
Decor a product it's about controlling

709
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:41,664
Smart light bulbs

710
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:45,760
And because we are focusing on that Whiting use case

711
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:47,040
And the bad

712
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:48,064
Adoption of

713
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,648
Light switch to the 20

714
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,672
Centuries

715
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:56,512
We felt that Digby was the right protocol because

716
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:59,584
Of the choice and availability of

717
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,608
Zigbee bulbs

718
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:03,936
We don't particularly endorse one protocol

719
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:04,960
Over another

720
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:08,800
You have a microphone in there and you have a speaker because it's now an intercom

721
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:14,432
Are there any other kind of sensors

722
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:15,968
Temperature might be an interesting thing

723
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:17,248
We have temp

724
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:21,344
And you can also there also is a proximity sensor

725
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,672
So you know we can see if there's activity in the house

726
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:26,976
We have some pretty Advanced machine learning

727
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:30,048
Programs going on right now and they will make use of that data

728
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,376
Outfitting my house

729
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:35,680
4 and trying to make it a smart home

730
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:39,264
I felt like for advanced users wink was a great place to start cuz it work

731
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,032
A lot of things

732
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,056
So

733
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:47,200
How many of these would I want in my house how should I be thinking about designing my house or is it still too early

734
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:49,504
Well it really depends on the houses

735
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:50,784
SKS I need

736
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,320
I live in New York so

737
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:53,088
I can only

738
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:53,856
Really have one

739
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,648
But

740
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:57,440
You know if you got a larger house and

741
00:31:58,464 --> 00:31:59,488
Intercom

742
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:01,280
Use kiss makes a lot of sense for you

743
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:03,840
Then you know we've had people that have ordered five

744
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:05,376
Before

745
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,912
Because I want one in every room

746
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:09,984
You know what you can have a button on one of your relays

747
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,520
That causes down the in

748
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:12,288
Entire house

749
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:13,312
For the night right

750
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:16,640
So that might not make sense on a relay in the living room

751
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:18,432
But you know my name a lot of sense

752
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:20,224
Relay like by the garage door

753
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:26,624
Something was it difficult to figure out a user interface Works in such a small space

754
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:31,744
Potentially do so much how do you kind of think about menus and accessing that

755
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:36,864
Something about designing for Relay is that we actually have some really interest

756
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:39,168
Constraints design around

757
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:41,216
And what really does best

758
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:42,752
And what it does better than

759
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:43,776
Mobile phone

760
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:47,616
It can convey information without being a

761
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,200
Answer. So we really try to focus on is

762
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:54,016
Designing widgets in a way where you can look at it for

763
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:56,064
2 seconds as you're passing it

764
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,880
And you know get useful information

765
00:32:59,136 --> 00:32:59,904
Information about things

766
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,440
I'd like the weather or you stopped

767
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:02,976
Like that

768
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:07,072
And it doesn't work like that with the phone the phone is a device that

769
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:09,120
You don't always want to have tethered

770
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:10,656
Why you don't want to carry around

771
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:11,424
Your phone in the house

772
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:12,960
24/7

773
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:15,264
And so the relay is sort of that

774
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,056
A match between

775
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:18,336
The services and

776
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:19,104
Information

777
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:19,872
Do you care about

778
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:22,432
Youth at Toronto Raptors

779
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:24,480
That's why we try to design for it

780
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:25,760
We don't spend a lot of

781
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:26,528
Time

782
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,064
You know imagining

783
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:29,600
Use case

784
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:30,624
You

785
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,648
China autumn

786
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:34,720
Relay For example like if you're setting up

787
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:36,768
You familiar with iRobot system

788
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:38,048
Automation

789
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:39,584
You wouldn't

790
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,376
Want to set up a robot

791
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:42,144
The relay

792
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:44,192
But

793
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:49,056
When it comes to looking at information passes lie the relay

794
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:49,824
Excel

795
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:50,848
And sales.

796
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:51,872
That doesn't use gas

797
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:52,640
Should we try to spend

798
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:53,664
The majority of our

799
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,688
Design timeline

800
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:55,712
Okay

801
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:58,784
And speaking of your robots because this is something that

802
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,344
When Apple just introduced the home

803
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,160
App for iOS 10 I saw this and I was

804
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:08,256
I was frankly a little bit disappointed cuz I was hoping they would push

805
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:11,584
Kind of the men Ewing and Concepts forward

806
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:12,608
In

807
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:14,656
Kind of the way we've been managing

808
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:16,192
Multiple devices in our house

809
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:18,496
And I don't feel like they really did

810
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:20,544
So I'm curious like

811
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,824
Do you see us

812
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:26,432
Programming are smart homes in the not-too-distant future

813
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:28,992
Or could it be something like as simple is

814
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:32,832
Telling something what to do so maybe doing it verbally or maybe it's

815
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:36,160
You know generated by Machine learning and you can say

816
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:37,952
You can offer me like an option

817
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:40,256
And the app like Stacy I see that

818
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:46,144
You tend to do this at this time or whatever this happens you also do this would you like me to set up a robot

819
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,472
Yeah you are alluding to some subjects that are

820
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:50,496
You know very near

821
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:51,264
Jerry West

822
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,032
We love

823
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:52,800
Robots

824
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:55,360
The ability to set up complex automation

825
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:57,408
And we think it's really powerful

826
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:58,688
For a certain type

827
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:00,992
And that type of user is

828
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:04,064
Savvy and husband you know

829
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,088
Selling these devices

830
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:06,368
Destroy a long time

831
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:07,904
It's really familiar with what they

832
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,696
They can do it makes a lot of sense for that

833
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:14,560
The dryer user that is maybe just getting their first couple smart bulbs

834
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:17,888
You know what they're trying to accomplish

835
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:19,168
Specific use case

836
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:20,192
Navy

837
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:20,960
To determine

838
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:24,032
Burglars with having lights come on at various times

839
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,056
Things like that

840
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:26,336
That's her to set up

841
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:27,104
You know

842
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:29,664
The things that maybe we Azhar

843
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:31,968
Like enjoy doing

844
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,248
Give me some kind of TV

845
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,272
Incel

846
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:39,904
You know we are we are looking at ways that we can make that easier through machine learning and

847
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:40,928
We

848
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:42,976
Are going to have a string of I think

849
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:46,560
Really interesting product news throughout the year this year and

850
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:49,376
And savenia stay tuned for announcements

851
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:51,168
Anada in that area

852
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,448
Okay and

853
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:56,800
What will be talked after kind of after the bankruptcy of Corky

854
00:35:57,312 --> 00:36:00,128
You had said that the smart home was taking

855
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:02,944
How to buy Life twists and turns the gist of it was that

856
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:07,552
The pause between some of the products that you guys have planned when you were part of quirky

857
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:08,576
End

858
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:10,368
Ability to take that time

859
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:12,416
After the bankruptcy

860
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:15,744
To kind of get things right was really welcome

861
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,792
Because the industry was changing so much

862
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:20,608
Can you talk to me a little bit about

863
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:24,448
What you've seen change and maybe would surprise you

864
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:31,104
Sure I mean I think that your article in your newsletter touchdown this little bit night

865
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:31,872
I really

866
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:35,712
Agree with the fact I think that this year is going to be

867
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:37,760
A year of calling to ascertain

868
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:38,528
Next time

869
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:39,552
I think that

870
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:41,856
The changes that are going to happen or that

871
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:43,904
People are

872
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:44,928
Going to be the last

873
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:45,952
Interested

874
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:48,000
Enteritis

875
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:49,536
Start new

876
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:51,840
Forms and ecosystems

877
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:53,888
And more interested in

878
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:57,728
And taking advantage of the good mature platforms and ecosystems

879
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:59,520
Is that are out there right now

880
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:02,336
So I think that this will be the year when

881
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:07,968
When people start concentrating more on those and devices that work with with the sir great platforms

882
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:08,992
Better out there

883
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:12,064
And I think that's a good thing for us and I think I work

884
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:14,880
Racine that reflect in the in the

885
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:16,416
Popularity the platform

886
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:18,208
Okay

887
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:22,048
Let's think about your platform because in talking to

888
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:28,704
Some other people they look at the platform is having control of the operating system

889
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:31,264
Apple with homekit

890
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,032
Whatever they do

891
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:32,800
Google home

892
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:35,616
And then the other platform people seem to be keen on Earth

893
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:37,664
It's jumping out of them it is

894
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:39,456
The Amazon Echo

895
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:43,808
You work with some of these things right

896
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:46,624
But you're also trying to be an OS for the home

897
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,160
Which Maybe

898
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:50,720
And I kind of tend to think the smartphone

899
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:53,024
Is a great sensor but I don't know if I want

900
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:55,072
My Holmes OS to live there

901
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:56,352
So I'm curious

902
00:37:56,864 --> 00:38:00,192
Where do you place yourself when you're thinking about competitors

903
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:01,984
Sure

904
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:02,752
I mean

905
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:04,288
I try to not think of

906
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:05,312
Like anyone

907
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:06,592
Editor like

908
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:07,616
I try to think

909
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:09,664
Is that you know

910
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,456
About how we can work together first

911
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:12,992
Because

912
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,784
At the end of the day

913
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:15,552
It's like

914
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:18,112
Consumers expect and what

915
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,416
The best experiences is

916
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:21,184
If

917
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,976
Thing if you can have choice

918
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:23,744
In what year

919
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:25,792
You know and so

920
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:28,352
If there is a way to work together with someone else

921
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:29,376
You don't we will

922
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:32,192
We are a neutral party

923
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:33,984
Next time we're not trying to

924
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,520
To compete with our

925
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:37,824
Core Partners Julianna Grace you know

926
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,360
I feel like you mentioned

927
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:40,896
Google like we're not trying to

928
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:44,480
We are just trying to add a layer of functionality

929
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:46,016
That you know

930
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:47,296
Consumers

931
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,368
Fun really engaging get a lot of use out of

932
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:51,904
Whereas

933
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:52,672
I think

934
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:55,744
A lot of other companies that are are

935
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:57,280
To make platform

936
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:58,560
How many block forms

937
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,352
Du Hast

938
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:04,192
Teacher conflicts that that limit them from offering the same choices

939
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:07,520
That's where we think we have a big advantage

940
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:10,080
And what about the business model

941
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:13,152
Is your business model going to stay with

942
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:14,176
Selling like

943
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:15,456
The relay in the

944
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:16,224
The hug

945
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:18,272
Or do you see

946
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:19,808
Something else evolving

947
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:23,904
Siri actually is quite a bit of evolution going on right now

948
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:27,232
Certainly selling Hardware is

949
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:29,024
Straightforward business

950
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:31,584
Something will continue to do

951
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:32,608
But

952
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:37,472
We also work with companies to help them bring connected products to Market

953
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:41,824
You know a lot of companies are entering this is the first time we've got a lot of experience and

954
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,640
You know that's where our boner Flex

955
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:46,688
Is a really really great

956
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:47,968
Parent company

957
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:48,736
Because

958
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:49,760
They are

959
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:54,368
One of the best if not the best company in the world that manufacturing connected products

960
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,160
And so

961
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:56,928
You know we're trying

962
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:00,256
Leverage. To offer companies

963
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:02,048
Is that are in the space s you know

964
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:03,584
Solutions to

965
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,120
Getting products to the market

966
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:05,888
Quickly

967
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:12,288
And getting products to the market with a built-in ecosystem that already has a big footprint and a lot of support for

968
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:13,568
Connect another device

969
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:18,176
But beyond that you know we do have other

970
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:21,760
Other ideas as far as business modeling and

971
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:23,552
Treatise dialysis

972
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:26,112
What we we spent a lot of hard work

973
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:27,136
End time

974
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:29,184
Making is hard as a platform ghost

975
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:35,072
And you know that will be something that will probably touch on in our our product updates lettering

976
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:36,352
Linear

977
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:37,632
And for the people

978
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:39,936
The people at home who have awake system

979
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:43,776
Can you share just a couple of your favorite robots or

980
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:45,568
Anna favorite things

981
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:46,592
Do you like yes

982
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:47,616
Yes let me tell you

983
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:51,712
Yeah so what am I adding my favorite

984
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:53,248
Is

985
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:56,320
If the smoke detector goes off turn on all the lights

986
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:59,648
Unintuitive things not like what you

987
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:00,928
Really think of when you start

988
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:04,000
Connecting something makes so much sense I really love that one

989
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:05,280
Can help people

990
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:06,560
Safer in it

991
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:07,840
It's not a straightforward

992
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:11,680
Another one that I really like is

993
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:12,704
Is the ability to

994
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,472
Shoe

995
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:16,032
Enable or disable sensors

996
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:16,800
With the

997
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:17,568
Canary

998
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,128
We can actually trigger

999
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,944
With dictionary mode changes

1000
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,528
We can turn on and off robots right so

1001
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:28,832
The way that I have mine set up at home

1002
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:30,368
Is that a sensor

1003
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,392
My doors

1004
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:33,696
When I leave the house

1005
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:34,976
Canary goes

1006
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:36,768
You know cuz armed

1007
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:41,632
It's basically enables the robot that turns on notifications for this sense

1008
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:43,680
So then get the door open

1009
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:45,216
You know well

1010
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:46,240
I'm not home

1011
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:48,032
Then I'll get a notification

1012
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:50,080
But then when I come home then you can I get back

1013
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:52,640
Privacy mode it turns off that robot

1014
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:56,735
And so that you know if I walk out on my patio on Holland

1015
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:58,015
Annoyed

1016
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:59,295
Vacations coming

1017
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:00,575
Jenna from the sensors

1018
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:04,415
Got it in the canary also send you a notification if that door open

1019
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:06,463
Well the canary

1020
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:07,487
It doesn't phase

1021
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:09,023
My front door actually face

1022
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:11,583
Okay

1023
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:14,655
I seasoned it settings on the backyard but you know

1024
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:15,935
I don't really like having

1025
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:19,519
I am so with you

1026
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:23,103
That's a good one for people who don't like hammers in the all right

1027
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:24,639
I like these ideas

1028
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:27,199
And I think I'll have to go pick up some relays

1029
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,503
Could you do the intercom

1030
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:33,343
Like install a relay in someone else's house or do they have to be on the same network

1031
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:35,391
You absolutely can

1032
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:39,231
If you wanted to have a little like tin can with the string you know between

1033
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:42,815
Two houses you could absolutely install a relay NH

1034
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:45,375
I am taking it might be fine for like

1035
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:46,911
A grandparent or something

1036
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:48,447
Be like Bob

1037
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:49,471
Mom

1038
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:52,287
Yeah I'm sure she loves that

1039
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:53,823
Yes yes

1040
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:54,847
Totally would not

1041
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:58,943
Why did you bring this to my house

1042
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:00,991
But it'll kind of a fun

1043
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:05,343
Alright thanks so much for coming this week
