00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:29,696
I am a bit lighting obsessed

10
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:30,464
He is

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,560
That's okay I am too so for all of you guys were like Stacy stop talking about lighting

12
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:35,840
This may not be your show

13
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:41,216
We do have an awesome show for you we're going to talk about the Bricker but

14
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:43,520
Ikeyless lights again

15
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:46,080
Because we found some information about their security

16
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:48,128
A bit of Microsoft Sopris project

17
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,408
A new hub

18
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:50,432
From Sbarro

19
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:51,968
New mesh Network

20
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:52,992
From tp-link

21
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:55,808
Some other odds and ends of news and

22
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:56,832
Matinee

23
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:58,624
And how to use it to change

24
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,392
Your lighting

25
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:02,464
I also have an install to talk about

26
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:04,000
We did the Google

27
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:07,584
The Google home vs Echo swap in my house and I'll tell you how that went

28
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:11,424
Richard has a smart blinds installation

29
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:14,496
You guys are going to want to hear cuz I know you love this stuff

30
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:16,800
Our Guest this week

31
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:19,360
Kevin Ashton

32
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:23,968
Who coined the phrase internet of things and he tells us all about that

33
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:25,248
And what he thinks about it today

34
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:26,528
Celtics

35
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:29,600
Let's go to a quick message from our sponsor

36
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:36,000
Got a great idea for an iot business Samsung artik interoperable in

37
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:42,400
Secure iot platform it lets you focus on building your business rather than worrying about technology

38
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:48,800
Integrated Hardware cloud and services interoperability with other device service cloud and systems

39
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:55,200
Charity Samsung artik coyote gets down to business for more information visit Arctic

40
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:59,040
Dot IO and that's a r t i k.

41
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:03,136
Alright let's kick off this show

42
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,416
Let's talk about

43
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:06,208
Bricked devices

44
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,512
Because we actually had

45
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:11,584
A couple weeks ago we talked about

46
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,864
Somebody had developed

47
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:15,680
A virus basically that went around shutting off

48
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:18,496
Active devices this was theoretical at the time

49
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,568
Thanks to people

50
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:24,640
It's called

51
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:26,432
What is this is

52
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:30,016
It goes through and it finds things that have the Mirai botnet in them

53
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,808
Or are accessible

54
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,344
By the Mirai botnet

55
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,136
Because it's got a hard-coded password and

56
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:37,696
Deportes breaks the device

57
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:42,048
Which is crummy if you own this device and suddenly it's

58
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:44,608
Not working but it's also kind of like

59
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:47,936
Vigilante justice on the internet of things trying to keep the bride button

60
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:48,704
Shutdown

61
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,984
I don't know

62
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,264
How do you spell

63
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:58,432
Yeah this is really really weird and the thing that's interesting here is am I correct in understanding that this was.

64
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:00,736
Discovered basically by setting up

65
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,016
A Honeypot

66
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,808
To try and find stuff like this

67
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:04,576
What is

68
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,232
I think it's nice in the sense that

69
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:14,816
It's going to really Force manufacturers

70
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:15,584
2

71
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,120
Is there consumers

72
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:23,520
What the heck is happening here and they're going to call their company in the company's going to be like oh crap we should have spent money on security

73
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:27,104
But I got to admit if my router

74
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:35,552
Well right and so that's what I'm really wondering about is as consumer and you know that's what I focus mostly on

75
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:36,576
My show

76
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:38,368
If I'm a consumer and I have

77
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:40,416
How does this impact me

78
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:43,488
Is it just that my router shut down

79
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:44,256
What is

80
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:48,864
My indicator that I have this problem and I need to do something about it

81
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,656
It breaks your device so

82
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:52,192
You will know because your device will

83
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:55,008
It flushes all iptables

84
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:56,544
And all the network

85
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,360
And then it adds its own rule to drop all out

86
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,688
It tries to wipe all the codons

87
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:06,272
So that's a pretty like there's not really

88
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,040
Way to come back

89
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:11,904
Do we know what devices are impacted by this

90
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:16,000
It is devices that are attractive to the Mirai botnet so they're running Linux

91
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:19,839
Those that are running the BusyBox toolkit

92
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:20,863
And it

93
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:24,959
Apparently according to the register has a particular affinity for Ubiquiti Networks

94
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:29,311
Yeah I saw that cuz I run Ubiquiti

95
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:31,871
Here's the solution guy so to block the attack

96
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:33,151
You have to disable telnet

97
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:35,199
Which many people tell you to do

98
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:35,967
You already

99
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:38,783
Change the devices factory set

100
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:41,343
Also something that you should be doing already

101
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:42,879
And

102
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:47,999
The company that discovered this radwear also recommends using intrusion prevention systems to lock down device

103
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,535
Coincidentally

104
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:50,559
Pappadeaux's

105
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:53,375
I will say though if you are running

106
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:56,703
Infected device or device it's likely to be affected

107
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:02,591
You should be doing taking those steps anyway because it's highly likely that it will get infected by the ride.

108
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,127
Anyhow so

109
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,407
Yeah yeah

110
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,199
Messi

111
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,735
Messi Messi

112
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:11,551
But we have good security News 2

113
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,855
We do two weeks ago

114
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,391
For the two weeks or last week

115
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:20,511
I think was the last week you guys were talking about the Ikea Troy tree lighting

116
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,071
Exactly is is that how you say it

117
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,863
Cuz I've been

118
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,399
You have just

119
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,423
Proven your worth

120
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:29,215
Right there

121
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:32,031
So we wondered

122
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:35,103
Gosh is Ikea doing this right or they just opening up a giant

123
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:35,871
Security hole ever

124
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,687
An answer is

125
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,223
I can't do this right

126
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,599
Yeah so it looks like from some independent research

127
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,391
Into the platform

128
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:49,183
Some really in-depth

129
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:49,951
Analysis

130
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:53,023
Diarias in

131
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,559
The Hub itself

132
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:56,863
And in the communications

133
00:05:57,119 --> 00:06:03,263
And the bottom line here was that says it seems like one

134
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,543
One of the most

135
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,847
Secure iot style devices

136
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,895
I've looked at

137
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:09,919
A quote

138
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:10,687
Doubt

139
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,735
He does mention one

140
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,015
Potential problem

141
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,551
And that's that

142
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:19,647
At the time of initiation the hub goes out and

143
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:21,951
Things at Ikea server and says hey

144
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:24,767
Let me know if there are any updates I should get

145
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:27,583
And it gets the response back in

146
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:31,167
Clear http which is probably not a good thing

147
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,959
And that's something that they could

148
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:35,263
Clearly fix at some point in time

149
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:39,615
But he also indicated that really the only way of hacking this thing

150
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:41,919
Is if you had physical access to it

151
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:44,991
Right in the reason is because there's no remote

152
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:45,759
DIYs

153
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,295
Which also means

154
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,599
It looks like this might not work with other device

155
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,391
Yeah

156
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,439
That's the downside so it's

157
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,463
Highly secure

158
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,487
In part because

159
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,511
It doesn't talk to any

160
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,815
Which is a good way to say

161
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:04,959
It is a medium hope I hope they're able to get beyond that at some point

162
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:07,519
Because I'm very excited about this platform

163
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:09,823
We talked about this a little bit on

164
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:12,895
Our next episode of home on and I've been

165
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:16,223
Eagerly awaiting what Ikea is going to be doing because

166
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:22,879
Stacy I think Ikea has the recipe to sell this stuff right in retail they know how to do it

167
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:25,695
Experiential storytelling in retail

168
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:28,511
I totally agree with you it actually

169
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:32,095
I've been in touch with Ikea and they should be on the show Suits

170
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,119
We can find out

171
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:33,887
A lot more

172
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,191
Yay

173
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,215
Security

174
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:41,055
This is going to get a little deep you guys but you should know about it because

175
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:41,823
Security is

176
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,127
Animal

177
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,199
Microsoft introduced last week

178
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:52,831
A project called project Sopris in what does is basically a way to bring security

179
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:57,183
Two microcontrollers which are the tiny little computers that run a lot of

180
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,207
You're connected to

181
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,487
Spices so

182
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:02,047
Tiny kind of dumb processors are

183
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:02,815
What these are

184
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:03,583
And

185
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,887
There's a million different flavors

186
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,423
It's not like the Intel

187
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,471
Kind of world where there's one flavor

188
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:11,775
There's pee more now

189
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:14,847
But what they done is it put out this research paper

190
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:18,431
And they basically came up with seven concepts for security

191
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,967
And put it on

192
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:23,039
Afford a development boards that they're giving to hackers

193
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:25,599
Later this month in May

194
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,135
So they're getting hackers in May

195
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:29,439
Try to get them to test it and play with it

196
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,743
So here are the seven things

197
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,535
That you need to have

198
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,559
In Microsoft

199
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,839
Worldview-2

200
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:37,119
Make a secure system

201
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:39,679
You have to have a hardware-based Reta Trust

202
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,471
Small trusted computing

203
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:44,287
We're stuck in a loop

204
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,591
Do you have to have defense in depth

205
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:50,687
Basically that means is the device still protected if the security of one layer

206
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,455
Device

207
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,223
Is breached

208
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,247
Clark

209
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,039
Compartmentalization

210
00:08:55,551 --> 00:09:01,439
And so that means does a failure and one component at the device require a reboot of the entire device to return to operation

211
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:02,463
They don't want that

212
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:04,767
Certificate-based Authentication

213
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:05,535
That's what

214
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:10,399
Renewable security which means the devices software can be updated automatically

215
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,191
And then failure report

216
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:14,751
Does the device report failures to its

217
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:17,567
I'm actually surprised when

218
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,871
I sometimes test devices and there's no failure

219
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,919
Reporting and I'm like really

220
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,711
Music

221
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:25,503
So these are the seven properties

222
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:31,391
I look at this and I actually talked to his some security researchers and some people in the industry

223
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:34,719
And they look at this actually this is a really good frame

224
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:37,023
My concern is

225
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,607
That Microsoft is pulling all of this in

226
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:41,887
And there

227
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:44,703
Already chip vendors who are trying to

228
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,543
Create this type of platform or some elements of this platform

229
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,079
On

230
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:51,359
Their chips so

231
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:53,663
Nxp has sicurella

232
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:55,455
Which is a designer

233
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:56,991
Facturar

234
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:59,551
What is that mean for those guys is basically what

235
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,599
Microsoft's kind of

236
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:03,391
Perspective seems to be

237
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,487
Or basic

238
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:17,215
Well I mean this is what Microsoft does best right they come out with some really great

239
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:19,007
Approaches and

240
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,287
Frameworks

241
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:22,079
And they're usually late to the game

242
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:27,967
Awesome experience

243
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,015
Right exactly

244
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,295
So

245
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:33,087
Who knows who knows if

246
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:36,671
This is going to get adopted I mean I'm wondering if Microsoft is doing this

247
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,695
In some way

248
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:41,279
As a way of saying look this is what we're going to expect

249
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:43,583
Run

250
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,119
Windows for iot

251
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,911
On NE

252
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:47,679
Device

253
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:49,215
We expect this

254
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,751
Level of security

255
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:53,567
And maybe that's where they're going to cut

256
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,847
Draw the line

257
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:57,407
I don't know how they would do that exactly

258
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:02,015
Is it could do that programmatically or if it would have to be something that they in a case-by-case basis

259
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:05,343
It's interesting

260
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:11,743
Frank Lee work companies need to be thinking about this yes I'm super glad it looks like the elements

261
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,511
Exactly right

262
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:19,167
And it feels like because of its a lot of the industrial internet so the Enterprise players and Industrial internet come

263
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,959
Please turn to Microsoft azure

264
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:22,495
Another cloud

265
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:23,263
Compute

266
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,055
And storage for their iot stuff

267
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,847
And they do it because they Trust

268
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,383
Microsoft to actually

269
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,175
Provide slang

270
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,479
Their it departments are like yeah

271
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,015
Microsoft

272
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:34,783
So

273
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,319
That level having

274
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:38,623
Having influence at Fortune 500

275
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,903
Tundra companies

276
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,951
Feels like this could be a good way

277
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:46,303
Get adopted maybe not in the smart home but definitely across connected devices

278
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:47,327
Enterprise

279
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,351
So

280
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,631
We'll see

281
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,167
All right

282
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,519
I know

283
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,055
A new hub.

284
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,335
You know what this is

285
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:01,919
This doesn't seem too though so fibaro has been talkin

286
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,199
For quite a long time now

287
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,223
About

288
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:06,527
Version of there

289
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,551
Home Center

290
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,599
Sbarro is a company that

291
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,647
Primarily does business in

292
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:12,927
European countries

293
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:15,487
And they are now bringing

294
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,023
A light version of

295
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,327
They're Z-Wave based hub

296
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,119
The US

297
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:25,471
And this is good news this is a really good product

298
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,239
From what I've

299
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,007
Racine

300
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,031
It has

301
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,055
Significant

302
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:31,871
Capabilities very granular

303
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:34,943
Programming capabilities energy monitoring

304
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:36,223
All the good stuff

305
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:39,295
That you want in a high-end helping this is a high-end

306
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:42,879
This is a $279 product this is not

307
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:47,487
Something that you're going to buy at your Lowe's for $60

308
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,863
There you go

309
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:53,887
There you go

310
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,423
And the other thing that

311
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,447
I love about

312
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,215
Sbarro

313
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:00,799
And I think you know we've talked about this I think tomorrow has

314
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:01,823
Some of the best

315
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:07,455
Physical industrial design for products out there if you're looking for products that are going to look cool and home

316
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:10,527
Dyson small and 9

317
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,295
Trusova

318
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:14,111
Particularly for security type products

319
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:16,927
They have a really good selection

320
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,719
Products available

321
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:23,839
And I'm excited to see this finally happening they say they're shipping

322
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,423
It's also going to be compatible

323
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,959
With systems like

324
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:31,519
Sonos and Logitech

325
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:36,639
Russound and Phillips restaurant surprised about you don't see a lot of folks integrating with that that's

326
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,175
A bit higher in but

327
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,455
Remember this

328
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,991
Origins of

329
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,271
Sbarro's Friday

330
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:44,319
In many cases are in

331
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,855
Irn installations

332
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:49,951
And they're planning Amazon Echo integration to so good stuff

333
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:52,767
Yeah oh and you can control 230 devices

334
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,047
Which is

335
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:59,167
That is a lot actually and I don't think even I have

336
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,959
230 devices

337
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:06,847
Now my echo 230 devices but that's cuz it counts everything multiple times for some reason

338
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:08,639
You may have multiple

339
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,943
Every time I read

340
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:11,711
Discover things

341
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:18,111
Discovery

342
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:19,647
So

343
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,439
That is

344
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:24,255
Quickfundusa

345
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,047
There's a new mesh router

346
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,071
From tp-link

347
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,375
It is The Deco M5

348
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,143
Mesh router

349
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,727
What are we calling these are these the new mesh router of the week

350
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,311
I don't know

351
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:40,383
We don't have a name but we do talk about him a lot so

352
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,455
The router will settle for $299

353
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:47,295
And I supposed to cover between 2400 and 4500 square feet

354
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:49,087
Individual units are going to be

355
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:50,623
129

356
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:52,159
So that's cheaper than Eero

357
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,695
It is

358
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:55,999
Right in line with Google Wi-Fi and

359
00:14:57,023 --> 00:15:03,167
And actually I have not tried this to have you tried the velop system from Linksys cuz that is there mesh wife

360
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,727
They have I have not

361
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,007
But now they have

362
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,567
Yeah no I have not

363
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:16,223
And yeah I'm glad to see companies get into this Mike Wolfe and I were talking about a year-and-a-half ago about how it's

364
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:20,575
Wi-Fi routers were just kind of becoming commoditized

365
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:22,367
Really glad to see companies

366
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,903
Coming out with

367
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,183
Innovative

368
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:27,999
New Solutions in adopting this newer

369
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:30,559
Mesh technology since I adopted mesh

370
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:31,583
In my home

371
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,143
Granted I mentioned I'm using Ubiquiti

372
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,727
So it's a bit of a more industrial solution

373
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:40,799
I don't have the problems that I used to have

374
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,335
These things

375
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:44,639
Do work these things do solve

376
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:46,943
The coverage issues that most folks

377
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,735
Particularly with iot devices

378
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:51,039
Around the fringes of their home

379
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:52,319
Typically complain about

380
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:58,975
Industrial designer this tp-link is a little weird I don't know if you can see the picture Richard bit

381
00:15:59,487 --> 00:15:59,999
It's beastly

382
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:02,303
Round circle pucks but then they've got like this

383
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,351
Triangle sticking out

384
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,119
Kind of

385
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,399
Of the side looks like

386
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:08,191
And you're like half

387
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:08,959
Pulling out

388
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:09,983
Piece of the pie

389
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:14,335
Is she had her you know I was joking on Twitter earlier this week that

390
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:20,991
I think it's a bit ridiculous that all of these products are designed as if you're going to put them out on your coffee table or something

391
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:26,879
In all likelihood this is going to be shoved in a corner but every company is trying to come up with

392
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:28,415
Something that looks

393
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:33,023
Unique and special and makes it something that you might want to put out for

394
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,303
Visibility

395
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,071
Of course

396
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:38,399
Any cords you have for power or

397
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:41,215
And ethernet backhaul on any of these things you're not really

398
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,239
Why do that

399
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:45,055
Here's my brilliant startup idea anyone can have this

400
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:47,359
Okay so Kleenex boxes

401
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:50,175
Have covers and if you're not a girl you may not know this

402
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:54,527
But they have these fancy covers that you can buy the stick over your Kleenex box

403
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:55,295
So

404
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,063
You don't have the app

405
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:57,855
What we need

406
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:58,623
Is that it

407
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:00,159
RF permeable

408
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:02,719
Netease 3D printed custom

409
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:03,999
Router cover

410
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:05,791
And that it could be pretty

411
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:11,679
All right I just don't want it to be knitted and have it look like a chicken or something like that I have

412
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,031
Okay

413
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,055
Ring added

414
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,615
An unlimited device plan because it

415
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,895
It has so many devices

416
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,943
Ring has been

417
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,015
Coming out with more and more products with cameras on them

418
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:29,343
Are intended to secure the perimeter of your home

419
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,135
And more cameras

420
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:33,439
Then the more you end up paying in

421
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,463
Video plans

422
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:36,511
To store and access

423
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,815
All of the videos that they're recording

424
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:39,839
So

425
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:44,959
At $3 a pop that can get pretty expensive if you have a bunch of these things around the house where

426
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:48,287
Expecting that there going to be coming out with the floodlight soon

427
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,359
That's also going to have a camera on it

428
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:54,687
So they've introduced a plan in advance

429
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:56,223
Of that product release

430
00:17:56,735 --> 00:18:00,575
That is a universal or unlimited cameras plan

431
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:02,367
Edis called ring protect

432
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,135
Four ring

433
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,927
For $10 a month

434
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,719
You can get

435
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:08,511
Any number of cameras

436
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:09,791
All in the same plan

437
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:12,863
And you can also pay $100 a year

438
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,399
If you want to pay that way

439
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:17,471
And if you have any more than three devices

440
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:18,495
Your

441
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:21,823
Definitely going to be saving some money I think this is a great thing

442
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:25,151
I'm expecting to get the ring

443
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:27,199
Flood light when it comes out

444
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:30,015
And so that's going to put me over the edge

445
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,551
I'm definitely going to be getting

446
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,087
Wow so

447
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:37,183
That is good news for ring because it means that hopefully people like you

448
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,207
Are buying

449
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:39,487
More than three devices

450
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:41,023
+ 3

451
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,815
So good for them

452
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,679
I don't know

453
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,959
I don't like the looks of it

454
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:50,239
It's a little bit

455
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,055
Chunky to put on the side of the house

456
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,079
Okay.

457
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,615
But so with a battery

458
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,151
How often do you recharge

459
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,943
So I

460
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,735
End up recharging about

461
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:03,295
Every two months I would say

462
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:07,647
Batteries get a workout

463
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:10,463
Because the one camera that I have is on

464
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:12,511
The side of the house where I let the dogs out

465
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,535
And

466
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,303
I'm doing that

467
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,583
Pretty regularly

468
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:19,423
So I'm pretty happy with that I don't really have a problem with

469
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:21,471
Pulling it down

470
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:25,567
The camera is made with a nice clip that it's easy to pull down

471
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:28,383
Just stick it on USB and charge it up for the day

472
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:29,919
Oh okay

473
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:31,967
So yeah I was I was wondering

474
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:34,783
I did the Arlo cameras in when I tested those

475
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:37,599
I put one like way up in a tree and I needed a

476
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:40,671
A ladder to get to it and then the battery died

477
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:42,207
This was dumb very dumb

478
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:47,583
Well see what you need there is a kid who likes

479
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,351
To climb trees

480
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,007
This is news that is tailor-made for you mister lighting

481
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:57,311
So we have some news about

482
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,847
The Amazon Echo

483
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,639
It has a new capability

484
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:03,455
And we have some new light bulbs that will work

485
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,479
With the Amazon Echo

486
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:07,295
So the new capabilities you can tell the echo

487
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:08,575
To turn

488
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:11,135
Tp-link +

489
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,671
Lifx light bulbs

490
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:14,719
To turn to a specific color

491
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:15,999
So yeah

492
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:18,303
Madame a turn bedroom lights

493
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,351
And that will happen

494
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:21,887
And that's really cool

495
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:22,911
Is Google home

496
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:25,215
That already so this kind of brings it to

497
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:26,495
Feature parity

498
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:28,543
And then

499
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:30,079
Tp-link Kasa

500
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,359
Are these new bulbs

501
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:34,687
I believe that the

502
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:35,967
Color changing

503
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:39,551
Bald is new but I'm not sure about the other ones I know that

504
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:41,087
They were showing

505
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,879
At CES this year

506
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:46,207
So I'm not sure if this is the introduction of those for real

507
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:47,999
Or if they already had them

508
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:51,327
Okay tp-link basically also said hey

509
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:53,631
You can change your colors

510
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:55,423
And are tunable white lights

511
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:56,447
With the echo

512
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:59,263
Which might be the same it is a skill

513
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:00,799
So

514
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:03,871
It's all part of that smart home skills so it's

515
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:05,663
Well it's a skill

516
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,479
It's built into the smart home section

517
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:09,247
Of

518
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:11,551
The app where you would configure this stuff

519
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:14,623
This is really good I'm glad to see that

520
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:19,744
Added color control this has been missing particularly if you have white tunable

521
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,024
You didn't have the ability

522
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,072
To address those and if you have

523
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,096
Then

524
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:27,168
You really care about the color of

525
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,448
Pure white light

526
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,032
So having this ability is going to be important

527
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:34,848
To you and then for the color tunables

528
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:36,640
You always had to revert to

529
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:38,432
Whatever app you

530
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,224
Control these things

531
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,528
If you wanted to change the color like if you had

532
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,320
Hue bulbs around so

533
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:46,112
This is a really good

534
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:47,648
New capability

535
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:54,048
I'm curious how this is getting rolled out though because I tried it and I think you said you tried it to and it isn't working

536
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:54,816
Fortis yet

537
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,608
It isn't

538
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,704
That doesn't mean I'm I'm sitting here looking in my Google Play Store to see

539
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:03,520
Have I updated the app recently so

540
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:04,288
I don't know

541
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:10,944
But I don't have it yet I will test it out for next week I'm excited about it because you know even things like make the lights warmer

542
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,480
Make the lights cooler

543
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:13,248
Will be

544
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:14,784
I think nice

545
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:16,320
Cuz I am absolutely

546
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:19,904
So

547
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:24,000
It's install time you guys were going to talk about our life in the Smart Home

548
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,024
Mine

549
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:28,352
Is last week I promised you that I would switch my Google home

550
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:29,632
And my echo

551
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:31,680
Downstairs in the living room of my house

552
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:32,704
Our kitchen is where

553
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,472
Elizabeth

554
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:34,240
It's open

555
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:35,264
And

556
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,312
I didn't actually do a full swap

557
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:40,128
Because the Google home is still a little iffy

558
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,712
So they're both kind of sitting there hanging out but we did use the Google home

559
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:45,248
And

560
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,552
Here's a couple things I can repay

561
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,624
When it comes to doing the smart home stuff

562
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,160
Google home is not quite

563
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:54,976
I had hooked it up to my Logitech Harmony

564
00:22:55,232 --> 00:23:00,096
That plus the wink integration gave me everything I needed to control all the devices that the echo

565
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:01,376
Can we talk to the echo

566
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,144
So it downstairs

567
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:05,216
Buy the Google home was fine with the harmony

568
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:07,776
To do a couple things

569
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:08,800
What's 1

570
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:12,128
It wouldn't reliably play music

571
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:13,152
I'm not sure

572
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:15,712
What was going on but we would ask it to play

573
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:17,248
Play Beyonce

574
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:19,040
And it was

575
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:21,088
Play Beyonce on Spotify

576
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:22,368
I'm sorry

577
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,648
There's been a problem

578
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,488
And I even asked at one point I was like what's the problem or what's wrong

579
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:28,256
It was like

580
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,792
Sometimes I'm a bit buggy

581
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:35,424
Like immediately after ask

582
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:38,496
Google home I would ask the Echo and the echo

583
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:40,800
And this is very intermittent

584
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:41,568
It just

585
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,872
You never knew when it was going to work or not work

586
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:44,640
Which is

587
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:48,736
Video killer for my daughter who loves listening to music

588
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:53,856
So that was one the other thing is probably just me but it's super weird

589
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:56,416
I have this crazy integration

590
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:57,696
With my

591
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:59,232
Lutron lights

592
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:01,536
They go to the Lutron hub

593
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:03,840
To SmartThings

594
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:05,632
And then through that too

595
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:06,656
Google home

596
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,728
I have two lights my dining room and my kitchen

597
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:13,312
Google home will turn on and off my dining room

598
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,896
But when I ask it to turn on or off my kitchen lights

599
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:17,920
It says it's doing it

600
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,200
And then nothing

601
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:21,760
Which I think is super weird

602
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,552
Yeah

603
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:24,320
No

604
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:26,368
You have these lights hooked up to

605
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,392
Other

606
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:29,952
System tray these are your Lutron light so

607
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:31,488
Are integrated with

608
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:32,768
D

609
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:34,560
Echo.and

610
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:35,328
With

611
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:37,120
What these Logitech as well

612
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:39,168
No they're not integrated with the Logitech

613
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:43,008
To homekit

614
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,032
Set up

615
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,056
Okay

616
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:45,824
The echo

617
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:46,592
Into smart thing

618
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:50,432
And are you able to control those lights okay from

619
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:51,456
Those systems

620
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:52,224
Yes

621
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,600
I did my favorite thing to do when my Integrations don't work

622
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:59,136
Which is pull everything out

623
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:01,184
So I pulled the

624
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:05,024
The Lutron to SmartThings integration I broke that and then I

625
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:05,792
Pull the

626
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:08,096
Google home and

627
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:09,376
The SmartThings integration

628
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:10,144
I broke that

629
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:13,216
Thinking maybe that would solve

630
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:14,752
But it hasn't solved it

631
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:15,520
So

632
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:17,568
If anyone has any ideas

633
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:19,360
Gilfre Richard

634
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:21,920
Yeah I mean something

635
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:23,712
That I would try is

636
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,576
To set them up temporarily so that they're all in the same room

637
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:30,368
And then see if

638
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:36,256
Your Google home is able to control them if you tell it to turn all the lights on in that room

639
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:39,328
Okay I'm going to do it

640
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:40,608
And that actually brings me

641
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,888
To another thing

642
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:42,912
The frustrated me about

643
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:43,680
Google home

644
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:45,728
When you put it in like lights and stuff

645
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:48,032
It asks you what room you want them

646
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:50,848
And so I put it in the appropriate room

647
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:51,616
Psychiatry

648
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:54,432
My various my for living room lights are all in the living

649
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:55,456
But

650
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,992
I want to be able to say

651
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:59,552
Haji turn off downstairs

652
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,576
It right now

653
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:01,600
I can't actually

654
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:03,392
I can't group the grouping

655
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:04,928
Into another group

656
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:05,696
So

657
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:07,488
In the Echo you can actually

658
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,536
Sayo I want to create a living room

659
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:10,560
Setting

660
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:12,608
And then I want to also keep

661
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,168
These lights in also it downstairs setting

662
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:17,728
And you can do that but in Google home you can't have

663
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:18,752
One device at 2

664
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:19,520
Rims

665
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:21,056
Yeah that's

666
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:25,152
Seems like it's something that they're going to have to fix it was funny

667
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:27,968
The echo gives you the ability to

668
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:30,528
Group things anyway you want to

669
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:34,112
But doesn't have the ability to know

670
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:36,160
What room anything is in

671
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:38,208
And then Google home

672
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:42,816
Knows what room things are in but doesn't give you any other group incapability

673
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:45,376
Is there must be a happy medium somewhere

674
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:47,424
There will be I have total faith

675
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:48,448
So

676
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:50,240
My verdict so far is

677
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:53,568
Is the Google home can't live on its own right now downstairs

678
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:55,360
And it's awesome

679
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:57,408
For talking to for asking

680
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:58,432
Questions of

681
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:00,736
But it's still not quite there in the

682
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:05,856
This is terrible so Kevin was out sick today

683
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:08,416
I'm trying to convince Kevin that he needs a Google home

684
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:11,488
And he's not sold yet so I don't think this is going to make him

685
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:12,512
Rush out and buy one

686
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:16,096
Maybe not

687
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:17,632
So you have an integration

688
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:19,424
And it's actually a really good one

689
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,728
It's over not integration and installation

690
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:28,384
I'm really excited about this so I have been looking for a way to automate blinds

691
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:30,944
Blinds throughout the house

692
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:31,712
And

693
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:33,504
I have a Southern Exposure

694
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:34,528
4

695
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:36,064
Part of the home and

696
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,368
So I get quite a bit of

697
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,136
Sunlight

698
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:41,440
And I want to be able to block that out at

699
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:42,720
Times of the day

700
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:43,744
So

701
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,560
Most of the products that are out there are there

702
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:47,584
Very pricey

703
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:48,608
Or

704
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,632
Still

705
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,448
Crowdfunding

706
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:58,336
And when I was at CES I ran across this company called mysmartblinds

707
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:01,152
And mysmartblinds creates

708
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,944
A $99

709
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:07,552
That you can install in nearly any

710
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:09,088
2 in or

711
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:10,880
Wider blinds

712
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:11,904
Installation

713
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:13,696
In the top rail

714
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:20,096
And it comes with a bunch of adapters to fit it to different manufacturers in mine wasn't one of the listed manufacturers but it were

715
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:20,864
Worked anyway

716
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,704
Too much

717
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,472
Weider

718
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:28,544
Is that right blind slats or is that the headspace

719
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:31,616
Yeah that's the blind slat so if you buy a

720
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:33,152
2 inch blind that's a pretty

721
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:35,968
Typical wooden blind nowadays

722
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:38,528
It's not going to work with mini blinds

723
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:42,368
So if you have something that's like really really thin

724
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:48,768
But with the wider wood blinds or wider vinyl blinds metal blinds it'll work with those

725
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:50,048
And

726
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,096
You just installed at the top

727
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:52,864
Rail

728
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,400
Comes charged but

729
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:57,984
You could charge it again through USB if you wanted to

730
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:01,824
Charger supposed to last for a proxy

731
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,592
Smitley

732
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:05,920
Six months to a year I think they said so will

733
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:07,200
See how that goes

734
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:09,504
And all it does is eclipse blind

735
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:11,296
It's not trying to raise or lower

736
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:14,112
It's just flipping the blinds either open or closed

737
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:14,880
In

738
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:15,648
Quarter

739
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:16,416
Anchorman

740
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,280
Not all the way from clothes to open but close to Parkway open and then open

741
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:22,048
And then

742
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:24,352
Parkway open and then closed again the other way

743
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:31,520
And I am really impressed it took less than maybe 20-25 minutes to install the Kit

744
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:33,568
Chainsaw the blind

745
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:35,104
Hooked it up to the app

746
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,640
It works through Bluetooth

747
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:39,200
It works on

748
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,224
IOS

749
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,504
An Android

750
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,064
And having hooked to Bluetooth

751
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:44,832
On

752
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:45,856
One device

753
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:49,952
All my other devices were able to know and control it

754
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:50,976
So there is some

755
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:53,536
Cloud stuff going on there to make all that work

756
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:56,864
The only thing that I have a problem with

757
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:57,632
Right now

758
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:59,680
Is the because it's Bluetooth

759
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:01,216
The range is kind of limited

760
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:04,288
That's my beef against Bluetooth lights

761
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:08,640
I like I want to go downstairs and turn off the light

762
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:11,968
Junction is a smaller house

763
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:14,016
Yeah that

764
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,576
Yeah yeah well

765
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:17,344
Someday

766
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,368
Someday

767
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:20,416
Maybe we'll actually get Bluetooth

768
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:21,696
Toothbrush for reals

769
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:22,976
In the meantime

770
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,256
What you can do

771
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,792
Is you can set schedules

772
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:29,120
And it is also aware of where the sun would be

773
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:32,192
Where you're located at different times of the day

774
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:33,216
So you can

775
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:35,776
Basically say at a certain time of day but

776
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:39,104
Dependent based on what time of year it is and where I am

777
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,176
Then close the blinds and those schedules

778
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:44,224
Live locally on the device

779
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:49,600
So it will still work on its own without any sort of controller nearby which is a great thing

780
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:52,160
They also sell a

781
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,440
Just a little

782
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:55,488
Remote that is Bluetooth and

783
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:58,816
You can install that just like you would install a light switch

784
00:30:59,072 --> 00:30:59,584
They have

785
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,376
Solar charger

786
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:04,192
That you can install on the outside if you want to use that

787
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:06,240
I am really impressed

788
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:07,008
With

789
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:09,568
This kit how easy it is to use

790
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:10,592
And

791
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:14,688
I don't understand why I can't buy this in every single Lowe's

792
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:16,480
And Home Depot around

793
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:18,528
But you can get it on Amazon

794
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:22,112
Awesome and it's $99 in actually how wide

795
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:24,160
How does it deal with the with the

796
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:24,928
The Blind Side

797
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,232
It's just a thing you stick on the slats right

798
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:29,280
It's not like I'm 12

799
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:35,424
I mean if you stick it in the top rail you're basically putting this mechanism in the top rail

800
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:36,448
2

801
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:40,800
Turn the little mechanism inside that top rail

802
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:42,080
The adjuster

803
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:43,104
The

804
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,128
Slat angle

805
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,432
So you don't see this at all

806
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:47,712
End

807
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:48,992
The wave that

808
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:49,760
It works

809
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:50,528
Is

810
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,808
Then by

811
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:54,112
Turning the crank inside

812
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,392
Then

813
00:31:55,904 --> 00:32:02,048
Your blinds turn and it doesn't matter if you have 2 inch blinds or if you have 4 inch blinds if there is such a thing

814
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:04,096
Lake Ozark banks

815
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,448
Awesome

816
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:09,472
Well this is a good

817
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:14,336
Like the sounds like a good product I'm excited to thank you for sharing that will put a link in the show notes forever

818
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:21,504

Fingers crossed

823
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:33,536
Once again thank you Richard for stepping up

Talking about how that happened

827
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:44,032
And going forward

828
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:45,824
Why he's so optimistic

829
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:46,592

The secret history of creation invention and discovery

837
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,496
Which is a really good book

838
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:16,288
So hi Kevin how are you doing

839
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:18,336
Hi Stacy I'm good how are you

840
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:19,872
I am super great

841
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:22,432
So in case my editing skills don't work out as well

842
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:27,296
Kevin and I are in Austin where it is thunderstorming and we both have dogs that don't like thunder

843
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:29,088
So they stray

844
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:31,136
Whining / barking you here

845
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:32,416
If you hear it

846
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:34,976
All right

847
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:35,744
Canon

848
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,280
Let's kick off with

849
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:38,560
Creating the

850
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:41,888
Which is a big statement it's like inventing the internet

851
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:43,424
What did you really do

852
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:44,960
Well

853
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:47,520
1998

854
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:50,336
I was an assistant brand manager

855
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:52,128
Procter & Gamble with and

856
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:54,176
I just launched

857
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:55,456
The new range

858
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:57,760
Charles Kylie Cosmetics on makeup

859
00:33:58,016 --> 00:34:02,368
This was this was kind of my suspect product launch in my career and ice packs

860
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:04,928
I defecate frustrated when I went

861
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:08,512
My local grocery store to get my weekly groceries

862
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:09,280
And

863
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,304
Noticed

864
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,608
My most popular products with no.

865
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:13,632
Michelle

866
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:15,424
You hear a lot of fantasy

867
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,216
He talked about marketing

868
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:20,544
The most basic thing is if people can't buy your product

869
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,568
It's about trying to sell

870
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:23,616
I started a

871
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:30,784
It was

872
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,576
You're horribly out of stock

873
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:37,440
Protect me the most was

874
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:38,720
People this was in

875
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:40,768
Did you say 1996 or 99

876
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:42,304
898

877
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:47,936
So this was in 1998 and so people understand this is before smartphones

878
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:48,960
Etnyre

879
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:49,984
Pause Spotify

880
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:51,008
Yes

881
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:57,408
It's funny for those of us who are old enough to remember what life was like in 1998 it's kind of funny it's almost like

882
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:59,712
Black and white world

883
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:07,904
End of 1994 beginning of 1995 and

884
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,208
Most people have not heard of it until then

885
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:12,512
Yes I was still using a dial-up modem

886
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,560
And I have got my first

887
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:15,328
Email address

888
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:20,960
The way you access the internet

889
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:26,592
Computer

890
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:27,616
Dakota motor

891
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:31,712
But you're plugging joke

892
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:38,112
Computer plug that box into your phone line which are the required a splitter on the phone line

893
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:40,416
On your phone line

894
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,488
Your phone line was that busy to everybody else

895
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:47,328
If you had cool waiting you had a problem because the cool waiting

896
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:49,376
Guitar with mess up your internet connection

897
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:52,960
You would get online and what could you do online

898
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:54,496
A lot of what you could do was

899
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:58,336
Bulletin board

900
00:35:58,848 --> 00:35:59,360
Your wife

901
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:00,896
2 minutes for a picture to

902
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:04,480
Wireless internet that was years away

903
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:06,528
Really want the internet

904
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:08,320
Like in the

905
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:10,368
Mid-to-late 1990s

906
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,160
Say yes with that context

907
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:13,696
That is actually relevant

908
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:17,280
Because the other Solutions this out-of-stock problem turned out

909
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:18,304
2B information

910
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,376
The really big thing but I should have discovered

911
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:22,912
That was not the only person

912
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:24,704
Was that

913
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,264
Are computers needed to start Gathering date

914
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,128
Is that all the information

915
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:36,224
It was human and two data are ugly

916
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,040
Until really I mean I guess

917
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:42,112
Nike rally 1990

918
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:43,904
You started to see the beginning of

919
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,720
Automatic data capture

920
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:49,024
The UPC barcode

921
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:51,328
Is the most visible example

922
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,144
Of a technology that was trying to

923
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:55,680
Start

924
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:56,448
Tonight

925
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:57,984
How date was entered into

926
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:58,752
Chicken Tortas

927
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:01,312
It's interesting to Crothers because

928
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:06,176
For a lot of people who use computers in the 20th century so that we people who

929
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:08,736
Probably in the forties or older

930
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:12,576
Now the idea of human in today Taurus is so

931
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:14,624
So much the natural paradigm

932
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:15,648
Computing

933
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:16,928
But it doesn't seem

934
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:17,952
Orange

935
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:19,744
Not sure if you were born in 20

936
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,024
First century

937
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,840
You're very very used to your computer gathering at 7 a.m.

938
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:24,608
Pencilmation

939
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:26,400
But the one I realized was looking

940
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:27,680
Out-of-stock problem

941
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:29,728
Was caused by the fact that

942
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:30,752
Stores

943
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:32,800
Had moved to more

944
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:34,848
Computerized Information Systems

945
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:39,456
Fidelity information they had was being hinted at the checkout counter and in a few

946
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:43,040
Stop code scanner in the warehouse a few other places and not men

947
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:48,928
Very detailed real-time like is a particular color of a particular lipstick

948
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,488
On the Shelf in a particular store

949
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,512
Was

950
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:58,400
Riddled with inaccuracies and errors to the point where it was kind of useless

951
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:01,216
The stores had sort of a big picture of you

952
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:04,032
But at that the grill detailed level

953
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:05,824
But she went into Data was

954
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:09,408
Was too limited to really be precise about what was happening

955
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:12,480
In a retail supply chain and then it turned out

956
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:17,088
Zygote into this mall through instead of 1998-1999

957
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:18,624
Any office supply chain

958
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:21,696
The way you live in this world a physical thing

959
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:27,584
Everybody was very enamored with what was called the information revolution in the 1990s

960
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:31,168
The information we really needed was about these these physical

961
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:37,056
Cata how can you order tonight

962
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:40,640
The capture of dates were about stoplight

963
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:44,224
Little lipsticks on shelves so I need any other thing in the world

964
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:45,760
At that time there was

965
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:49,600
Emerging technology called RFID radio-frequency

966
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:50,880
Z Nation

967
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:52,160
It started to look too

968
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:52,928
Tumi light

969
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,000
This Mason RFID technology

970
00:38:56,256 --> 00:39:00,096
Could potentially be embedded and sings like lipstick Packaging

971
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:01,888
As a way to know what the

972
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:03,168
Shell

973
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:05,728
But the other piece of artwork

974
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:07,520
Which was

975
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:09,056
Kind of a berry

976
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:11,104
Niche technology in

977
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:14,176
In the 1990s and the reason was

978
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:16,736
It was much more useful

979
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:19,296
If you could connect it to the network

980
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:24,672
Because now I'm the the lipstick is on the shell to keep it. Example

981
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:27,744
Meticulous

982
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:31,328
If that date was being shed on Broadway

983
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,608
And so

984
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:33,632
The emergency

985
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:37,728
Public internet at about the same time as the beginning

986
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:40,032
Specialization of RFID

987
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:41,312
Was I buried

988
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:45,408
Technology-wise because what we've LED Subs

989
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:50,016
What was

990
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:55,392
But not in great detail inside 1999

991
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:57,696
Was it connecting sensors

992
00:39:58,208 --> 00:39:59,488
Like RFID tags

993
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:01,280
To the internet

994
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:03,072
Gooseberry powder

995
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:04,352
Because suddenly

996
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:09,984
Gather information automatically in one place and know it in real time and some other place so you can

997
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,568
You can gather information all over the place and not real time in one place

998
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:16,640
This idea of connecting

999
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:18,432
Consensus to the internet

1000
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:19,456
Soda

1001
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:20,992
Machines to gather their own

1002
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:21,760
Information

1003
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:23,040
Was

1004
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:25,600
A really revolutionary paradigm

1005
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:26,624
Time shifting computer

1006
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:32,256
The only person he was thinking that way

1007
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:35,328
But I do remember it was very hard

1008
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:36,096
Define other

1009
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:36,864
The people

1010
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,144
It was thinking that way

1011
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:41,728
I say we get to 1999 and I have

1012
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:45,312
Crystallize this concept in my mind

1013
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:50,176
That Proctor needs to lead a kind of a worldwide effort

1014
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:54,272
Initially chips but then all the senses

1015
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:55,552
Insane

1016
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:56,832
Unconnect

1017
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:58,112
To the internet

1018
00:40:58,624 --> 00:40:59,904
So we can have this

1019
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:04,000
Incredible new visibility into what's going on in the world

1020
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:09,632
Senior manager

1021
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:11,936
Instead of 5 minutes or less

1022
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:12,704
Icicle

1023
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:14,240
Because

1024
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:16,032
You know you had people who were very busy

1025
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:18,848
Who didn't know if this is going to be interesting to them

1026
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:21,152
Most importantly

1027
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:22,432
Wooden on techno

1028
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:24,992
Release for guys who

1029
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:26,528
How to started

1030
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:30,368
Working at a time when Company still had things like typing pools

1031
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,160
So I guess my thought is

1032
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:34,464
Because this is

1033
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:39,584
Focused on things that the P&G guys while the technology is difficult

1034
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:41,888
It's probably much more accessible to be like

1035
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:46,240
Hey you could track all your things as opposed to you could put

1036
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:49,312
Stuff on this magical place called the World Wide Web

1037
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:50,848
It feels easier

1038
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,640
That's that's why I said

1039
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:54,431
This is happening

1040
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:56,735
I mean in 1998

1041
00:41:56,991 --> 00:42:00,319
John Chambers who was the CEO of Cisco

1042
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:06,719
Chambers guide run around all the CEOs in 100 CEOs with

1043
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:08,767
PowerPoint presentation

1044
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:11,327
Explaining to them what the internet

1045
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:13,631
What was and how important it was that

1046
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:15,935
It was kind of internet or. I was kind of

1047
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:16,959
Raised right

1048
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:21,311
50 60 something year old white guys

1049
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:23,359
Who

1050
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:29,247
I've been told in a very compelling way

1051
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:31,807
If I needed to get on board with the internet

1052
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:33,855
So the way to get

1053
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:37,183
Attention

1054
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:40,767
Was to find a way to join the wood Internet to the wood thing

1055
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:41,535
Bicycle

1056
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:46,911
To describe this idea of network connect connected

1057
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:49,471
And so the PowerPoint presentation

1058
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:55,103
At least through the company with this PowerPoint presentation

1059
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:57,919
I had to coat something like small packages

1060
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:01,247
Just kind of a horrible dead-on-arrival kind of name really

1061
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:04,063
To really grab the attention of these people who

1062
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:07,135
Newton's net worth important wunschel what it was

1063
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:07,903
Answered

1064
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:08,671
Tubidy

1065
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:13,023
Make my idea pitch my idea was an internet strategy

1066
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:16,095
RN about I think it was probably about April 9th

1067
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:19,167
99 change the presentation

1068
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:23,775
And I knew I wanted to use the word internet and I do I want to see use the word things

1069
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:28,639
So I wanted to get them both in the same type of the PowerPoint presentation and there was no

1070
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:33,247
Easy way to do that so I came up with this this phrase into that all stings

1071
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:37,855
As far as I'm aware nobody'd ever

1072
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:40,415
At least not loudly and publicly

1073
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:42,719
Out of Internet all's anything

1074
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:44,767
If all right there was just the internet

1075
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:48,351
Preposition that went with internet

1076
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:51,935
I'm here looking back I probably should have called it like the internet for things

1077
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:52,703
Saw something

1078
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:57,567
But whatever reason internet all stadiums had some kind of ring to it

1079
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:59,103
So that was a typo.

1080
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:04,735
Impatient and earned me to MIT to make it real at some point

1081
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:05,503
During the

1082
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:07,295
Sodalite to mm

1083
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:09,087
It became a common

1084
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:11,391
Common phrase people used

1085
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:12,671
So let me ask you

1086
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:14,975
Now that we are in 2017

1087
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:21,119
And I feel like the Resurgence in The Internet of Things has been around for

1088
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:22,655
11 2010

1089
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:25,727
Where we started seeing a cheap sensors

1090
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:26,751
Data everywhere

1091
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:30,335
WeChat cloud computing which made a big deal

1092
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:33,407
And so where it where do you think we are today

1093
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:35,711
You thought we would be or did you think we'd get here

1094
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:36,479
Here faster

1095
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:41,855
If you'd have asked me in like 1999 or 2002 predict 2017 I would have been

1096
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:43,647
Wrong about most things

1097
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:47,231
I think I was

1098
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:48,767
Network sensing

1099
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:52,095
An automatic data capture was going to be a huge thing

1100
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:53,375
Look at me trying

1101
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:59,775
Inspirational I'll give you some examples in a minute

1102
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:01,055
RFID tags with B

1103
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:02,335
Would be everywhere at right now

1104
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:04,383
And it's interesting why that no

1105
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:05,151
By the way

1106
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:06,687
And some of its structural

1107
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:07,455
It's like

1108
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:13,855
Gives you his day to you you haven't got because you haven't got that you don't necessarily know you know

1109
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:14,623
Need it

1110
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:16,159
So I could be buried

1111
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:18,719
Nicole is still kind of

1112
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:23,071
Working our way through the 20th century generation of senior managers

1113
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:24,351
These are people who

1114
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:27,423
Grasping the idea of

1115
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:28,447
Networks and

1116
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:30,239
Intuitively

1117
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:32,799
There's some kind of

1118
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:33,567
Fort imagination

1119
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:36,127
Has better see the value of something like

1120
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:40,223
They got to know where your stuff is all the time through a technology like RFID

1121
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:42,271
Add another thing this happened

1122
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:44,575
Pacification I mean one of the assumptions I made

1123
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:46,879
Through my whole time at MIT

1124
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:52,767
Was it you needed something like RFID because something like Vision Machine Vision

1125
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:54,303
Was never going to be good enough

1126
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:56,095
I'm actually happy

1127
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:57,375
Softer

1128
00:45:57,631 --> 00:46:00,447
1952 about 2000

1129
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:02,239
Machine Vision was horrible

1130
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:04,543
I was a really struggling field

1131
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:05,567
And then

1132
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:06,847
Episode of 2000

1133
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:08,895
2010 it suddenly

1134
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:10,687
Became very sophisticated

1135
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:15,039
And the reason why is interesting from the internal things perspective by the way

1136
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:17,343
But she got good suddenly

1137
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:19,391
Because of network sensing

1138
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:22,207
So digital cameras all senses

1139
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:25,279
And then uploading pictures to the internet is kind of

1140
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:27,583
Caprice of network products.

1141
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:28,863
I want happen

1142
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:29,631
Was

1143
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:31,423
The dataset

1144
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:34,751
That computer scientist had available to them

1145
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:36,799
Algorithms

1146
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:40,127
Dinner went from a few pictures to a few

1147
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:41,663
100 million pictures

1148
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:42,943
In a few years

1149
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:46,527
See I credited two gpus in

1150
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:49,343
Having more compute but you're right the training data

1151
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:55,231
A big deal

1152
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:57,023
Write machine learning

1153
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:58,047
Is

1154
00:46:58,303 --> 00:46:58,815
Patton Wrecker

1155
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:00,351
Basically

1156
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:03,423
You have a hypothesis about Wattpad

1157
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:07,007
She might want to recognize to Beartooth for example identify a face

1158
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:10,079
Hypothesis

1159
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:11,103
Some mathematics

1160
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:13,919
But you need to run

1161
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:20,575
Thousands or Millions

1162
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:25,695
But also your algorithm

1163
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:26,719
How can I prove itself

1164
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:29,535
Ride it can start to look for

1165
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:30,815
What oldies station

1166
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:34,143
The same face what do they have in common

1167
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:36,959
I'm one of the ones that I sold what I say

1168
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:39,263
Butt off my face what do they have

1169
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:40,543
What don't they have

1170
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:47,711
So

1171
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:48,735
Burger

1172
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:50,271
Unimportant

1173
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:51,807
Is generally

1174
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:54,879
Didn't happen until about

1175
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:57,183
2000-2001 is Seroquel

1176
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:03,071
A lot of things we do today without thinking about it like GPS and

1177
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:05,119
Smartphones in your pocket

1178
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:06,143
High definition

1179
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:09,727
Digital cameras in your pocket and you know broadband

1180
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:12,031
Downloading hi-def movies and things

1181
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:13,311
All those things

1182
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:14,847
Pretty much

1183
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:17,151
Declared to be impossible

1184
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:19,455
The early 2000

1185
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:20,735
That was some

1186
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:21,759
Supposed to be

1187
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:26,367
These physical limits or technological limits of man

1188
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:28,927
It would never be possible to

1189
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:30,719
To scream high definition

1190
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:31,999
Movie into Ohio

1191
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:36,607
Peter have a GPS sensor that work indoors in your pocket

1192
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:40,191
It was supposed to be all these reasons why those things wouldn't work

1193
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:41,471
Elderberry important

1194
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:46,335
Technology invented in the two in the early 2000s the transformed

1195
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:47,615
You could do with radio

1196
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:48,639
Radio sensing

1197
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:53,759
Which lead us to where we are today

1198
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:56,319
Any type of things which is like you

1199
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:57,343
Does GPS

1200
00:48:57,855 --> 00:48:58,367
So

1201
00:48:58,623 --> 00:49:00,415
There's a whole bunch of star

1202
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:03,487
And the GPS space in the digital photography space

1203
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:05,791
Health sensing from your phone

1204
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:07,583
A lot of things that were

1205
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:08,351
Maybe

1206
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:11,935
Should have creamed off by a few wild-eyed dreamers like

1207
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:12,959
Met-Ed

1208
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:15,007
Late 90s early 2000

1209
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:19,871
But we were told we were crazy and frankly we weren't being crazy enough

1210
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:20,895
That is awesome.

1211
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:23,967
There's stuff that you like

1212
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:25,247
And then it doesn't

1213
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:27,295
It happens way later than

1214
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:29,343
Absolutely

1215
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:30,367
It's awesome

1216
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:31,391
That's why I love it

1217
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:35,743
So let me ask you because I know you said you were working on a new book

1218
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:39,583
And you also told me that you are inherently an optimist

1219
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:43,423
Look at the internet

1220
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:45,727
As a tool that can be used for great evil

1221
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:46,751
Is he all kinds of

1222
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:48,799
Set a bad but I can also see like

1223
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:54,943
I talked to a company that it's a power company that once they connected their infrastructure they were able to turn off

1224
00:49:55,199 --> 00:50:00,063
The lights at beaches when sea turtles were nesting in so sea turtles are actually now

1225
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:06,463
They just have to dispatch Crews to actually physically turn off these lights

1226
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:10,303
Four seater sea turtles can come up to nest on the dark Beach and it's very sad

1227
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:14,399
I look at that and I'm like holy cow

1228
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:15,423
Cool things

1229
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:17,727
So you can do with this so what does the future hold

1230
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:19,007
Oh

1231
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:21,567
Spiffy wonderful

1232
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:24,895
42 optimistic because history teaches us to be open

1233
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:25,663
Domestic

1234
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:29,503
My lost book how to fly a horse was very much about

1235
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:31,551
The human creative spirit

1236
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:35,135
But I think one of the things we we can mess because it's

1237
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:36,927
Everywhere is

1238
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:40,767
Another thing that's unique about human being as a species

1239
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:43,583
Is we all have an innate drive to create

1240
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:45,631
Not everybody is going to

1241
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:47,935
5th Symphony

1242
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:51,519
We all have an innate drive to create two

1243
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:54,079
Improve things to make things better so

1244
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:56,383
What we do is a species

1245
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:57,407
Is

1246
00:50:57,919 --> 00:50:59,199
Approve also

1247
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:02,527
Improving on technology and we've done that forever

1248
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:05,343
Anat has led us to a place where

1249
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:06,111
In

1250
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:07,647
1800

1251
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:10,207
People were worried about growing population

1252
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:10,975
Because

1253
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:14,815
The world's population of China just about reached 1 billion

1254
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:17,887
But today at 7

1255
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:19,935
An 1800

1256
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:21,727
Average life expectancy

1257
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:24,287
See probably was about 38

1258
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:26,079
And today it's about

1259
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:27,359
75

1260
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:28,895
So

1261
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:30,431
We know only

1262
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:32,223
We have been able to sustain a large

1263
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:36,831
Most of those people live longer Fuller happy alives

1264
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:39,135
What's changed

1265
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:41,951
Strangest we continually improve. Technology

1266
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:43,487
So when you look at what's happening

1267
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:44,511
Now

1268
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:48,863
You see some exciting things going on in

1269
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:51,679
And Technologies

1270
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:53,471
Space traveling

1271
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:54,751
Space exploration

1272
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:56,031
Things like self driving

1273
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:59,871
The things that are happening in microbiology to improve

1274
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:00,639
Angel

1275
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:02,175
Revention smartphone

1276
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:03,967
Earlier

1277
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:05,503
Amazing

1278
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:08,831
Rarely told stories about smartphone

1279
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:10,367
Cell phones is

1280
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:14,463
We're taking us from a wild wear in mm

1281
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:16,511
About 1 billion people

1282
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:18,559
Had access to a telephone

1283
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:21,375
So that was probably about 20%

1284
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:27,007
Today that are more phones Than People 120%

1285
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:29,567
Population has access to a phone

1286
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:30,591
Bats

1287
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:32,383
Powerful change

1288
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:34,943
Does happen because of Technology

1289
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:36,991
And it means that

1290
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:40,575
You know some people can't talk to their mom or whatever

1291
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:42,623
But they can access information

1292
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:44,415
In places where they can attract

1293
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:45,183
Consummation

1294
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:50,303
So what hola amounts to is you know whatever challenges we see

1295
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:53,375
Did one of the big ones people talk about now is climate change

1296
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:56,447
Example which is Real History shows us

1297
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:58,495
Credibly likely almost certain

1298
00:52:59,007 --> 00:53:02,335
We will overcome and mitigate the effects of

1299
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:03,359
Climate change

1300
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:07,711
By proving on technology because

1301
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:08,735
On that note

1302
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:11,295
What is the biggest obstacle today

1303
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:12,831
For your vision

1304
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:13,599
The internet

1305
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:17,183
Oh I mean that kind of has really

1306
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:19,487
But I look when I look around the

1307
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:27,935
Consumer applications in like things in small firms that use GPS so that the sense you're hot right or whatever

1308
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:29,215
I'm sorry business

1309
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:29,983
Incredible

1310
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:32,287
Largely unseen

1311
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:36,383
Revolution around Network sensing so there another no autistic

1312
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:37,151
Post to my page

1313
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:38,431
The Internet of Things

1314
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:43,039
Happening cuz it's already it's already happened we are now surrounded by

1315
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:45,343
Network sensors and the benefits

1316
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:46,623
Subnetwork census

1317
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:50,719
I don't see any any particular all the schools are always new problem

1318
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:55,071
Yeah that the frontier for the internet of things today

1319
00:53:55,327 --> 00:53:56,095
Is definitely

1320
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:56,863
Machine learning

1321
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:58,911
Because you eat cycle this diet

1322
00:53:59,423 --> 00:53:59,935
This coming from

1323
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:00,703
Census

1324
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:06,079
And you need a new way to evaluate and analyze it because there's so much of it but

1325
00:54:06,335 --> 00:54:07,615
The 20th century

1326
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:09,151
Types of paradigm

1327
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:11,967
Was was kind of the Excel spreadsheet

1328
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:14,015
Clear coat turned into a pie chart

1329
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:15,039
On a PowerPoint

1330
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:21,183
In the mind of a lot of CEOs and Senior executive so I gather these 20th century white guys

1331
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:26,815
That still want dangerous right you ever report that comes out of something like an sap system or

1332
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:28,863
Salesforce.com or something

1333
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:30,655
And some kid

1334
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:32,959
Into a spreadsheet

1335
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:34,751
Add makes up pycharm

1336
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:41,407
And then I arrange a meeting in the Outlook calendar 3 weeks later and they sit there

1337
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:42,175
I'm stare at it

1338
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:44,991
Try to understand it decide to have another meeting

1339
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:47,807
About state or Dialysis in the 20th century

1340
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:50,111
In the 21st century

1341
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:55,999
It's ultimated using this technology for machine learning

1342
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:57,279
So either one of them

1343
00:54:57,535 --> 00:54:58,047
Sweetheart

1344
00:54:58,303 --> 00:54:59,327
People's rehab today

1345
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:00,095
Is

1346
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:02,399
Developing Alpha Beta algorithm

1347
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:05,215
To do machine learning analysis of

1348
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:07,519
Huge amounts of real time

1349
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:09,311
It's a lot of things

1350
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:11,103
Another challenge the

1351
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:13,663
I don't know how we're going to solve is

1352
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:16,735
The wild have this

1353
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:18,783
Really old fashioned

1354
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:20,831
Approach to radio spectrum

1355
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:22,879
Kind of like

1356
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:24,671
Bright House Spectrum

1357
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:27,231
Is kind of still allocated

1358
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:30,559
Everybody watched analog broadcast television

1359
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:33,119
Listen to analog broadcast radio

1360
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:35,935
There's barely any Spectrum

1361
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:38,495
Digital computer science like application

1362
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:42,847
You know you got more 20th century white guys running the world governments

1363
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:46,943
And then you got big old fashion companies that give them bunch of money

1364
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:49,247
And tell them what policies to agree to

1365
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:51,295
It could be hard to get them

1366
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:52,319
DeGraw

1367
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:54,367
You know how we need to make

1368
00:55:54,623 --> 00:55:56,927
More radio waves available full

1369
00:55:57,183 --> 00:55:59,487
Internet of Things type applications

1370
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:00,511
I like your thinking

1371
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:01,791
Alright Kevin

1372
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:03,839
Thank you so much for coming on the show

1373
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:09,471
Well that's it for another episode of The Internet of Things podcast

1374
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:15,871
Please join us next week when we have another amazing show for you and if in the meantime you are Hank

1375
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:20,991
Praying for some iot news sign up for my newsletter it's Stacey on iot

1376
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:27,391
Dot-com thanks for listening
