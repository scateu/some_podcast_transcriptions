00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:17,664
And we are here with a bunch of stuff this

5
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:21,504
Just like last week we're actually going to have some Deja Vu talking about

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,784
Amazon Alexa

7
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,344
We're going to talk about insurance for the Smart Home

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,392
Or how does smartphone relates to the insurance Market

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,464
I took a trip to Marriott Hotels to see what the

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,512
The hotel room of the future is going to look like

11
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:34,048
It will be talking about

12
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:36,608
Experience of a 6-month point

13
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:39,936
Our Guest this week will be Darren samuelsohn

14
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:42,240
Who is a reporter at Politico who

15
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:48,384
Works on a massive spread that magazine did on how DC is looking at regulating the internet of

16
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:51,200
So stay tuned for all of the symbols

17
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:53,504
Great Kevin

18
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,272
Here we are

19
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:55,040
It's like

20
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:58,112
It's like it's last week all over again because our first topic is

21
00:00:58,368 --> 00:00:59,904
Going to be Amazon

22
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:03,232
Yeah yeah I'm going to rub it in that I don't have an echo

23
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:05,280
See I didn't even know

24
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:06,048
Bring that up

25
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:08,864
You must be doing some serious angst because it's like

26
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:10,912
I'm going to make a bold proposition

27
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:13,216
This week amatar actually was last week

28
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:15,264
Amazon open.

29
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:17,056
It's voice SDK

30
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:18,848
And the kind of

31
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:20,128
Research and development in

32
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:21,152
Building

33
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:26,272
Voice recognition into the Echo and then it also opened up easy integration

34
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:27,552
To the echo for

35
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:28,320
Developers

36
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:31,392
Does a cherry on top of that Sunday

37
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:33,440
Created a hundred billion dollar fund

38
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:38,560
Support Alexa which is are startups using Alexa which is the AI brains

39
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:39,328
Can you find

40
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,096
The echo

41
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:43,680
Because makes

42
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:44,704
The echo

43
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,240
Actually better

44
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,312
Right now I think Amazon just outmaneuvered Apple

45
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,336
When it comes to the smart

46
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:54,176
You know what you told me that before the show and I sort of

47
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:58,528
Said I get your point but I'm not sure I agree but then you raise some really

48
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:02,368
Good points about people's recent experiences with Siri voice

49
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,648
Activation and

50
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,232
At home cat that just really haven't been up to par yet and

51
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:09,024
I think was

52
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,328
Frank Frank Fowler over at 2

53
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:12,352
He was returned

54
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:16,192
Yeah he was talking last week about how hung kittens

55
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:17,984
Siri together Air Canada

56
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,520
Just not all there

57
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:20,544
Just not all that

58
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,312
And

59
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:24,640
You got me thinking you might be right maybe Amazon has

60
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:26,432
Slowly but surely

61
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,224
Position himself really well

62
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,272
For the smart home with Echo

63
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,576
Here's my take on this and here's why I'm saying

64
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:33,600
Because I'm

65
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:36,160
I'm not I'm the furthest thing probably from an Apple fan

66
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:37,184
Fanboy out

67
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,488
I do respect

68
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:40,256
Stead

69
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:43,072
You know it has done an amazing job bringing

70
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:46,144
Really difficult technology to users and make it really simple

71
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:46,912
So

72
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:48,448
I was really hoping that

73
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,728
They would get there

74
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,032
I was really looking forward to

75
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:55,616
The issue with the smart home so far there's a couple

76
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:56,640
It's expensive

77
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:59,200
But it's also hard to

78
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:03,552
Get out of use each other you could put in one device

79
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,576
Two devices

80
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:07,648
That's hard

81
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:08,928
I mean that's what we spend

82
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:10,464
You know hours talking about of the show

83
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:17,120
What's going to happen to your and it's both like an integration standard issue but it's also a UI issue

84
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:18,912
Because you may be happy with

85
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:22,752
Carrying your phone around all day but I am most assuredly not

86
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:26,592
Before the show

87
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:28,896
Activate to wake up my nest

88
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:32,480
That was one problem but the same problem was

89
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:34,784
Physically left my desk

90
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,552
To do it

91
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:39,136
Because my phone was sitting next to me but it couldn't load the app faster

92
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,416
Then I could get up and

93
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:43,744
Which really is terrible

94
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,792
Slamming it that's got to be fixed

95
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:46,816
That is terrible

96
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:48,096
Maybe I'll reboot my phone

97
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:51,168
When you think about things like that

98
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:55,264
It's really just sucky to be a consumer right now this invoice

99
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:57,312
Is a wonderful way

100
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,872
For lazy people like me to stay in the chair

101
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:01,920
It's also a bit faster

102
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,712
To be like

103
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,736
Hey Alexa

104
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,528
Turn my Nest back on

105
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:09,088
All I need to do

106
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,904
And so what episode is done with Alexa

107
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,976
And then by opening it up it's created a platform

108
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,512
Where the standards don't matter

109
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:18,047
Because everything's going to go through

110
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:19,839
And

111
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:24,191
You control it all the invoice which is really intuitive and if you want you can

112
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,983
Get up off your butt and go

113
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:28,031
Musically or you can do it from

114
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:30,591
Eddie number of the apps on your phone but you don't

115
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:33,663
What the other biggie here is that

116
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:37,503
One device can be used by multiple people in the same house

117
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,039
To control whatever needs to be

118
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,599
So it's not like you have six

119
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:45,439
Smartphones everybody's got their own app and everything from nasty or whatever it may be

120
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:46,975
If you have one

121
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:48,767
Interface that you share

122
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,047
In this case voice

123
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:52,607
I mean that's that take a lot of complexity out of things

124
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,911
That's a brilliant point

125
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:58,239
I'm glad you that's why I'm that's why I'm here thank you

126
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:00,543
I'm so glad that I don't pay you to come

127
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,103
So

128
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:08,991
I talked to startups that are working with Amazon in the Echo Or Nah funded by Amazon

129
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,295
We're building these things

130
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:13,599
And we're going to see products coming out

131
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,671
Before the end of this year probably within you know a month or two

132
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,463
Discount alarm

133
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,231
Is one of them

134
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,255
What's a DIY

135
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,303
The orange chef

136
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,327
Which makes

137
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:28,447
Wait we actually talked about it makes a connected kitchen scale and it also makes a device called countertop

138
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,751
That you're going to be able to buy

139
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:31,775
I think next year

140
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:33,823
Waze off but

141
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:37,151
It's next to your Vitamix blender and some other things

142
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,175
Till like

143
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:42,527
Basically give you recipes and recommendations tied to like your job own app

144
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:44,319
So tied to your activity

145
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:47,647
What you have in your house and gives you recommendations I want to

146
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,951
Some other

147
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:52,255
Groups that are kind of interesting

148
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:54,815
AR

149
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:58,911
Dragon Innovation which is a company that works with a lot of startups

150
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:01,471
The CEO of Dragonair

151
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:02,495
Innovation

152
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,799
Scott Miller he's one of the

153
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,335
Founders of iRobot

154
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:14,271
I didn't even realize this at first but he was telling me one of the best things about what Amazon is done

155
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,295
Here's opened up

156
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,599
The physical Hardware the R&D day

157
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,647
Kind of created around building

158
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:23,487
The Echo and made it such a good voice recognition device

159
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:24,255
Cuz

160
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:28,351
I don't know if you guys remember but I've tried a lot of voice recognition devices in

161
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,631
Most of them aren't any good

162
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:35,263
So he's like hey of startups have access to this you can imagine you know somebody building a Roomba

163
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,543
That you can talk to

164
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,079
Heck yeah

165
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:38,847
I want that

166
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:43,967
It just doesn't listen

167
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,759
So again I think

168
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:48,575
I think this could be amazing I have no idea if like

169
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:50,367
What if you could get home kit India

170
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,391
I doubt it

171
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:54,719
Because I don't think so

172
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,279
But I'm excited

173
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,815
So that's that's the thought there

174
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,887
Yeah I think there's lots to be excited about and

175
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:05,983
And again I did not buy the echo because I didn't want to buy something for

176
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:09,567
Potential I saw the potential in it but back in November as like

177
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,103
Just doesn't do enough for me

178
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:17,247
And then they have the best DK come out in February and then we had if this then that support added a whole bunch of other things

179
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,319
As we talked about the WeMo support Phillips

180
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,623
Hue light bulb support now

181
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:27,231
And now they've got this Alexa skills kit which is really the SDK for for Alexa

182
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,255
And

183
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:32,095
Aside from the smart home aspect even on a mobile perspective

184
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:36,447
There's potential here in terms of apps I had read the Intuit StubHub

185
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:39,775
AOL and Citrix are already using the Alexa skills kit

186
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,311
I don't know what for but

187
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,847
This is to embed

188
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:45,407
Voice recognition I Summa to apps and services

189
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,455
Yes I can tell you what Citrix is

190
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,479
4 days

191
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,783
They bought a company called octo blue back in

192
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,575
December of last year

193
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:55,903
And they are actually enabling it so it will work with

194
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,439
Aqua blue is a

195
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,463
Code

196
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,255
See how do I describe October

197
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:03,839
It is cold that connects devices

198
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:06,399
Two other devices and devices to web service

199
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,703
So it's not it's like an if this then that

200
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:09,471
But it's actually

201
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,263
Code it's not

202
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,311
It's not a simple for the everyday user to use

203
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:16,127
But it's amazing it is it is very flexible

204
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:18,943
So they're using it to

205
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:21,503
Basically you tell Alexa you can say

206
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,807
Alexa allow octoblu

207
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,343
To check my calendar

208
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:26,623
In

209
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,927
And then it'll check your calendar for the day

210
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,207
It'll give you all that

211
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:34,047
So basically it opens up more services Enterprise

212
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:34,815
Glass services

213
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:35,583
Actually

214
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,863
Makes sense

215
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,143
But

216
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:42,239
They're also doing something with wit AI which is a startup that does

217
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,775
Speech recognition

218
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:47,615
And artificial intelligence around speech like getting

219
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:49,663
Computers to generate their own speech that

220
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,431
That makes sense

221
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,991
So they're actually

222
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:55,807
Running stuff that they tell the echo

223
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:58,879
And then the Echoes response back through with AI

224
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:03,487
In the idea there is to teach the echo via October

225
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:04,511
This is America

226
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,583
How to respond to better

227
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,375
How to better respond to Natural length

228
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,959
Cut that's all very far

229
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:16,543
Far-fetched but it's actually really exciting stuff I'm very excited in

230
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:17,567
I don't know

231
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:23,199
People who listen to The Show for a long time are going to remember that actually talk to Chris Matthews who is the founder

232
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:26,783
Who was the founder of October Lou way back in the day about what he was doing

233
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:29,087
It's really very flexible and very

234
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:34,463
Well I am looking forward to seeing this all develop and I said earlier I

235
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:36,511
Will probably buy the echo now inside

236
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,303
I put in a request

237
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:41,119
To get it and I had complained on on are the same

238
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,423
Well I blew it cuz now it's $149

239
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,447
The 99

240
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:47,263
Well once it came out for everybody

241
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:52,127
That request just got ignored and now it's 179 so I really missed out

242
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,663
The remote I didn't realize this

243
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,199
That's extra

244
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:59,295
Yeah and I I use the remote but it is a little iffy so if your house is really big

245
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:05,951
Cuz it's blue should be I don't think I even want the remote I think I'd rather have multiple echos because I don't

246
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:09,279
When I carry something else around or have something in every room

247
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:14,911
That makes sense if you get multiple echos because I'm very curious I've actually thought about it

248
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:16,703
Multiple echos on

249
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,007
Amazon

250
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:23,103
Does anything I hope so if any of our readers have multiple echoes

251
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:24,895
Let us know

252
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,967
Curious how it works together affect if it actually does

253
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:34,111
Yeah cuz like I know they don't have like a party load like Sonos does for all of your speakers to play the same songs at once

254
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,647
That's the only thing I know

255
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,183
So I know nothing Beyond

256
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:43,839
I think if there is there not working towards multiple echoes in a house I hope they do soon because I think it's going to be required for

257
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:44,863
Many many people

258
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:47,423
I agree there is there plenty of times

259
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,215
Dang it I whip

260
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,751
I wish I had an echo in the bathroom

261
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:51,519
I know that's over

262
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:57,919
But you know I owe you could instantly or you know order toilet paper when you're out

263
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:04,063
There is be ordering things like a lot of the stuff that you need to order is in the bath

264
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:07,391
They have to dash with the Oil of Olay products I'm all on that

265
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:09,951
Also you know you listen to music in the shower

266
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:10,975
You can

267
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:13,023
Add things to your shopping list

268
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,071
Think of a lot of good ideas in the shower I could

269
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,655
I actually used to have a shower crayon that I would write them on the walls with

270
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:21,471
Add this to my to do list

271
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:22,751
There's a lot of

272
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:29,151
I tell you I could see it now Sunday paper in the bathroom shopping at the same time no yeah

273
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,687
Cook

274
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:36,063
The bathroom

275
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,599
We're going to talk about a toothbrush

276
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:38,879
Oh goodie

277
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:42,719
Looks like one of the great segue there so we hadn't connected

278
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:45,535
Toothbrush company based out of Columbus Ohio

279
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:47,839
It's called Bean Technologies

280
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:50,911
Lesbianism Beam not being

281
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:51,935
And

282
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:52,703
What they

283
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:54,239
We may have talked about

284
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:58,335
Before for 2 years they sold a connected toothbrush that basically says

285
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:00,383
Is it's a toothbrush with Bluetooth

286
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,919
It's got an app the app is like

287
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,199
Hey you brush for 2

288
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,735
Minutes today good on you

289
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:10,111
Basically talk to the CEO Alex premiere

290
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:16,767
That was just a trojan horse to build an insurance company that can offer cheaper rates because they have access to more.

291
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,303
Data about how you brush

292
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,583
And because they

293
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,607
Build a lot of stuff

294
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,911
I'm more modern software infrastructure

295
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,703
You're so boring the cost by hosting stuff

296
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:26,495
So

297
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:27,519
That

298
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:28,543
Is pretty awesome

299
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:32,127
Yeah so I guess you would get discounted insurance rates

300
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:35,199
If you had their toothbrush and provided them information and so on so forth

301
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:40,575
You sign up for the dental insurance in he's basically promising that it's

302
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,623
It it's actually offered

303
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:43,903
So it's not offered

304
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:49,279
A company would sign up in the rates to offer the dental insurance

305
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,351
10 to 25% cheaper

306
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:53,887
And

307
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:54,911
In addition

308
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:57,727
They're changing the model a little bit by sending out

309
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,775
Every quarter a tuba toothpaste

310
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:03,615
Dental floss and a replacement brush head so they provide that for

311
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:04,895
Gotcha

312
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,455
And the idea is if they're doing that

313
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:09,247
And they're encouraging youth

314
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:11,295
Through gamification to brush

315
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:13,599
And then I see that you're visiting the dentist

316
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,367
They pay for the

317
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,903
Preventive stuff anyway

318
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:20,511
Should a pretty good sense of

319
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:23,071
That you're probably being healthy and

320
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:26,655
We're going to ask you little things throughout you know on the app you can ask

321
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,679
Ask you questions like

322
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,727
Hey

323
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,007
Sensitive teeth

324
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:33,823
And if they do we can make recommendations that will help improve

325
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,359
Outcomes for them

326
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:43,295
Can I see the game of vacation here the more you brush the more stars you collect and then you get rewards for different star levels such as

327
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:46,879
Healthy replacement heads or cashback on the plan

328
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:48,415
Yeah actually Our Guest

329
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:52,767
Are cast today later on in the show it was using a beam toothbrush and he said that

330
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:55,327
Keno brushes for 2 minutes just to get more stars

331
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,607
Four stars

332
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:57,887
All right

333
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:58,655
So

334
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:01,983
Bean is not the only company that's looking at taking kind of

335
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:05,823
The information from the internet of things and connected devices in

336
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,871
It helping users

337
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,919
Develop better habits will start there

338
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:12,479
Nest as we talked about last week

339
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:13,759
Has a program with

340
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,551
American family

341
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:16,575
Where

342
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:19,647
They give discounts they have a 5% monthly discount

343
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:21,183
A free Nest protect thermostat

344
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:23,231
Nest protect smoke detector

345
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:26,047
To their customers and

346
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:29,375
I want to get people to make sure there's smoke detectors are

347
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:30,911
Working so short

348
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:31,935
Just encourage them to

349
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,471
Custom once a month

350
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,263
Change the batteries when they're done

351
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:38,847
Is idea so it's not punitive it's just purely

352
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:41,663
I add an additive nice site

353
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,991
It's a good thing

354
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,015
So

355
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,343
That is what they're doing and then

356
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,879
A company called automatic

357
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:54,463
Which is they make an OBD Port so an onboard diagnostics

358
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:56,255
We got it right this time

359
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,535
Yeah I did

360
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:02,143
Yes Dondo that plugs into that port on your car to tell

361
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:07,007
Tell you information like hey driven this many miles are hey this is why your check engine lights on

362
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,799
I hate you speed too much knock it off

363
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:09,567
Yeah

364
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,335
Hey stop speeding

365
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,871
Go easier on the brakes

366
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,455
They actually got

367
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:18,527
Strategic round with a raised 24 million last week and they

368
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:23,391
The investor that led the round was USAA which is an insurance

369
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,159
Company

370
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,951
Based in San Antonio Texas

371
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:30,815
And USAA is interested also in kind of building

372
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:32,607
Smarter and better insurance

373
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,143
Policies for

374
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,959
People Based on data from things like that automatic

375
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:39,007
And I think

376
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:44,127
Progressive actually has a little plug-in module like that as well that I don't for a while and I'll give you a discount.

377
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:46,943
You agree to plug that into your car

378
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:51,295
Let that information be you know sifted up to them I don't know what kind of discount you get butt

379
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:53,855
So they do that and they also do it

380
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:57,951
They only do it for six months so they collect the data for six months and then you send them

381
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:58,975
Stuff back

382
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:01,279
I miss how it worked

383
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:04,351
In Progressive is like really they don't want to be in that business

384
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:06,655
The CEO speak one back in

385
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:08,703
He was like you know I would love to get that data

386
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,495
Car manufacturers I hate

387
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:13,055
Being in a device business shipping it back

388
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:13,823
The 4th to people

389
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:19,199
Nothing to note though is none of the insurer so far talk about real-time price

390
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,735
This is not something there after

391
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:24,063
I should also know that the second generation of the automatic

392
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,087
Not the current one

393
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:27,391
The second generation will have cellular

394
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,439
Apparently really big 4

395
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:32,511
Oh yeah that way they don't have to worry about

396
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:37,631
Recipe not to send any device and plug it in and upload data it will just go

397
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:40,447
Set the current automatic WiFi on

398
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,471
Next gen

399
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:42,751
Have cellular

400
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:49,151
I think it's a really kind of cool way of using the internet of things to rethink the way people

401
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:49,919
Business

402
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,711
Especially being I I think that's

403
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,503
I have no idea that

404
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:54,783
But I loved

405
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:57,855
You just want the Stars

406
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:08,863
So last night I visited a Marriott Hotel here in Austin

407
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,399
I saw the future

408
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,191
Really

409
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:14,751
Little little sleep pods like at the Google

410
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:16,031
No knots

411
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:19,103
Be honest it's a little boring

412
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,383
Because

413
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:24,735
Hotels actually have to pay for all this stuff and they don't see an Roi just yet on a lot of

414
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,831
What they do see is

415
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:31,135
Netflix in the rooms on the TVs which I have

416
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,927
Canker sore for a while

417
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:33,695
Yay

418
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:34,463
That's an ounce

419
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,279
They will have

420
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:42,143
Starwood has them already in Mariana's testing Bluetooth door locks that

421
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:45,471
You know you turn that you put your phone up to the door lock and it automatically opens

422
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,239
End

423
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,519
It's like mobile check-in

424
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:48,799
Yep

425
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:51,359
So you basically you can check into the hotel

426
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,383
From your phone

427
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:54,687
And then you're like you go up to your room

428
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:57,759
About to check in on her to tell you which room is you go up there

429
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,295
And you flasher

430
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,319
Phone up there in

431
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,087
Inside

432
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:04,927
Yeah I think it's a Starwood you don't even have to go to the

433
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:06,463
Desk to Check Into Cash

434
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:09,023
Yeah I thought it's all done on the phone and

435
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:12,351
You unlock the room whichever motels between the app and you're done

436
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,119
Starwood's

437
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,143
Was hacked

438
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:16,191
The Marriott people were very

439
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:16,959
Very excite

440
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:19,519
Knowing that

441
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,543
Over it I believe it was

442
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:22,847
So

443
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,895
That's at the other thing and this is

444
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:29,759
This is way far down the road maybe 2016 but they're talking about bringing wireless charging into

445
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:31,295
Well that's

446
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:32,575
Probably a good

447
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:37,439
Time for it to happen I don't think it's happened yet because they're just been too many competing standards too many groups

448
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,975
But you've had the

449
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:41,279
I'll probably get this wrong but I'll say the wireless

450
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:43,327
Power Consortium and

451
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:47,679
Welchy's the standard and I think the alliance for wireless power a

452
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,959
4wp

453
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:51,775
I believe they agreed yeah we can use the

454
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:54,591
The Apache standard Qi it is chi

455
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:57,663
That's really what we need because right now

456
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,735
You got multiple standard still so you're not going to embed

457
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,783
Spend money in betting these charters in

458
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:06,879
Furniture we're not everybody's phone or tablet's going to work so

459
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:08,927
Getting closer to the standard

460
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:13,279
And I could see in 2016 people financing okay there's enough of us

461
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:17,119
Have a standard here that we can spend the money and offer this to our customers

462
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,399
Exactly in

463
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,423
Marriott is looking at the

464
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,215
Cool

465
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:22,239
Good good good

466
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:24,799
So that was exciting I thought as

467
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,335
Who stays at hotels often

468
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:29,663
Talk about how

469
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:34,527
People consumers will see The Internet of Things First and hotels this kind of makes me wonder about that

470
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:36,575
Because other than the connected door locks

471
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:39,903
There's no plans there are no plans for like fancy dimming lights

472
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:42,463
Automated thermostats

473
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,487
Blinds

474
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:47,071
Again return on investment isn't going to be there unless

475
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:53,215
Unless you're the only one doing that and people want that type of experience and eventually everybody will do it and

476
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:53,983
Therefore

477
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,263
It's just Anna

478
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:57,055
You'll be a common thing so

479
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:58,591
I don't I don't foresee that happening

480
00:19:59,103 --> 00:19:59,615
So it's not

481
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:02,175
Alright so now it's time

482
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,455
Kevin said it

483
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:06,527
5 minutes

484
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:16,255
So

485
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:19,327
We've got whatever returning to I'm returning to the ring

486
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:24,191
Connected jewelry

487
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:25,471
OtterBox

488
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:31,103
I know no I mean I paid about $130 for it but it actually sells for between

489
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:34,943
I believe it's 195 + 260 depending on the stone

490
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:36,735
So

491
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:39,551
I got mine in December and I loved it

492
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:44,415
It's for those of you guys who don't know what's a ring that's connected to your phone via Bluetooth it's got an LED

493
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:45,695
And it's got a little

494
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:46,719
Kidney stone

495
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:47,487
Install

496
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:49,023
Or under the stone

497
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:52,095
Rather in the LEDs and then it's got to happen

498
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:52,863
Sexy back

499
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:53,887
I'm so

500
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:55,167
And there's no screen

501
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,703
It's it's something pretty

502
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:58,495
I was very excited about it B

503
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,311
I leave my phone in my bag all the time and I need to know what

504
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:05,663
But before my ringler actually 2 weeks after I got my Wrigley I got a pea

505
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:07,455
And

506
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:08,991
Having used both

507
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:12,831
I've decided that I found myself only using the ringly when

508
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:17,184
I couldn't get away with wearing the watch and most of my day I wear the watch

509
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,488
I like getting the screen notifications

510
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:23,840
I will say that the Ringley is nice because it links into things like Slack

511
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:24,864
Uber

512
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,632
That

513
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:26,400
You know I don't

514
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:27,936
I just need to know that someone's painting

515
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:30,240
Me right or you just need a signal you don't need

516
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,008
Data

517
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,288
Right so

518
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:34,592
If you wanted to wear both you

519
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,896
But I've actually had

520
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:38,432
A bit of a challenge

521
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:40,992
With Renly so my first Ringley after

522
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:43,040
The three weeks it just stopped working

523
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:44,832
And

524
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:47,648
I sent it back and they've been very nice about

525
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,440
An independent right nice to other

526
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:50,464
It's not like

527
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,072
Hell yeah we get that all the time

528
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:58,656
I went out for dinner last night on the iot podcast

529
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,936
And I heard your voice

530
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:02,240
No we're not that

531
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:08,640
Date they sent me a new one and they said that it was a it was a one-off Luke that my box

532
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,432
Broken

533
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:11,456
So

534
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:15,552
They sent me a new one the new one was the wrong size so

535
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:17,344
I sent that back that was just in Arabic

536
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:19,648
I was in a system is having two sizes

537
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:20,928
Not

538
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,720
So I got my third ring

539
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,000
And

540
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:25,024
That one

541
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,304
Oh man actually

542
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:29,632
Okay so English

543
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:31,936
Words for about

544
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:32,960
A couple weeks

545
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:34,496
And then it stopped

546
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,056
Same problem as the first

547
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:41,408
Different problem this went this time it wouldn't hold a charge and that was a common problem

548
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,504
So are a relatively common problem so we set it back I got a new one

549
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:46,784
Did that one

550
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:48,064
The Box

551
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:48,832
Sad

552
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:50,368
The USB

553
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,160
Micro USB port was

554
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:53,440
Messed up on the box

555
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:57,024
So you can actually plug it in to charge it to the ring work

556
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,304
Boxden

557
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,840
In the Box in the ringer actually

558
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:01,632
Affected

559
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:02,656
Think together

560
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:03,936
Be a serial numbers so they

561
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,472
I couldn't just

562
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:07,520
Sentence using a USB cable

563
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:11,104
What can use a new USB cable but the box is actually the charger

564
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,384
That is actually a

565
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,152
Battery

566
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:14,688
Inside I got you

567
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,480
You have to put the ring in the Box.

568
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:20,576
And you can't use a different box because of the serial number tie

569
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:21,344
Because they link

570
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,112
What's the boxes

571
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:25,952
So originally I was like swapping out the ring that I had that

572
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:26,720
Wasn't

573
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:27,488
Broken

574
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,048
At one point in time I literally had three boxes

575
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,352
And I was just like

576
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:34,400
I can't make them work

577
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:36,704
So I said that back and now

578
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,472
I am on

579
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:40,800
That's at least four

580
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:41,568
That's at least four

581
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,616
Number for

582
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:44,384
And

583
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:46,176
So far it's doing okay

584
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:47,712
So we're going to check back again and

585
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,248
Another month because it looks like

586
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,784
They had some quality

587
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:52,576
Controller yield issues

588
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:53,600
Epic

589
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:54,880
Which is not uncommon

590
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:55,904
This is something I bought off of

591
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,672
Kickstarter

592
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:57,696
But

593
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:58,720
A concern that

594
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:00,256
Quality control problems

595
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:01,792
Our problem

596
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:08,192
Very good about sending things back but I also feel like I may have passed it by with like the Apple watch

597
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:12,288
Coming out there's a lot of other things I could do the same thing and more

598
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,824
So and for Less

599
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:16,384
But I mean you can get a pebble for 99 bucks

600
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,152
Half the price

601
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:20,736
Right so that's that's the question is there still

602
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:22,272
A market of women

603
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:23,808
It's mostly women

604
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:26,624
Be interested in a cocktail ring

605
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,720
This is connected cuz it is beautiful I get compliments on it from people who have no idea that it's

606
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:36,352
Which is good I mean that's a win in my book if it doesn't work it doesn't really matter

607
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:41,472
So there it there's there's the update on the Ringling

608
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:42,752
And

609
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:44,288
With that I guess we should

610
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:46,592
Call it a day and go straight to Our Guest

611
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:47,616
Sounds good

612
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:51,712
All right so stay tuned everyone because our guess is Darren samuelsohn

613
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:58,112
He is a senior policy reporter at Politico and he's got talk to us about what Washington thinks about the Internet of Things

614
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:08,352
Hey everybody this is Stacey Higginbotham and we are back with the Internet of Things podcast

615
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:10,912
And today I have are man and wife

616
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:12,704
Darren samuelsohn

617
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,752
He's a senior policy reporter at

618
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:15,776
Politico

619
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:16,800
Hey Darren

620
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:17,824
Hey sexy

621
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:20,896
So I gave him a little upgrade he's actually not our man

622
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:24,480
Washington he's just a guy in Washington who happened to write

623
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:28,576
Most of a really big package from Politico

624
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:29,856
On how

625
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:32,160
Washington DC weather

626
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:34,208
Explaining the internet of things to watch

627
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,536
DC highly recommend it to all of you guys if your

628
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:38,560
Sitting there going

629
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:40,864
What are legislators reading about

630
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,888
What's the Internet of Things

631
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:43,936
So good job Darren

632
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:46,240
Let's get started by

633
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:52,128
So let's get started with a sense of

634
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,480
What did you know about the internet of things when you started the reporting for this

635
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:57,760
Be stories that you were

636
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:04,672
You know I really didn't know that much at all about the internet of things I got a lot of topics in Washington has covered the Pentagon has covered

637
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:05,440
Energy

638
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:09,024
Policy and climate change and I had a lighthouse beat for about a year

639
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:13,888
Subpoenaed to things was kind of new to me I've actually spent I should say a year

640
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:17,216
Covering a political campaign technology last year during the

641
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:19,264
I got to see how

642
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:23,616
Sophisticated the Democrats and Republicans are in using technology to win

643
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:25,664
Election or to connect with voters

644
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:28,736
But this was totally different yet I learned a lot

645
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:34,880
In that previous beat that really maybe help me sort of just to start to understand how much policymakers and lawmakers and

646
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:38,208
And the administration you know I was going to be used

647
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:40,000
Technology themselves

648
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:40,768
To get it off

649
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:47,424
This is kind of an example of how much they are using technology while in office I guess that's what made it at 7

650
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:48,448
Awesome

651
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:51,520
Now that you've reported out the story

652
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:53,824
What do you think about the Internet of Things

653
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,592
What's today

654
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:59,712
It's pretty amazing I certainly started quickly seeing things all around me

655
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:00,736
That

656
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:03,552
Were part of my life or you know I was being choked

657
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:09,952
Watching on television commercials just my wife and I were sitting on the couch during the Stanley Cup hockey game

658
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:15,328
We're just kind of floored by how many of the commercials related to the internet of things I can find the best example

659
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,168
Was I think it's an Audi commercial where the guy is driving me

660
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:24,288
Kind of a classic

661
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:27,360
It just kind of floored me how many things are around us

662
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,640
Are being advertised

663
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:29,408
Directed at us

664
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:31,456
It was weird me

665
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:34,016
One of the projects I had was to get his wired up his

666
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:34,784
Cuz I couldn't

667
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:36,064
On the Metro

668
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:41,952
And there was an advertisement for the nest thermostat right there like waiting for me when I got off the train one day at

669
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:44,512
I'm a little bit weird like they knew that I was

670
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:46,560
Starting to connect my life up to the intern

671
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,376
I would say before long

672
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:53,216
Started to become aware of this issue and then

673
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:55,776
Started reading reading reading as many

674
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:59,616
Pieces of literature that could have been discussed whether Congressional hearing transcripts

675
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:01,920
FTC report to the Homeland

676
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:03,968
Security reports have been done on the topic

677
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:08,320
And you before too long starting to become a little bit of a dangerous expert on it

678
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:09,600
I love those

679
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:10,880
Consider myself a dangerous EX

680
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:17,024
So we'll get to you and your your personal transformation and dude I believe it was super Robo reporter in a moment

681
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,048
But let's

682
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:20,608
Let's focus on DC because

683
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,400
The tecknity often does

684
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:25,984
They're just kind of our own things

685
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:30,336
Washington's going to have their light-touch regulation there too slow

686
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:32,640
They're going to look at this forever

687
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:36,224
Hopefully we can keep them off our backs that is very much the sense I get for

688
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:36,992
Can the people I talk

689
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,808
So in reading your story

690
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:43,392
I was kind of strapped it what you found so I'd love for you to talk to me

691
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:44,160
About

692
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:47,488
You going around and interviewing people at the Capitol in kind of

693
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:49,536
What your take is on how

694
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:50,816
Legislator

695
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:52,096
View the internet

696
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:54,912
She was really interesting I just

697
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:58,496
Has been up in the capital for 15 years covering a whole range of issues

698
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:00,288
This was one that

699
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:03,872
I was floored by just how many people I had to do some explaining

700
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:06,688
Once I should have presented the question to them

701
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,272
Typically with a member of Congress you know you just say a couple of keywords

702
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:14,624
And they latch Andre quickly and they have sound bites in their own head where they thinking

703
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:15,904
You know they can take it

704
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:18,976
With this one you know I would usually start off with

705
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:21,536
Excuse me Senator or Congressman I'd like to ask a couple questions

706
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:23,328
About the Internet of Things

707
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:28,192
And except for maybe five or six members I got in a blank stares

708
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,216
People who

709
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:33,568
You would think would be pretty technologically savvy there's a quote from Congressman Sean Duffy

710
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:36,128
Wisconsin Republican used to be on the real world

711
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,200
Couple years ago a reality TV star who

712
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:43,296
Is in Congress anyway I asked him a question and he looked at me and said what the hell is that

713
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:48,160
I don't explain him usually what I would do without a quickly will explain another you know drones and

714
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:52,512
Autonomous semi Thomas cars in probably two examples that you're probably familiar with

715
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:54,816
And then a lot of members are going to say okay okay okay

716
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:55,584
What you're talking about

717
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:58,912
There's only been one hearing Energy company that was

718
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:00,960
Corning Court internet of things related to

719
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,008
And then there was only one Hearing in the Senate

720
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,312
Commerce Committee earlier this year so

721
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:07,104
For 2015

722
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:10,688
No hearings with you know the internet of things as the main driver

723
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,992
And then you have this internet-of-things caucus

724
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:14,272
Before we get to the caca

725
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:17,088
The hearings have only

726
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,880
There's been no hearings in

727
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:21,184
Congress because there have been hearings

728
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:22,208
In front of the f

729
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:22,976
TCM

730
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:26,304
I think so cuz I just want to clarify that far listener

731
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:27,840
May not make the

732
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:30,144
Congress in the regular

733
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:32,448
So absolutely yeah sure

734
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,752
Back to the Internet of Things caucus

735
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:35,520
Just because

736
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:36,288
Is it

737
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:40,384
So he's a he's partnering up with Suzanne.

738
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:45,504
A Washington Democrat who used to work for Microsoft who's been in Congress I think about 3 terms now

739
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,320
Bipartisan caucus immuno keep this in mind with

740
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:49,344
Respect

741
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,624
Powerless

742
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,416
Organizations are basically away

743
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:54,976
Four members of Congress to me to get together and

744
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:57,536
And host a panel discussion or

745
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:59,072
Trying to gauge but

746
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:02,656
There's all kinds of caucuses in Congress has ones on Whiskey Drinking

747
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:04,192
Little League baseball

748
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:05,728
So keep that in mind.

749
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:06,752
Gina one

750
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:09,824
Easy thing that members of Congress can do but it doesn't really

751
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,152
They don't write legislation if you're in some sort of like a club

752
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:14,432
High School

753
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:20,064
Kind of like a social thing again very few members are aware of it

754
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,624
Those are a couple their licenses and Bill Bean

755
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:24,928
In the house and then over in the Senate

756
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,464
You have

757
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,232
Small

758
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:28,256
Group of

759
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:30,560
Kind of I would say backbench senators

760
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:32,352
With respect to

761
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:34,400
Deb Fischer from Nebraska

762
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:37,984
I was thinking about this issue because of Agriculture and all the trucks that are

763
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,032
Flowing through the state of Nebraska

764
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,312
You have the

765
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:43,360
Brian Schatz from Hawaii

766
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:46,688
A Democrat who's taking his leadership on this issue

767
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:51,808
I meant Cory Booker he's pretty well-known New Jersey Democrat Saturday

768
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:53,344
And he's been

769
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:56,416
Front and center the former mayor of

770
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:57,952
In New Jersey has been in the Sun

771
00:31:58,464 --> 00:31:58,976
Couple years now

772
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:00,000
Again

773
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:01,280
There's no pushing

774
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:03,584
More education than legislation

775
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,888
Okay and it sounds like it

776
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,680
It's sorely needed I think

777
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:09,216
In your story you had

778
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:13,056
Representative Isis saying that there are 435 members of the House

779
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:15,872
100 members of the Senate and most of them don't know what the internet is

780
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:17,408
So

781
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,200
It's kind of Grimm news

782
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:21,248
It is not the Congressional level

783
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:23,808
So let's let's talk about

784
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:25,088
The regulatory

785
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,136
Kind of side of the house because

786
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:28,416
Side of things

787
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:30,720
Don't confuse the issue

788
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:32,512
The FTC

789
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:36,352
Is actually already issued a report and some of their conclusions

790
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:37,888
From the report talk about

791
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:40,192
Increase data privacy

792
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:44,032
Making sure that companies don't keep data Beyond a certain

793
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:45,312
Threshold

794
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:46,592
The report also asked

795
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:47,360
Spore

796
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:52,224
Keto companies to be a little bit more transparent about the data they're collecting and how it gets shared

797
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:53,504
They've also

798
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,528
Tencent

799
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:55,808
Censorship bar

800
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,856
Find companies for

801
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:00,160
Violations of consumer privacy

802
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:01,696
Related to connected device

803
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:09,120
There's also the FDA which is actually doing some research into connected medical devices I have read some stuff from

804
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:13,472
Then you mentioned the Department of Homeland Security which I thought of where I was so I

805
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:15,264
I'd love to get a sense because

806
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:18,336
I don't know if it was one of your stories but someone

807
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:19,872
Brought up in this

808
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,664
Package of stories

809
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:23,200
The Internet of Things

810
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:23,968
Covers

811
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,016
A wide swath of Industries

812
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:27,296
And Congress

813
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:33,440
Regulatory system doesn't look at things holistically it looks at things in a very siloed fashion

814
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:35,744
And I thought that was a really good point

815
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:37,280
For like when were thinking

816
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:39,584
Yeah that was something that

817
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,888
Domino's in my main story that I wrote

818
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,984
And it was something you asked earlier you know what did I learn and actually that was something

819
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:48,544
A baby and it's been about 6 or 7 weeks

820
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,824
Digging in on the topic

821
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:51,616
Midway through

822
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:53,408
Did it occur to me that that is

823
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:58,272
The case I'll tell you where I came to that conclusion from up denim covering Washington for a long time

824
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:03,904
I cover federal agencies of cover the energy Department in the EPA very closely in the Pentagon very closely

825
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:07,232
And everyone does things very vertically Within

826
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:08,000
Their ages

827
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,024
Think about what

828
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,048
What laws

829
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:13,120
Allow them to do what they're authorized to do Under

830
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:16,960
Under existing statutes and they don't tend to think too often about

831
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:18,752
What a neighboring agency might do

832
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:21,056
And it's the exact same thing in Congress

833
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:26,176
Can you create a you have the Judiciary Committee and it tends to think within its own balance of what

834
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:28,736
It wants to do and it will fight like hell

835
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:30,528
With another eight committee

836
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:31,808
Over jurisdiction

837
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,856
This happens over and over and over again

838
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:36,416
Can you just fascinating you have this battle going on in Washington

839
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:37,184
Hanover who is

840
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:39,488
I get the Internet of Things

841
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,048
Just kind of wiped out all of those walls

842
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:44,352
And is designed to sort of have

843
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:46,144
One thing talking to another thing talking

844
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,680
Do another thing that typically

845
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:49,472
In Washington we erect barriers

846
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,544
Rancho that openly ultimately leads you to the White House

847
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:56,128
And you know the lighthouse is supposed to be the place where all federal agencies

848
00:34:56,384 --> 00:35:02,528
Trying to take their commands and their lead and and you know the buck stops with the president United States who's in charge of the entire Federal.

849
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:04,320
Dancer that was a question

850
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:06,112
I was closing to the White House was okay

851
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:07,136
What are you doing

852
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:12,512
Be kind of came back with a similar answer to what you hear from industry

853
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:13,792
We want to light touch we don't

854
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:15,840
Really want to get involved we kind of want to

855
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:17,376
Stand back and let

856
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:18,912
The rest of the

857
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:26,848
At the same time they are being warned by their own Homeland Security Department you got a small window of opportunity here.

858
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:28,384
Talking if you don't

859
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:30,944
You know there's going to be some serious serious consequences

860
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,480
Security and sell

861
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:35,552
The White House is well aware of what's going on

862
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:38,368
If the White House has been telling people which way to row the boat

863
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,208
The Russian news agency that Justin start rolling in 30 different directions

864
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:43,488
And that's trouble

865
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,632
With that idea because the idea that we need a holistic view for regulating The Internet of Things

866
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,168
Or legislating it

867
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:53,472
And if the white house isn't taking

868
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:55,008
Charge of this

869
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:56,288
As you said

870
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:57,312
Where we going to

871
00:35:57,568 --> 00:36:00,128
Get weird who should be regulating this should it be

872
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:01,152
Should we

873
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:07,552
Elect a president who actually knows with the Internet of Things is in 2016 should we turn to regulators and

874
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:08,832
I hope that they get it right

875
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:09,856
Should be

876
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:12,160
Start buying Congressman I don't know like

877
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:14,720
Where is our best hope of Regulation that may

878
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,512
It's a

879
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:22,912
Great question mean there's there's there's this tension here between the two and you know when I set out to teleport the story I was

880
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:23,936
Trying to figure out

881
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:27,008
How much do Congress and how much should be Administration no and then

882
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:29,568
How much were they ready to do and obviously what

883
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:31,360
What is industry telling them

884
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:32,640
They like.

885
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:36,736
Don't be wrong Amino President Obama is

886
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:40,576
Is no dummy on technologies that he's been wearing once a couple of months now

887
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:44,416
She certainly aware of it and he has made a couple of

888
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:47,488
Allusions to sort of what the Fitbit is capable of

889
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:49,536
Energy Systems

890
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:53,120
And he hasn't used the words Internet of Things

891
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:55,168
Please talk to me about today

892
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:57,216
Prospects of what technology

893
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:57,984
Conducive

894
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,264
He knows what it is

895
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:03,616
Some of these people actually told me that he just doesn't like to use sometimes

896
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:04,896
The nerdy terms

897
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:10,016
You know that that you and I are very familiar with it cuz he wants to kind of speak to the laminin

898
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:12,576
Internet of things is something that

899
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:15,136
Nick Milana is still struggling with her quite candid

900
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,208
President Obama

901
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,232
Use the

902
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:21,024
Use those words per say

903
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:26,912
Going forward I mean I think this is going to continue moving forward

904
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:29,728
The way it kind of is right now I don't get a sense that there's any

905
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,800
Effort underway to create an Internet of Things

906
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:34,336
Apartment or Internet of Things

907
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:37,664
Pacific law

908
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,432
Probably

909
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:39,456
Payback

910
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:41,760
On this like the industry is urging him to do

911
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:45,088
At the same time as I mentioned before having a lot of you ladies are

912
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:46,624
Competing for

913
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:51,744
And starting to get engaged on this issue summer doing it more proactively like the SDA

914
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,536
The transportation department

915
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:58,144
The FAA with respected drones in a lot of these are can actually be issuing rules that are going to affect

916
00:37:58,656 --> 00:37:59,936
Decisions made by businesses

917
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:00,704
Usher

918
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,288
It sounds like that it's more of the same will get piecemeal efforts

919
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:05,568
That

920
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:07,872
Embody that light-touch regulation

921
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:08,896
For the internet

922
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,480
And I think that's to be expected I think in one of those things

923
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:15,296
Editor's would ask me to do and I really enjoyed this part of the story

924
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:17,344
Honestly one of the very first questions

925
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,648
I was asking if myself when I started out with

926
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:24,768
What about other big technological innovations how long does it take Washington to respond

927
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:28,608
3

928
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,168
And the airplane and Telegraph

929
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:36,032
And the railroad will it be before that I went and I started asking historians will you know how long did it take

930
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:42,432
It was that case I mean the railroad is interesting example

931
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:43,200
70s men

932
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:44,736
It takes another

933
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:48,832
20 years before you get the Interstate Commerce Commission starts to regulate

934
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:55,232
On that front door automobiles the great again Henry Ford pumps out the Model T at the start of the 20th century

935
00:38:55,744 --> 00:39:00,352
But doesn't actually for seatbelts in the cars until the 1960s 1970s

936
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:02,912
Yeah so it sounds like we're going to eat we might

937
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:09,568
I might be in for a rocky few decades with the Privacy then it sounds like I know is a consumer that's a big

938
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:10,336
Issue

939
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:11,104
4

940
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:13,664
People in the internet of things and I think

941
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:17,248
Is there anything to the idea that technology moves

942
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:21,600
So much faster today I mean you look at regulations for the internet I mean

943
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:24,416
Not that the railroad in the car we're not huge significant

944
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:25,184
And things

945
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,488
And intent of milestones in

946
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,560
Both are economic and you know social

947
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:31,328
Development

948
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,352
But

949
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:36,448
The internet for example is already disrupting things is 25 years old

950
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:39,520
We are still trying to adapt our laws to deal with

951
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:41,312
Kind of the holistic

952
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:42,080
World of

953
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:43,872
Everything being connected right

954
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,200
And so when you look at the internet of things which is

955
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:52,064
It's been 25 years but we're basically saying hey you know what let's take the internet and like

956
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,088
Put it into light

957
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:54,112
* 1000

958
00:39:55,136 --> 00:40:00,256
Yeah yeah absolutely there hasn't been much regulation on the internet and I think that's maybe why

959
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:01,024
It is

960
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,096
Do transform society as much as it has and hasn't really blocked

961
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:06,400
That many Innovations over the last

962
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:08,704
Two and a half decades and seems to be

963
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:11,008
At this point the lesson that

964
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:13,312
Graphic policymakers in Washington

965
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:14,336
Have learned

966
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:15,104
Is

967
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,128
Hang back and

968
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:19,200
And don't get too engaged in and let the market

969
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:22,784
Sort itself out when you have a company going and then having a big privacy here

970
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:23,808
Security breach

971
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:27,904
And that's something I heard over and over that company will probably be headed for the exits

972
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,952
Has people turning their competitors

973
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:30,976
To buy up whatever

974
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:33,280
An alternative they can so

975
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:35,584
I mean I think there's going to be regulation

976
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,400
You know what is a pointed out of the Peace

977
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:44,032
If something big happens if there's some Calamity of some kind that we can't quite Envision in the moment

978
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:47,616
You know I should have asked people give me your doomsday scenarios while I was reporting it

979
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:50,176
Pick up all sorts of crazy things

980
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:51,200
People envision

981
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:53,248
Happening because of the Internet of Things

982
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:56,576
And maybe a crisis would wake Washington uphill of course Racine

983
00:40:56,832 --> 00:41:01,184
In a big crisis has on a whole host of other issues with IP infrastructure and

984
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,232
You're not replacing the bridge after

985
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:06,304
She's not doing big things after we have a major Bridge collapses

986
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:07,840
In Minnesota

987
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:08,864
Or

988
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:12,192
You know the fiscal crisis that we faced and all those deadlines

989
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:14,240
Drive Congress to act either

990
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:19,360
So you know Washington is pretty broken it's been broken for the last couple of years

991
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:23,712
Legislative front for President Obama he's in he's obviously done a lot of things

992
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:26,784
Reviews on executive powers because Congress

993
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:27,808
Subdivided

994
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:32,416
So I think it's as long as Washington's broken as well just another factor to keep an eye on

995
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:34,208
We're not going to see much on the

996
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:35,488
Passage of new laws

997
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:37,792
And that leadeth into the agency

998
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:40,864
So then I will tell people carry on and watch out for the Aged

999
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:42,400
Add

1000
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:45,216
In terms of you personally

1001
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,032
How do you view this because you did

1002
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:51,360
You bought the sea it looks like a Fitbit at Dropcam

1003
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:55,455
What else did what else did you buy to connect yourself to The Internet of Things

1004
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:56,991
And what did you think about your

1005
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:58,271
Really fun I mean

1006
00:41:58,527 --> 00:42:02,623
It was an idea that we kind of came up with how many things can I get my hands on in like a week

1007
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:06,207
I ended up with a Fitbit to Fitbit

1008
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:10,303
Bought a nest thermostat about the smoke detector and the Dropcam

1009
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:16,191
I Got a Car connect which was allowing let me sort of Texas temperature of my car as I was driving around

1010
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:19,775
I'll see what else do they have electric toothbrush the beam

1011
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:24,127
Toothbrush was told me that I was the smiley faces when I rushed for more than 2 minutes

1012
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:30,527
So yeah I was doing all of these things at Mercedes Benz dropped off a car for the weekend I was able to drive a semi autonomous car for

1013
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:33,855
Sweet machine

1014
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:37,439
I will say this is fastening so the Mercedes sent the car over

1015
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:41,023
The guy who delivered it we were you showing me everything

1016
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:42,559
You know the dashboard

1017
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:43,839
I was asking about the

1018
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:47,679
The parallel parking assist any kind of looked at me since man I don't use that I like to parallel park

1019
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:49,727
And I just thought it was

1020
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:55,871
So true because I tried to do it a couple of times and ultimately I just I prefer to parallel park myself and maybe that's the generational thing

1021
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:58,943
So which of these devices that you tried

1022
00:42:59,199 --> 00:42:59,967
Did you find any that

1023
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:00,991
You couldn't live without

1024
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:07,391
I will say that I really enjoy the nest that one we didn't get rid of forked over the cash for that myself and

1025
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:11,487
I've started noticing that I can I probably could go back to what I already have

1026
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:15,327
I've already had the wires for pretty complicated to pull it out

1027
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:17,375
Pull the old thermostat out of the new one in

1028
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:23,519
Dropcam was kind of fun we've been using a time really to watch a cat's back in the day

1029
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:26,847
You know I could probably live without nutmeg. They're doing cuz I'm pretty much sleeping

1030
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:29,151
Are the toothbrush obviously it's kind of

1031
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:31,455
Something now that it has replaced my old toothbrush

1032
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:34,015
In my bathroom and

1033
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:40,415
Your other than that I'm happy with the old 2008 Subaru that I drive which is totally unconnected except for

1034
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:44,767
I do not hook up my iPhone iTunes to it but that's pretty much it

1035
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:45,791
On the car

1036
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:48,863
So you know I think I'm uncomfortable living in in

1037
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:49,631
20

1038
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:52,447
2012 here in 2015 but

1039
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:56,799
I feel like I'll so it's just a matter of time before when I start buying the Next Generation and everything

1040
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:59,359
It's probably going to be in minesing Schenectady

1041
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:03,711
Voltaren thank you so much for talking to me about this stuff I appreciate your

1042
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:07,039
Your look at your look at Washington DC and a sense of

1043
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:07,807
What

1044
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:10,111
What the capital is doing about the internet of things which

1045
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:12,927
Sounds like it's not much and it'll be pretty reactive

1046
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:15,487
That's how Congress off handles

1047
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:16,511
Adidas react

1048
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:22,911
Awesome alright well thank you so much for coming that's it for today thank you

1049
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:29,311
You so much for listening
