00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:14,848
Hey everyone welcome to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacy Higginbotham and this is your surprise

2
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:15,872
Why is co-host

3
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:17,152
Grant clauser

4
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:20,480
So Grant is joining us in place of Kevin

5
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:21,760
Because Kevin is

6
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:22,784
Traveling

7
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:25,344
But do not think that this

8
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:27,136
Because Grant

9
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:29,696
Is the Smart Home editor at The Wirecutter

10
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:33,536
So we have an opportunity to talk to someone who is not just like

11
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:36,864
Well he might even be better than Kevin don't tell Kevin I said

12
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:41,728
Grant good to have you co-hosting the show with

13
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,008

Channel 4

21
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,368
For Louisville Kentucky

22
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:01,440
We're going to talk about your smart TV spying on you

23
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:04,256
We got a kitchen m&a deal we've got

24
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:05,280
Echo

25
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:06,560
Chitin chat

26
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,608
How I'm going to call that

27
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,632
We've got

28
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:11,936
Europe's big Cydia show happen

29
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:13,472
Right now with some exciting news

30
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:14,240
Who's there

31
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:15,776
Some security products

32
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:16,544
But first

33
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:18,848
Let's get a message from our sponsor

Ayla networks as an Enterprise internet-of-things platform that is empowering the world's leading manufacturers by simplifying

36
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:34,208
Apparent complexity at the iot enabling them to turn their products into smart connected systems and transport

AC on iot. Com Ela and that's a y l a

42
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:10,048
And before we get started with the show I'd like to ask you guys a little bit of a favor

43
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,328

49
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,880
All right back to the show

50
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:36,928
Oh I almost forgot

51
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:41,792
This week's guest is Bruce Sterling who is the famous science-fiction author and

52
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:47,680
Futurist he is also building a smart home lab in Italy and we're going to talk about all of those things

53
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:48,704
So

54
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,728
Stay tuned for that

55
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:51,776
Grant

56
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,824
All that out of the way

57
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,128
Thank you for doing this let's get started

58
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,152
With

59
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,688
The if this then that channel

60
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,712
Louisville

61
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:00,736
Chucky

62
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:05,088
I think this is awesome so Louisville

63
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:07,392
You guys maybe like more familiar with it

64
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:09,696
And you realize because that's where CNET smart

65
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:13,024
Was that actually put it on the market now they've got a smart apartment

66
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,304
Building and

67
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,424
What's happening in Louisville Kentucky is connecting be created and if this then that

68
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:26,336
And so one of the things you can do is take your Philips Hue smart light bulbs and when the city of seas bad air quality

69
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,104
City data

70
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,640
They can turn your hue light bulbs red

71
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:31,456
How big of a problem is this in Louisville

72
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,528
I don't know I've never been to Louisville I kind of feeling bad about it

73
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:37,856
Maybe the barbecue Smoke Gets in there and

74
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:39,904
That would be

75
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,672
That would be

76
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:44,768
I would rather have the lights change color when the barbecue is ready

77
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,816
That is totally doable

78
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:48,864
I think Char-Broil Char-Broil has a

79
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,632
Make it smoke right now

80
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:58,336
I better be pretty easy to do this yourself with an in-home air quality sensor of some sort

81
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:00,384
You could or you could

82
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,152
Probably

83
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:06,016
Because they've got an interest in that channel they probably have an API which means

84
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,808
If you could access it you

85
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:09,088
You could do it with

86
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,904
If you didn't want to do your lights for example

87
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,440
You can do it too

88
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:16,000
I know what a little alarm that teens

89
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,536
Send a text message

90
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,815
Since you're something to alert you to

91
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,607
Put on the gas mask

92
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,399
Three. But that's a little harder

93
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:23,679
Also

94
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,959
If this then that

95
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:25,727
Sounds good

96
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:28,031
I know that we had a woman on the podcast

97
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:31,103
Weeks ago she actually did a connected

98
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:34,175
She took Transit data for the city of London buses

99
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:38,527
And she built something that basically told people when the bus was 5 minutes away

100
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:39,807
The light returned

101
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,599
Orange

102
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:42,623
Yellow

103
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,951
When it was 2 minutes away it would

104
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:46,719
Red

105
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,999
So you got a chance to

106
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,791
Like the bus is coming quick

107
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:53,887
So I think those kind of things would be great although again

108
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,167
I don't know how many people take public

109
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:59,263
Well the other problem is it is known as

110
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:02,079
Quick so well the bus could be gone by the time

111
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:05,919
What's the message goes back and forth to the Cloud Server and turns you like color

112
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,199
That is true

113
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,223
Alright so

114
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,247
Transit stuff

115
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:10,527
That's a

116
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,551
Good question about

117
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,319
At the light bulb

118
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,343
Grecian

119
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,879
Like how long does it

120
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:18,207
With air quality to guess

121
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:21,791
If it was a 30 second delay it's not going to be a big deal because

122
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:24,607
Then you wouldn't have choked to death by then but

123
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,423
Something that's really time-sensitive

124
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:31,007
I think it'd be a better way to to better public alert system

125
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,543
There you go so

126
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,591
But I also think it's nice that

127
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:36,383
You know Louisville is actually expire

128
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,151
Flooring something

129
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:37,919
Like this

130
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:40,479
Because it is it brings that kind of data to

131
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,271
Are citizen levels

132
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,807
If you can actually you know

133
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,879
He's at this and that to pull data streams into a spreadsheet

134
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,183
Could be something as mundane as I

135
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:49,951
Charting it

136
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:52,255
What also makes it interesting is that

137
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:55,071
Create new stories like this and help

138
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:59,167
Spread awareness of the types of features that the things that you can do with

139
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:03,007
With smart home devices that I talked to a lot of people who

140
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:08,895
Who wanders in why would I want a light bulb that changes color or this and that and

141
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:14,015
Looking into some more interesting applications of this technology I think it is always a good thing

142
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:16,831
Speaking of what people are doing with

143
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,647
Let's talk about Vizio

144
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:20,927
Holy cow

145
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:23,487
Grant do you want to share with Vizio

146
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:29,119
Well what does you're doing right now is just paying a fine for things that they did a while ago

147
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:32,447
It was revealed that their TVs were

148
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:35,775
Tracking and sharing information of the other internet connection

149
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:41,663
And they kind of got caught and now the total pay a big fine for that we cover this when it first came out

150
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,943
The models that

151
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,479
Did this

152
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:47,039
Who does is they had a

153
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,063
An opt-out map

154
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,879
You didn't opt in to allow your data.

155
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:53,183
Opted out of it and they made it

156
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:53,951
It's hard to

157
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:56,767
To find out where you can opt out this exchanged

158
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,839
But I think the bigger story is that it's not just Vizio it's

159
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:02,655
Almost anything that plugs into the internet is doing this kind of thing

160
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,423
Sangria

161
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:06,751
We did a privacy blog about this last year

162
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:07,775
And

163
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,311
We looked at the privacy

164
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,591
And data collection

165
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,895
Processes or policies

166
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,455
Standard

167
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:20,831
Internet-connected devices from your streaming media services to just standard web browsers

168
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,111
And it's

169
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:25,951
Some people may be other people

170
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:28,255
Program but a lot of people be shocked at

171
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,791
How much information

172
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:34,143
Manufacturers rubber companies have about you just based on

173
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,191
What's plugged into your house in

174
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:39,263
And what you're watching on TV and what you're doing online

175
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,799
Agree with you there is like

176
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,591
Any connected product

177
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,359
Is also

178
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,383
Giving your data

179
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:46,943
Sharing.

180
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,503
But what I did find

181
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:50,783
Upsetting

182
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,063
About the Vizio

183
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,087
Details

184
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,623
What was that it was

185
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:55,647
Hidden

186
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:56,671
Very well

187
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,255
Activity

188
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,791
And basically they were like

189
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:04,351
This enables program offers and suggestions

190
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,399
Which is kind of what Netflix does

191
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,935
Netflix also

192
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,215
Watch

193
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:09,983
What

194
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,007
What's does it do

195
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:11,775
Who is track

196
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:12,799
Other services

197
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:13,567
Just going over there

198
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:15,615
I can't

199
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:20,223
So did the other thing is it provided customers IP

200
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,527
The address yeah that's a sneaky Park

201
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,599
This is where I feel with the smart home and

202
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:26,879
Connected devices

203
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:29,183
Our idea of personally identifiable

204
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,207
Call information

205
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:33,279
Is going to have so what's known in the trade is pii

206
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,327
Is isn't sufficient

207
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,607
Basically

208
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:39,167
Where we've got so much data that can be

209
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:43,263
Triggered back to us like I'm probably the only one in my

210
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,591
Austin Texas which feels like

211
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:48,639
There's a woman in Austin Texas

212
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:49,663
You know

213
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:52,223
Who has these characteristics

214
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,271
You actually probably could identify me

215
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,039
From Lake

216
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:58,879
My IP address yes you could identify

217
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:02,719
From a cluster of different devices that are in my house

218
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,255
What turns everything into pee

219
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,815
What will somewhere

220
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:10,143
Yes or lots of places probably there's a profile of Stacy

221
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,215
Of what she owns what she does in her house

222
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,263
Know what her her standard

223
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,079
Temperature is how often she

224
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,615
Opens and closes your door

225
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:23,711
I thought it was

226
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:24,991
Because I was like

227
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,015
My husband

228
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,343
He's like yeah I know I could

229
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,111
Cooking

230
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,439
That's weird

231
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:37,791
Potato ad

232
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:40,095
No coming in a year

233
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:43,423
Coming up next showing up on

234
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:45,215
Yeah your browser what's on

235
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,239
Pandora

236
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,519
I would like to see if

237
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,055
Buy potatoes

238
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:49,823
They're delicious

239
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:54,687
The Other Woman I thought was disconcerting about this was

240
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:56,479
And you mentioned it is the opt-out

241
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,783
You're automatically opted-in to Olive

242
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,575
And that's actually the way

243
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,599
List my devices

244
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,391
Standard

245
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,159
Yeah

246
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:04,927
End

247
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:09,791
I don't know if you guys notice others are covered it but there was a lawsuit actually a couple

248
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:13,119
A couple months ago about a connected vibrator in the

249
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,399
The people who purchased it

250
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:15,679
Didn't realize it

251
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:16,703
There

252
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,471
Sessions

253
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,007
A toy would be

254
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:21,055
Sent to the manufacturer

255
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:21,823
With the settings

256
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:26,175
And that and the standard

257
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:28,735
Responsible manufacturers is

258
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,527
So we can improve the product

259
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:31,551
Witches of

260
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:33,343
Open the door

261
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:36,927
I mean there are good things with this like if you

262
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:37,695
You can approve

263
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,463
The product

264
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:44,351
You can actually do really interesting like it if my TV gave data about like what it was on and what I like to watch

265
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:47,167
You might be able to do some Energy Efficiency

266
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,191
Things you know

267
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:51,007
Like the show that she loves is about to come on

268
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:54,591
Add Sesame I watch TV in real-time which most people don't

269
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:59,455
You know you can you can start to plan for things around that in the TV could be turned off

270
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,479
Completely off

271
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,503
And then try to

272
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:02,527
Fire up

273
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:03,807
But that's not what they were

274
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:08,415
You're just selling your data and I think that's that's a model that

275
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:11,743
If we don't fix that it's going to engender a lot of distrust and

276
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,767
People are not going to want some

277
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:16,351
And probably one of the reasons that model has

278
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,887
Has grown

279
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,167
Cuz it could but

280
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,703
To the pressure to keep

281
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:23,775
Prices on the hardware constantly going down

282
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:26,591
It's got to come up with some of the revenue stream so

283
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:28,383
The customer becomes the product

284
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,711
I think that's going to go to Wayside actually

285
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:33,759
I think we're going to see

286
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:34,527
See a lot of ships

287
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:39,135
We'll see I'll have to come back on next time next time Kevin's traveling

288
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,415
In February I'll be like

289
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,463
Did it come to pass I don't know

290
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,743
Let's talk about

291
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,791
Attention. Because I love kitchentek

292
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:46,559
How do you feel about that

293
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,863
I'm on the fence

294
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,143
Smart Home in the kitchen

295
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:54,751
If it's something that I need to be in front of

296
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,799
To experience to appreciate

297
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,079
I don't need to get

298
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,615
Alerts to my phone

299
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,663
Front door Decor that's hurting

300
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:04,223
Maybe when I buy some

301
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,015
Smart kitchen

302
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:08,831
Crock-Pot or something else change my mind but at the moment

303
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:11,647
I don't have a smart coffee maker I mean the

304
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:15,231
Echo in the kitchen that has the timer button

305
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:17,791
Grant if you were standing in front of

306
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:24,959
I work at home so I don't leave the house

307
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,495
I have the same

308
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,799
So here is the news

309
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,079
Electrolux

310
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,639
Consumer Appliance

311
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:35,711
Bought a company called Innova

312
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:37,247
Ana Nova

313
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:41,087
You guys may be familiar with it because they make a sous vide circulator

314
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,367
I have a connected one

315
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:45,695
I've really basically all this is is something that

316
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:47,743
Bluest water around

317
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,535
I'm keeps it at a certain temperature so you can

318
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,815
Can cook your eggs at like

319
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,887
120 degrees

320
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,679
In a little plastic bag

321
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:57,215
To the perfectly done

322
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:58,239
Or your meat

323
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,799
I I don't know what like do you sous-vide

324
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,615
I know I know I know there a lot of

325
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,407
At Wirecutter

326
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,687
And in fact

327
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:12,319
The Anova Precision cooker is is our choice in in the guy that we

328
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,343
Mapreduce

329
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:16,671
Our tribe

330
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,207
Just haven't gotten around to it

331
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:20,255
It makes me think of boil in a bag food

332
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,535
But I know it's not that

333
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,327
It's supposedly

334
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:27,167
Way better like I've had I've I played with it a while back in

335
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,191
Can gear Wirecutter

336
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:31,519
People they're so good because that is a really awesome product

337
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:34,079
Electrolux plant brand

338
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,359
As they entered in this

339
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,383
Market in

340
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,687
And nobody actually said that they plan to

341
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:43,551
To do some additional Hardware around the smart home possibly even a Smart Oven

342
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,319
At 8

343
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:46,111
Connected kitchen show that I was at

344
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,391
In October

345
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:48,415
So

346
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:50,207
It could be that you know

347
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:55,839
We'll see a smart connected oven which means that the wire cutters totally get on that

348
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,375
Beat in like a year or so

349
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:02,495
We were looking at a lot of smart appliances at CES this year

350
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,311
We tend to think that

351
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:10,431
Or not internet-connected kitchen appliances is it going to be the default

352
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:11,967
No sooner than later

353
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:17,855
For some applications I think it makes great sense that I haven't used them really myself just sort of

354
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:20,415
Cinema at trade shows and whatnot.

355
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:22,207
I think there's a

356
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:25,279
Everything is is getting chips in it's going to happen

357
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:28,095
What's your ideal refrigerator

358
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,375
If you're going to have connectivity there

359
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:35,775
I don't know I want a refrigerator that doesn't leak cuz that's what I've got right now

360
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:36,799
It's okay

361
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,359
That's terrible I'm going to suggest you

362
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,151
You get there

363
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:46,015
I got nothing else

364
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:46,783
Okay

365
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,575
So there is this

366
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:50,111
Crazy rumor going around

367
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:50,879
The hue

368
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:53,183
Actually you tweeted this this is about

369
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:55,487
Possible upgrades to the echo

370
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,511
And I'd love to hear your take

371
00:14:57,535 --> 00:15:00,351
Okay what are on a on a Facebook

372
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,143
Group for Echo users

373
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:05,215
Is someone posted a picture of their app

374
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,495
The settings

375
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:09,055
Part of her app that showed that

376
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:12,895
Their app had a new feature called synchronized audio

377
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:15,967
And the short description on there was it it was too

378
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:20,575
Synchronize audio among different Echo devices you remain after your. And what not

379
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:23,391
Which would give it a similar ability to

380
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:28,255
Twitter Sonos has system has or what the Google home can do and that you can play

381
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:33,375
The same music all over the house and it's synchronized and people watching this

382
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,167
This Thread we're going nuts

383
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:38,751
I've tried to verify this the screenshot look legitimate

384
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:42,079
But I've contacted all my Amazon contact

385
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,871
And they won't say anything

386
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:48,479
And I'm getting ignored so I'm wondering if this is

387
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:53,855
Somebody just playing around with Photoshop or it's a real thing I hope it's a real thing because

388
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,135
It'd be an excellent feature

389
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:57,439
You would have play your

390
00:15:57,695 --> 00:16:01,023
Your Amazon music or what not all over the house and be a lot cheaper than

391
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,303
Like a Sonos system

392
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:06,143
Multi-room audio is basically like I play things on one Echo

393
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:09,983
I actually so we kind of jerry-rigged

394
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:13,823
Spotify

395
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:14,847
Connection

396
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:18,687
So this is a common question we actually get a lot on the show

397
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:20,735
Echo versus

398
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:24,319
And so since you guys have this amazing

399
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:26,111
Review product reviews

400
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:28,159
What are you guys

401
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,183
Recommending to

402
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:31,231
What features do you have

403
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:35,327
What overall reviews

404
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:39,167
I think of the two Echo versus home the echo is

405
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,703
Is better and most of the

406
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:41,983
We did

407
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:46,079
Very detailed sound measurements and blind listening test

408
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,615
An echo

409
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:49,919
Came out over home a little bit not much

410
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:54,271
And it also tested better as a listener in most situations

411
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,039
But not all

412
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:58,111
I'm actually Google home is better hearing you

413
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:00,671
While it's playing music then than Echo is

414
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:03,487
An echo dot has more smart home Integrations

415
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:07,327
Google homes is better at searches if you ask a question

416
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,375
And as we were talking earlier it's

417
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:11,679
Understands language more naturally than

418
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,471
Then I go does sometimes you got to

419
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:15,263
Twist yourself into knots ticket

420
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,799
Exactly the right phrasing

421
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:18,847
To turn your lights off or something

422
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:20,383
Anal with with Echo so

423
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:23,455
Both of them recommend

424
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:26,527
People who don't have a lot of smart home experience

425
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:28,831
Tempered expectations a little bit

426
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:32,671
It's not going to completely change the world you got to learn how to use a prop

427
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,207
Khalifa

428
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,999
They're almost the same

429
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,791
We tend to think that

430
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:42,655
More people be satisfied with with a Coleman home but it's not a dramatic difference

431
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:44,959
Okay

432
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:47,007
And now we're going to get to the

433
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,287
Professional

434
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,847
Slash old school smart home stuff

435
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,127
The show because

436
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:54,687
Great you were actually an old

437
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,479
We are home installation

438
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:03,647
I'm certified to design control for systems of I haven't done it in my

439
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:06,463
My knowledge of their programming up-to-date lately

440
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:11,839
And for many years I was the online editor for electronic house and we covered the

441
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,375
The professional smart Hallmark

442
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,935
I've been in a lot of homes

443
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,471
With high interest

444
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,287
Okay

445
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,567
Old school

446
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:24,127
I know they never do

447
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:27,711
So what's happening right now is a show called Integrated Systems

448
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:30,271
That's over in Amsterdam in

449
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,319
Ayad mentally call it the city of your

450
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:35,391
This is for professional installers you see a lot of

451
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,415
Really cool

452
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:39,487
Light bulbs some news is coming out

453
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:41,279
So two bits a newsletter

454
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,303
Someone interesting

455
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:43,327
Is

456
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,119
One control for

457
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:48,959
Has integrated with the Amazon Echo in the UK they had had a

458
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:51,263
They did it actually last years CD

459
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:52,287
Here forth

460
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,055
You asked

461
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,847
And then also Crestron

462
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:55,871
Which

463
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:56,895
Has a

464
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,687
Professional commercial install

465
00:18:58,943 --> 00:18:59,455
Club Mercury

466
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:00,735
They actually

467
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:03,039
Are announcing that that they have

468
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,575
Crestron Mercury

469
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:08,159
For in-room meeting so it's an all-in-one meeting room

470
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:09,183
Product

471
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:09,951
From them

472
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:10,719
Did they announce the

473
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:13,023
And they're working with polycom and Microsoft

474
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:17,887
This is interesting because a couple other companies like Citrix is using it

475
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:19,935
Tableau platform to do this

476
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:24,543
Some people are hobbling leasing cobbling machines together with Amazon Echo

477
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:25,567
So

478
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:27,359
There's definitely demand for Stuff

479
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:29,919
And now here's what we get grants

480
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:34,527
Let's talk about what would you advise

481
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,623
I get a lot of people that like Stacy how come you never talk about insteon

482
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,159
Crestron or

483
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,183
Or Supply.

484
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,719
And I talked about him a little

485
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:46,559
The professionally installed systems

486
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:49,375
Pictures of on Crestron control for Elan

487
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,911
Yeah there's a couple more

488
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,447
It's a whole different

489
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:54,239
Experience than what you can

490
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,519
To do with Saya

491
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:58,335
A wink or SmartThings

492
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:00,895
The relation is going to

493
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:03,711
No clean and basically invisible

494
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:07,807
You want to have snow Blinky sensors all over the place

495
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:09,087
Telling people who

496
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:11,647
Who come over and visit the home gadgets everywhere

497
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,183
The experiences

498
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,975
Once again installer will do when they

499
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:17,791
When they're setting up your system is so come on sit down with you

500
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,327
And just talk about

501
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:22,399
What you do in the house talk about your lifestyle

502
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:25,471
And then design the functionality of the system really around that

503
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:29,823
That's a lot of money a beginning one-room system

504
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,359
Might be

505
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:32,639
5 grand

506
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:35,967
Just run the DAV in the temperature in one room

507
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:39,295
The level of function that you can get with love you do it yourself

508
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,831
Is getting much better

509
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:43,135
But the reliability doesn't match that of the

510
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,159
Prosystems

511
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:44,927
And I agree with

512
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:46,207
If you I would also

513
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:49,023
Say that anytime your circumstances change on the

514
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,559
The prosystems you have to call them

515
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,327
Back out again

516
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:52,863
Well you have to

517
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:57,727
Call to call him back out anymore because they're they're getting much better with

518
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:00,287
Cloud access to your system if there isn't something

519
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,311
Physically

520
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:03,103
You know wrong if it's some

521
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:04,639
Switch that they can do

522
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:06,431
No freezer on computers

523
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,199
Google web

524
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:10,271
Most can do that but

525
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:11,551
I should say you buy a new Blu-ray

526
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:15,135
And you want to hook it up to your home theater can't really do that yourself

527
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:16,672
She got to call his daughter to come back

528
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:22,560
Look up right things and then do a little programming magic into your system so yeah it's um

529
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,096
This car sticker

530
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:28,960
That's what they all say

531
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:32,288
What do you think

532
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,080
I have no evidence

533
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:35,872
EXO

534
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:39,200
Everyone should always have a little bit of paranoia but not too much

535
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:41,248
But that's just that just you know

536
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,040
Goes without saying in most of life

537
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:49,184
All right and I brought this up because I have neglected to tell you guys about this for a while and I actually think it's pretty cool

538
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,464
The almonds

539
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,232
3

540
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,000
Router

541
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:54,816
Which I talked about the past because it's not just a mess

542
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:56,608
Wi-Fi network it's also

543
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,168
A smart home control system

544
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:00,704
Has a signature

545
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,472
Chip in there and

546
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:03,008
Very nice Caesar

547
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:03,776
Interface

548
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:08,384
And I think it's TSA actually announced an alarm so now it also doubles as like

549
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:10,176
Oh crap button

550
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:11,200
Which

551
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:16,064
They've added iot security to their device

552
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,112
So basically it knows

553
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:19,648
Because it knows what's on your network

554
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,696
It will check your

555
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:23,232
Network for vulnerabilities on

556
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,256
Play spices everyday

557
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,304
And when it

558
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:30,656
She's devices that are going out to sites that look suspicious it will block

559
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,192
So

560
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:36,544
That's that's actually really cool and you can also see the data usage which

561
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,848
If like you were infected by the Mirai botnet

562
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:40,128
On one of your cameras

563
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:43,712
You would notice that because your cameras would be consuming a lot of

564
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,760
You probably wouldn't notice it

565
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:47,040
Any other way unless you lie

566
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:49,088
Like physically went up to feel them and they were super hot

567
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:49,856
Cuz they were just

568
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:50,624
Running

569
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,392
Cuz he's our

570
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:52,672
It's not like a computer

571
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:56,768
Sonic's we got this was really good and then Grant told me that

572
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:59,072
You guys are actually working on something right now.

573
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,096
Wirecutter

574
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:06,752
Yeah because it's a security for your smart home devices has has become such a question would we get

575
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:08,544
About it all the time

576
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,616
That we're going to be a developing a guidon

577
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:13,152
Devices like this

578
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:17,248
I saw the Almond at CES and I think that's a pretty interesting one

579
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:20,320
That I was intrigued by Izzy

580
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,856
They keep a profile

581
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:26,208
Of some of the top smart home devices I think right now they've got about 20

582
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,024
Which one has the Hue bulbs and nest

583
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,304
And that profile

584
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:34,656
Is of the sort of the standard operating parameters of that device

585
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:36,192
And if it notices that

586
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:37,216
Your

587
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:40,800
Nestor baldwood not goes out of those parameters it tells you it says

588
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:41,824
Something's not right

589
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:44,128
It could be suspicious and could not

590
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,456
I will also tell you what ports are open and what ports are in

591
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,016
I think the challenges is translating

592
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:51,296
That information

593
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,064
Into

594
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,856
In a sort of actionable

595
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:56,416
Languages that the average consumer knows what to do with

596
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:59,744
And that is the hard part Del Alma.

597
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,304
A pretty nice job it gives you these alerts and then

598
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,608
You know it it gives you a little bit of like

599
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:05,888
What you can do

600
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,680
I don't know if that one of the options

601
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:08,704
Is Burnet at this

602
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:13,568
Look if he's got the infected

603
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:17,664
You know if you got cameras that are affected by the Mirai botnet but the hard-coded password

604
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,944
It just dump that

605
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:20,224
It's no good to you

606
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:23,296
So we'll see most of the devices

607
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,832
We talked about on this show

608
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:29,184
Are over-the-air upgradeable in so you should expect actually to see

609
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,208
Patches come

610
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,000
Pretenders and then yes you should Def

611
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:38,144
All right we'll print thanks so much for coming on the show this week I think you were an amazing

612
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:39,936
In an even better Grant

613
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:41,216

00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:34,880
I I know I say this every time you guys but I really am I'm super excited to have Bruce on the show because he is a science fiction author he is

655
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:41,280
Is also used to come to South by Southwest end the show

656
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:42,816
With like these really

657
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:43,584

Really interesting and

662
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:54,080
I think really difficult

663
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:54,848
So

664
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:57,152
And I'm going to link to this in the show notes but

665
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:59,200
You have a Flickr page where you are in

666
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:00,480
Is it Torino Italy

667
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:02,528
Does Rihanna wear in Turin

668
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,808
Torrid okay

00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,856
Robert cirino as the Italians with

670
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:09,440
I prefer to call it okay I was a little confused about that I was like

671
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,720
Shroud of

672
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:12,256
Okay

673
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:16,608
So you're in Turin Italy and you are building Casa Jasmina

674
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,632
Can you tell me why

675
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:22,496
Are we came to turn my wife yasmina and I

676
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:24,032
Some years back because

677
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:30,432
Curators of a local electronic art fair which is called share Festival

678
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:36,832
Journalist but I also like to write about design and especially keen on electronic card

679
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:39,904
Signs of Life or send high technology art set

680
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:42,464
We were hanging out with

681
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:45,280
Serenity Electronics

682
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:49,888
Some of them were makers and some of them where I go you know guys and some of us just you know

683
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,680
Weird weekend hippie

684
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:53,216
Aren't people

685
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:55,264
But we befriended

686
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,800
I became quite close to them

687
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,640
Build a house

688
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:01,664
The house

689
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:05,504
Where were you been carrying out some of these electronic activities

690
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:07,296
So the house is

691
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:09,600
It looks like from the pictures that you guys

692
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:10,368
Took out

693
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,416
An older house and you

694
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:13,184
You're basically

695
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:13,952
You retrofit

696
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:17,280
Well what it is is an old Fiat founder

697
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,584
Car company here in

698
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:22,400
They're building

699
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:27,520
This particular building is

700
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:29,056
Fablab in it

701
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:31,360
It had the Arduino offices

702
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:34,176
Design coworker

703
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:34,944
Space

704
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:35,712
Moscato

705
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:37,760
Print shop

706
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:47,232
A combination of light and a place to piss domestic tools

707
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:52,096
I know they'll a little show class at a place where we have cultural events

708
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,376
Okay and

709
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:55,168
This is a house for me curso

710
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:56,448
What does that

711
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:57,472
Mean to you

712
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,544
Kwik King on Internet of Things

713
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,312
Issues

714
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:03,360
Cuz that I've been I've been writing about

715
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:07,968
For a long time and used to write science fiction about that kind of densely Network

716
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:09,504
Connected world

717
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:14,880
We do

718
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:20,256
So they're just like all let's let Bruce of jazz Meetup be like the curator in the hostess

719
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:21,536
Of our space

720
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:24,864
Set of roused

721
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,144
People among our group of

722
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:26,912
Creative

723
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:29,728
And I'm the curator in the sense that

724
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:32,544
I say what goes into the place and what we

725
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:36,128
This is a very Lively make her scene

726
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:42,016
So it always are pretty to a lot of this stuff and

727
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:44,832
I used to be a columnist for Make magazine so I

728
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:47,648
Do people at the O'Reilly Circle

729
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:49,440
Make her seed in Europe

730
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:53,280
Just because I know a lot of people who were doing it and they do stuff

731
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:56,864
Just wouldn't see in the US and I find that of credit interest

732
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,448
So what are the sorts of things you're putting in Casa.

733
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:07,360
Well you know it's mostly stuff that we either made or had given to us and it's mostly open source.

734
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:09,408
We just ended that means

735
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:11,968
Protection

736
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:13,504
Table

737
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,344
Feel like a multimedia set in the area tile big screens and

738
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:20,672
Kind of hardware

RT Podcast

742
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:30,144
Like the lighting system in

What translates to how we're going to live in the future

756
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,192
Or

757
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:07,520
How you might build a house for normal people in the few

758

Surveillance marketing

But it's our policy not to about people in the house

770
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:54,368
We have a feminist group in this house the internet of women things

771
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,904
It's been a lot of time

772
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:59,744
Considering domestic issues like why does a wife

773
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,048
Mother want these devices in her house

774
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:05,120
How do they change the way people relate to one another

775
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:08,192
These are kind of intimate cultural issues

776
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,008
By people who

777
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:13,568

The tenor of society in the long run

00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,968
What are some of the

00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:22,784
Domestic or cultural issues that you see from

Nativity indoor

784
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:32,256
Well it wasn't quite good book that was written I don't know maybe 10 years ago by Adam Greenfield there's a friend of mine

785
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:34,048
Everywhere

786
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:36,096
Iwa re re

787
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:37,888
Speculating

788
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:38,912
Kind of

789
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:42,240
They're all personal effects at this kind of ubiquitous

790
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,800
Answer the things he said

791
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:45,568
What time

792
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:46,592
Really shocked

793
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:48,384
Weather

794
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,432
This declaration was that

795
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,712
Mobile devices

796
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:54,528
Change cities more than cars have

797
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,600
Oh come on this is pure height

798
00:32:57,856 --> 00:33:01,184
How could that possibly happen and you know I think it's coming true

799
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:08,864
Yeah you can actually set of see it on the streets Jedi with the other kinds of

800
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:15,008
We got Lites strange little electronic rentable cars in our neighborhood now

801
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:17,312
Things Adam talked about

802
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:19,616
Differential permission

803
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:22,688
I'd like to set up a system to automate

804
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:23,456
Your house

805
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:25,760
And it kind of automatically locked

806
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:30,624
It's not in the interests of an inquisitive 7 year old

807
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,464
Or you know the 87 year old grandmother who's living in the back

808
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:37,792
Bringing out these kinds of

809
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:38,816
Power strike

810
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:42,400
What to say to Dad's using his Android

811
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:44,192
Is a remote control for everything

812
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:47,776
Kat makes dad that remote control

813
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:53,408
Like Dad turn on the lights dad open the windows dad open the garage

814
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:56,224
Dad do that everybody either husband Magnum

815
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:58,528
If he's left

816
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,600
Whatever he's effectively

817
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:02,880
Imprisoned everybody

818
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:05,952
One of the secrets to

819
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:06,976
Excessive

820
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:08,256
Amazon

821
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:11,072
Cowboys computer interfaces The Talk

822
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:12,864
Can donkeys I like the color

823
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:14,656
I can't say her name

824
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:15,424
Minor program

825
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:17,216
Is true

826
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:21,568
He who cannot be named as we like to call her in the trade

827
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:24,640
Everybody in the family

828
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:26,688
7 year old cat

829
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:27,456
Asked

830
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:28,992
The main was Donkey

831
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:31,040
The play Jingle Bells

832
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:32,576
And it will

833
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:38,976
Endigo

834
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:42,304
It doesn't segment the family and it doesn't

835
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,352
Doesn't cause he's annoyances

836
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:45,632
Andrea Lee

837
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:49,216
Horace kind of family power division

838
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,544
Why do you call these personal assistant

839
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,568
Devices tok

840
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:58,688
I think you need a term for Amanda. I think it's science fiction

841
00:34:58,944 --> 00:34:59,456
Free makeup

842
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:00,736
Slang for stop

843
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:02,272
Geologist

844
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:05,856
But I am cuz it's kind of a lot of

845
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:09,184
Right and I think they're going to end up kind of attached all kinds of

846
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:11,744
Services that kind of a do

847
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,768
No smart

848
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:13,536
Refrigerator

849
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:19,936
Where you used to have a webpage unnecessarily attached to everything we're going to have one of these

850
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:22,240
Unnecessarily attached everything

851
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:25,568
Issue that I'm looking at and struggling

852
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:26,848
In my life which is

853
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:29,152
They are like talking donkeys like you said there

854
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:31,456
Not intelligent about everything

855
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:34,016
And one of the places they really break down is

856
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:35,296
Knowing

857
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:37,088
Which one I'm talking to

858
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,624
And what makes sense

859
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:39,648
To ask

860
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:41,184
Context

861
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:44,256
Well you know I actually appreciate your effort to struggle

862
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:46,560
Cuz I was listening to that

863
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:51,936
A healthy naming protocol for these boys

864
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:56,800
Got to change the kind of language

865
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:58,848
Nearest because General natural

866
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:00,384
Language recognition

867
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:02,432
Although it's Advanced YouTube

868
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:05,248
Pretty badly off

869
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:10,880
Are there a lot of situations where you could make a verbal slip and like accidentally Set Fire to the house I need to know

870
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:16,512
That has not happened yet but

871
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:18,048
Donkeys become more often

872
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:21,376
The present of people just start randomly

873
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:23,680
If this then that processes

874
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:25,472
Oh well you know

875
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:27,264
Nameless Amazon one

876
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:33,664
You're so smart go out to be able to figure this out and instead you just set up set up a situation display

877
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,688
Fire really

878
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:40,576
I can easily be literally I mean you could say something like nameless rhyme

879
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:43,904
Turn on the stove and there could be something wrong with the stove

880
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:46,720
You can have a gas explosion

881
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:48,768
That is why they don't hook these up yet

882
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:49,792
Gas

883
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:51,584
The echo team is very good

884
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,376
Door locks for example

885
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:54,400
You can't actually can

886
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:55,680
You can laugh

887
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:03,104
Already

888
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:05,920
Audio generated Google Now malware

889
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:11,040
Surprise me at all because you know where we've been or doTERRA where you got this

890
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:12,832
Used out of state supported

891
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:15,136
Cyber crime activities

892
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:21,024
Who do nothing all day except look for zero-day vulnerabilities

893
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:24,864
Man who wouldn't want to who would not want to hack

894
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,144
Always on micro

895
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:29,472
Yes I fully believe the NSA it's already done

896
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:32,800
And besides it's just plain doable

897
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:37,408
Wrote about hacker crying

898
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:38,176
Walkabout

899
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:41,504
Packer crime actually cash

900
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:44,576
That's involved electronic crime and also the political

901
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:45,600
Power of it

902
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:50,976
Are so motivated that we really died of a massive International class or full-time criminals

903
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:53,024
Which never existed in the past

904
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,072
And I think this is one of the major

905
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:56,608
Differences between

906
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:58,656
Shooting world

907
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:03,520
Old school internet of the 90s

908
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:06,336
Siloed

909
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:07,872
Barre Cypress

910
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:10,432
War friendly Internet of Things

911
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:14,016
So what should we do about that or how should be

912
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:15,296
Think about that

913
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:17,856
Because if we think about domestic techno

914
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:19,392
She's so like in the home

915
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:20,928
That's actually not

916
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:22,720
Terry Bradley widely adopted

917
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:23,488
Fatso

918
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,792
We could be like just just don't buy into

919
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:26,816
This is not a good

920
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:32,448
For the rest of Industry which is already adopted this because there are real benefits

921
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,984
What do we tell them

922
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:37,312
The point of view of somebody

923
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:38,080
Italy

924
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:43,712
What can we do about this

925
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:47,040
Because they're on the receiving end of this almost all the time

926
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:49,856
Mini military G7 industrial Nations

927
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:51,392
Equality

928
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:56,000
Google Apple Facebook Amazon Microsoft and NSA

929
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:58,048
They're not where you buy or not at all

930
00:38:58,304 --> 00:39:02,144
Huawei timeout Samsung Gear not the Russian Anthem at the Chinese

931
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,680
Intelligence units

932
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:04,960
Certo bottle

933
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,288
Santa Monica is home automation

934
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,312
And Italy

935
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:11,104
And it's been around since flight

936
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:14,176
Animes like dinner with thermostats and whatever

937
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:15,456
And sometime

938
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:21,856
Kitchens that like

939
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:23,904
Kitchen equipment

940
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,696
Rakhine enough it just give us

941
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:26,720
Stop

942
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:31,840
Which we use in which yolk usually oppresses are Italian

943
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:33,888
A really good kitchen

944
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:35,168
Okay I think

945
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:37,216
The European response to this

946
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:38,496
Initiative

947
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:40,032
Well eventually the

948
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:43,872
Some kind of Lifestyle packaged alternative

949
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:46,176
Internet of Things

950
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:49,248
And I'll probably say things like well we don't spy on you

951
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,552
We're not Facebook or not.

952
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:52,320
Prop

953
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:55,392
You know you can have some really nice chocolate

954
00:39:55,648 --> 00:40:00,768
Is your guitar really nice espresso will keep can tabs if you're really nice clothing

955
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,328
I'm all deliberately do less

956
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:05,120
And Silicon Valley does

957
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:07,424
When perhaps they can do it in some

958
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:10,752
Safer and more regulated way because that would be

959
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,800
The classic European response

960
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:15,616
The pretty much any American technological initiative

961
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:19,200
But okay you guys do it and we'll do like the cute version

962
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:23,296
I will do the beautiful version that's elegant and private and

963
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:24,576
Possibly.

964
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:30,208
Well as the Japanese say that all of Europe is a boutique and America is a farm

965
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,768
I would predict some kind of European

966
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:34,560
30 corresponds eventually

967
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:38,400
Okay and as a user as a plain person

968
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:41,472
Makes money thinking about alternative scenarios

969
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,264
Where do you think we're headed

970
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:46,336
And ask that question

971
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:48,896
And I don't really think we have the words for

972
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,688
Barham

973
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:52,992
I was listening to it on one of your interviews

974
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:56,832
Reason why we were talking about augmentation a kind of everywhere

975
00:40:57,344 --> 00:41:00,672
That's where we're going

976
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:03,744
Icon Vintage Ubiquiti

977
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:07,840
Cuz I've been very keen on ubiquitous Computing and augmented reality

978
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:11,936
I thought many years ago that if you're going to have time to tationil processes

979
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:16,544
Going on you were going to have to have some kind of display wherever they were happen

980
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,128
Is one of the biggest problems

981
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:21,408
You can't see it's working

982
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:23,200
That's not visible right

983
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:28,064
Disconnected like little things are little prickles of disorder

984
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,600
Life

985
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:30,368
Particular

986
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:32,160
Beloved of mine

987
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:39,328
Science fiction

988
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:40,864
Intelligent light

989
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:42,912
Are like JustFab cast

990
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:44,192
Literally

991
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,496
But I don't I don't

992
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:50,848
Mother's Day that I can go and only one way I think we're going to see various breeds

993
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:52,384
Augmented Ubiquiti

994
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:56,479
I think we're going to get a balkanized internet we're in for an era of

995
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:58,271
A massive breakdown

996
00:41:58,527 --> 00:41:59,807
We're not going to see

997
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,855
The kind of

998
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:03,135
Handshake

999
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:06,207
One-size-fits-all tcpi world

1000
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:10,047
Not because it doesn't see the institutional interests of the major players

1001
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:12,863
We're going to see silos

1002
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,143
I'm going to be like

1003
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:16,447
A protective kind of situation

1004
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:20,799
Market segmentation

1005
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:23,615
I really don't want this in my bath

1006
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:28,735
And I want somebody to prove that it's not turned on

1007
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:32,319
I don't know what the reaction is going to be it's not going to be one

1008
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:34,623
The American way since that is always say

1009
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:37,439
Consumer and I just won't go and buy that down at home

1010
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:38,207
Home Depot

1011
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:41,023
But then I got to be offered that chance

1012
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:45,631
This is going to be epic struggle on a very high geopolitical

1013
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:50,239
And it's not really about you choosing between an 800 PC and a Mac

1014
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:54,591
It's true I mean you have to have a phone now to do just about anything

1015
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:56,383
And those things are

1016
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:58,431
Fantastic tracking

1017
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:00,223
Information gathering

1018
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:04,319
What should we do about the FSB

1019
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:06,879
For like the Russian intelligence services

1020
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:10,975
And the response is not a whole lot I mean you can be aware that there around

1021
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:15,327
But it's not like you get down to go there and vote with your pocket

1022
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:19,423
I'm going to go someplace for the FSB

1023
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:20,703
Nowhere now

1024
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:23,519
You just compared iot to the FSB

1025
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:24,543
The Russian state

1026
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:29,919
They infiltrate the internet and everybody knows but they not

1027
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:33,759
Exactly

1028
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:35,039
So

1029
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:36,831
This feels very

1030
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:40,159
Dystopian we can't do anything

1031
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:41,951
But it's also a real life

1032
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:42,975
So

1033
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:43,999
I feel like it's a

1034
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:46,303
The person I have to be able to do something

1035
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:47,583
Cuz I can't

1036
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:49,887
American

1037
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:50,655
Response

1038
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:53,983
Kind of like that I'm an individual and I have to do something

1039
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:54,751
Pragmatic

1040
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:58,847
I know people think that way

1041
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:05,247
Everything will I have to go to the plaza or you know I have to like join a different political party or I have to find a

1042
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:06,015
Patron tequila

1043
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:07,295
Protect me from desk

1044
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:08,831
So it's not like their health was

1045
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:10,879
I just don't think that the individual

1046
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:12,159
Very much

1047
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:16,255
I've got to like work to my city council

1048
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:21,119
Born some kind of clique I got to get my community or my political party to help me out here

1049
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:22,143
It's not that different

1050
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:23,679
Different way of life

1051
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:25,727
I know I don't like to

1052
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:28,799
A determinist about this and kind of like

1053
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:31,871
Make people Despair and feel like how they can't really do anything

1054
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:34,431
Only country I kind of do like a lot of stuff

1055
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:37,247
I just don't have an illusion that it's super effect

1056
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:40,575
Like just having a house where people can stay

1057
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:43,647
I think it's been very helpful

1058
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:50,815
Does a lot of people who are very active on the internet and have all kinds of friends and social media

1059
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:53,375
Who does Matt have dinner with

1060
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:55,423
Because it's like trouble

1061
00:44:55,935 --> 00:45:00,799
But yeah we can set us a why don't you fly over here and stay for a week and turn in our house

1062
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:03,871
Interesting place

1063
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:05,407
You don't have to pay

1064
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:08,735
When it's a little weird you might get a few plywood splinters

1065
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:12,319
A very nice kind of social intervention

1066
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:16,159
We have people show up

1067
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:18,207
Weather not Industrial

1068
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:21,535
People like that

1069
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:23,071
Antonella

1070
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:26,911
Curator of design Museum of Modern Art

1071
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:32,799
We had Palace drop by a cousin

1072
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:34,591
Okay I like I like this

1073
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:36,895
Fatality ID

1074
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:43,295
What would you do with your house okay we have an Internet of Things house but it's a house forest and kind of a

1075
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:45,343
Internet of Things node

1076
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:48,927
I can be really like push the domestic aspect of it

1077
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:52,511
And I think that's actually very useful thing

1078
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:56,607
Anybody could build a castle yasmina

1079
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:58,143
All right

1080
00:45:58,399 --> 00:46:00,959
Question here which may not end up being a question

1081
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:02,239
We'll see what happens

1082
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:07,359
Novelist just a storyteller

1083
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:10,687
On the show because I think stories are so important

1084
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:13,759
Play to something as abstract as technology

1085
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:19,135
Do you feel that are storytellers are

1086
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:20,671
I sort of feel like they might be

1087
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:21,951
Failing us a little bit

1088
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:24,255
Not providing a new visions

1089
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:25,279
MP

1090
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:28,095
Maybe less positive Visions I don't know

1091
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:33,215
Our storytellers are shaping the future in

1092
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:34,239
Have we reached like a

1093
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:35,775
The point where they're in the future

1094
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:36,543
I don't know

1095
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:37,567
Bright

1096
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:38,335
Well

1097
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:47,295
Author novel SSI prison

1098
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:49,343
Doesn't literature about that

1099
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:55,999
Nobody was going to say our Barbers are failing us or our plumbers are failing as a gas station attendant

1100
00:46:58,303 --> 00:47:01,887
Dino guys were like quite the situation

1101
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:02,911
Better guys

1102
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:07,775
Play groups in the United States that interests me a lot but I think they have a big future here

1103
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:09,567
We're kind of academics

1104
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:14,687
Who actually want to occupy a space between science fiction detective element

1105
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:18,527
