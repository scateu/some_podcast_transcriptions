00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:57,600
When is the BC who did the

23
00:00:57,856 --> 00:01:02,208
Iot report that we talked about earlier this year so it's a good interview

24
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:02,976
I think you'll enjoy

25
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:06,304
And now a message from our sponsor level education

33
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:53,152
Okay let's kick it off with this week

34
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:55,200
Which is not

35
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:56,224
Despite the fact

36
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,528
Next Bachelor

37
00:01:58,784 --> 00:01:59,296
Police

38
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:02,112
In Arkansas

39
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,904
Walmart Walmart

40
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:05,696
For data

41
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:15,424
Yeah well this is only a matter of time and then anything that captures information recordings and such

42
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,472
It's likely to be

43
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:18,752
Subpoena door

44
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:19,776
Requested

45
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,056
DL warrant

46
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:24,640
This if I read correctly was unfortunate you know a murder case

47
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:25,664
It is

48
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,480
The information which actually found this

49
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:29,760
Story first

50
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:32,064
Amazon Echo in the hot tub

51
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,600
Which I have to say

52
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:35,136
Good headlines

53
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:39,488
So what happened is the police

54
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:42,048
A gentleman named Bates is a suspect

55
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,328
James and Ruby

56
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,120
Which is really on

57
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:47,936
I'm in the police are looking for

58
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:52,800
Any audio recordings from the echo that he had and he also actually

59
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,848
Had several other smart device

60
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:56,128
Vices

61
00:02:56,384 --> 00:03:00,992
Pizza set to go to trial for the first-degree murder of a man named Victor Collins

62
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,624
And what they're arguing they're looking actually not for like the murder caught on tape

63
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,160
But understanding

64
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,208
Who was in the House basic

65
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:12,512
Looking for voices that were in the house

66
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:13,280
At the time

67
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:16,864
Interest so Amazon didn't get the police any information

68
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,216
Did the echo dog down its servers but it did Handover Bates Account Details In purchases

69
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:24,544
Police say they were able to pull some data off the speaker

70
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:27,872
So they were able to access physical data from the

71
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:28,896
The device

72
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:38,624
Confiscated yeah that that's correct him and my guess is the because you have control over those recordings of Snippets

73
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,928
After you say the Wake word

74
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:46,048
Those are all saved for an indeterminate amount of time but you can go and delete them

75
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,096
Obviously this person did not

76
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:49,888
Do that mean who would you know

77
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,984
Honestly really premeditated everything

78
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:02,176
That's good to know I'm glad you're taking care of

79
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,480
Yeah

80
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:08,064
My understanding is that Amazon felt that the

81
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:10,368
Warrant request was too broad

82
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:12,160
To actually hand over everything

83
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,952
Including the recordings

84
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:14,720
Yes

85
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,256
What was

86
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:21,375
And I know that the echo is like everybody's focused on that and it is

87
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,911
Voice at scary

88
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:27,775
Police also say that Bates had other smart home devices including

89
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,311
A water meter

90
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:34,431
And that show that 140 gallons of water were used between 1 a.m. and 3 a.m.

91
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:37,503
The night that Collins was found dead in Bates hot tub

92
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:42,367
Yeah that's probably more of the cortical Smoking Gun if anything

93
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:43,903
Still

94
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:44,927
Stantial

95
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:46,207
Yes

96
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,743
I'm sure he's going to be asked

97
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:54,143
Simcorp what did you do with Outer 40 oz of water between 1 a.m. and 3 a.m. and specially if that coincides with it

98
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,679
What time of death and so on so

99
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:58,239
Is there a useful information for the

100
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,775
Prosecution

101
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:02,079
And I would not have thought

102
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:05,663
That my Smart Water since I don't have one but if I had one

103
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:09,759
Deck that could be used against me you just a water sensor like

104
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,551
Wrightwood

105
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,087
Beautiful format

106
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:14,879
Well

107
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:21,279
I am not let's make that very clear right now on the air

108
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:24,351
So I will say in this sounds really creeptastic

109
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:26,911
Behavior but when I am away from town

110
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,959
Sometimes I look in

111
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:34,591
At the sensors in my house so I look at my Nest Thermostat I can't even look at like I have

112
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:36,895
Devices that measure sound in my house

113
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:42,271
When I can look at that and I can see like oh this is my family talking at The Breakfast Table

114
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:44,575
You know cuz you can see this biking

115
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,367
Decibels right

116
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:48,159
If you have a humidity meter

117
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:52,511
You know in your house you can actually see when people have someone is taking a shower because the humidity rise

118
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,791
Isis

119
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:56,095
People may not be aware of it but

120
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,655
And it is kind of creepy that I'm like

121
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:03,263
I miss my family let me go look in the blinds are open they must be awake

122
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:11,967
No it's actually it really illustrates that by understanding what's going on inside the privacy of your own home

123
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:17,343
You can actually piece together what is going on right you totally can in

124
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:20,927
I have motion sensors for example on a bathroom light

125
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:23,487
And you know that motion sensor goes off in

126
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:25,279
I know someone has

127
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,351
Walked in at least and then walked out of the bathroom

128
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:29,631
Aunt

129
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:30,655
The closet or the laundry

130
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:31,679
So

131
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,983
People may not be aware and it's

132
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,775
It's fine because it's

133
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,055
Private butt

134
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:41,407
What people don't necessarily understand is some of these privacy policies

135
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:45,503
May make that information public and it is easy to piece together this

136
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:51,135
And part of me says that this is just an extension of the date of this already available

137
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:53,183
Through traditional smartphone usage

138
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,463
You know where you are

139
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:56,255
What you're connecting to

140
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:59,327
When you were out of place who you talkin to

141
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:03,935
It does because now your instrumenting so many different

142
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,727
Other physical thing

143
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:12,127
And that can get in when you take the Telemetry data from all those things you can really piece together

144
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,223
Timelines of actions and locations

145
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,503
Far more

146
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,527
Accurately

147
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,367
And in the case of Christmas I'm going to let you guys know that you know

148
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,903
After we installed Arkin

149
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,183
Connected doorbell cameras

150
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,743
I realize this was a side benefit but

151
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:30,047
When people are walking up the stairs with

152
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,583
Your Christmas presents like they're about to

153
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,351
To wrap them

154
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,631
You can actually see them

155
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,655
Doorbell camera

156
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:39,263
The point we're making here is

157
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:45,151
It's light and fun baby when it's you looking in on your family and everyone is aware of these things

158
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,199
But this is information that

159
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,247
Part of your digitalfit

160
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:50,527
Redis

161
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:52,063
And if we don't have

162
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,135
A real clear understanding of how laws are going to

163
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,415
Protect that we're not

164
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:57,695
So

165
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,975
This cases

166
00:07:59,231 --> 00:07:59,743
You know

167
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:05,887
A really good example and you know the attorney for Bates is arguing that this is private information so we'll see what happens

168
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:08,959
I want to follow what happens with this because I do want to

169
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:09,983
See what how

170
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:13,311
The Court's address the Privacy Issue Number 1

171
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:15,615
But I would hope that people

172
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:22,527
Listen to show or just aren't interested in IRT don't just say I'm not going to do any smart all morality stuff

173
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:23,295
Because

174
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:28,415
Look what can happen if these are simply tools and just like any tool how you use

175
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,463
And what's your doing

176
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:33,791
Tools themselves are not inherently bad as what

177
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:34,559
What I want to get at

178
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,351
Yes and I think

179
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:40,703
To me because there's so many benefits of having this information

180
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,495
This is really a wake-up call

181
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,263
Or

182
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,823
Consumers and the industry to

183
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,615
Actually start thinking

184
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:48,383
About

185
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,151
Privacy

186
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,711
And how do we want to regulate

187
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:56,063
Because we can't just say we'll figure it out regulation will come eventually

188
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:58,623
Because right now I'm having his regulations going to come

189
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,391
Quartz

190
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,671
And that's always real

191
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,207
Elation

192
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:04,255
So that's our thoughts here

193
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:06,047
Kevin has exciting news

194
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,327
We should note

195
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,095
Kevin works

196
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:09,887
Baidu

197
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:17,311
That's correct and this is not internal information which obviously I wouldn't have no could I share

198
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:21,919
There's some information from The Verge who Intergroup interview Jeff Chang

199
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:26,527
The product manager of Android Wear at Google so we'll talk wearables for a few seconds here

200
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:31,647
The folks who can't follow the Android Wear platform

201
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:34,463
He probably already knows about recap real quick that

202
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:38,303
It's been several developer previews of Android Wear 2.0

203
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,583
Over the past

204
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,911
Toss a 6-7 months and

205
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:49,311
The final version of Android Wear 200 is expected in 2017 will all along with that software

206
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:55,711
Jeff Chang is told of hers there will be two new flagship smart watches in the first quarter of 2017

207
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:56,991
From Google

208
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:02,111
They probably would have assumed similar to the Nexus and pixel devices where

209
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,647
Hardware is

210
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,439
Me to showcase the software

211
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:08,255
Interesting ladies will not be

212
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:11,327
Branded Google or pixel which is the new

213
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,863
Google Hardware branding

214
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:15,423
Which is kind of surprising to me

215
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,191
Together

216
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:20,287
Yeah I don't understand that so I mean there's so many

217
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,823
Harbor partners that

218
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:26,175
I've created Android Wear watches so I presume one of them will partner with us and it will be

219
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:29,503
There branding on back of Union Motorola LG

220
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,807
Casio polar

221
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:38,207
HTC Huawei a sus a whole bunch of folks have partnered so I don't know who the part

222
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:41,023
There isn't an Jeff Chang did not say who it will be but

223
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:43,583
It'll be interesting to see what

224
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:49,983
Hardware showcases the software is as I said before so we'll find out early in the first quarter of 2017

225
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:51,775
Okay

226
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,567
What are the features that you feel like

227
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,359
You're the smart watch

228
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,967
Way too many of them

229
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:03,295
What are the features that you're like

230
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,087
If you are going to play in this area

231
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,367
Unitus

232
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:10,207
Table Stakes on a smartwatch these days are obviously the time

233
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:14,047
Smartphone notifications Rich notifications that you can interact with

234
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:20,959
Very contextual notifications that we get today from a Google Now for example Siri does this to a

235
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:23,007
Small smaller or lesser extent

236
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,567
APA contextual notifications are important

237
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,151
AI Voice Assistant type thing so I

238
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,687
Presuming I do not know

239
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,479
I'm just answering your question

240
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,271
I would hope to see

241
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,551
Google Assistant

242
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:36,831
Which is

243
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:41,695
Davi rebranded Google now that's in Google home for example and on the pixel phones

244
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:45,791
I would expect to see that in a flagship Google Android Wear device

245
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,071
And then

246
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:50,911
Sensors for your exercise and health tracking

247
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:57,567
Are important to me I mean percentile so I can see GPS because I run with just a watch and listen to music through Bluetooth so

248
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:59,871
So I wouldn't say that

249
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:00,895
I must have

250
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,175
Those are the

251
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:02,943
Key

252
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,479
Things I would like to say

253
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,015
I would like it to be

254
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:10,623
But that's just

255
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:12,927
Evans like I want

256
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:14,975
No no no no no

257
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:21,631
There are many SmartWatches that I bought are not very pretty and some that I really like the design of

258
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:23,423
With apple you get

259
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:26,239
1 basic look and you can customize

260
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,263
With color War

261
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,287
Bands

262
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:34,431
With Android where they're actually you do have a very wise choice and get a Michael Kors Smartwatch for example that

263
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:39,807
It's a little more upscale in the fashion area fossil q line is also another

264
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:40,831
Nice-looking

265
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:46,207
Line of Android Wear watches and then there's some of their very utilitarian and those are the ones that I have bought because

266
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:50,559
Included a GPS where is the fashion ones did not examine the Stake Center

267
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:54,655
Or whatnot so you actually have more choice I think when it comes to Android Wear

268
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:59,775
Whether or not they suffer experiences the right one for you or with platform use that's that's personal choice

269
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:01,823
Okay

270
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:02,591
So

271
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,383
Will bring this into a

272
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:06,431
I think Stacy is found on the internet

273
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,967
Really excited

274
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,503
Product category

275
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:18,975
I was actually in my in my perusal of Amazon's smart home stuff

276
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,255
I discovered

277
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:24,095
GE Z-Wave Wireless smart door sensor

278
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:26,399
It fits over your hinge

279
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,679
Pin on your door

280
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:29,471
So it's like invisible

281
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:33,567
So it is got a ten year battery life

282
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:34,847
And now this product

283
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:35,871
Has kind of

284
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,407
It looks like calibrating it

285
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:40,479
Is tough so I ordered one because by golly

286
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,271
Why not

287
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:47,391
So what we'll see how this works but it's $40 in the idea is when you open the door

288
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:48,671
It could trigger

289
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,439
An action

290
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:54,815
Or I guess if you close the door in this kind of gets rid of like the open clothes sensors that

291
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:55,583
You know I

292
00:13:56,607 --> 00:14:00,703
Because I test so many things I have so many open close sensor stuck to various stores at

293
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:05,055
Nintendo's those are all add-ons to the

294
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,335
Traditional door

295
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,871
Right you have like this

296
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:11,967
This thing that you have to add to a door frame or inside the door someone

297
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:17,087
This actually replaces a part that's on existing door which I like the concept here

298
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,879
I think it goes over

299
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:22,719
So it doesn't replace it I'm look at

300
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:27,327
When when it arrives I will tell you what it does because

301
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,351
It's a little unclear

302
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,375
But yes

303
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:30,911
You don't have to remove the door

304
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,191
Kiss

305
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:37,567
The best way to ruin a marriage is to try to install a door with

306
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,127
It's literally the hinge

307
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,663
Canton that you're replacing

308
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,967
Yes you just left.

309
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:44,735
I'll be right back in there

310
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:45,759
Right

311
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:49,599
So if this works with lissy according to the instructions

312
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:53,183
It works with SmartThings Nexia Trane

313
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:55,999
LG Smart Security + Lowe's Iris system

314
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,279
And

315
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,327
I guess we'll see

316
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,095
But

317
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:02,143
For those of you guys who are like

318
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:06,239
Oh that sounds good cuz I hate those ugly open close sensors on my door

319
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,007
Free

320
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:12,383
Someone also pointed out to me a company called sensitive I will put this in the show notes but it's

321
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,431
Sensa

322
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,967
Tive

323
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:18,015
If he's already $60

324
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:21,087
They look like double-sided tape they're just

325
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:28,255
It's literally just a 3 mm thick strip

326
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:32,863
That you put in like you would put in door insulation or something you know

327
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:36,447
Not visible to eat it's not noticeable either

328
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,495
And it's a Z-Wave product as well

329
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:41,567
I had never even seen his Heir Apparent

330
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:42,335
Leah crowdfunding

331
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:47,455
It'll so if you're in the market for non-intrusive sensors

332
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:49,247
Both of these options look really interesting

333
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:52,575
So I just thought I'd throw that out there since you guys

334
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:55,647
My listeners are always like a great

335
00:15:55,903 --> 00:16:02,047
I also will caution though with this open close thing I've been kind of thinking about that cuz I started putting motion sensors to control lights around my house

336
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,351
It is very hard

337
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,631
Defined

338
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,959
You know you want to think about when I open the door

339
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:10,751
Do I want the same thing to happen

340
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:11,519
Everysing

341
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:18,687
Not necessarily but I think it at a basic level you could either you would either a want to a notification that

342
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:21,503
Somebody has entered or left your house would be

343
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,527
In certain

344
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:24,063
Times of the day

345
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:27,903
You may want a nearby lake to go on as you walk into the house

346
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,183
Yes and that's

347
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:31,231
I'm thinking you know you could

348
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:37,887
This is interesting because I could open when I open my front door for example my patio lights could go on when it's

349
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:38,655
Dark

350
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:45,055
This would be awesome until like the one day I'm like trying to see like if there's a burglar outside and I hope

351
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:45,823
Victoria Justice

352
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,615
To see what I can see and then

353
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:48,895
The lights go out

354
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,943
This is me always thinking the worst case

355
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:53,759
Moving right along

356
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:56,575
Cea

357
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:58,879
Do we want to talk about it

358
00:16:59,135 --> 00:16:59,903
We'll talk a little bit about it

359
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:03,487
Just a little because I am not going

360
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:08,095
But you are and it's you head out there next week so

361
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,631
I think you have a

362
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,935
See we talked about CEs from CVS next to

363
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:14,495
Yes so we're doing a special edition

364
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,263
Of the iot

365
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,031
Podcast

366
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,311
From CVS

367

And this is going to be a show that comes out on Monday so you guys are going to get to

368
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:25,247
Actually this will be the Monday after CS

369
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,551
So the week of the 9th you're going to get to

370
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:29,087
Guess what

371
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:30,623
Add

372
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:37,535
While I'm there so next week's podcast you're actually going to get some really exciting news we're not going to talk about

373
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,071
Some of the things that are happening

374
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,095
Because I can't yet

375
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,375
But I will say

376
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,911
Voice is going to be big

377
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:47,007
Service providers people who are you know

378
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:51,615
Making these iot experiences they're actually there's some really good stuff happening there

379
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:54,687
And there's some great news for lighting

380
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:55,455
So

381
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:57,503
If you guys are like on the fence about to

382
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,039
Click Buy on a lake

383
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:00,319
Fighting kind of product

384
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,343
Wait

385
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:08,511
I often tell people to wait on consumer electronic purchases at this point in time just because you know the consumer electronic show is

386
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:10,047
Going to have a gazillion different

387
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,583
New options

388
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:14,143
Not all of them are readily available as of

389
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:16,703
The Daily Show so that's something to keep in mind as well

390
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,239
Mynews however

391
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,055
Subway time

392
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:24,127
That is my advice to you

393
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:26,431
I mean you don't have to if you really want to buy it but you

394
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:29,759
Which status

395
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:33,087
All right before I get too philosophical

396
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:34,111
Let's talk about

397
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,903
We don't actually talk a lot about

398
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:38,975
Some of these other hoes like Nexia are very light

399
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:39,743
But

400
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:42,815
I saw it a new story about Intel and Amazon

401
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:45,887
Are demoing a tiny smart

402
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,679
And it's powered

403
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:49,471
Spy software called

404
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,007
Neo s

405
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,543
Aosm iOS

406
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,615
Maybe it's my

407
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:58,943
Well it could be a capital M little eye

408
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,479
Big big ass

409
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:02,271
So

410
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,551
Maybe they were little I

411
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,183
I just gets no love

412
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:09,951
No love for the

413
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:13,023
Okay so meiosis is the meiosis

414
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:15,327
Is the company behind the vire

415
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,863
Xavier light system

416
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:19,167
Which is a Z-Wave smart home system

417
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,191
It

418
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,215
I've tried

419
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,495
It's okay

420
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:24,799
It's all Z-Wave so it's never

421
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:28,639
But I kind of want to do because I want to throw a bunch of stuff in there

422
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:30,687
But it is a solid system

423
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:32,479
I'm they work hard to support

424
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:33,503
Wings it Iz

425
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:34,527
Totally reasonable

426
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:35,551
So

427
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,343
What they did is

428
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:39,903
They have a Gateway with Intel Core processor

429
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,951
And Amazon Echo

430
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:43,231
Is doing the voice control

431
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:44,255
So

432
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:48,351
The Cee Pro is reporting that so far

433
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:50,911
This product that is being demonstrated

434
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,959
Controls Philips Hue Lights

435
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:53,983
Oh

436
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:56,287
I wonder if that's who a new hardware.

437
00:19:57,311 --> 00:20:01,151
If that's through the Gateway that's interesting cuz that means that

438
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:03,711
But it could be just the echoing

439
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:07,551
Philips Hue with you have a nest thermostat a Sonos player

440
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:09,087
Soundbar and subwoofer

441
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,623
So not the actual speakers

442
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:12,927
Legrand Motors motorized shade

443
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:15,231
Somfy motorized awning

444
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:17,279
I wonder if they can also do the song people right shade

445
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:21,375
Avira security cameras

446
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,655
Amazon Fire TV

447
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:24,447
The Plex Home media software

448
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:25,983
And

449
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:28,031
A Wi-Fi Gateway with Intel

450
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:29,055
Anyone

451
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:29,823
Anyway in

452
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:31,359
Any Quinn

453
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:32,383
Why do.

454
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,199
I'm going to go try to find this

455
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:35,967
It's a yes

456
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:36,735
Embassy

457
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:37,759
What's Happening Here

458
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:38,527
Cuz

459
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:41,599
Yeah I'm curious if it's more

460
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:44,159
Demo and not a

461
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:46,975
To gauge if there's interest in a product

462
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:47,743
Maybe

463
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,791
So I will say

464
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,327
Lutron sent me

465
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:52,863
A casita

466
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:53,887
Bridge

467
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:55,679
To test with homekit

468
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:59,263
And as part of my homekit testing which

469
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:01,311
I guess I won't tell you it because next week's can be

470
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:03,103
He probably also yes all the time

471
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,895
Sometime in January

472
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:05,663
We're going to get into my house

473
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:06,431
Homekit stuff

474
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:09,759
I'm thinking I might actually be able to get rid of my wings

475
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:10,783
Hub

476
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:14,879
Use the Lutron caseta to control my Lutron stuff

477
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:16,672
Amend

478
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,024
And various Echo skills to control everything else plus I have the Hue hub

479
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:22,560
Already so

480
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:23,584
I'm actually going to

481
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,376
Going to try to see how far I can

482
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,144
Go

483
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,448
Without having

484
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,496
Like a SmartThings like a big brain hub

485
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:32,800
Write the traditional

486
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:33,824
Smart home hub

487
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:34,848
So

488
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:36,128
We'll see cuz

489
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:36,896
I think

490
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:38,688
For a lot of consumers that

491
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,712
Mets

492
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:41,760
I don't know

493
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:48,416
It depends I mean you know what you'll be using the echo.for a lot of your interface and interaction I suspect so

494
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:50,208
For consumers who don't have an echo

495
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:51,744
I don't know that I would get rid of

496
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,512
A hub

497
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:55,072
In that case

498
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:56,864
Listen sometimes

499
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,680
Like I have to tell you

500
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:03,520
In the middle of the night when our house cuz it's been like 80 degrees here in Austin this week

501
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:05,312
When our house gets too hot on like

502
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,616
I want to tell the echo to

503
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,920
Turn the nest down

504
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,992
I can't cuz my husband sleeping next to me safety

505
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:14,016
Padma

506
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:15,808
Right now

507
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:18,624
You don't keep a phone on the bed

508
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,392
Stantler

509
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,184
Don't because

510
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,464
Don't look at it

511
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,488
Before I go to bed

512
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:28,352
Sucked into it so I can charge my phone in another room

513
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:30,400
I know I'm not like a real human

514
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,168
It's weird

515
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:32,448
Sep

516
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:34,496
You are not

518
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,336
Who should be your avatar in

519
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:41,664
This is

520
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:46,272
A conversation brought up by everybody's favorite Japanese

521
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:48,320
Oh Japan

Wish I could go with ya creating virtual wives and girlfriends to help you

523
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:57,536
Navigate your life on a daily basis

524
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:05,728
There is a video probably it was before Christmas

525
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:06,752
Anime

526
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:09,056

This is nothing like

532
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:25,696
The idea of

533
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:26,976
Animated

534
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,512
Virtual girlfriend

00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:31,328
Men is nothing new

537
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,864
The home automation is a newt

538
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,656

Anthropomorphism

Actual figure to be one of them

552
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:03,584
Woman's voice like

553
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:10,240
First of all I'm in some some of the assistance that are out there you can change the voice to male or have a different diet

554
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:12,032
Elector or accent

555
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:14,848
So I think Siri you can have a male voice if you want to

556
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:21,504
So but I think going back to your original question it's do we want to see the interface

557
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:23,296
What do we want something like

558
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,576
In the movie Her

559
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:29,952
Which is sort of what we have today with voice controls and and response back and

560
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:33,024
As you said right before the show we were discussing this briefly

561
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:37,888
It seems like apples going that way with the airpods and Siri access in there

562
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,424
Whereas

563
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,448
Amazon is looking

564
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,472
Wer

565
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:44,800
Distributing The Voice through multiple devices in a house not to

566
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:51,200
Two headphones that you could have Amazon voice services in in a single device that you wear for exam

567
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,224
That could happen

568
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,832
I think it comes down to especially after looking at this video do you want to see your assistant

569
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,112
And do you want

570
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:05,280
Well you shouldn't you should be able to have him or her look at the way you want because it's a personal assistant but

571
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:07,072
It's early days yet so

572
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:09,632
Japan has this little blue anime girl

573
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:12,704
Fine I'm sure but I don't know that I want to see

574
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,728
A virtual

575
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:14,752
Assistant

576
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:17,568
I mean if I'm going to see something that I want something like

577
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:18,848
An actual Android

578
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:21,152
Natsu Landry buy a robotic

579
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:22,432
Android that can

580
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:27,040
Physically do things around the house to that mean I'm going to buy Bicentennial Manwich

581
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,320
My favorite movies

582
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:33,184
And that's that's so cuz there's all these like Jibo in these little robot things that

583
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:33,952
Can I put a

584
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:36,000
Face again a face to

585
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:36,768
A voice

586
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:39,328
But for me I feel like if I'm going to have

587
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:41,376
Robot

588
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:42,144
Or like

589
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,448
A robot my house I want to have arms so it can

590
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:47,008
Right where I mean if you're going to go

591
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,056
Go all the way at this point

592
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,920
We'll see at CES a laundry folding robot although it takes a really long time to

593
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:54,688
Tefl those

594
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:55,712
Those towels

595
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:57,760
May takes me a long time to but

596
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:02,368
It's funny because I think I'm the last show we just talked about the

597
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:04,160
Personality of some of these

598
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:07,744
Services assistant devices where it said

599
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,608
I often after speak to my echo will say thank you after she does something for me

600
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:17,984
I already have that personal connection I don't need to see anything to get a more personal connection

601
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,776
But that's just me

602
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:22,336
This is one of those things for him like

603
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:24,896
I know I don't want like a little weird

604
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:26,944
Avatar thing and I've never been in

605
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:29,248
I think the Jibo and those kind of robots

606
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:32,320
Cool but I don't realize I would never spend the money on it cuz I'm like

607
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,648
Already have most of that and

608
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:38,208
Haven't seen roaming around my house doesn't

609
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:40,768
No no

610
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,816
And you know I dedicated robot

611
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:43,840
The price that it would

612
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:45,120
Write a program

613
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:53,312
But there's there's hope 10 20 years from now maybe it's but no it's not something that most people going to

614
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:56,640
Get in there so few options out there to being with right now anyway

615
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:57,664
Right I'll save my money for

616
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,432
The self-driving car

617
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:03,296
So I have to say that we had

618
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,064
An awesome

619
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:04,832
Comment

620
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:08,416
As last week's episode where we kind of was like

621
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:10,976
Hey this is what we've done to automate our house

622
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,512
And Scott

623
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:15,584
Lawrence Lawson left a comment on a Blog and he

624
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,120
It's great idea

625
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:17,888
Which is

626
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:23,008
Change the switch or the plug on your garbage disposal to a connected one

627
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:25,568
So you can use voice control with the echo

628
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:26,592
Orbitz Google

629
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,640
And he gave it with

630
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:30,176
Hey smart thing

631
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:32,224
Turn on off the drain

632
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,016
And he said this is really useful

633
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:35,296
When doing dishes with wet hair

634
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:36,576
Its and it's

635
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:40,160
I want to see I would never have thought of this

636
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:41,952
Possibly because

637
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:43,744
My garbage disposal

638
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:45,280
Yes which is just covered

639
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:46,304
Mike Massey Pizza

640
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:48,096
Iwatchonline

641
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:52,192
I totally going to do this

642
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:56,032
That's perfect for hands-free I mean that the perfect scenario so

643
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:57,568
Well done well done

644
00:27:57,824 --> 00:28:00,128
Guys feel free if you have these like

645
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:02,432
Easy things send them our way because

646
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,968
The beauty of

647
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:10,368
All of the stuff is there's a long tail of things you can do in most of us just don't even think about it until it's

648
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:12,160
But basically tossed in her face

649
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:15,744
Almost done with this week show but first

650
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:17,536
I want to say because

651
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:18,560

652
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:20,096

And I'll see you next week sounds great thanks

696
00:29:57,376 --> 00:30:03,520
We are interrupting the podcast with the message from our sponsor sponsor is Samsung

697
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:06,080
And I have Mark Wright director of product management

698
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:07,360
At Samsung

699
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:11,456
From the very beginning I have heard much about Samsung

700
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:14,528
Module Hardware side and also on the cloud side

701
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:16,320
Can you just give me a quick overview.

702
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:18,112
Put this all together for me

703
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:18,880
Arctic

704
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:20,416
Is an antonym platform

705
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:22,208
That integrates modules

706
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:27,328
What security have pre-programmed the connectivity so that they have secure transport

707
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:28,608
Into a cloud

708
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:31,168
So where we can virtualize products

709
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:33,728
We can then store data from those products

710
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:36,032
Control products manage those products

711
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:38,080
And then it's also

712
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:38,848
Rapt

713
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:40,384
In an API first

714
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,688
Design methodology so people can

715
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:46,272
Then also writes drawing apps for those products

716
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:50,112
And also do connections to other services and other cloud

717
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:54,720
Okay so this sounds a lot like something that manufacturers might be interested in

718
00:30:54,976 --> 00:31:00,096
Systems integrators and I heard you say security a couple times so I'd love for you to talk to me

719
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:01,376
About what's unique

720
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:03,168
Here on Arctic

721
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:05,216
We have an end-to-end platform

722
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:06,496
For manufacturers

723
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:07,776
Systems integrators

724
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:11,360
To use in creating product iot connected product

725
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:12,640
But as We Know

726
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:14,432
You know from any of the reports

727
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:19,552
And even things that are going on in the world right now security is top-of-mind

728
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:21,600
We sealed platform development.

729
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:22,368
The best place to

730
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:25,184
To put security think it through at the beginning

731
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:25,952
And

732
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:26,976
Been implemented

733
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:33,120
And what we've implemented for security is a best-in-class methodology known as AAA security

734
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:34,656
It's Authentication

735
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:37,216
Authorization and ability to audit

736
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:40,032
What we do there is we have Hannah Kate

737
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:42,592
The user and a device

738
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:46,432
So that falls into the module offering that we have

739
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:50,272
Write and in the software we have for that software for onboarding

740
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:51,552
The end product

741
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:54,112
We Them secure the trance

742
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:55,648
Sport into the cloud

743
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,976
So the second thing we offer is authorization

744
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:00,256
So what authorization

745
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,560
Is the user

746
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:04,096
That utilizing this

747
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:04,864
Product

748
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,424
Do they have the proper role are they authorized

749
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,960
To do what they are trying to do

750
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:12,032
And we use certificate-based Authentication

751
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:13,312
For that process

752
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:15,872
And then we have the ability to audit what has happened

753
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:20,480
In addition to security what are the other benefits of having an end-to-end

754
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:23,808
Tell the benefits of an end-to-end platform

755
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:27,392
Are that when a manufacturer is looking at

756
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:30,208
Building a thing to be iot connected

757
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:31,744
It's a change in their business

758
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,048
Generally for a manufacturer

759
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:37,376
There is the electronics there's the software there's the product

760
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:44,032
But now on top of that they have to consider RF design they have to consider protocol they have to consider cloud

761
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:45,824
I also have to consider

762
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,104
Mobile app development

763
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:48,640
And each of these

764
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:54,784
Are additional software development efforts that they have to do on top of their normal product developer

765
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:58,112
So utilizing an end-to-end platform

766
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:59,392
Simplify stock

767
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:02,464
And gives them single SDK

768
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,512
Where can I find

769
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,328
You can find out more at dub dub dub

770
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:13,728
Arctic. IO that's Arctic artik. IO

771
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:20,128
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things

772
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:26,272
Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest is gaurav Garg who is a partner at

773
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:27,552
Wing venture

774
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,344
Hi darling how are you doing

775
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:30,624
Great

776
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,392
Thanks for having

777
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:34,208
I am super glad so basically

778
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,488
You guys

779
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,608
Actually earlier this year wrote a really awesome report that delved into kind of some funding

780
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:47,008
Not just funding information but also Trends in The Internet of Things space and I will link to that in the show notes but I thought it'd be fun

781
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:48,800
Fun to have you on here to talk about

782
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:49,824
Kind of

783
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,408
What you think the role of the internet of things is going to be

784
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:56,992
Going forward and how that's kind of influence in your investment strategy

785
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:03,648
Let's dig in if I'm looking at this world how do I break up the opportunities

786
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:04,672
I had

787
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:10,816
So there are very practical things that you mention like for example security

788
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:16,448
Place to be

789
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,264
Authorized user interaction there's also

790
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,592
Lake life cycle management there's so much to think about

791
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:23,360
So

792
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:26,432
Where do you think the date opportunities

793
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:30,784
Are that makes sense from this maybe not the ones we can't see cuz who knows what those are

794
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,832
But some of the ones that are a little bit more visible

795
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:35,392
What looks the first thing is

796
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:36,928
If you think about what we talked about

797
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:38,208
It would seem a patent

798
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:38,976
They at

799
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:42,560
Driven by iot in various definitions of iot

800
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:46,912
Technology ecosystem will probably expand

801
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:49,984
Buy a very large amount relative Americans today

802
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,008
Maybe for 5X

803
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:56,384
And occupy an even larger portion of GDP than it does today

804
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,176
It's not very much

805
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:01,248
Whatever is kind of every decade right

806
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:04,832
Footprint of the technology Industries got up by 5 to 10 a.m.

807
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:08,160
Imagine that happening enabled

808
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,696
Baidu news

809
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:11,744
So

810
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,560
Where are we in the life cycle this earlier very early

811
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:15,584
Maybe

812
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,864
1% aloe vera

813
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:18,912
The way I look at it is that

814
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,240
Any new ecosystem like this

815
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:24,288
Did usually starts with

816
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,568
Semiconductors

817
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:26,848
Which are

818
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,896
August a hard place to invest

819
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:30,432
Blood in iot

820
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:31,712
One can imagine

821
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:32,736
In the short-term

822
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:34,528
Meaning the next 4-5 years

823
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:41,184
That there will be opportunities driven by specialized semiconductors I'm not an expert in semiconductors

824
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:41,952
Imagination

825
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:43,488
But the power honesty

826
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:45,280
No pun intended

827
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:47,072
You're going to have to stop at semiconductors

828
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:49,376
Then there's a phase of Platforms in

829
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:50,144
Assistance

830
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:51,936
Which becomes important

831
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,728
Yeah stings proliferate

832
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:54,752
And

833
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:55,776
Come off

834
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:57,824
Operating systems that are

835
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,104
Peterbilt for

836
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:00,896
Industrial

837
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:03,968
Networks from 30 years ago or beds

838
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:06,784
For computer said we as human beings interact with

839
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,344
New platforms to be created for iotv

840
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:10,624
As Wheels

841
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,672
Some of these tax on services

842
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:13,696
Like

843
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:16,000
What do you need to do in the cloud to collect Olive

844
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:17,024
Sustaita

845
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,816
How do you deal with security

846
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:19,840
So on and so forth

847
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:21,632
Of course I will be

848
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:25,472
A normal amount of investment as well in the actual sings themselves

849
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:26,752
Sambal fish was saying

850
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:28,544
Any ideas like drones

851
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:29,824
And

852
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:30,848
At some point

853
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:33,408
They'll be a set of applications

854
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:34,944
And message

855
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:40,576
For all of the things as well as the applications to talk to each other which will probably be the biggest slice of

856
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:41,344
The pie

857
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,416
A lot of that we cannot imagine today because we don't have massive

858
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:47,232
Deployment

859
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:48,256
IPhone came out in

860
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:51,072
When did we really start

861
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:55,424
Saying native mobile applications like uber that wouldn't make sense on the desktop

862
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:57,728
Took a few years I mean never there

863
00:36:57,984 --> 00:37:01,824
But it took a few years before they really started taking off something will happen here

864
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:05,152
Stevia proliferation of platforms and creative people

865
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:07,200
But applications that really can't

866
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:09,504
Take off today but that ultimately will be

867
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,552
The largest piece of economic pie

868
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:13,088
It just so people know

869
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,160
IPhone came out in 07 in the App Store

870
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:17,184
Which was the big

871
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,720
The Big Kahuna

872
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:19,744
Came out in 08

873
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:21,792
Yeah thank you

874
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:23,840
But I think of

875
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:25,120
What to invest

876
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:26,144
Austin today

877
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,472
The concentration of investment is going to be in the actual thing

878
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,800
But you're going to be presented as vertical applications today

879
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:34,080
Or

880
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:35,104
Platforms

881
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:37,664
Isabella stats form like services

882
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:39,200
That's what people are going.

883
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:44,064
The notion of what applications run on these things and how do they talk to each other

884
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,880
Beverly bits and pieces but it's still a little bit toy

885
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:48,416
And we're not quite there yet

886
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:49,952
A ninja

887
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:52,000
Kind of report you actually

888
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:55,328
Bless you all for doing this cuz you guys names like

889
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,376
You found 700 different

890
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:58,912
Platforms

891
00:37:59,168 --> 00:37:59,680
Platform

892
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:02,752
And I was like oh I feel you man I

893
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:04,544
I feel like I've met at least 300

894
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:05,824
So

895
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:10,688
What do you think the fate of these platforms is and what is maybe a sustainable

896
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:13,504
Look like I don't even know if that's the right way to parse

897
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,576
It's like a credible number of companies trying to be platforms or what

898
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:18,112
I would love to get your

899
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:21,696
In industrial applications or anything

900
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:22,976
Things like cars

901
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:24,512
They look like men

902
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:26,560
The closest Sam's today

903
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:29,888
And the person that makes a car or make

904
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:32,704
X-ray machine

905
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:35,008
Whatever you think of those other things as well

906
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,824
They have this vertical stack where they control August

907
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:40,128
The reality is

908
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:40,896
Dad

909
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,432
We're going to get to a word

910
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:43,200
Where

911
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:46,272
Software that runs in cars or an industrial machine

912
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:48,320
In all things in general

913
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:49,856
Is going to come

914
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:50,880
Partially

915
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:52,672
From software developer

916
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,488
That have nothing to do with that particular car mats

917
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:58,048
Exit right in the world of distributed applications and

918
00:38:58,816 --> 00:38:59,584
The weather please

919
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,352
Disco Donnie

920
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:01,376
Together now

921
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:02,656
All of that

922
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:05,984
Means that they're going to be some very rich ecosystems

923
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:07,008
2

924
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:09,824
Develop software in to write applications

925
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:12,128
And like most are forms of

926
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:13,920
Today my guess is

927
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:14,944
Those

928
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:17,504
Can attract the most Developers

929
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:21,856
Linda hearts and Minds moving what that looks like in the future

930
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:23,648
I don't think it's going to be

931
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:28,512
Steak mobile platforms which is basically two or three operating systems on the desktop

932
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:29,536
Which was similar

933
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:33,120
I think I ought to be out of necessity they will be more than one or two

934
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:35,680
But I don't think it's going to be 600

935
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:40,288
How to put a finger on it but

936
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:43,616
Is Ewa Beach some concentrations of ecosystems depending on

937
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:45,408
Types of devices.

938
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:50,016
Just picked up a really fun thought exercise for iot I think's going to develop

939
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:52,064
Vertically or horizontally

940
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,856
If you're kind of thinking about being a plateau

941
00:39:54,880 --> 00:40:00,256
So that could be horizontal by Pio

942
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:02,816
Verses like I'm going to build something for

943
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:03,584
Restaurants

944
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:08,448
Beverly some places where they will be vertical development cars that are obvious one

945
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:10,240
The stars are going to be

946
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:16,896
How's a large part of the it conomy places which have specialized needs you have this 4000 lb

947
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:20,224
Vehicle traveling at 80 miles an hour that is suddenly connected in

948
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:21,248
Does a

949
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,320
Lot of implications of stats relative to

950
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:26,112
I like boat ride

951
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:27,648
Or my telephone

952
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:31,232
I suspect that just because of the outside

953
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:35,072
Fraction of economy that is occupied by the Auto industry

954
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:35,840
And

955
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:39,168
Because it is very far along and getting connected

956
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:41,472
Cost example of a place that you can imagine

957
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:44,288
Will probably be

958
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,336
List of consumer products

959
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:47,360
Where

960
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:49,408
Because you want companies will attempt

961
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:52,224
I have that song Feeling sexy app on Google

962
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:54,784
Have their own horses in the race already

963
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:56,576
Hard for me to

964
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,880
Think about how

965
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:03,232
And small independent company can become platform player in consumer products

966
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:04,768
That just seems super hot to me

967
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:07,840
I didn't get the answer is it's going to be a little bit up

968
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:10,656
Let's talk about Enterprise iot

969
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:17,312
I'd love to see how you break down of Internet of Things world is it consumer Enterprise Industrial

970
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:22,944
Does multiple categories does industrial designer prized as wearables does home

971
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:24,480
Des health

972
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:26,016
Does Auto

973
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:28,064
All of these are probably already

974
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:29,344
Looks like by the way

975
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:30,880
And I don't know very well

976
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:35,488
That could be an overlay across some of these things or

977
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:37,536
An independent entity all together

978
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:39,584
And then there's also

979
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,376
Dirt of public places

980
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:47,776
Where are you know Stadium train stations coffee shops restaurants on so far to wear

981
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:50,080
Romani people occupying buildings

982
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:51,104
Where

983
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:52,384
For not employed

984
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:56,479
Do you guys also I feel like you had a drone category in your research

985
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:57,503
Search as well

986
00:41:58,527 --> 00:41:59,551
Yeah

987
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:00,831
I'm sorry I forgot it

988
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:03,647
I wanted to see if

989
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:05,439
You guys have less you had a sudden like

990
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:11,583
Good point I still have

991
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:14,655
Difficulty believing

992
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:15,423
Dad

993
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:17,215
Jason the United States

994
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:19,263
CSA score

995
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:21,311
Police drones for every purpose

996
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:22,079
Possible

997
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:25,407
Send you're well aware that they've been fairly conservative so far

998
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:28,223
I can imagine that explain drones

999
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:30,015
It's already in use today

1000
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:32,831
Which require airport at all sorts of regulations

1001
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:35,391
Starting user security

1002
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:36,415
Surveillance

1003
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:38,719
Fan agriculture pretty heavily

1004
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:40,255
Symptoms of

1005
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:44,351
Piloted Vehicles as well as drones

1006
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:47,679
But I have a really tough time believing these

1007
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:49,215
Quadcopter

1008
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:51,263
Type drones are

1009
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:54,079
Going to be given free rein by the FAA to do

1010
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:56,383
What everyone imagines can do

1011
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:00,479
That's part of the reason we being a little bit more

1012
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:02,527
Circumspect at least for the US market

1013
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:08,159
That makes sense and like one of the big things I think about when I'm thinking about iot

1014
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:14,303
When you're dealing with the internet of things in this concept of data being everywhere and everything being connected

1015
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:16,607
Scalability really matters

1016
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:17,375
If you're going to think about

1017
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:18,655
Platformer

1018
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:22,239
And from a regulatory perspective

1019
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:25,055
It doesn't feel like drones are going to be scalable

1020
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:26,079
Yeah

1021
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:32,479
Who knows how the FAA will deal with it and maybe technology

1022
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:34,271
But

1023
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:35,039
I just

1024
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:37,343
You know when you hit all the tales about

1025
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:43,743
Drugs being delivered over the Border by drones Southern South America guns getting delivered to prison spy drones

1026
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:46,303
I just I have a tough time believing

1027
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:48,095
Bed in the United States

1028
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:49,375
Just going to be

1029
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:52,447
Go to free rein red rose can do whatever they want

1030
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:55,263
Sure and I can imagine like UCI Pharmacy drone

1031
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:56,031
Planet

1032
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:56,799
The sky are like

1033
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:58,847
Just a

1034
00:43:59,103 --> 00:43:59,615
Maybe this is

1035
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:00,383
Some good drugs

1036
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:05,503
Okay

1037
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:06,783
Let's go

1038
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:13,183
Touch on some of these categories so wearables actually is really interesting because we've had a couple deals in 2015

1039
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:16,767
Wearables was super hot even consumers love them

1040
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:21,119
It feels like we're heading into like a retrenchment on wearables

1041
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:22,911
And I am curious

1042
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:24,703
Where you think that my

1043
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:27,519
Old temperature of reality

1044
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:30,847
That's the truth of the matter is

1045
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:32,895
They haven't been doing very much so far

1046
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:34,431
And

1047
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:35,711
As they do more

1048
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:37,759
And if they develop more sensors

1049
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:39,295
Centos become more useful

1050
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:40,575
They'll get deployed in

1051
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:41,599
Various ways

1052
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:44,159
Sorry I have an Apple Watch I use it all the time

1053
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:46,719
And frankly what I like more about it

1054
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:47,743
Funnily enough

1055
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:49,023
Notifications

1056
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:50,047
Dan

1057
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:51,327
If measuring

1058
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:53,375
You know the number of steps I walked today

1059
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:54,655
It just tells you that it's

1060
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:56,191
None of the variables are

1061
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:58,239
Let me they been doing a little bit but

1062
00:44:58,495 --> 00:44:59,775
It's been fairly restricted

1063
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:05,151
But one can imagine like I'd like to have a variable that measure my blood sugar all the time I don't know if

1064
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:08,735
If you could be integrated into my Apple watch

1065
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:09,503
Boy

1066
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:10,527
But that be superheroes

1067
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:15,135
Let's go back to this concept of The Internet of Things

1068
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:16,159
Because

1069
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:21,791
I think what is most baby. Most disruptive but I think one of the things that we don't

1070
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:24,863
Really comprehend yet is the fact that

1071
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:27,935
Computers used to be built kind of for individuals

1072
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:32,799
Or to be owned by entertainment One Singular entity.

1073
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:33,823
Consumer

1074
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:38,431
Enterprise when we start putting in everything

1075
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:40,479
It's impossible to have a one-to-one

1076
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:41,247
Relationship with

1077
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:42,527
So

1078
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:46,879
Like that's for me upkeep standpoint

1079
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:47,647
Stampy

1080
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:51,999
Even the way we have it now isn't really sustainable where I have to have an app that works with the specific

1081
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:53,535
Product on my phone for exam

1082
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:55,327
So how do you think

1083
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:57,631
That is going to evolve what even needs to have

1084
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:01,727
Wow I mean that's such an interesting area

1085
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:05,055
And you start thinking about security you think about

1086
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:06,079
Policy

1087
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:10,687
You think about public policy in terms of who has access to what

1088
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:13,247
But also on an everyday basis

1089
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:15,807
What types of services are being enabled

1090
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:18,879
Every LED light in the future has a camera built in

1091
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:22,975
What does that mean the the Spheres of control

1092
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:24,255
An access

1093
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:26,047
Bar a day obviously

1094
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:28,095
Russell the fact

1095
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:31,679
Put it very well it is

1096
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:33,471
They're going to be many

1097
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:34,239
Science

1098
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:36,543
Off the information that comes out

1099
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:39,103
And many people looking to sort

1100
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:40,383
Vegas Nevada

1101
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:41,151
Birth control

1102
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:43,711
In spheres that they are given permission to enter

1103
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:45,503
So

1104
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:47,551
Lot of possibilities

1105
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:50,623
In areas like Administration

1106
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:53,951
Security computer vision even

1107
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:58,303
Genesis Next Generation environmental control applications all of that

1108
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:00,095
Public places

1109
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:03,167
This is quite possible and and quite interesting

1110
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:05,471
So what role do you think the government

1111
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:06,239
Either

1112
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:10,335
Federal level or even a municipal level if you're starting to deploy these things

1113
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:12,639
What is their role in the

1114
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:14,943
And then what is your role is like a citizen

1115
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:26,207
I just think these things are so far forward that regulation cats always catches up to Innovation right eventually

1116
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:30,303
Hopefully I don't think people are going to know what it means for a few years

1117
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:31,583
So

1118
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:33,631
I agree I just thinking about like some

1119
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:36,959
I was thinking about things

1120
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:37,727
Cameras

1121
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:42,591
Hurry up we have red light cameras in cities kind of can program

1122
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:45,919
Like the yellow lights to be super short so more people get caught in the red light

1123
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:46,943
Right

1124
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:48,223
If you start thinking it

1125
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:51,551
About that is just one example of a very low-tech

1126
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:52,319
Thing happening

1127
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:53,855
When you start thinking about life

1128
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:56,159
Parking meters that are digitized

1129
00:47:56,671 --> 00:48:00,767
Basically even having access to see all crime in a city and figuring out

1130
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:02,303
Cuda charge

1131
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:08,959
It feels like we're going to need like an oversight board that is not accountable to

1132
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:09,983
That particular

1133
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:11,263
Municipal government

1134
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:14,847
So I've been thinking a standard

1135
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:17,919
Department of weights and measures Department of Agriculture things

1136
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:21,247
Gasoline dispension that we have today

1137
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:22,783
How do you bring some model

1138
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:24,319
The general account

1139
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:25,855
Accounting Office GAO

1140
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:26,879
2

1141
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:28,671
Connected cities I don't know

1142
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:30,719
An example would be

1143
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:33,023
If there was a carbon monoxide sensor in a car

1144
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:34,047
And it goes off

1145
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:36,351
Do you want the car to call 911

1146
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:37,631
I'll have the police come in

1147
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:40,191
You don't help you or is that an invasion of privacy

1148
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:43,775
Should you roll the windows down and call the ambulance immediately

1149
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:45,311
Whether or not you requested it

1150
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:47,871
And you know you can imagine variations of that

1151
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:49,151
Gesso

1152
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:50,431
What is the Concorde send

1153
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:51,967
Said you were in trouble or

1154
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:53,759
What is the cost of the sense that you're drunk

1155
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:55,551
From the driving is that a public

1156
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:56,319
Hollister

1157
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:58,367
I was going to say that's probably a very

1158
00:48:58,623 --> 00:48:59,391
That's an excellent news

1159
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:03,231
By the way there's a company that can already do that

1160
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:05,791
And they're selling the product to commercial Reb

1161
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:07,839
Operators

1162
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:10,143
And forever for all these non-british

1163
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:12,447
English speakers out their lorries are

1164
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:13,471
Tractor trailers

1165
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:15,519
Or Siamese depending on where you live in the US

1166
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:20,639
Yes those are those are exactly the sort of things

1167
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:27,807
Once you have automation coming into these if you don't come up with policies around automation it's going to be

1168
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:28,575
Really exciting and

1169
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:34,463
We could also say that you know if you're drunk instead of calling police your car just doesn't start

1170
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:35,487
Which is like

1171
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:37,279
Basically the robots conspiring

1172
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:38,047
Against you

1173
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:38,815
Or

1174
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:41,375
But if they don't have to tell anybody

1175
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:45,471
So even for that exam

1176
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:49,311
Where someone sufficiently drunk you don't want them to be out in the road

1177
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:51,359
As a hazard to other drivers

1178
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:56,735
Yes but if they're car doesn't start then they wouldn't be just be safe

1179
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:58,271
Questions radio drama decline

1180
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:01,087
Okay

1181
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:04,159
What date is there anything else you want to talk about I should ask

1182
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:10,303
What are the trends you're looking to invest in you guys just raised a new fund of 250

1183
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:13,375
And what are you guys looking to invest in

1184
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:15,679
Iot security and policy that

1185
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:22,335
State Optical right now and going to be an area that people are thinking about getting into their products over the next

1186
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:27,711
Another area that was quite interested in his computer vision so this is

1187
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:30,015
Really chine proliferation of cameras and

1188
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:31,295
Types of cameras

1189
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:33,343
Sarah going in everywhere

1190
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:35,903
And what do you do with that information

1191
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:37,183
Beyond

1192
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:40,767
What Google Facebook like to do witches Drive advertising

1193
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:41,791
This many other interests

1194
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:45,119
Applications as well as quite interested in the services around connect

1195
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:45,887
Vehicles

1196
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:47,679
Going back to the beginning

1197
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:48,959
All the fixings

1198
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:50,239
Statin products

1199
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:51,263
Temp services

1200
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:55,871
There may be other services that Jack built on things are super interested in those as well

1201
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:59,711
Pandora hard for me to Define I mean this example we talked about

1202
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:00,991
With the carbon monoxide

1203
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:04,319
Is that something the car company provides or is it somebody else

1204
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:06,111
Adapter for the car

1205
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:07,391
Has a software service

1206
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:08,415
Right

1207
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:09,951
Taking me many others like that

1208
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:11,231
Auto stores

1209
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:13,023
Services are enabled

1210
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:14,559
That particular return policy

1211
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:15,839
Services or

1212
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:19,423
Services enabled by the fact that a certain thing. Connected

1213
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:21,983
All of those are great interest

1214
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:24,799
I think I think it's worth

1215
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:27,871
Underline the fact that just because you own the sensor

1216
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:31,199
Or just because you own the platform like the car for example

1217
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:32,479
Doesn't mean

1218
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:35,807
You're going to automatically win when it comes to delivering that service

1219
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:38,111
And I think that's a really important thing that

1220
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:41,695
People usually the bigger companies who own the platform 10/2

1221
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:42,719
Havis Huber surround

1222
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:45,023
Well we'll do it and will be amazing

1223
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:48,351
Because we've made washing machines appliances or cars forever

1224
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:50,911
And then the sensor guys

1225
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:55,007
They seem to think they're amazing because

1226
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:57,311
You can get sensors on things pretty easily

1227
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:58,847
I'm curious like

1228
00:51:59,103 --> 00:52:00,383
Who will win and where

1229
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:01,919
I don't know if you have

1230
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:03,967
Stanley speaking you know

1231
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:05,759
Become things of the past

1232
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:07,807
Keep going and they have customers but

1233
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:10,111
Very rarely today

1234
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:11,903
Change

1235
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:15,743
Dynamics of the future or become the Giants of

1236
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:17,535
Dinosaur Next Generation facts

1237
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:19,327
You see that all the time

1238
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:23,423
All right will Gaara thank you so much for coming on the show this week I really appreciate

1239
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:27,263
Yeah I think it was a pleasure

1240
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:33,663
Well that's it for this week show thank you so much for listening and we'll see you again next week
