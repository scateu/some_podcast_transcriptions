00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,032
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast diameter hose

00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:13,312
Stacey Higginbotham

00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:15,616
And this is my co-host Kevin tofel

4
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:18,432
Pamela said George Jetson I'm sorry

5
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:19,968
That's very appropriate

6
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:21,504
Soyo

7
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:23,808
George

8
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:28,160
Anyway go ahead

9
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:30,208
Okay I was ready to

10
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:31,744
Smoothly segue into

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,024
To the things we're going to talk about

12
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:34,048
Kevin ruined

13
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:35,328
What kind of charge

14
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:37,120
So we're going to talk about SmartThings

15
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:39,168
Because we got more information

16
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:40,960
We're going to talk about some news bits

17
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:42,240
Such as a new integration

18
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:44,544
Jennifer ring we're going to talk about Google's OS

19
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,824
Best for the Internet of Things

20
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:46,848
Rillo

21
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:48,384
Everything about hoverboard

22
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:49,408
Even though they're not

23
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:52,992
Let's get started with

24
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:53,760
Smart thing

25
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:57,600
All right last week we spent a lot of time because I wondered if my smart

26
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:59,392
Things home automation hub

27
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:00,160
Most haunted

28
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:02,976
Turns out the Hub was just not really working

29
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:03,744
We

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,768
Hydrema right

31
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:07,840
We were we were right we were wondering what the heck happened

32
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:10,656
We're going to still wonder I finally got my

33
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:11,680
I'm sending it back to

34
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:12,448
Tell SmartThings to

35
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:13,216
Figure out there

36
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:16,032
Or dissected or whatever it is

37
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:16,800
Is autopsy

38
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:18,848
And figure out

39
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:19,616
What happened

40
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:20,384
Because

41
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,688
We replaced the Hub and now everything works

42
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:23,968
So my experience

43
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,248
Should not be your ex

44
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:31,392
See this is good to know because two reasons me personally and I've said this many times that's going to be my backup if we

45
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:33,696
You know Winks away into the background

46
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:37,024
People who are considering SmartThings

47
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,096
They probably walked away from last week's podcast making

48
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:41,888
New one of these artists

49
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,424
It's not working

50
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,984
It's not working for Stacy is not going to work for me but

51
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,008
But

52
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:47,776
You should not

53
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:48,800
Worried so

54
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:50,336
Take two on SmartThings

55
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:54,176
Is that you could actually add things very easily

56
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,456
So when I

57
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:56,736
Launch my new hub

58
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,784
I was able to add all the sensors

59
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,088
My camera woes iFix

60
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,624
So instead of adding it

61
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,648
As an app

62
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:04,928
On its own

63
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:07,232
A separate camera thing is

64
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:08,256
Instead added it

65
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,280
Spruce SmartThings

66
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:16,448
So instead of adding it as a wireless camera I did have to compromise and added as a wired camera so it comes with

67
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:19,776
Ethernet cable and I did that when I did it that way it worked

68
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:20,800
And from then on

69
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:22,080
And I was Off to the Races

70
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:30,016
One of these shoes you had was some of the motion sensors or door open close sensors are not working and one

71
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:31,808
Was stuck in open mode and

72
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:33,600
Something of the stadium

73
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:36,928
Plug which is a zigbee device it never found the zigbee device

74
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,976
Yes that's that always result

75
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:41,792
Yay in what was weird is that

76
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,584
The problems I was having wasn't Lake

77
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:45,120
One radio wasn't work

78
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:47,424
It was like just a bunch of things

79
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:49,472
So we don't know

80
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:51,776
We still don't know when SmartThings

81
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:52,800
Autopsies

82
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:53,824
It tells me what happen

83
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,360
And because I've asked if they do that

84
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:57,152
I will let everyone else

85
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:57,920
What the heck have

86
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:00,224
We should probably point out now are you

87
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:00,992
Did not

88
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:01,760
By this

89
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:02,528
Correct

90
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:03,808
The one that I

91
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:05,600
Tested was a review unit

92
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:06,624
That they had sent

93
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:10,720
The one that I swapped it out for was one that I actually

94
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:12,000
Purchased via ammo

95
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:15,072
And you would purchase it before last week's show

96
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:18,912
Which is why we knew you have to and that's why we're saying no LS swap them out and see what happens

97
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:19,936
So that's what you did

98
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,032
Gotcha I know I only said that because you know the review units

99
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:26,592
I've gotten review units for a dozen years

100
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:27,360
Thursday

101
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:32,480
Companies and they are often times when review unit doesn't have the latest software or it

102
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:35,296
They produce some quickly off the line to get them out

103
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:37,088
Are the early reviewers and so on

104
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:41,184
This has happened before I guess what I'm saying not trying to give anybody passed but the reality of the

105
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:41,952
Situation is

106
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:42,720
It does have

107
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:45,024
Instead the one you bought does work

108
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,328
And I'm guessing how did you go through

109
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:52,704
Typical Samsung support or no

110
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:59,104
The way SmartThings does their support is they have both email support they have forums and then they have like a chatbot

111
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,456
At a certain point in time though if it's not working I have seen

112
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:09,856
Them support via like finally they're just like okay this isn't working here let's call let's get to the bottom of it

113
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:16,256
So in a situation like mine I imagine that someone from SmartThings would actually you would end up on

114
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:19,583
On the phone with it because there were enough weird crazy things happening

115
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,351
They would just be like

116
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,119
Okay

117
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:27,263
Yeah I mean support can always be her Miss for any company and I said that if somebody who's managed support desk for the previous life

118
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,567
So get your experience could vary but

119
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:30,591
My point being

120
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:34,175
Chances are if somebody else had similar to the same problem

121
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,479
Play Wicked solid support from Samsung

122
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:39,807
Amazon

123
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,087
Samsung Tab e

124
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:43,647
Samsung and I will I will say that

125
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:44,671
Yes I have

126
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:46,975
I've been a SmartThings user for

127
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:47,743
Gears

128
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,279
But their forums

129
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,303
Are awesome

130
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:54,911
They have a lot of really dedicated users who do a lot of crazy stuff

131
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,703
And so just

132
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:00,799
Kind of trolling around the forums you can actually find a lot of fun things

133
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,079
You can do and ideas

134
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:02,847
So

135
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:05,407
This is again more for the DIY person

136
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,943
Not the person who's like

137
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,479
I just want to plug it in and have it work

138
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:14,111
Write it sounds like there's a good robust Community there that's willing to share for the DIY people

139
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:16,671
But even out of the box if you just want to use the product

140
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,975
Now that it's working the setup process

141
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:21,791
It's good you know you think it's a solid

142
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,327
Entry to

143
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:29,727
Start homes for people don't have anything right now yes so if you were taking this out of the box you've never if you were going

144
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,007
To the smart

145
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,031
Some space in your leg

146
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,567
Holy cow what do I buy

147
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,591
This looks pretty good

148
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,383
I would recommend

149
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,151
SmartThings

150
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,175
And I would do it

151
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,967
Unhesitatingly for

152
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:43,551
Like probably 90% of the population

153
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,575
I would say

154
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:45,855
For people who are not

155
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:49,183
There are people who are not going to be comfortable kind of

156
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:53,535
Playing with software setting rules even things like Winker probably too complicated for them

157
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,071
Those people

158
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:56,863
Should probably just get a nest and

159
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,143
You know just

160
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,959
Toggle things on and off or maybe they should just not really

161
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:01,727
Worry about the smart

162
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:04,543
Gotcha maybe they should call their ISP it have

163
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:05,567
Set up every

164
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:09,151
Just just reach out to Stacy

165
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:09,919
Papa

166
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,015
You mentioned when

167
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:17,855
So let me ask you this is somebody who owns and is very happy with wink

168
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,415
And this is a personal preference which

169
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,719
Would you go with if you could only choose one

170
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,487
I would go with

171
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:24,255
SmartThings

172
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,559
Because because SmartThings

173
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,095
This has a more consistent

174
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,631
User experience than week

175
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:30,399
For me

176
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:36,799
There are things like the lights all come on at the right time for me SmartThings works

177
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:38,079
More consistently

178
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,615
For me then winked has

179
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:42,943
I do lose those some of my favorite device

180
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,783
This is so right now Chamberlain MyQ is not supported on smart

181
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,831
Southern Chamberlain has told me

182
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,111
That they will

183
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:50,879
Eventually stop

184
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,927
Okay so no garage door opener

185
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,207
So my garage door open

186
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:57,023
Now you got to have fun

187
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,839
Chase now I just have to hit something else in my app

188
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:00,607
So there

189
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,143
And there is

190
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:07,007
SmartThings does have an Arduino Shield so there's a possibility of me doing a work around there

191
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,287
But that is not

192
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,335
No it's not your everyday person

193
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:14,943
Only people who do podcasts and speak Elvish

194
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:16,991
We're back to you

195
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:19,551
It also doesn't have in this is actually big

196
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:20,575
It also does

197
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:21,343
Support Lux

198
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:23,135
Your favorite

199
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,159
It's are my favorite

200
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:24,927
So

201
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:31,327
I have begged Lutron to make a dongle that supports their protocol that I can plug into the SmartThings

202
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,119
Dongle

203
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,447
Elvis dongles and

204
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:43,103
Iot Bingo that I'm going to make that and we can print it up

205
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,127
For Christmas

206
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,151
Best for everyone who listen

207
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,711
That will be my Christmas gift to Olive

208
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,735
Holiday gift

209
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,015
So

210
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,295
With the Lutron

211
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:54,111
You don't with the SmartThings you there are ports on the back

212
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,135
Plug China

213
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,671
Things into and make it

214
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,951
You know ad on radio

215
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,999
So they haven't done that yet but

216
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,279
But it's their potential

217
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,559
Lutron would be like

218
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,351
Then I would just

219
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,959
How to make me so happy so

220
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:10,751
Those are the two things I miss most

221
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:13,311
That's why right now the wink Hub is still

222
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:15,103
Kind of actually right now it's unplugged

223
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:18,687
I unplugged it as part of the setup process in troubleshooting but

224
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:22,015
If it isn't plugged back in it stopped working

225
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,039
For some reason

226
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,319
Everything just got to stop

227
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,343
United 7

228
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,367
Bothered excited cuz

229
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:27,903
Catch-22

230
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:31,231
I don't know that we've ever talked about this before but I'm curious again

231
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:33,023
Personally I think for the audio

232
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,839
Amazon Echo integration

233
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:39,423
How robust is that and how well is that working

234
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,191
It works

235
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,215
It

236
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:41,983
Turns on

237
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:42,751
Buy lights

238
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:45,823
It does not there at there are definitely things that does not

239
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:46,591
Work with

240
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:48,895
So it doesn't work with the locks

241
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:49,663
It doesn't work

242
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,199
Blinds

243
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:54,271
If I wanted to get the special Stacy support

244
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:57,087
I think there is a way for it to work with my blinds

245
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,367
And I can work on that

246
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,159
And tell people about that

247
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,183
But I haven't yet

248
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:04,255
Cuz I spent two hours on special Stacy support

249
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,279
Aetna

250
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:07,327
I felt that that was plenty sure

251
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:10,655
I wonder if there is a way to do that with if this then that which is your favorite toy

252
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:13,215
SmartThings is supported through if the subnet

253
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,751
Amazon Alexa

254
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:18,079
Still has limited Triggers on FSM that so

255
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,359
Come on Amazon

256
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,895
We would still have

257
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:26,783
Add blinds to shopping list

258
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:33,439
So that's how SmartThings is doing as I create new recipes and things will definitely come back to this

259
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,207
I'm sure

260
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:37,023
And I think for a while I'm going to stick with this hub

261
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:37,791
Although

262
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:38,559
I'm going to

263
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:44,959
Just going to throw this out there the next see if people have finally worn me down and I think I might try a Nexia hub

264
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:45,727
Because

265
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:48,031
Because I feel kind of bad about not trying one out

266
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,567
I'm getting a lot of questions about

267
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:56,223
No no I mean the more the merrier I mean not all at one time obviously you don't want to have all these things going on in the in the same house because

268
00:09:56,479 --> 00:10:02,623
I could actually cause problems that people would not have so I say go for it

269
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:03,647
So

270
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,439
That's the SmartThings experience

271
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:07,999
So I recommended if you guys are into it

272
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:12,607
I'd like the apps I think the software is much better I used to recommend people didn't SmartThings

273
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:15,167
Really feeling good about tinkering

274
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:19,519
Now I feel that the software has a lot of use so bring it every bring it

275
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,311
$99 for the version

276
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:24,383
Hub 249 for monitoring

277
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,175
Kit and also by

278
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,967
I can't

279
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:30,527
Not going home care

280
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,807
RockAuto

281
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:33,855
So if you want to come get this is not your answer

282
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,391
And it doesn't work with Nest beak

283
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,671
Because they also are not

284
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:39,231
Super appreciative of the nest

285
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:40,255
Terms

286
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:42,815
Frederick how the data is used in what they share

287
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,863
All of that again with the

288
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,655
So speaking of

289
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:49,471
Fitness no longer belong

290
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:50,495
Google

291
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,287
Now

292
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:57,151
But we'll talk about Google and Google has released its operating system

293
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,687
Some for the internet of things called

294
00:10:58,943 --> 00:10:59,711
Brillo

295
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:05,855
We talked about it before and we scratch their heads because it was more of a concept and everything else

296
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:10,207
For those who missed it Google announced their iot platform

297
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,999
Comprised of brillo and

298
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:12,767
Weave

299
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:15,327
Yeah they did that at the Google IO event

300
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:19,167
In June or July always forget which month it was but

301
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:21,215
Oh my God I met this year you're right right

302
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:22,239
Taryn Toomey

303
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:25,311
And we hadn't heard really much of anything since then

304
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,847
Other than that saying

305
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:30,431
Our Nest we will be available to people in 2016

306
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:32,479
And it's different than Google's weave

307
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,271
So that's a whole nother mish-mosh

308
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:38,367
But regardless the good news is right after the last show of course

309
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:41,439
Google release the SDK for Brillo

310
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:45,279
If you go to developers. Google.com Merlot you can get the

311
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,815
Limited information they've shared

312
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:47,583
Publicly

313
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,655
But you can then also request an invite

314
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:53,727
To the Brillo SDK search array

315
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:59,103
If ice maker or are you just morbidly curious like we are you can request an invite for that

316
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:04,479
Other than that there is a introduction to broil a video that's all a matter of 3 4 minutes long

317
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:10,879
Didn't really tell me anything that Google didn't already say back in May so if you miss the announcement way

318
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:14,975
Way back when you could actually watch this and maybe get a glimpse at what Google is going to do

319
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:18,559
There's a little bit more info

320
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:21,375
Formation so they're going to be updating it every

321
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:23,679
Etsy well actually I should

322
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:24,703
Hello

323
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,727
Works with

324
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:26,495
Google

325
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:32,383
Sweet yes now I asked Google about if it was going to work with Nest we

326
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:35,711
And here's where things get a little acronym

327
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:39,039
I'm going to tell you exactly what Google told me

328
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:42,367
I'm going to bed it's either a subset or a superset

329
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,159
Your guess is as

330
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,439
So here it is

331
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,207
Quote

332
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:49,279
We're working closely with Nest ensure that nest

333
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:55,679
Stand workshop with Nest devices are interoperable with Brillo devices and we will have the same grade out of boxes

334
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:58,239
Experience and set up built into Android phone

335
00:12:59,007 --> 00:12:59,519
Unquote

336
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,823
So it sounds like it doesn't work with

337
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:02,847
Ness

338
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:03,871
We've yet

339
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,663
Correct that's how I read that as well

340
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,431
So

341
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:09,247
That's that's it that's what we do

342
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:13,343
That's all we know that's all we know

343
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,671
Brillo will be

344
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:18,463
And this might be not news but I'll

345
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:20,767
Mention only cuz it is on their developer site

346
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,047
Brillo is

347
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:27,423
Chelsea Hardware diagnostic as a platform because it will be square on arm chips Intel x86 chips

348
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,215
MX based Hardware

349
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,519
Also you're not limited to just one

350
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:35,615
Chip architecture if you're making devices and they're going to release updates every

351
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:36,895
6 week and

352
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,431
Bigger releases every

353
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,223
Smuts which I actually thought

354
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:46,111
So that that's kind of interesting to me because I also a cover Google Chrome and Android platforms

355
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:46,879
And

356
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:50,719
Google is committed to monthly security updates for Android

357
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:56,351
And every six weeks it updates Google Play services for Android as well as

358
00:13:56,607 --> 00:14:00,191
The Chrome OS gets a full stable release update every 6 weeks

359
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:03,519
It's just odd to me or interesting that they're using the same timeframe

360
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,055
So

361
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:05,823
Maybe this

362
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,663
Ties into that but see will use your Chrome knowledge here

363
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:14,271
Is Google's Brillo developer kit is based on Ubuntu 14.

364
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:16,319
4 + Android developer

365
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,855
Including Android Studio

366
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:18,623
No

367
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,391
Including

368
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:20,927
Bebe

369
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:24,767
Android debugging Bridge

370
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,583
I may have gotten that wrong but basically

371
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,167
8 Ibiza is a command line tool set that you use

372
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:33,215
Imma that I've used in the past to

373
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:38,591
Control and modify Android phones from a PC or a Mac

374
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,127
So it's a way that like

375
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:43,967
Little custom ROMs on my Android phone I wipe out Google's Android I put on

376
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:46,783
Something else Cyanogen or what have you

377
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:47,551
I don't want to

378
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:50,367
You throw a bunch of names out there cuz it doesn't matter what it is

379
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:54,719
Use ADB to unlock the device use ADB to push the new

380
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:56,255
Image to the phone and Flash

381
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,791
The phone and so on so

382
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:00,095
It's a toolset that developers using

383
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:02,911
Easiest used to modify their Android devices

384
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:07,519
Okay so it sounds like that I could use this to develop on my iot devices

385
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:11,871
I would say probably because ADB is actually a

386
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:14,175
Small part of the Android SDK

387
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:17,247
Okay so and we knew that Berlin was a stripped down version

388
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,271
Have Android anyway

389
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:21,599
Yes so it sounds like they're staying true to that

390
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,903
So this is going to work on devices

391
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,951
This little is 32 megabits

392
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:26,719
Megabit

393
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,743
Bytes megabytes

394
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:30,047
Bytes of RAM

395
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,071
+ 100

396
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:31,839
28th May

397
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:32,863
Historic

398
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,143
Which actually is kind of big

399
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:34,911
Yes it is

400
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,703
So this is not a sensor thing

401
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,007
Cognizant

402
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:41,311
Liam probably the

403
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,103
Google onhub router

404
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,127
Which we know is

405
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,919
Going to have pillows

406
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:48,223
Support built in order

407
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,271
LOL. My bad

408
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:54,111
Google

409
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,695
Is it nestweaver Google

410
00:15:59,487 --> 00:15:59,999
But we do know

411
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,023
Ashley

412
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,839
Okay so that's what we know about Brillo

413
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:05,375
If you guys are confused

414
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:07,423
Well well

415
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,703
So is the rest of the world

416
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:09,727
That is what we know

417
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,543
Unless confusing

418
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:16,127
The only because it just caught my eye

419
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:20,479
We mention Android a lot here we just mentioned crom and we'll talk about boiling weave

420
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:26,879
On the developer site for Billy says extend the reach of your IOS and Android apps to the physical world with weave

421
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:33,535
So I just want to mention you know they're not in typical Google fashion they're not sticking solely with Android for this it's

422
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,071
Bear cross platform

423
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,095
On the mobile site

424
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,119
Right still don't

425
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,399
Have anything we View

426
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,727
We've waited this long for Brillo

427
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:42,751
Which we know

428
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:45,055
How's I know that imagination

429
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:46,079
With their developing

430
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,359
Board that we talked about a couple

431
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:49,663
Citgo they are supporting Brillo

432
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,199
Whatever that is

433
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:54,015
ASL words

434
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,807
Lots of languages

435
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,087
But

436
00:16:57,343 --> 00:17:00,927
List of all hey look you know Google really has not shared a lot of

437
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:03,231
Details here out to Developers

438
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:03,999
Person trying under

439
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:04,767
Standing

440
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:10,911
Eventually someone will build a product that uses this but I think what's happening is people are looking at the center like

441
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,959
What are we going to do with this OS

442
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:18,591
Splatoon until we know a little bit more about weave which is actually going to do the talking to two devices

443
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,639
We kind of don't know what we want

444
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,687
Well and that's fine

445
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,223
You and I sat through the big

446
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:27,807
Come by akeno last year at CVS with Samsung talking about

447
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:30,111
How the internet of things will

448
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,391
Tie the whole world together

449
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:34,975
My guess is that this January at CES you may see

450
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:36,511
Google's partners

451
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,559
Maybe Samsung but probably others

452
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:41,119
Have a little something to show for all this

453
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,399
We can't start docker

454
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,703
Nope

455
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:46,239
It's less than 8 weeks away

456
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:48,031
All right moving right along

457
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,567
Just blowing right through that

458
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,847
Going to talk about

459
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,663
Little bit of news for those of you guys who like doorbells

460
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:58,271
Jalisco August said that they were going to start selling a doorbell door lock

461
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:01,087
The doorbell part of that won't be out till the middle

462
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,111
December but

463
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:02,879
Can buy it now

464
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:05,183
And today or rather

465
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,207
Yesterday

466
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:06,975
Ring

467
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:09,535
They company that Richard Branson invested in

468
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:12,607
Has announced that it will do an integration with

469
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:13,375
The Kevo

470
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:14,399
Door lock

471
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,167
Which is

472
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,447
Matador LACMA

473
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,471
Kwikset

474
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:20,031
Bluetooth suddenly photos of Bluetooth door lock

475
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,567
Are pretty the deadbolt

476
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:26,943
And so basically what happens is you can have similar function at when someone is your ring doorbell

477
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,479
You can give them commands to open

478
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:30,527
If you have a key

479
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:31,807
Yes

480
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:34,623
Find nice it sounds like a

481
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,927
There seems to be this coalescing vision

482
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:39,487
Is it no longer can you just have a connected doorbell

483
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,279
We're connected door lock now they mad

484
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,839
Integrations are good

485
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:45,631
Yeah it's it's another way though

486
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,655
I will say

487
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:49,727
Cuz these door locks are like between 200 200

488
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:50,495
50 buttons

489
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:53,311
If these doorbells are about two hundred bucks

490
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:56,895
So suddenly you are now investing about 404

491
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:58,175
$50 on your

492
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:01,247
So probably more than the cost of your front door

493
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:03,039
What kind of front door do you have

494
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:05,087
A piece of plywood with a Holguin

495
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:09,695
We live in the sticks with a lock anything up it's just left opens pretty much a mesh screen

496
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:11,743
Just kidding

497
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:14,815
You're like we have one of those but I don't know what it came with the house

498
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,375
Gonna be a heck of a lot

499
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:18,399
Got it

500
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,167
Okay

501
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:19,935
So

502
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:21,215
That's out there

503
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:22,751
I'm a big fan of

504
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:23,775
Connected doorbell

505
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:24,543
Genre

506
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,847
So that is definitely on my Christmas list

507
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:33,247
Speaking of which Kevin and I are going to get together and come up with a connected device Christmas list so stay tuned for that

508
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:34,783
Because Kevin doesn't know

509
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,087
We're going to start that very soon

510
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,623
Surprise surprise

511
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:42,463
This is why I should have cute cards or teleprompter I had no idea you were going to make us do that

512
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,231
Boom

513
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:44,767
Probably for our Thanksgiving

514
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:45,535
Podcast

515
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:46,815
Have a guest will

516
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,607
Get it all cute up

517
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:51,935
Good ideas for your turkey UK

518
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,215
Start shopping

519
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:54,751
Preparation for Black Friday

520
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:55,519
Okay

521
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:58,591
I know it's going to my Christmas list cuz I already bought my own Chris

522
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,359
Early

523
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,151
Oh nice Segway

524
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:05,247
Tell us all about it I see on your Facebook

525
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,783
Post this is looks like

526
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:10,879
Alright let me just preface it by saying it's not

527
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:11,903
Really an iron

528
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:12,671
40 things

529
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:14,975
Really cool face

530
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:16,767
I'd allow it

531
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:17,791
Yeah thank you

532
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:21,631
I ended up buying and I bought one on eBay but I

533
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,679
Since part two more of these

534
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:24,703
A little bit less

535
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,751
A self-balancing

536
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:27,519
Scooter

537
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:31,871
You could call it a personal transporter you could call it a hoverboard but clearly

538
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:33,407
We're not hovering with this

539
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,223
So what I did was I bought one of these things that

540
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:37,503
Britton Segways

541
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:38,527
Before I love Segways

542
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,343
But there now 56 Grand whatever they are

543
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,623
I'm not going to go get a Segway

544
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:46,207
There there little bit cocky little bit clunky so

545
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:47,743
What I bought is

546
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,791
Similar concept but it

547
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:52,095
Looks more like a skateboard

548
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:52,863
Innocence

549
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,655
But you don't ride it

550
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,959
Like a skateboard but it goes

551
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:00,287
Just wright

552
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:04,127
So you're sitting you stand on a hoverboard

553
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:06,943
And what it has it has small 6in

554
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:07,711
Wheels

555
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:08,479
And it has

556
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:11,807
Two independent Motors and a battery inside source Electric Power

557
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:14,879
Recharge it up takes about 1 to 2 hours to charge

558
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:20,000
And then you put your feet on this thing in there foot pedals to where you place your feet when you press

559
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:22,560
Your put your foot down on these pressure points

560
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:25,120
It knows your on it and it is ready to ride

561
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:27,424
It also has a gyroscope inside

562
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:33,824
So that way once you get over the first five minutes of initial trusting I guess.

563
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,872
I was trusting your balance on this thing

564
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,152
Itself balances

565
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:39,968
So it's on two wheels you're standing on it and it's self-balancing

566
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:41,504
The interesting thing is

567
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,320
The two wheels are obviously connected by an axle but

568
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:48,928
Your left foot in your right foot each have an independent motor and operate independently

569
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:55,584
If you want to go forward either lean forward or push your the front of your feet down a little bit more than the back your feet and you go follow

570
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:58,144
Same backwards you lean backwards

571
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,192
And it recognizes that you want to go backwards

572
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:02,752
The interesting thing with the independent axles is

573
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:07,360
What you put one foot so your left foot forward and your right foot back you literally spin

574
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,128
In place

575
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:13,504
Very easy to ride

576
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:18,112
And 11 electric movie at solar panel so I'm all for Anything Electric

577
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:19,136
How long can you ride on

578
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:20,416
With that one charge

579
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,208
A single charge I have

580
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:25,536
Maxed it out yet but what it says is depending on how you ride it

581
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:28,096
Terrain the speed that you ride and so on

582
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:30,144
Is anywhere from 9 to 12 miles

583
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:33,472
Sounds like that's actually about as much as a Segway Cortana

584
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:34,752
Speed-wise

585
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:40,896
You can stand in place not go anywhere you can crawl along really slow or if you go full speed which I just kidding

586
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:42,176
Comfortable enough to do

587
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:43,456
You going to bounce

588
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:45,760
1011 miles an hour so basically

589
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:46,784
6 minutes

590
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,552
Pace

591
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:48,320
Per mile

592
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,344
Holy moly

593
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,184
Oh you can haul you can haul and it's silent because it's electric so actually

594
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:53,952
This is really

595
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,488
What they did is

596
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,072
It's got two little blue LED headlights so that way when you are

597
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,096
Moving

598
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:05,216
And activating one or both of the motors the light for that motor I should light up so people can see

599
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:06,752
And also if you go

600
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,800
I don't know what the threshold is Victor going

601
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:09,568
At 8

602
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:12,640
Close top speed it starts beeping so the people around you

603
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:14,176
Can hear you and get out of your way

604
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:15,712
Along pretty quickly

605
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:16,736
So what

606
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:18,528
It is really really fun

607
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:19,552
Is really fun

608
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:20,320
So how much

609
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:23,136
Well that's great I'm glad you asked that

610
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:23,904
Happy car

611
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:25,440
What I found out

612
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:28,256
In doing a lot and I did a lot of research for this

613
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,024
Thereabouts

614
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,328
Three maybe four companies that make these

615
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,168
And they're all in China they are all the same

616
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,192
Products

617
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:40,800
I bought a no-name brand and I paid 343 I purchased two additional ones for the kids

618
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:42,336
For Christmas don't tell them anybody

619
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:43,872
And they were 299

620
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:47,456
If you buy a brand name one which is takes the exact same thing

621
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:54,112
And slapped a logo on it such as iowahawk Levi board funky duck or any one of a number of other

622
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:54,880
Brand names

623
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,672
You will end up paying

624
00:23:57,184 --> 00:24:00,256
I've seen him for 599 I've seen them for 1,000 I seen them

625
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:05,376
1499 and I've seen them for $1,799

626
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:07,168
Don't do that

627
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:10,496
Don't buy one of those for that much it's not worth it first of all

628
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:12,544
And second of all you get the exact same thing

629
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,824
Probably run 300

630
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,640
In fact if you shop around on Alibaba which is

631
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:17,664
China's

632
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:22,272
Take online Commerce Place you can get it directly from the manufacturer even under

633
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:24,320
Note 8 to 2:50

634
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:26,880
Yeah and if you buy in bulk

635
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:29,184
OtterBox

636
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,768
But I'm not going to get into the personal transporter real hoverboard business myself

637
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:35,584
Corporate gift-giving season is upon us

638
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,608
There you go

639
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:39,168
Now I will say this as fun as they are to ride

640
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:40,960
The outer shell is

641
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:41,984
Is completely plastic

642
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:45,568
And that's fine keeps the weight down it's certainly sturdy enough

643
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:47,360
However when you

644
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:48,896
Are learning to write it

645
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:51,712
Kind of jump off at like a jump off a skateboard

646
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:52,480
And what happens is

647
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:54,016
Nothing rolls over on itself

648
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:54,784
And since you're

649
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,344
Probably getting a sidewalk or road or driveway

650
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,368
It gets counted up

651
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:02,208
Really quickly so you want to be careful when you're learning to ride

652
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,488
Metal shatter

653
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:06,304
Crap to be quite honest but that's okay I can live with it

654
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:07,840
It's something you want to be

655
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:10,400
You don't consider when you when you do if you buy one

656
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:11,424
Learn how to write a note

657
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:15,008
You can ride on the carpet that we learned actually riding it in the house

658
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:17,568
Yeah we are on that we have bamboo floor so we've been around

659
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:20,896
Various rooms are resource that we went on the carpet no problem

660
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:26,016
Not that great on grasping out all the grasses but you could do it and what is it

661
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:26,784
Pretty

662
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,320
Strong National

663
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:30,368
How much does a

664
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:33,184
That's a great question is it is heavy

665
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,208
So if you

666
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:39,840
I do not like right in the city or on a college campus or at work and then you find a place we can't ride it yet to pick it up

667
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:41,632
And it's about 22 and a half pounds

668
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:48,288
It's not big but it's dance because it's got some Hefty batteries in there you got the two electric motors in

669
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,104
That's why these posture to keep the weight down

670
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:56,224
So it's heavy it's not something you're into putting a backpack and tote around when you're not riding at you're going to ride it

671
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,760
And then you can eat off it

672
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:00,320
I'm not going to want to carry

673
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:01,856
Got it okay

674
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:02,880
So I think

675
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:04,160
That is some awesomeness

676
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,696
Disgust

677
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:06,720
Some great dad

678
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:07,488
It's actually

679
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:09,792
Yes I'm confusing operating systems

680
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:12,096
And if you stay tuned we will have

681
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:13,632
Actually some more great gadgets

682
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:14,912

You guys are doing something that is near and dear to my heart

711
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:17,632
Because it involves food

712
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:18,400
And I love it

713
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:22,240
So why don't you start by telling the audience a little bit about what haikyuu is

00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:58,592
My wife's doing lunches on

737
00:27:58,848 --> 00:27:59,360
Breakfast

738
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,384
Pazzo

739
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,432
If I would have taken my wife in that moment like

740
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,968
Hey get out your mobile phone

741
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:07,296
There's no way

742
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:09,088
But I can say to my little one

743
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:10,368
1 people sent for Daddy

744
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:12,928
So do what you get the big smile on her face

745
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:13,952
Graphite you up

746
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:16,256
The fridge and the cereal say bananas

747
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:20,864
Now that goes to a shopping list that's available on my phone my wife's phone

748
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,400
Instantly goes to the left

749
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:24,448
So that when we walk in the store when you don't

750
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:25,728
We need

751
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,264
I can also pick

752
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,032
Shopping list

753
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:31,616
And then actually actively go shop for you online

754
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:32,384
And

755
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,176
Purchase items

756
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:36,480

758
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,808
Or in a fridge magnet

759
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:40,576
Netflix

760
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,880
Adora fridge magnet

761
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:45,952
Either way I mean baby you're doing the nutshell like

762
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:49,792
So this week you guys actually just announced

763
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:52,096
Here for people in the US

764
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:53,120
Partnership with

765
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:53,888
Walmart

766
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:55,168
And Peapod

767
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:56,448
That will now allow

768
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:57,472
U2

769
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:58,240
Put these things

770
00:28:58,496 --> 00:28:59,520
What's in your shopping list

771
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:01,056
And then you can pick them up

772
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:04,384
At Walmart store at participating Walmart stores and

773
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,968
With Peapod they will actually deliver to some people in some areas

774
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:13,600
Absolutely so we've integrated with both of us online grocery stores

775
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:15,136
To allow you

776
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:16,160
Bata Shop

777
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:20,000
What I'm excited about is this idea that you guys have built up

778
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:21,024
Connected objects

779
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:23,072
Has a business model at

780
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:24,608
Attached to it so I I want to ask

781
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:25,376
Explora kind of

782
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:27,168
How you're doing this because

783
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:29,728
How do you guys make money right now

784
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:30,752
I'm spending

785
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:37,408
For now it's a it's a $50 to buy send for me because I am a very busy person in our family is busy and I

786
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:38,176
I have a child

787
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:38,944
This is

788
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,760
Totally worth $50 for the convenient but

789
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:43,808
For a lot of people they might be like who

790
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:46,880
Armani to keep track of my grocery list

791
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:48,416
So let's talk about

792
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:53,024
Why you went into this and then how to think about kind of building a business model

793
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,072
Cuz I think there's a lot of options

794
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:56,608
Explore them

795
00:29:58,144 --> 00:30:00,448
Couple different questions than their the first one is

796
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:01,728
Why do the spa

797
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,776
Why does it why does this device

798
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:07,360
This is a first world problem

799
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:08,128
So why create

800
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:10,432
It is a first world problem

801
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:11,456
There's no doubt about

802
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,480
Like we recognize

803
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:16,064
But fundamentally we got tired of running out of stuff

804
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:19,136
Ain't we got busy family

805
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:20,416
Demanding job

806
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:21,952
3 kids

807
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:24,000
So yeah we tried mobile app

808
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,792
They're a good step in the right direction

809
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:27,328
Can you get your list with you when you walk

810
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:28,864
The store you can share with others

811
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:30,656
But In the Heat of the Moment

812
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,448
I do not like in that scenario like a

813
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:35,008
Describes about getting breakfast ready for the family

814
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:37,056
In the Heat of the Moment you fall back

815
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,360
Because it's fast

816
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:40,384
Easy Uke

817
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,408
Shut down

818
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:44,480
Mobile apps are not necessarily the right tool for the job

819
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:46,016
I'm inside the house

820
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:47,040
So we wanted to create a

821
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:49,600
Fast and easiest pen and paper

822
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:50,880
You had all the benefits

823
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,672
You got a nap

824
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:55,488
Is it available on both Apple and Android

825
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:59,072
Can I just talk to it or do I have

826
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:00,608
Have to manually added

827
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:01,632
Type in microtia

828
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:07,008
Are apps you can on the Android version you can both stand and speak

829
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:08,288
I mean Apple version

830
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:09,056
There is

831
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:10,592
Skinny

832
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:11,616
Speaking yet

833
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:13,408
You can pick some regulars

834
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,176
You can

835
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:15,968
Manually type git men

836
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:20,064
Lots of shopping list

837
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:22,112
Oceanside

838
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:24,160
You can share less across

839
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:25,952
Even if

840
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:26,720
You might have

841
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:29,280
IPhone your husband has Android

842
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:30,048
No problem

843
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,328
Shopping list

844
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:34,400
So that when you walk in the story both have to list with you

845
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:35,424
Yes

846
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,240
Android and iOS are they both important

847
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:39,520
They are

848
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:40,800
Thank you for doing both

849
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:43,616
So what kind of think about building a business

850
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:44,384
Around the connect

851
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:47,712
Where do you see your company is going to

852
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:48,736
Revenue coming

853
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:55,136
From is it from consumers buying the device is it from building out revenue from third-party services how do you how do you want

854
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:57,440
Certainly

855
00:31:57,952 --> 00:32:00,256
The device yesterday

856
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,304
Absolutely

857
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:06,144
But when we think about the business bottle

858
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,680
It's more about

859
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:09,728
For bringing retailers orders

860
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:11,264
Then we expect to become

861
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,360
Stream charging

862
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:17,152
Retailers

863
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:18,176
Tesla charger

864
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:19,200
Francis well

865
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:21,248
But you're lucky blast me like

866
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:23,808
Advertising on a product

867
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,368
I'm in a potentially down the road

868
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,392
Maybe

869
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:28,672
And absolutely wechat

870
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:29,696
Monetize

871
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:30,720
Stay at the station

872
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:32,256
Gameworks still focused

873
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:33,536
On speakerphone

874
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:34,560
I'm delivering

875
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:36,096
Experience

876
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:36,864
And that means

877
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:39,936
A shopping app that remembers for you and also packed

878
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:43,776
Recharge retailers

879
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:44,800
Absolutely

880
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:46,080
No doubted

881
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:47,104
That's one

882
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:49,408
Where do you see

883
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:53,248
Kind of the future of food acquisition grocery shopping

884
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:55,040
Walk me through 5 years

885
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:56,832
Kind of what it's going to be like

886
00:32:57,344 --> 00:33:00,160
Now you can just grocery shopping just the active

887
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:02,720
Crafting recipe you're thinking about what to

00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:05,280
What to make cuz there's a lot of other connect

889
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,816
Did products kind of vying

890
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:13,216
My kitchen space and some of them are really interesting and like this idea of you know might this just don't view of like

891
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:20,128
Connected activity tracker saying Haywood for a run you should really eat some potassium so here how about a banana smoothie

892
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:23,968
So I don't know maybe this is 5 or 10 years but like walking through the six.

893
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,016
What is a

894
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:26,784

895
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,600
Cricket stick things I'll be be made over

896
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:30,880
Inside

898
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,464

Like you know how did we prepare food before

902
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:46,240
Today we we might think

903
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:47,776
We do research

904
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:50,592
How did that work

905
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:51,872
Microfiche

906
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:54,688

All your house

914
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:09,280
Consumption

915
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:11,840
Audition for that

916
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:13,376
Continue to be

917
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:14,400
Answers

918
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:15,424
Inside the home

919
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,448
That

920
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,728
They're aware

921
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,776

Magnetic is really important

926
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:26,688
Getting you touched on this earlier about life

927
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,224
Yeah people who are

928
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,272
Yeah freak out by things listening

929
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:31,296
You listening all the time

930
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:33,088
You don't think they should be

931
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:34,624
HB creepy technology

932
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:39,488
Faith Technologies

933
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,280
A good number of years

934
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:43,840
There's an influx of technology that made life

935
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:44,864
Waiting

936
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:46,400
People in hell

937
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:47,936
Nighttime think like

938
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:48,704
Washing machine

939
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:49,728
Dishwasher

940
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,032
I didn't want to date a live tonight

941
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:56,384
It in Atlantic City apartment without a without a dishwasher

942
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:58,176
Taylor Swift die

943
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:01,504
Is that okay

944
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,808
Yataghan Gatsby's are first world problems

945
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,088
Yes we understand

946
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,160
But they're also the impact on

947
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:10,976
To think about the future

948
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:14,304
Retail will irritable move inside the hall

949
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:16,864
Angelini net doors are setting

950
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,936
Skittles commercial

951
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:22,496
Experience of

952
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:24,032
Being able to buy things

953
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:25,312
Will be more kinky

954
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:26,080
Great Adventure

955
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:28,128
19 places where cops

956
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:30,944
That's a little that could feel yucky

957
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,480
Am I single

958
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:34,528
Because that's really important

959
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:39,648
Yeah cuz advertising I think there's new advertising models that people aren't really talking about

960
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:40,928
Instead I think

961
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:43,488
Are really interesting or could be interesting

962
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:49,888
Around like apis for I think it was like kind of the old Campbell's cookbooks on steroids

963
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:53,984
And I don't know if you have those cookbooks for the 1970s but

964
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,032
OKC

965
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:59,104
So my mom had that

966
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:03,456
Scrum was a working mom and she used them because

967
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:04,224
The working mom

968
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:09,088
And so I grew up on a variety of Frozen vegetable meat in Campbell Soup

969
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:09,856
Casseroles

970
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:12,928
And that was a form of advertising and I think about

971
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:14,976
You know today with an API

972
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:17,280
You really have an understanding you are like

973
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:18,048
Proctoring

974
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,584
Campbell Soup of

975
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,376
What people are consuming

976
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:22,400
Based on you know

977
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:25,472
But I'm logging in activity tracker my food tracking

978
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:27,776
And you can start delivering to me some you know

979
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:29,824
Crazy recipes I customize rest

980
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,872
And then you could you know

981
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:32,896
Maybe help.

982
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:36,992
Compile my what are those called meal plans for the week that could be helpful

983
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:40,064
That could be depending on how it's done and you know if your

984
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,112
Automatically filling my shopping bag

985
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:42,880
You know that

986
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:48,768
I is a working mom might really actually welcomed this if I could set parameters around that ghetto

987
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:50,560
Sodium intake and things like that

988
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:51,584
But I don't think

989
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:56,448
I don't know if Custer like companies are really there yet I don't know

990
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:58,240
Such a good point about

991
00:36:58,752 --> 00:36:59,520
You know that balance

992
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:04,384
Examples

993
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:05,408
Where

994
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,944
Things have been helpful

995
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:08,480
Based on

996
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:10,272
Other companies knowledge of what

997
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:11,552
You like don't like

998
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,088
Watch.

999
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:14,880
Bright Netflix

1000
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:16,416
First come to my mind

1001
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:17,696
I like Netflix

1002
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:21,536
Most people do

1003
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:24,608
Radio is another good example that I think like

1004
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:25,888
Pandora and Spotify

1005
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,168
I'm going to make you mad

1006
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:28,192
Predictions for

1007
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:29,472
What you might want to listen to

1008
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,800
All recipes that far from that type of

1009
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:34,592
Negations and

1010
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,968
I think what would be important that recipes would be being able to

1011
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:41,760
Control some of the parade

1012
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:43,296
Campers at Lake

1013
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:45,344
I think a company wants to

1014
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:49,440
Send me an and I think food companies are getting a lot smarter about changing their off

1015
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:53,792
I certainly don't want a bunch of recipes that offer me

1016
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:55,328
Really poor option

1017
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:56,352
Cuz I'm not going to

1018
00:37:57,888 --> 00:37:59,680
That's right that's right you also don't want

1019
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:01,472
Feel like a like a commercial in

1020
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:04,544
No one likes

1021
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,312
To feel like the

1022
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:12,480
But people do want

1023
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,576
And that's certainly the way we approach our product

1024
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:17,600
Is

1025
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:20,160
Yes focus on delivering value today

1026
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:21,440
I'd help

1027
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,488
If you do that

1028
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:25,024
The belated Builder

1029
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:26,304
I guarantee it

1030
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:27,840
If you do that

1031
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:30,400
True you guys are really doing this so

1032
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,168
I guess

1033
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:37,568
From me I do want to make sure how are you building your product to make sure somebody is equally good scanning and voice

1034
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:39,360
Enginetech she doesn't have built

1035
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:40,128
Mico

1036
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:43,200
Which does exactly the same thing

1037
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:43,968
Take a look at it

1038
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:47,808
A big

1039
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:48,832
Advantage

1040
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:50,368
Publishing a

1041
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:51,648
I am weak

1042
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:52,672
Created this guy

1043
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:54,976
Thing in your house

1044
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:56,000
Can you scan

1045
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:57,024
Speaking

1046
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,048
List of shops

1047
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:59,328
Are you satisfied

1048
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,352
And

1049
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:03,936
You looking at you like a like a like a Fitbit

1050
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:04,704
Where

1051
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,728
Even after

1052
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,008
I copied like

1053
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:08,032
Jawbone

1054
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:09,056
Nike

1055
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:11,872
I and others moved in and created similar type

1056
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:13,408
Fitness trackers

1057
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,688
Has data from

1058
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:18,784
A year ago that they still controlled 68% of the market

1059
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:22,624
Your people saying well you know well now Apple

1060
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,416
Looking at it's going to be all over

1061
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:27,232
Do you know if there's an idea or I should do thing I feel already

1062
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,168
Any startup that makes it to an IPO

1063
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:38,496
That's a success

1064
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:39,776
All right

1065
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:45,664
Well then your final challenge

1066
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:47,200
Cuz I am still think

1067
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:49,504
