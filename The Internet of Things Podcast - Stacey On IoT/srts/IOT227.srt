.

42
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:53,920

/ Stacey

44
00:01:58,784 --> 00:01:59,808
Already

45
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,088
Heaven

46
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,648
I'm going to get this started off with

47
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:04,928
Smart

48
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:05,696
Beds

49
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,744
This is partially because I love

50
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,512
Tracking my sleep

51
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,304
Fitbit

52
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,096
I think the Whiting sleep tracker

53
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,120
I've done a lot here

54
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,144
Because I am

55
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:15,424
About sleep

56
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:22,080
And what is happening is Tempur-Pedic is launching a new not connected mattress but a connected mattress

57
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:22,848
Bass

58
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,384
Actually

59
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:26,944
Detects if someone is snoring

60
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:29,248
And activates the bass

61
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,272
To stop

62
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,832
So my husband is really excited about it

63
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,112
Cuz I'll be honest you guys

64
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:34,880
I snore

65
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:36,160
I think I

66
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,720
If you remember but I did try that

67
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:39,744
Snoring device

68
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:43,328
And actually it did something similar that idea was

69
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,096
Had

70
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,376
Microphones

71
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,144
And when it

72
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,728
Heard me snoring it would inflate The Sting in my pillow

73
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,264
And lift my head up

74
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,824
That didn't work so well for

75
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:56,128
But the idea is similar on the temp

76
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,920
Orthopedic face except

77
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,456
It doesn't have any mic

78
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:02,272
Car phones what it does is it to text vibration

79
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,344
Set I like better than a microphone in the

80
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,112
Bedroom

81
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:10,464
That's what I thought you would say in this works with the Tempurpedic line of mattresses

82
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:13,280
They didn't test it with any other mattress but it's possible it

83
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:14,560
Other

84
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:19,936
And the bed doesn't just measure snoring it also measures

85
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:20,960
Heart and breathing

86
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,752
So

87
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:25,824
The tracker will sense the vibrations from snoring

88
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,104
Just the bed

89
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,384
And

90
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,920
It's also going to tell you how I used

91
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,760
So we have a non-connected bed

92
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:38,112
And base that's very similar to this we have the Sleep Number beds with the

93
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:44,000
Remote sensor wire remotes for each side of the bed obviously you can change your sleep number by adding more of us are

94
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:44,768
2 mattress

95
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:47,072
But also they raise your head and or your feet

96
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:49,376
When I was snoring will I do so

97
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:51,680
When I snore my wife occasionally

98
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,984
Tries to raise up the bed manually

99
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,264
And this would obviously

100
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:58,592
Get rid of that manual activity buddy comes in a car

101
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,176
The cost of the smart base is 1799

102
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:03,456
Queen size bed

103
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,784
I mean we paid a lot for Arnon

104
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,064
Non snoring

105
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:12,416
Sites in line that is totally in line with it

106
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:13,440
If

107
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,208
Now

108
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:15,232
I have a smart

109
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,791
Well I don't have a smart base I do have a base with Wi-Fi

110
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:19,071
I do not ask me why

111
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:22,911
The only time we've used it is when my husband was playing

112
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,447
Which was

113
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,751
Turning on the vibration on the bed

114
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:27,775
Itau

115
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,311
And I was like what is happening

116
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:33,407
It must be malfunctioning

117
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,431
And then like

118
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,455
He'd hit a button

119
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:36,479
Calculator

120
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:37,503
I didn't realize I had

121
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,319
The point is that is literally the only time

122
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:41,855
Here

123
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:43,903
But it does too

124
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:44,927
1

125
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,719
If it's with my idea

126
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:49,279
Which is we will start seeing smart embedded in product

127
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,071
Just as part of the basic

128
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:54,655
Going forward I expect this sort of thing

129
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,191
In a lot of

130
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:59,519
And it'll be just an added little bonus

131
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:01,055
Hey if you're storing the soul

132
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,079
So just out of

133
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:03,871
There's tons of

134
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:08,735
Potential products like that I mean I'm leaving back in my chair with very bad posture right now sensor could

135
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:09,759
Protect that

136
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,039
Move the chair

137
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,343
Color for example

138
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,159
Yeah exactly in so we'll see that and then

139
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:19,999
This actually is nice because it's offering you tracking

140
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,791
But it's also offering

141
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,583
Action so it's actually

142
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,375
In the sense that it's going to do some

143
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:26,911
Not just

144
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,191
So

145
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,727
Actionable information

146
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:30,751
There we go

147
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:31,775
So fancy

148
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:36,127
Alright so I'm Pro the Tempurpedic smart bed if that's something you want

149
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,431
If it's not then that's okay

150
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:41,247
Next up is something that Kevin and I

151
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,527
We don't often does a

152
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:44,575
Which probably makes the show super boring

153
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:47,135
No disagreement here

154
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:47,903
Google

155
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:48,927
Talked about

156
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,463
Project soli

157
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:51,743
Gosh

158
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:52,767
Five or six years

159
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:56,607
And I was excited about it this is a gesture-based technology

160
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:57,631
Ultrasonic

161
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:58,911
And

162
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:01,727
Now they showed a video for the pixel 4

163
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,263
That involves

164
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,031
Project soli

165
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:05,311
Which is gesture-based can

166
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,079
Trolls

167
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:08,383
And you can use it to swipe

168
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:09,407
In the air

169
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:10,943
To move things around

170
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,223
I think it's cool

171
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,271
I think it's

172
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:15,295
Cool

173
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:18,367
But here's there's nothing it just to be clear Google has not.

174
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:21,695
Announce the pixel for what they're doing slowly leaking

175
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,231
Information such as

176
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:26,047
What it's going to look like they did last month this month it's heavy

177
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,327
Up at the top in that

178
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:30,399
Paper bezel the reason has a big bezels because it's got

179
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:31,679
Face unlock

180
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:36,287
Top projectors like the iPhone and IR cameras for face unlock

181
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,335
A light sensor

182
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:40,895
Salon also has the project

183
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,431
Sweet radar chip

184
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,479
And I filled your songs that you mention

185
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,783
Yes it's cool

186
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:51,391
And they have a 20 second video showing how you can unlock your phone with your face the pics

187
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,415
Performing the song

188
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:59,071
And you can swipe over the phone or from the phone to scroll through web pages and content and such

189
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:03,423
And I think I'm not jazzed about it because we seen this before

190
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,471
Regardless of the technology used

191
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:09,567
It doesn't add or hasn't yet at a tremendous amount of value

192
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:12,383
So that's my big beef with us

193
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,175
You feel otherwise

194
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,967
The reason I feel otherwise

195
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,783
Cuz I have not changed my smartphone

196
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,831
This is not a smartphone

197
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,135
This is a

198
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,159
Television

199
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:30,047
This is a I'm cooking and I have a display a Google home display and I want to move it with

200
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:31,839
Touching her using my

201
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,375
My voice that is what this is

202
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,679
So imagine your Google display

203
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,471
I know we both love

204
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,519
Imagine being able to gesture to

205
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:44,127
I don't disagree with everything you said in your car

206
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:46,943
Their places were voice is cumbersome and like

207
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:47,967
You know saying

208
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,503
Haji skip

209
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,807
You know when you hit the microphone the Music Stops

210
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,343
I think so this is why

211
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:58,719
And I get that I think the difference is you're looking at the broader picture

212
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:01,791
And I'm looking at a product that has no need for

213
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,071
Soli radar Japan

214
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,863
So the reason they're putting it there

215
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:08,191
I would argue is to build the economies of scale necessary

216
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:09,471
Although

217
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:11,263
Not the pixel phone

218
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:16,639
It's basically to get the economies of scale

219
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:18,943
That make it cheap enough and reasonable enough

220
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:19,967
Definition of device

221
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:20,991
That's

222
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,807
Yeah I get it I get ice I suspect

223
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:27,391
So they'd be better off putting it in a new smart display

224
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:29,183
Because they probably sell

225
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:31,999
More of those and they sell pixel devices quite honestly

226
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,839
Alright Google ignore the pixel 4

227
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:36,863
Put it in the next

228
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:37,887
Ness

229
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:38,655
Set the nest

230
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,495
What is the Google Nest hub

231
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:43,519
Yeah

232
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,311
All right

233
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:48,639
So that's our disagreement Dushore or of the month

234
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:49,919
I'd like to know

235
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,455
I don't know

236
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,223
But

237
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,271
Let's talk about Amazon ring

238
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,039
And

239
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:58,623
This is been coming up this idea that Amazon

240
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,415
With this ring doorbells is

241
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,439
Building

242
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:02,463
Penn Optical

243
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,487
And I believe will

244
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,023
Called it

245
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:07,839
It's that it is working with police.

246
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,935
Or ring is working with police departments

247
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:12,959
2

248
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,519
Gather data on neighborhood

249
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:17,055
Crime so when a crime

250
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:17,823
Occurs in

251
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,615
People have ring doorbells

252
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,895
There's a neighbor's app

253
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:23,967
And what happens is the police can ask for

254
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,759
The video doorbell

255
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:28,831
Recordings from people in the area

256
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:30,623
They have to have a case number

257
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,159
And they have to

258
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:34,719
Ask permission so they can't just pull this date

259
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,791
But what's squeaking people out

260
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:40,607
Is the police are actually working with ring

261
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:42,143
Inner getting incentives

262
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:43,423
From ring

263
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,703
2

264
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,519
Promote the ring doorbell specifically

265
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,055
And

266
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:52,127
The more people who sign up for the Neighbors app

267
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,943
The more doorbells

268
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:55,711
The police

269
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:57,503
It gets to dispense

270
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,295
And this rub

271
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,319
People the wrong way

272
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,599
Aniket why

273
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:05,183
Everyone says they put in safeguards by the fact that you know

274
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,743
Police can't just go through a database and scroll through

275
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:08,511
Randall

276
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:09,535
Doorbell sound

277
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,327
You have to have a case number

278
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,607
I have two requests in the

279
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,375
A person has to agree

280
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:17,471
But police are promoting one particular type

281
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,519
Because they're getting

282
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,055
One particular type of video.

283
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:21,823
About that's why

284
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,103
2

285
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:24,895
It does

286
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:28,735
Turn a neighborhood walk into kind of the potential of being

287
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:29,503
Surveilled

288
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:32,319
Yeah and I have a

289
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,599
Camera that faces

290
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:37,695
Front of my house in people do walk past people obviously Drive pass

291
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:40,511
They probably don't know that they're being caught on camera

292
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,607
I talked about this once before in the show it's a homeless feel like I should have a sign

293
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,631
Cat says hey

294
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,679
Just so you know

295
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:48,959
There's a camera here

296
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,007
When you walk past your going to be on it

297
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,311
I don't use the data for anything

298
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,079
Other than

299
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:58,943
When I need to such as when my car was hit and that was a good thing I needed to do that because the person

300
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,479
Said they didn't hit my car

301
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,759
And clearly they did

302
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:02,783
Let me ask you

303
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:03,807
And so

304
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:06,111
If for example there was a crime

305
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,927
Down the street or two streets over and

306
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,207
Police said hey

307
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,231
I know you

308
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,511
What do you have a ring

309
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:19,423
I don't have a ring out that that that has front camera is a wise and then my front door which is Ash on the side of the townhouse unit

310
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,703
Is a nest hello

311
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,007
Okay so they just maybe they saw your

312
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:25,567
So they call and they say hey

313
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:30,175
Can we get your camera data for this crime that was someone stole a computer broke in

314
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,199
Two streets over

315
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,479
We want to see if

316
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,015
Can catch the

317
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:35,551
Which way they turned on

318
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,319
On your street

319
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,343
Right

320
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,623
Would you say yes

321
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:41,439
I probably would've you everything first

322
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,463
Myself

323
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:48,095
Because I wouldn't want to send the video of a my neighbor's doing something else incriminating

324
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:50,655
Okay see ya

325
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:51,935
So then

326
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:55,007
You review it first and if your neighbor is out smoking weed on

327
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,031
Porch uibe

328
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:59,615
Maybe I could scrub that out in myself like a

329
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:02,943
I get a pet video obviously cuz it has and it's my right to do so

330
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:03,967
As far as I'm

331
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:07,295
Anna and it's not hurting the police for what they're looking for

332
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,319
So

333
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,855
That's probably what I would do

334
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:10,623
So

335
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,903
I'm a good neighbor I think

336
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:15,999
So with neighbors they just get the raw file so that's an interesting

337
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,559
Correct and there's no and I looked

338
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,863
Document cloud is some of the documentation

339
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:21,887
Between

340
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:23,167
Ringing in the ear

341
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,191
Some of the police

342
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:24,959
Apartments

343
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,751
It was nothing in there that

344
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,031
Kind of allows for that

345
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,311
I just get it like you said

346
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:34,175
Marilyn I want to help if there's if there's an issue and I can provide helpful Evan some happy to do it

347
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:37,247
But it's a personal choice everybody sing feel differently about this

348
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:40,063
Yashow Kevin isn't in conflict with me this time

349
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,343
Time he's now in conflict

350
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,367
With himself

351
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:46,463
All right we'll see if we're in agreement on this issue

352
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:50,815
The FTC last week said that it will host a workshop on

353
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:53,119
Coppa the children's online protection

354
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,143
Privacy

355
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,167
Rule

356
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:55,935
And

357
00:12:56,191 --> 00:13:00,287
The idea here is there going to host a workshop to see if changes are needed

358
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:03,615
And this is news and I was surprised that people did not

359
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:08,479
Pick this up very much in the reason is because the FTC every

360
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:11,039
10 years is supposed to check out

361
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:11,807
See how the

362
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:12,831
A couple rules

363
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:13,599
Doing

364
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:16,415
So do they fit the current standards yes or no

365
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,207
The last time they did it they didn't

366
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,231
2013

367
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:23,071
So they're doing this earlier in the reason they're doing it

368
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,631
Is because they're worried about

369
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,399
Voice

370
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,167
Speakers

371
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:30,239
What they're going to ask is a bunch of questions of

372
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,007
The industry

373
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:38,431
They are going to be talking about websites cuz I know YouTube and children's access to advertisements and children's access to

374
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,223
Various other things on

375
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,015
But

376
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:45,343
They also are going to be talking about what are the implications for

377
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,879
Copa enforcement

378
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:50,719
Raised by technology such as interactive television Interactive

379
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:52,511
Gaming or similar in Iraq

380
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:57,631
And should the commission consider a specific exemption

381
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,655
Parental consent

382
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,191
For the use of Education Tech

383
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,495
In schools

384
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:05,311
And there they actually do talk about voice

385
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:12,479
And then should the commission modify the rule to encourage General audience platforms to identify and police

386
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:13,759
Child-directed

387
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:14,527
Content

388
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:15,295
Uploaded by

389
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,599
That's the YouTube

390
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:19,647
So

391
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:22,719
Did publish something in the Federal Register and I've been a link to that

392
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:24,255
Cuz that talks a lot about

393
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,279
All the questions

394
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,047
There

395
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,071
Asking

396
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,375
But in the education section

397
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:34,239
Like hey should schools use this technology and also

398
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:37,055
What about the collection of audio files is a

399
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,591
Replacement for text

400
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,383
Where the audio files are promptly

401
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,151
Deleted

402
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:43,455
In line with what the agency hit issue

403
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:44,991
Years ago

404
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:48,319
And this is again related to the fact that Amazon

405
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:51,647
And I believe Google have both come out saying

406
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,695
Yeah we can't delete everything

407
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:54,719
Because

408
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,999
Benes service

409
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:57,791
Kezar

410
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:00,863
I a scroll through this there are tons of questions here

411
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:04,191
I have a question for you and that is

412
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,239
Because it says

413
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:10,591
You can comment on this on or before October 23rd 2019

414
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:15,711
Does that mean this is for public, so could parents actually read this and respond to some of these things

415
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:16,735
Yes

416
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,551
I think there's a lot of

417
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:23,647
I'm actually going to spend a lot of time with this and I'm probably going to come up with like

418
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,183
Things that I think

419
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:25,951
AR

420
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,231
As a parent

421
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:28,255
That I care about

422
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,791
Cuz my daughter uses

423
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:30,559
A lot of this type

424
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:34,911
LG schools we actually just had a question from somebody was a teacher who wanted to

425
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:35,679
They have there

426
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,215
Class Dubois skills

427
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:40,287
I I think that there's a lot of

428
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:42,335
Stuff here like should parents be able to do

429
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:44,383
Request deletion of personal information

430
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,151
Collective II

431
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,175
Leaders of Technology

432
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:49,503
And that's within the school setting

433
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:56,159
But at the same time I understand why companies want some of the state up because they need to make their services better

434
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:03,583
I mean I see this as you said an early review basically because of the rise of smart speakers microphones Etc

435
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,375
School

436
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,399
Center

437
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:09,471
The technology is quickly changing we're finding out

438
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:12,543
More about what really happens with your recording or not talk about that

439
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,567
Some more in a second

440
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:19,199
I think it's smarter than to do this I think what they're trying to do is kind of educate themselves a little bit

441
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:19,967
And see

442
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:20,735
How well

443
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:26,623
Are the current laws applicable how often are they actually use such as you know if somebody

444
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:29,951
Request a parent request deletion or review their child's data

445
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:32,255
How often does it happen and how often

446
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:34,303
Are companies complying with that Etc

447
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,095
It seems to be like a

448
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:36,863
Let's

449
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:39,935
Research this little bit more up since the landscape has changed

450
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,727
I will say

451
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:43,007
There's been plenty of

452
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,823
App company instead of taking advantage of Chile

453
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,615
People I mean

454
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:50,431
If you can make money by taking advantage of children it is

455
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:52,223
Literally like taking candy

456
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:53,503
For this case money

457
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,271
From a baby

458
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:56,831
And so we see a lot of

459
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:57,855
Malicious

460
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:58,879
Is a malicious isn't

461
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,159
Various I feel like I've

462
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,183
Where is here

463
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,463
But shame

464
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,231
Slimy

465
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:04,767
Yes

466
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,559
Slimy Behavior

467
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,095
On behalf of certain

468
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,167
No this isn't Google this isn't

469
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,447
Apple but these are

470
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,287
Platforms that allow for slimy companies to come in contact

471
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,567
With your children and

472
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,103
Get them to

473
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,383
Give data

474
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,151
Gift I mean

475
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,455
I can totally see you know

476
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:26,271
Things asking for personal data from children

477
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,063
Just two

478
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,343
Maybe make it easier to hack

479
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:30,623
Neither

480
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:33,439
So much out there or you could ask kids questions

481
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:36,767
What brand of milk do you have in your fridge and it's like a little Focus

482
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,303
Cancel think that's fine

483
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,095
So

484
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:43,679
I think this is necessary I think research is good I'm going to spend some

485
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:44,959
Really hard

486
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:45,727
Time to Kill

487
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:47,519
What

488
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,543
Makes sense

489
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,567
And I should mention this

490
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,127
The FTC wants to know also

491
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:54,687
What kind of bird needs rules

492
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:55,711
Create on

493
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:57,503
Bigger companies smaller

494
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:58,527
Etcetera

495
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,343
So not every company is going to be able to create

496
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:03,135
Neutral age-gate

497
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,159
Concept India

498
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:04,927
Here which is a

499
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:07,743
Creating a subsection of your

500
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:09,535
Platform that is

501
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,327
For people who don't have it

502
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,095
NH

503
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,911
The assumption is there kids

504
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,959
And if you

505
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:17,983
Speak up

506
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,007
Can small cavities

507
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:23,871
And that's what's happening here if you want more information I

508
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,407
Link to the Federal Register

509
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:27,199
You guys can go read it for yourselves

510
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,479
And common

511
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:29,503
Andkon

512
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:30,783
All right

513
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,063
Let's do some

514
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:32,831
Quick bits

515
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:35,391
Apple also uses contractors

516
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:37,695
Just like Google just like Amazon

517
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:41,023
Just like we said everyone would have to do is a form of QA

518
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:43,839
And these contractors can listen to your Siri

519
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:45,631
Kevin event

520
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:49,471
Yeah I mean we just wanted to point it out because

521
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:52,031
It would be unfair to point out the issues

522
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,311
From

523
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:55,871
Other companies in an appointment for Apple

524
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,663
Interesting to me is that

525
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,687
The

526
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:00,735
Apple watch and the homepod

527
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:03,551
Apparently had the most frequent sources of mistaken

528
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:05,343
Activations I guess and

529
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:07,903
The contractor that regarding spoke with

530
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:12,255
Said they could definitely hear a doctor and a patient so they can your medical history

531
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:16,863
Pedir a car with engine background noise it sounded like a drug deal

532
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:19,167
And then of course people engaging in into

533
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,191
Ax

534
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:27,871
Apple's no different Bible says less than 1% of all

535
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:31,199
Are these recordings were because of

536
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,991
Norfolk positive

537
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,527
Inactivation that was wrong

538
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:37,599
But that's a big number when you think about how many iPhones watches and

539
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:39,135
Sutter out there with Siri

540
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:41,951
Oh yeah we talked about this son this weekend Google

541
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:42,975
Which is a show that

542
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:44,511
Kevin is sometimes on and I'm

543
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,279
Nicole host

544
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,303
And

545
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,095
You know we were talking about it and

546
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:51,935
Not this particular issue is I believe the Amazon issue and

547
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:54,751
Somebody's iPhone activated Siri and poop

548
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,799
Suddenly there's a transcript apus

549
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:01,151
So we all seem to trust apple and

550
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:07,551
What about the other companies what it companies do consumers most trust and mistrust will

551
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:10,111
Pcmag ran a survey on their own

552
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:13,951
2000 us consumers participated back in May

553
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:18,559
And the results are code I expected as far as the trust

554
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:24,191
It was actually Google first then Amazon or buy Microsoft and Samsung

555
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,983
LG products

556
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,007
Career

557
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:29,055
10% and then Facebook

558
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:31,359
Was actually being least trusted in fact

559
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:32,639
The mistress

560
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:39,039
Chart if you want to take a look at it will Lincoln the show notes is off the charts after Facebook the mistrust was 48

561
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:39,807
Percent of consumers

562
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:40,831
Mistrust

563
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,111
Facebook

564
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:45,439
Every other company in here in the survey

565
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:48,767
Was at 10% or less for mistrust so

566
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:53,119
I'm not surprised to hear you have a little surprise while they did this before

567
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:53,887
Is the big back

568
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:54,655
Clash over

569
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,959
Listen to my voice recordings

570
00:20:57,727 --> 00:21:03,871
So is that could skew these results now sure

571
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:04,639
It's not a smartphone

572
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:05,919
Coyote

573
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:07,199
Which is why it's not on

574
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:10,527
Well apples not

575
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:15,135
How to make TVs Motors Facebook obviously they don't make smart

576
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:16,159
Displays

577
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:17,184
Just make

578
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,744
Psalms and the homepod

579
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:25,888
Yes pretty much mobile devices aside from the homepod which we know hasn't really taken off so

580
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:29,984
I guess they're just not a big enough player to be asking about in this particular question

581
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,264
Okay that would have been in

582
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:32,800
I would have had the mother

583
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:37,664
All right

584
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:38,688
Speaking

585
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,224
Trust

586
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,016
There's another

587
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,808
There's another vulnerability

588
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,392
And this one is the

589
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:49,440
Amcrest ip2

590
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,720
Um blah blah

591
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:52,512
It's a cheap camera

592
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:54,048
In this particular

593
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,072
Case

594
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:56,608
You can connect to the audio stream

595
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,144
Septimus

596
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,472
Write your Monday notes to use so somebody could be listening at all time

597
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:03,008
There's no record or anything it just

598
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:05,056
Is listening because of the abilities

599
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:08,640
It is a low-cost like a $58 camera

600
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:11,456
On Crestor amcrest rather I don't know that brand

601
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:14,784
And I tend to stick with brands that I know for this very reason

602
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,112
Not the brands the big Brands don't have their security issues to

603
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,904
What concerns me is

604
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:25,024
Amazon Celsius and I wish Amazon start cracking down on selling things that aren't

605
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:27,328
Safe number one number two

606
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,888
I think a lot of people bought this because it has

607
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,984
Nearly 12000 customer reviews + 857 answer

608
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:34,752
Questions

609
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,312
That leaves me to believe a lot of people at the scammer

610
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:38,848
Yeah and

611
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:39,616
They thought it was

612
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,432
So the next question is

613
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,968
What is

614
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,296
Company to get in this is a rebranded hardware from another come

615
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,064
Japanese

616
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,344
They probably did the soft

617
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:51,136
So the question is

618
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:52,416
Can you fix

619
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:58,304
So this has a common vulnerabilities and exposures or CVV numbers

620
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,328
Official reported

621
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,096
As far as a

622
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:00,864
Fix

623
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:03,680
It says n a for proposed

624
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,216
I don't know

625
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:06,496
It's a no sign

626
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,800
To tenable network security Inc

627
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:10,848
So as of now I do not see any

628
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,664
Alright so in that case unplugged

629
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,224
That's

630
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:17,504
Edward

631
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:20,064
Okay and now it is time

632
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,088
To answer

633
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:22,880

This

Product

663
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:24,832
For you

664
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:27,392
Will send that out to yet if

665
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:28,672
You enter

666
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:30,976
All right

667
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:33,280
Next week we'll announce our winner for this

668
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:35,072
Stay tuned for that

669
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:36,608
And I also want to say that

670
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:37,376
Last week

671
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,400
So much timing

672
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:41,728
Last week we talked about outdoor light bulbs

673
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:47,104
And we got so many people telling us that they use their Hue bulbs outdoors in

674
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,384
Minnesota

675
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,664
In Sweden

676
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,688
In Norway

677
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:51,712
So

678
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,016
We discuss the temperature ranges be

679
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:59,392
Because neither as well I didn't live in a place where my outdoor Hue bulbs ever got below freezing

680
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:00,416
And

681
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,184
Kevin's

682
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:01,952
Wasn't using

683
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:02,720
That so

684
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:03,744
He's not a huge fan

685
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:07,840
But apparently lots of people use their Hue bulbs outdoors in the

686
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:08,608
Just fine

687
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:09,632
17

688
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:10,400

Accu

691
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:14,240
This week

692
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:16,800
We have a question about ceiling fan

693
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:17,824
Let's

694
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:19,360
Stacy and Kevin

695
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:21,408
This is Andre in Virginia

696
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,712
Thank you for your podcast

697
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:25,504
All the time that you guys put into

698
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:27,552
I just installed a

699
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:28,832
Ceiling fan

700
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:29,856
My daughter's room

701
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:30,624
And

702
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:32,416
It has an RF

703
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:33,184
Remote

704
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:34,720
109 ideas

705
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:37,280
To have to find a remote to turn off the lights

706
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,560
And leave the fan one

707
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:39,584
So

708
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,376
I see that the

709
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:42,656
I just recommended

710
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:43,424
Bond

711
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,192
Hub

712
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:46,240
Thinking of your yard

713
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:47,776
Sycophant

714
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:49,568
Google home Alexa

715
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:50,336
So what not

716
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:51,872
And I'm wondering

717
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:56,224
If you have any other recommendations in the other alternatives to bond

718
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:57,504
As in

719
00:25:58,272 --> 00:25:58,784
Really I don't

720
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,552
Want to spend

721
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,576
$90

722
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:01,600
4

723
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:02,624
One device

724
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:03,904
Control

725
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:04,672
Fan lights

726
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:06,208
Okay Andre

727
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:07,744
We have

728
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,768
More work for you to do

729
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:11,584
And we may ultimately have bad news

730
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:14,144
When I heard your question

731
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,168
For you said you didn't

732
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:19,264
That will solve all your problems

733
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:25,408
But I got it $90 is a lot of money you can find it for $70 on Amazon site

734
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,712
And I think sometimes it goes on sale

735
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:28,992
But still a lot of money

736
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:31,296
So we found a product

737
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:36,672
It depends on your fan and your remote

738
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:39,232
And Andre I sympathize xiamen the same

739
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,256
Boat as you

740
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:43,328
I have a Hampton Bay fan and

741
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,608
A remotes

742
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:46,400
And I wish I could make it smart but

743
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:49,216
I've been frustrated and I do want to spend $90 on the bond together

744
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:50,496
So

745
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:54,592
What Ninja for you to do is see if you can find out

746
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:55,872
The frequency

747
00:26:56,128 --> 00:27:01,248
That your remote uses and we presume that is RF and not IR because you said RF

748
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:03,808
In either case if it's IR or RF

749
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,880
What do we find something from broadlink of the wave

750
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:09,952
Yes we found the broadlink RM 33

751
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:10,976
Pro

752
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,256
Inappropriate

753
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:13,024
Plus

754
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:14,560
This is like a little

755
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,864
What's an IR + RF

756
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:19,168
Plus WiFi

757
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:20,448
It's very much like the boss

758
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:22,496
This is a $40

759
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:23,776
It may be 43

760
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:24,544
$3

761
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:25,568
Depending on who

762
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:26,336
Do you buy it from

763
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:27,616
Device

764
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:29,408
The challenge is

765
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,200
It is only going to

766
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:31,968
Court

767
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:34,016
433

768
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:35,296
Hertz is the RF

769
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:36,320
So

770
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:37,856
If your

771
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:38,880
Ceiling fan

772
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:41,696
Is 433 megahertz

773
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:42,720
You are great

774
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:45,280
But ceiling fans can operate it

775
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:46,560
315 for 30

776
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:47,328
3

777
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:48,096
And several others

778
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:50,656
And the bond actually supports all of them

779
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:51,936
Is why they reckon

780
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:55,264
The two way you can call him today and figure this out

781
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,824
You could actually also look on the SEC sticker on

782
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:59,360
Spice it may tell you there

783
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:00,640
Or you can

784
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:02,432
Take the serial number of your fan

785
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:06,016
And look it up in the FCC database and see what

786
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:09,344
Or you could do what I would do

787
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:11,904
And that is just buy it from Amazon

788
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,696
Try it if it didn't work I would send it

789
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:18,048
The other thing about working with the broadly

790
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,632
In tying it into Amazon or Google

791
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:22,912
Is that it is

792
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:24,704
Works like a remote can

793
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,728
Control for a TV

794
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:28,288
So you're going to have to tell Amazon

795
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,824
That is a television

796
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:31,616
But you can also do

797
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:32,640
When you're setting it

798
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:33,920
Or

799
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:35,712
You can create a scene around it

800
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:36,736
So

801
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:40,576
If you do the scene then you create your own voice command and then it's going to

802
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:43,136
But you will still have to set it up as a

803
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:44,416
A television room

804
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:45,696
Just so you know

805
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:48,512
Yeah and one other possible got you

806
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:53,120
It is only supported on 2.4 gigahertz Wi-Fi

807
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:56,704
I need the Wi-Fi to

808
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,728
Tire near me

809
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:58,752
Smart speakers

810
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:00,032
Just be aware

811
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:03,360
Based on your home network that this is a 2.4 gigahertz

812
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,384
Wi-Fi radio

813
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:06,432
Kind of a lot of gachas there

814
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:07,712
But

815
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,504
Is the bond is $70

816
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:10,784
And this is $40

817
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,088
Is it worth $30 to have to

818
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:14,112
The call into this

819
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,136
If it is

820
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,160
Do it

821
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:18,208
Or it maybe it's not even worth 40.

822
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:19,744
And then you'll be like yeah

823
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,280
We're just going to work with a non smart

824
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:24,352
I'm just going to make sure the remotes Always by the bedside.

825
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,448
I suppose I could always by and try it I just don't know that if I have the exact

826
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:30,752
Same fan configuration that Andreas

827
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:34,592
There is also a Hampton Bay Universal Remote

828
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:35,616
For $50

829
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:36,640
What works with wink

830
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:38,688
But you have to buy a wink

831
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:40,480
Which temperature

832
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:41,248
You back

833
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,272
The price

834
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:43,040
Exactly

835
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:43,808
We're not ready

836
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:45,600
For a couple

837
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:47,904
Already have a wink

838
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,184
If you already have a wink then

839
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,976
Google Hampton Bay Universal

840
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,072
Okay

841
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,632
That is a less than satisfactory

842
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,704
I just said that's not our fault

843
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,472
No

844
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:03,264

Already

850
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:20,672
It feels like the end of the News segment of the show in time for us to

851
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:23,744
Actuary guess so please stay tuned

852
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,072
For Mike nefkens who is the CEO of resideo

Howdy Wells

855
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:31,680
Security and smart

856
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:34,240
We're going to be talking about

857
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:37,568
Why they're making all these Acquisitions and the future of the smartphone

858
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,848
You want to hear it

859
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,896
After a message from our sponsor

860
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:42,944
This week sponsor is

861
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,016
Nutanix

862
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:52,416
Everyone we are taking a quick break from this week's Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor

863
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:54,720
Answer is nutanix and I have

864
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:57,536
Sacem vakani hear from the company

865
00:30:58,048 --> 00:31:01,376
So netonix we all think of that as a leader in hyper-converged

866
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:05,728
Infrastructure and now it's offering products and services in the iot area

867
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:07,520
Can you tell us what drove

868
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:08,800
Accompany misdirection

869
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:15,456
It's been quite a revelation space

870
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:17,760
License to Enterprise Al

871
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:20,832
We are going to be true to our mission

872

Vauto address

874
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,680
Find a lot of time

875
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:38,496
Computing solutions for the wall of humans

876
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:43,872
Ohio State requires us to think about

877
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,712
Can you talk about some of the customer scenarios you've encountered as you go

878
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:53,344
There's a quite a lot of diversity in the type of use cases for instance

879
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:59,744
Customers in retail and solve problems

880
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,328
Things like loyalty number identification in their stores

881
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:04,864
Loss prevention

882
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:11,520
And we want to work with them to create new experiences

883
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:12,800
Fortune 500 Food Service

884
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:21,248
Existing data that is collected using

885
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:24,320
Machine Telemetry data

886
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:34,816
Girl from Human based Meat Inspection process

887
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,424
Individualized inspection process

888
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,984
We see similar Trends in oil and gas

889
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,056
Juicing machines

890
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:48,128
And what is your high level learning so far

891
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:51,712
There's so many but let me share

892
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:52,736
For 1

893
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:55,040
Let It Go

894
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:56,064
Elan new project

895
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:58,112
It is asthma

896
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:59,648
About respecting the prison

897
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:02,720
As it is about building for the future

898
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:04,256
Flat affect

899
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:05,536
We need to respect

900
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:10,144
Although the infrastructure that is already in place and the dealer collection that is already in place

901
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:10,912
Why

902
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:16,544
Create new business processes and experiences

903
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,312
Leveraging

904
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:20,384
Potato

905
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,456
Nicktoons R&D projects about technology

906
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:27,040
And I are taking but they also need to plan around people

907
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:33,952
Different set of skills

908
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:35,232
Last but not the least

909
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:37,536
We need to budget for failure

910
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:39,328
Just like Halloween projects for sex

911
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,656
Iot projects take a long time to fertilize

912
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:44,448
And then to apologize

913
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:52,640
Project point in time project

914
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:56,736

How that's going but first

926
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:36,416

I've been here about two months and so far so good A bit hotter than we

930
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:52,288
Expected but but we're really enjoying that we opened our new headquarters about two or three weeks ago and we are fully up and running

931
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,080
Excellent all right

I should we should tell people who may not be familiar didn't read articles I wrote about this but

934
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,784
Talk to us about

935
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,088
Why Presidio spun out of Honeywell

936
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,112
What

937
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:07,392
Resideo is today

938
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:12,000
Grassy the process started about a year-and-a-half ago where a Honeywell

939
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:13,024
Being a

940
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:19,424
Omega Industrial Corporation has multiple business lines from building

941
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,264
Chemicals Etc and what they realized was they had a few businesses

942
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,288
It will actually be

943
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:25,056
Cunning

944
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:28,640
More consumer eyes than then what they're

945
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:30,432
Teaching Focus was becoming

946
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:34,784
Honeywell focuses on creating topics for airplanes and you know creating

947
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,320
Huge Building Solutions

948
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:38,624
So they were for businesses in Honeywell

949
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:45,024
One was all that distribution business which is low voltage security the other was a comfort business which is really focused

950
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,560
Are thermostats

951
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:52,704
Web security business as well and then a what we call an energy business which is really gassy

952
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:57,312
And they brought those for businesses into one and that is what ridiculous

953
00:35:57,568 --> 00:36:03,712
Honeywell in October and turn on publicly traded companies do about at 5

954
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:05,504
Billion dollars annually right now

955
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,112
And we're bringing all those assets together now to really focus on the Smart Home

956
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:15,232
What makes us unique as we don't sell to consumer-direct we do everything through the pro Channel

957
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:18,560
So once or business has spent over a hundred years building up

958
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:21,632
Coaching with a very very loyal customer base

959
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:22,912
And that's what

960
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:24,704
Will bring those businesses together

961
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:31,104
To bring a really unique experience to the pros and to the homeowners and work on the company resideo Technologies

962
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:34,688
We do still have the Honeywell brand work on the Honeywell Home

963
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:37,504
On certain product over the pros will continue to see that going

964
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:41,600
Oh yes I was going to ask him I, but I still have Honeywell

965
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:48,000
In also I feel like I can buy Honeywell thermostats at Home Depot or someplace like that like the tea

966
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:49,792
It's maybe the T9 there's a lot of

967
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:50,816
Is T5

968
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:51,584
Also

969
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,352
That is correct

970
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:54,912
We do about 3% of our business

971
00:36:55,168 --> 00:37:01,312
Home Depot Lone Star Best Buy really really what it is

972
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:04,384
Those products are not do-it-yourself products and then you can buy them

973
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,408
Do you need a prototype

974
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:12,320
Now we're learning about the consumer through Home Depot we want that touchpoint that late customers of ours but our Focus

975
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:18,464
You and my husband agree on that we need a pro to install thermos

976
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:20,512
I personally am

977
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:21,280
I could do it

978
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:23,584
Why we stopped people don't cut the red wire

979
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:27,936
All right

980
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:30,496
Let's talk about some of the Acquisitions you guys have

981
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:32,544
With me because you done about the

982
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,336
3believe Bowie

983
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:36,384
Was one of the first it was a

984
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,920
Device that you can stick on your

985
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:38,944
Your water main

986
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:39,968
And it

987
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:45,600
Monitor flow if it shut things off it was very cool I saw to see us a couple years ago

988
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:47,648
You'll find the IP from whisker lab

989
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:48,928
Angebot LifeWay

990
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:51,488
We're so kind of a lot happening here so

991
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,512
What is the strategy

992
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:55,840
Yeah so let me back in just talk about

993
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:57,120
What about the home itself

994
00:37:57,376 --> 00:38:03,520
Soaps

995
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:05,824
Right where people are buying the product

996
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,360
Donald called one of the gadget

997
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:12,224
Now that you can put in your home and somewhere on his camera can be a doorbell whatever maybe

998
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:17,344
But what's really happening is there so many more critical systems and networks in the home

999
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:23,744
That's until those are being monitored and you're able to get the data and then really be able to understand how you can

1000
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,280
People that give to those

1001
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,816
We consider the homeless

1002
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:33,216
And I really the best example I have to know what you think about that

1003
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,520
Which mean the most people have some kind of

1004
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:36,544
Security system

1005
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:38,336
And that's the monitor

1006
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:40,896
To the last 30-40 years you can buy

1007
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:45,248
So you're out of the home and Intruder comes in somebody calls the police they come

1008
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:47,808
But the rest of the home water neck

1009
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,344
The air mattress

1010
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,392
Air quality in temperature

1011
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:52,928
The gas Network

1012
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:54,208
Your electrical net

1013
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,536
The homeowner is left all to themselves

1014
00:38:57,792 --> 00:39:02,912
Also have to figure out how to maintain and how to ensure that those things are working properly

1015
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:07,008
What we're looking to do as we are looking to take monitoring

1016
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:07,776
From

1017
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:14,176
Security and start to monitor those other networks in the home your water your are your gas in your left

1018
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:15,968
So we can provide

1019
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:16,736
Call home

1020
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,392
So that's the big the big chain

1021
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:29,792
Solidify know our value proposition to the Pro-Am to the homeowner

1022
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:34,656
We want to make sure that we can tell the homeowner

1023
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:41,056
What's happening in the water Network in your home do you have any leaks what kind of water flow do you have the right

1024
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:44,640
What time is your water safe to drink in all of those things in

1025
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:46,688
The best example that on water is

1026
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:48,992
Know when you leave your home if you have a leak you won't know about

1027
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:51,040
If you're losing hundreds

1028
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:55,648
Thousands of gallons of water because your sprinkler system is leaking you're not going to know about

1029
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,744
Until you find a wet spot outside or until you see a really crazy water bill

1030
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:06,400
We're going to be doing is just like him security if somebody breaks in your house or if you have a window open the moment that there is a pressure

1031
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:12,800
If you were working the water losing pressure leaking between 2 and 4 in the morning we will advise the homeowner just like

1032
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:14,592
Security that you have a problem in your house

1033
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:18,688
And even better will send what we're calling our home hero which is our contractor

1034
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:20,224
Immediately out to help you sleep

1035
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:22,272
Same goes for the air Network

1036
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:24,064
There's so much focus on thermostat

1037
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:28,160
That's really cares about is your temperature 6970 more

1038
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:34,816
I think the industry got that figured out what people care about now is your well-being in the home they want to know the quality is good

1039
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:36,352
A window that shakes

1040
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:42,752
And they wanted to do something about it when there's a problem so the same there were to be providing alerts when your indoor air quality is not

1041
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:44,544
Semi satisfactory Ariel

1042
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,616
And then really looking at the home Behind the Walls

1043
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:51,456
There's so much going on behind Network young electrical Network

1044
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:55,040
The best example I like to give there as you know your hot water heater

1045
00:40:55,296 --> 00:41:00,160
How many people are coming home turn on the hot water for a shower and I had a long day and there's no hot water

1046
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:02,976
Is that hot water heater will tell you

1047
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:09,376
A couple weeks before or Jeter using more electricity and we're going to be able to proactively tell you

1048
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:10,400
There's a change

1049
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:16,288
Turn on the hot water heater and we're going to send out a home here in to take a look at it in Six Pack Unit before it actually break

1050
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:19,616
So that's what we're looking to provide to the homeowners you take a look

1051
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:26,016
Bowie is key for us on the waterline whisker Labs is going to help us with energy management from sure we can save the homeowner

1052
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:28,832
More money on your energy and life where is going to support us

1053
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:30,112
On providing data

1054
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:32,160
India on the gas electrical.

1055
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:36,000
Excellent so it sounds like you have most of this figured out

1056
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:39,072
I'm curious on the HVAC Network in air

1057
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:41,888
Is that something you guys have everything there do you need to buy any bud

1058
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:49,568
I think this will be a a constant you know as new technologies pump or will be adding insult

1059
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:52,128
Acquisitions to help us go faster

1060
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:58,527
You know we we have a majority but we need to have a very good offering you know we're always looking to see if you know where

1061
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:00,831
Where else we can now pop in Subutex

1062
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:01,855
Lily Drive

1063
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:06,975
What I call your savings to the homeowner improve time improving the homeowners well-being

1064
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:08,511
Okay and

1065
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:09,791
With this in mind

1066
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:13,375
And I I like to break this down cuz I feel like we're in the middle of a very big tree

1067
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:14,143
Transition

1068
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:15,679
That's between this

1069
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:19,519
We're monitoring it or we're just reacting to take as they're happening to

1070
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:20,543
What is

1071
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:21,823
I was saying much smarter

1072
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:25,663
And to make this happen it feels like you know we need monitoring

1073
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:28,223
And then we need that layer of intelligence

1074
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:33,855
It sounds like you're arguing that we need a layer of Professional Services to come in and deal with it with

1075
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:34,623
But it's

1076
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:35,391
What's something happy

1077
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:37,439
It's also

1078
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:39,743
What's really interesting is we have all the products

1079
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:44,863
Already on those main lines remain in the house and a lot of our competitors they are dying

1080
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:48,191
That's why they're losing hundreds of dollars on every

1081
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:48,959
Cardwell

1082
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:52,543
Gadget picture onto the house because they want data on the homeowner

1083
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:55,103
We are ready at $151

1084
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:57,663
That's what makes us unique we already have

1085
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:59,199
The contractor Network

1086
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:00,735
It wants to work through us

1087
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:05,343
What you just said is exactly right but I think you use the word Gadget burnout

1088
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:08,159
Right now so somebody's got to bring

1089
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:09,951
This information together

1090
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:16,351
And what we're looking at

1091
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:18,655
And that's how you win a gray

1092
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:21,727
You have been a great through these various applications and frankly

1093
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:25,311
So what we're looking to do with we're looking to put them intelligence play on top of that

1094
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:27,359
Bb1 application

1095
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:29,407
It allows us to drive

1096
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:30,175
All of them

1097
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:32,479
Nation on those networks I just described

1098
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,271
And allows your pro

1099
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:36,319
See the data that you want them to

1100
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:39,391
And get alerts so that they can come out and help you

1101
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:44,511
So we are Vision in this is why we have headquartered in Austin we got a big development team here

1102
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:46,815
Our vision is a we will build

1103
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:48,095
An application

1104
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:54,495
That will be an application people use no other 15 applications or so they use in their daily life

1105
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:57,567
And it will allow you to monitor

1106
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:59,615
And it will allow you to

1107
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:02,687
See the information you need on those critical.

1108
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:04,479
Examples hot water heater

1109
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:07,551
Nobody wants to go deep into a hot water heater

1110
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:13,951
And see what are the corrosive levels what's going on from the exact temperature in the tank and you know how is it

1111
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:19,327
The gas burning in a what's the control unit doing people up here they just want to know

1112
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:20,863
And if not let me know

1113
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:26,751
And that's the kind of information wouldn't be providing and when we let the homeowner know we'll let the pro know as well

1114
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:28,287
Immediate

1115
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:31,359
Okay now this is a big shift

1116
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:32,895
And I think

1117
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:37,759
What happened in the smart home is people have bought gadgets because there is a subset of

1118
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:39,039
Homeowners who are like

1119
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:42,111
Hey meet it's a cool Gadget I want to I want to play a 1/2

1120
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:43,647
And I think that's where we've been

1121
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:46,463
The challenge here is

1122
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:52,863
This is expensive in I don't know if a lot of people are ready to invest in something they can

1123
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:55,167
Can't see so there's like the cedia channel

1124
00:44:55,423 --> 00:45:01,311
Offers you cool AV stuff like that turn on and off and it's very funky and find people

1125
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:02,335
Pay for that

1126
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:06,431
It seems really tough to get people to Shell out for something like

1127
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:08,991
We're going to make sure your hot water heater doesn't light

1128
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:13,599
And I know it's a big deal and I know people hate it when it happens but I am

1129
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:15,135
Really impressed

1130
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:16,671
By people short-sightedness

1131
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:18,975
When I asked them about

1132
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:22,815
Hey would you buy it like a belief system or something like that they're like

1133
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:26,399
Ar500 or $600 I don't know

1134
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:28,447
How do you convince people that they

1135
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:30,239
They want this they need this in their car

1136
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:31,007
Payforit

1137
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:31,775
How do you make

1138
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:33,311
Pricing

1139
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:34,079
Works for that

1140
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:40,479
You got it to look the first thing is we're going to be launching in December when we're going to be launching exactly how these models

1141
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:45,855
So much more to come on that but what I can tell you now is think of it really as

1142
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:52,255
A lot of homeowners 20%

1143
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:58,655
They bite their HVAC Pro they buy medicinal warranty that Pro comes out twice a year

1144
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:02,751
So what we want to do what we want to do that

1145
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:05,311
As a warranty

1146
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:11,711
I think of it that when were everything will be included. They're going to be certain models where you you can either Buy.

1147
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:13,247
Hardware yourself

1148
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:17,087
Or you can actually do it through as you go monthly warranty

1149
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:23,487
So that's our big announcement that will be having at the end of the year and we're looking to make this very simple for the homeowner

1150
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:29,887
No you're paying for two or three warranties and different parts of your house you can come by

1151
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:36,287
One and even even better I'll give an example if you have the water Protection Service that we have you can print off a certificate

1152
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:39,615
Like your insurance company gets really significant discount on your insurance

1153
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:46,015
So we were confident we're going to be able to save the Homeland quite a bit of money by doing this and save them time and hassle you know when the

1154
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:48,575
I have to stop this will be able to put down

1155
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:50,879
Given the direction that you're moving

1156
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:53,695
In this idea of monitoring all the vital systems in the

1157
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:55,743
How important is it that

1158
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:58,047
Everything in the home be made by Honeywell

1159
00:46:58,559 --> 00:46:59,583
I'm sitting in a house that

1160
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:01,887
I'm sitting in a rental house but

1161
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:04,191
Even in my older house I

1162
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:05,215
Mixed and matched

1163
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:06,239
France so

1164
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:07,263
What is the philosophy

1165
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:11,615
Typically been an open company and we are

1166
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:14,431
Looking to add many many partners

1167
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:15,455
To our service

1168
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:18,271
No just like to run ATI Branch we have

1169
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:24,671
The largest distribution of low voltage Security in the world with 200 locations we only sell about

1170
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:28,767
15% of what soul do that is residual products so we want to make sure that

1171
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:31,583
No the homeowner is able to get a whole Home Solution

1172
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:34,399
And the residual product is the best for that great

1173
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:40,031
And if there are others out there they complete the solution we will partner will make sure that that's accessible to what to the homeowner

1174
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:42,079
Okay so that makes a lot of sense

1175
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:46,943
But now let's talk about kind of the role of the pro cuz I'm hearing a lot of

1176
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:48,991
Pro install Pro everything

1177
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:51,039
Does this mean you guys are going to

1178
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:51,807
Back out of

1179
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:52,575
The DIYs

1180
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:58,463
Well we're really not in the DIY space like I said about 3% of our revenues isn't DIY

1181
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:04,863
What you just said is it's so important in the real battle going on right now is Pro versus DIY

1182
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:06,655
And we are doubling down on the pro

1183
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:08,191
Elizabeth

1184
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:10,495
The house is only going to become more complex

1185
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:14,591
And with that you would support if you take a look at your daily life

1186
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:18,687
Rights for your body you have a position for your car you have a mechanic

1187
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:20,735
Office Buildings at building manager

1188
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:26,367
But against the home we leave it was really not trains or doesn't have the time or skills

1189
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:29,439
To manage a lot of these systems in the home that are behind the wall

1190
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:31,999
Sure they can maybe manager Gadget or two on the wall

1191
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:34,559
We're going to focus on elevating

1192
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:36,863
The professionalism of the pro

1193
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:38,655
Making them a home hero

1194
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:41,983
Helping support the homeowner with all this drip system

1195
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:48,383
You're still going to be Gadget so you can buy and we don't want to play with him

1196
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:51,455
So there will be a DIY more Market that will continue

1197
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:57,343
But for these big critical systems around water around gas around electrical around security

1198
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:59,647
PowerPoint of Ulysses are pro products

1199
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:04,767
And by doing so that we can save the homeowner time money and improve their well-being

1200
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:07,583
Let's talk about the impact to your bottom line

1201
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:09,887
So

1202
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:10,655
This is a big

1203
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:12,191
And

1204
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:18,591
Part of I know that you've talked about in previous earnings calls has been the shift to recurring Revenue so things like monitoring

1205
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:20,639
How do you guys in vision

1206
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:23,711
Making that flip for my product to a

1207
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:25,503
Services kind of company and

1208
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:26,783
What's that going to look

1209
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:33,951
Now we're starting that now the first piece is going to be bringing the multiple applications we have together until

1210
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:35,487
So that's the first step

1211
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:41,887
So when we do that we're going to be able to offer the pro and homeowner we're going to be a thought for them straight up

1212
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:48,287
Sell a product that's what they choose for will be able to offer them a subscription service so that they can really get the service

1213
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:52,127
Just pay as they go and will we will keep their Tech up-to-date in their home

1214
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:59,295
You know I'm 3 years. They have a thermostat to Russian 3 years will replace it to the next newest one if they so choose so

1215
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:03,647
We're starting at flip now we already have a chunk of our business

1216
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:05,439
Recurring Revenue

1217
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:07,231
And yes we're looking to grow that

1218
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:13,375
So I told the market that know that recurring Revenue

1219
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:14,655
What we have now

1220
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:17,215
And I work all that we can make it to that knowledge

1221
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:23,615
No stress the recurring Services if the quality is right and we can do this right margins movie Higher

1222
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:29,503
And we also think their value will be better for us for the program for the homeowner so it's a win-win for everybody

1223
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:30,783
Excellent

1224
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:33,343
But how do you adjust your business

1225
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:36,415
The deal with the fact that you're no longer selling a product

1226
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:38,463
But you're really selling this relationship

1227
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:41,535
Yeah that's really

1228
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:42,559
That's exactly

1229
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:44,351
What we want is we want

1230
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:45,887
Proactive

1231
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:47,679
Continuous relationship with

1232
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:48,447
Customer

1233
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:51,519
We want resideo to be the home hero

1234
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:57,919
And our vision in the future is that know when homes are built they will be certified homes that have all

1235
00:50:58,175 --> 00:51:04,319
All this equipment so that way you can just turn on the service and

1236
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:05,087
Monitored

1237
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:07,391
In your home is safe efficient and healthy

1238
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:09,439
That's what I'm looking for last longer

1239
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:11,231
Excellent all right

1240
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:14,047
Let's move from the future of resideo

1241
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:15,839
You just brought questions about

1242
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:17,119
Building devices

1243
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:18,911
I have to ask

1244
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:23,519
Tariffs are big topic now I'm seeing some companies push out higher pricing be

1245
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:24,287
Because of them

1246
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:26,079
How is that affecting you guys

1247
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:30,175
At this point there is no Sac a majority of our products

1248
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:31,199
Armada next

1249
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:37,599
On the borders when the trade free zone so you know we went through a bit of a scare when the US and Mexico

1250
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:39,135
We're talking about tariffs

1251
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:45,279
But it looks like we made it through that we also do a lot of manufacturing when you asked a lot of Eastern Europe as well the Wii manufacturer

1252
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:49,375
Close to where are markets are in markets are which is the position we like

1253
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:53,471
And look we're just going to have to kind of roll with what's happening politically and economically

1254
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:59,871
I just like everybody else but I like her hand versus having everything done in China if something changes

1255
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:04,735
Have to have to mitigate that but we like the hand we have with our men's fashion right now

1256
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:08,319
