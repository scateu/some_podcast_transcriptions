Perceived

15
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:42,240

Aibo

42
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,432
Robot.

43
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,736
And if you were not around in

44
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:59,296
Thoughts so 2005

45
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:00,832
Mm

46
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,368
Sony introduced

47
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:05,440
Cute little robot dog called aibo

48
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:07,744
It was crazy expensive I did not own one

49
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,536
And then in 2006

50
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:10,560
They

51
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,680
They put it out yes they pulled the plug on

52
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:17,728
Add people were sad because

53
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:18,496
Cuz there were lots of

54
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,544
Who loves their eyebrows and back

55
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:23,360
They were actually people who held funerals for the

56
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:25,920
Big things

57
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:27,456
So I was really excited

58
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:28,480
But then I

59
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:34,112
So is planning to be less excited with the new aibo

60
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:34,880
Wow

61
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,416
I think it's cool that they brought it back

62
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:40,768
I mean I'm not saying everybody needs a robotic dog and Stacy you have a dog I have a dog

63
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,072
Sometimes you can hear them on the show in the background

64
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:45,120
Put some people don't want to deal with

65
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,912
An actual dog and I get that

66
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:49,984
But you want to companion so that's what I though is before I get to the

67
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:52,800
It's actually an interesting product itself I mean

68
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:57,664
This is everybody dog that can move around 22 axis it's got OLED panels

69
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,480
Expertise issues expressions

70
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:05,088
Sony makes a lot of computer vision products so all those Imaging sensors and

71
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:06,368
Products like the iPhone

72
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,392
Sony makes

73
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:14,816
It's really cool to see Sony saying hey you know what computer vision is now a real thing happening in the world

74
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:17,632
And we got technology for this let's put it in this

75
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:19,424
Aptoide and see what happens

76
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:20,704
So it has

77
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,264
Yeah I mean it is impressive from a

78
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,544
Technical standpoint

79
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,312
Right

80
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:27,360
Is it though cuz here's where we get to

81
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,896
It reminds me of

82
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:34,272
Cosmo which is $150 connected toy for kids that is just a door

83
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,808
And it has

84
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,600
Image recognition

85
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:38,368
It rolls around

86
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:40,928
Small Earth

87
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:41,952
Send the dog and it doesn't

88
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:42,976
Move is

89
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,000
It doesn't have the

90
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,536
22 access web movie

91
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,864
It cost 150 and I

92
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:51,680
Yeah

93
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,216
This is not a toy

94
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,104
But even if it was what's a $700 a thousand dollars less

95
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,408
I still would not be interested this is why

96
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,248
On top of the purchase price there is a monthly subscription

97
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:08,576
That is going to cost you $26 a month

98
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,624
You have to have that for like 3 years

99
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:14,208
And that's giving the dog Wi-Fi and LTE connectivity

100
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:15,744
Cloud backup cuz you know

101
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,512
Because you want to

102
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:18,559
Remember where he got his bone you could

103
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:22,911
There's an app that goes along with it I mean

104
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:25,727
A subscription for a dog I don't know

105
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:28,799
Should I buy food for my dog

106
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:30,591
Yes yes

107
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:33,663
Guess what your dog doesn't have life he can't be used as wifi hotspot

108
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:37,503
I don't know I mean this is just that it's just a stretch

109
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,039
To me a lot of money

110
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,319
It is a lot of my

111
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:42,623
And I will purchase

112
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:47,487
The original was too early for its

113
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:51,071
And I think this is now the right time for something like this

114
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,095
And

115
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:57,215
I actually think there will be an audience for it even with the $26 a month subscription fee

116
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:57,983
Although

117
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:00,031
Kind of like does my robotic

118
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,055
Nini Deli

119
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,639
I mean I feel like we're going to start seeing people ask

120
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:06,687
These questions because right now

121
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:09,247
Cellular costs are still very high

122
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,015
Compared to you

123
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,551
Wi-Fi which is basic

124
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,087
And so

125
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:13,855
I think

126
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:16,927
Maybe they could have chop that subscription fee

127
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,463
And the bill of materials to make

128
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,231
A dog

129
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,023
A bit

130
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,303
Okay I was just making Wi-Fi

131
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,839
If you wanted to

132
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:24,607
Take your dog to

133
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:30,495
You have Wi-Fi at the Starbucks but getting to and from the Starbucks you have to

134
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:37,407
Healthy I guess but it's kind of interesting I agree that yes there is an audience for this I remember reading about older folks

135
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:40,223
Lived alone fat companion

136
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,831
And I'm not going to judge on that that if that helps those people then so be it I think that's great

137
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:45,855
But this is not

138
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:46,879
Mass Market

139
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:48,415
Product in my opinion now

140
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,439
You know nothing

141
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:52,767
Well let's talk about San Diego

142
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:56,351
Because I've been there twice this year and I love it it's a lovely place

143
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,911
And it is getting smarter

144
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,191
This is not

145
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:03,263
Exactly new we talked about San Diego in the past

146
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,799
Because it's had a pilot Smart City

147
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:07,615
Graham now that pilot is moving into production

148
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:13,759
And they're working with cheese current to manage the LED Street lamps in the city

149
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,551
They also are

150
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:18,879
They put in 3200 sensors and they're going to stick

151
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:20,671
3000 more sensors

152
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:21,951
In the city which is

153
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,487
Quite a lot of sensors

154
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:28,351
Yeah I mean this is a whole city wide after this is not just like sections of the city there

155
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:30,655
Spending 30 million dollars to deploy this

156
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:31,423
And

157
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:37,567
I think it's good I am a little worried because they are working with ge's current they're throwing everything into products

158
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:38,847
Cheese products

159
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:42,687
So I'm kind of like what happens to that data I do feel like

160
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:49,087
A lot of Articles focusing on the Smart City don't think about who has access to that data how it's managed in

161
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,159
Even inside a city one of the challenges that

162
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:55,999
Cities have to deal with in it's worth it for the citizens to know is

163
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,023
How

164
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,815
The data from different sensors

165
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,607
Is shared across

166
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:01,631
So

167
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:05,471
Do police have access to you no surveillance cameras or do they have there

168
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:09,567
And those kind of things become really important

169
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,335
When you think about

170
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,359
Qatar privacy app

171
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,639
Locations and

172
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:13,407
Economic

173
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,175
Considerations

174
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:16,991
Right right some of the services that AR

175
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:22,367
Rolling out actually touch upon that in fact is they're looking at installing shotspotter which is affecting

176
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:25,695
Location of gunshots in real time and at first I thought I was a good idea about

177
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:30,047
Before the show station I was talking about and she didn't mention to me that the last cities that use shotspotter

178
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:36,447
Are actually getting rid of it and I did not realize that never definitely privacy implications there of sensors that are

179
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,727
Listening for gunshots that

180
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:41,055
Can also record conversations and so on so forth so that's

181
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:43,359
Definitely something that needs to be considered

182
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,639
Yes and

183
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:48,479
It's probably not a lot of cities taking it out but several cities are taking it out the

184
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:51,295
Because they felt like they didn't San Antonio is one

185
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:57,951
They're talking about it Oakland is another concern to that you know it's a little redundant people will report gunshots

186
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,231
Pretty much

187
00:07:59,487 --> 00:07:59,999
When they hear the

188
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:03,839
Sometimes there's false positives and that was a problem

189
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,631
932 privacy concern

190
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:08,959
Shotspotter microphones keep recording

191
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:09,727
After

192
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:10,751
Detect shots

193
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,799
So please have use that in

194
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,591
In court to try to invite

195
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:16,127
People for crimes now

196
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,663
If those people committed the crime

197
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:21,503
Probably okay but if not they just have to be at the wrong place at the wrong time

198
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,039
Recipe you know

199
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:25,343
So there are definitely some

200
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:26,367
Liberties

201
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,647
Things to think about here

202
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:29,439
I hope the cities are

203
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,463
And speaking

204
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,487
Of a lack of privacy

205
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,279
Let's talk about Apple

206
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,047
Because it is

207
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:40,191
Cell focus on user privacy and I think that's probably going to be a problem for it going forward into the smartphone

208
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,215
Basically

209
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:43,007
There's bad news for homepod

210
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,543
Lovers and lovers

211
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,823
I guess you can't love it yet it doesn't

212
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:50,175
It's not out by the homepod speaker when it comes out

213
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,455
There's

214
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:57,599
Kevin yeah I mean it's for the homepod comes out next month for $349 and

215
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:03,999
Apple hasn't really said much about it so we're all kind of guessing what will it be able to do with behave like

216
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:06,559
OK Google Home Products on Amazon Echo products

217
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:07,583
Not out of the box

218
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:13,471
Is what I can tell you right now and that's because the SDK for it Apple has just provided to Developers

219
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:16,031
Say hey here you can start making apps for the homepod

220
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,055
But

221
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:19,871
Only in a few categories such as messaging list

222
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:20,639
Endnote

223
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,663
2

224
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,455
You'll be able to use

225
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:29,855
Homepod to control Apple music by voice but I don't see any third-party Music Services coming anytime soon

226
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:30,623
Because

227
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:35,743
There's no way to do that Apple hasn't provided a way to do that so it seems like it's going to be a very limited

228
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,535
Experience and the shame of it is

229
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,815
And my opinion

230
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:41,887
Siri is already a limited experience because

231
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:48,287
It's not as smart at getting information in my opinion is some of the other assistants out there and of course it is within Apple's wall

232
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:50,335
Olive Garden which there's pros and cons to that I

233
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,615
No issue there but

234
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:54,687
It's just an observation you know he's going to work with homekit

235
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,967
But what else

236
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:56,991
You know I ain't just

237
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:59,039
I think this is going to be a very

238
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:01,087
Limited product when it first comes out

239
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:03,647
Well in that was very much like homekit

240
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,695
And homekit is much better now

241
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:07,487
But even today

242
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,023
Developers are still Lake

243
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,095
Where's my homekit support

244
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:17,983
They've been promising homekit products and haven't actually released them because of challenges working within the

245
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,263
Ecosystem

246
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:20,287
And so

247
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:24,639
I was really excited about homepod and I thought this would actually help push

248
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:26,175
Homekit to the mainstream

249
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:29,247
This does not make me feel like

250
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,271
That's going to happen

251
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:34,367
And it's frustrating as a reviewer someone who talks about the

252
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:40,767
The stuff because so many consumers are looking forward to homekit I get so many questions about things were

253
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:42,815
Working with homekit and people have been waiting for

254
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:44,607
Literally years and

255
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,887
Feels like

256
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,679
Apple has promised them

257
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,727
Something that works in

258
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:50,751
So far

259
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:51,775
It's pretty minimal

260
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,567
Everyone else feels Miles Ahead

261
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,359
Will it does work

262
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,383
It's just Luke

263
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,943
You don't have to breath of options

264
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,479
That you had with other platforms

265
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,759
PreSonus support standpoint

266
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,295
And you had said that a lot of these

267
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,319
Product makers

268
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:09,951
That deal with challenges not only challenges but changes because Apple went from a hardware base than occasionally

269
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:15,583
Security bit to software-based in I mean that stuff to these companies can't change in a diamond

270
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,351
Producing Hardware

271
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:18,143
So that has caused delays

272
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,191
Thanks and maybe some people just like you know what

273
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:25,055
Like you said others feel Miles Ahead such as Google's and Amazon's ecosystem

274
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:28,639
Maybe people just throwing their hands up and saying we'll get down get when we get to it

275
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:32,991
Yeah and I would say from a developer side that makes a lot of sense from

276
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,015
Consumers

277
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:37,855
I don't want to say look Amazon's really good it's easy to work with

278
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:42,975
Do that or Google if you're already on a bunch of Google services Google home has

279
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:44,255
Over 6

280
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:47,327
Christie Partners right now in the smart home section it is definitely a

281
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,167
Do you want to keep waiting

282
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:57,311
Good waiting and I'm in Apple's ecosystem

283
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:59,359
I would say it's not

284
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,895
So I'm sad

285
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:03,711
Well I think a lot of people will purchase this

286
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:05,759
Even with these potential

287
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:08,575
Limitations just because of the bus sound

288
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,879
Quality is my gas and they will feel it

289
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:11,903
349

290
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:15,743
And Apple's technology they are getting a better sound system than what's available

291
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:18,047
That's just what people may think and that's fine

292
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,327
And it will work with her

293
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:20,863
It has Siri support

294
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:27,263
For built-in but if you want to control Spotify for example by voice that's not happening you have to do it through if it's

295
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,359
Play Spotify through AirPlay 2 and control by voice on your phone not through the

296
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:33,663
Speaker itself so it just seems

297
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,687
Talk Dirty to Me

298
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,479
Awkward

299
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:37,503
Yeah

300
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:41,599
Okay here's some fun news bits before we get to

301
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:44,671
Arvig review of the Echo Plus and Amazon smart home

302
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,463
Which is

303
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,743
Coyote

304
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:50,047
Form as a service

305
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,839
For companies that are

306
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,119
Usually selling products

307
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,423
Consumer so think big name brands

308
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:57,215
Are selling connected products to Consumers

309
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:58,751
Girl who stood on

310
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:04,127
Ala and they just raised $60 in a series D round

311
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:04,895
Stay

312
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:07,199
The capital but they're doing it

313
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:09,503
Because they are going

314
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:12,575
And they are creating a joint venture in China with sunset

315
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,343
Communication

316
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,623
Telco

317
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,647
Telecommunications

318
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:16,927
In China

319
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:21,535
And I think this is gray tail has been around since before the iot was

320
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:22,815
Even a thing

321
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:24,095
Really they've been around

322
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,375
2010

323
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,143
Which

324
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,447
Holy mackerel that's a really long time ago

325
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,263
What house what else was happening

326
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:34,591
Can I have 2 years that's a long time

327
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:37,663
What's before Nest which was when everyone was like oh my God

328
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:41,759
And I've got a crack update for everyone

329
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:44,575
We talked about this two weeks ago crap is a

330
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:50,719
Vulnerability in the Wi-Fi protocol itself with client devices and your router's so all of your

331
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,743
Phones

332
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,791
Smart ovens smart whatever's

333
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,327
Are all affected

334
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:58,655
Wi-Fi and most companies have done a really good job

335
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,191
Either they are not

336
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,471
Vulnerable to the attack

337
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:03,007
That's because of the way they structured

338
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,543
Their products

339
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:08,383
Which is Yay good June nest and feel like wink

340
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:11,967
Is in that category and then others have been updating

341
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:12,991
Like mad

342
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:18,879
Crazy Mad personally my Nvidia Shield got an update for that address this as well as added other features

343
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:22,719
I bought an essential phone last week and got an update through them

344
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:25,279
From Google with that address McCracken chorizo

345
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:27,583
I was surprised how quickly on some of my devices

346
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,863
That actually showed up

347
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,911
Yes

348
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,983
What didn't get update

349
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,287
Is actually pretty stunning to me so

350
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:40,383
Two big names in the iot space and in their outer space

351
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,919
I reached out to Belkin

352
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:45,759
The day of and they were like yeah we're working on it

353
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:46,527
What's out there

354
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,575
So now two weeks later I felt like

355
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:49,599
Okay let's just check in

356
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:55,999
They still haven't released a patch for their devices and then the other is tp-link which is another big router maker but

357
00:14:56,255 --> 00:15:00,095
Also makes the casa and other connected devices

358
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,375
They have light bulbs

359
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,423
Kasa smart home app

360
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:06,495
And they have not done an update either although they do

361
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,519
Did say hey yes

362
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,287
Yes we're aware of it

363
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,055
So

364
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:09,823
I don't know what to say

365
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,871
I look at this and this is why

366
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,151
Hive historically been

367
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,687
I don't know about 2 p.m.

368
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,455
Alex products

369
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:16,991
Worries me

370
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:20,575
I am also a little worried about the security on wemos products just because of the

371
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,599
The way that's built

372
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:25,439
It's a known fact that you can walk into someone's house if you're running

373
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,207
A WeMo

374
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:28,511
App if you walk onto their Wi-Fi network

375
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:32,095
You can actually control their WeMo devices if you have access to their

376
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:40,543
Tp-link sort of surprises because Google partnered with them for the original Google onhub router they were two models of that

377
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,823
Tp-link made one of them

378
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,663
I'm sorry it's not that they're not

379
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,431
They just haven't

380
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:48,991
We have

381
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:49,759
People working

382
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:51,551
And

383
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:54,367
Mozilla

384
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,647
Because they're still around

385
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:56,671
Music

386
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,975
Ouch

387
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:01,023
I love Mozilla because

388
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:01,791
What they're doing

389
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,327
Work on the open

390
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,375
Privacy rights I shouldn't

391
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:11,263
I heard they're not as prominent as they once were for various reasons I agree I agree

392
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,823
I need credit is iot effort that felt like

393
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,871
If you just like

394
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:16,895
So

395
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,943
But they did survey

396
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,223
190000

397
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:20,991
The people

398
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:21,759
And

399
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,551
Discovered how people felt about

400
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:26,111
Privacy and smart devices and Kevin

401
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,903
What jumped out at you for

402
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:34,303
This will have you obviously a lot of people are concerned about privacy and this is global by the way this is not just

403
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,839
190000 people in one

404
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:42,239
Region of the world is global privacy and that kind of filled to some degree that ship has

405
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,263
Assailed

406
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,103
But I totally understand that people still really don't understand

407
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,639
Peyote and all the difference

408
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:50,431
Things that make it work

409
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:54,783
They said fewer than 30% of respondents said they can't explain IRT or botnets

410
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:55,551
Blockchain

411
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:57,343
RFID for example

412
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:00,927
And fewer than 40% could explain what a DDOS attack was so

413
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,719
Yeah people still have a lot of

414
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:05,279
Learning to do and I blame kind of the industry and

415
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:08,351
The people like us to degree who explain it I mean we need to

416
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:13,471
Get the message out more to get people to understand what they're buying into if they're going to look towards this future or so

417
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,007
I agreed

418
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:19,615
The thing is it actually sucked me what is Brazil

419
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,151
So resilient

420
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:27,551
They have both in Brazil in India they have the highest rate of connected Appliance ownership at 15%

421
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:29,087
7% for the rest of the

422
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:34,975
And Brazilian respondents were the most excited about how quote-unquote easy as Martin

423
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,791
4% selected

424
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:39,071
The top benefit

425
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,351
The world being more

426
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:42,399
So the Brazilians are like

427
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,167
Super Pump

428
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,471
People in the US France the UK

429
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,263
Canada there were less

430
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,567
I don't know I just like

431
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,335
Go Brasil

432
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:56,991
Yeah I wonder and I don't have like Molly I should you have a survey data out there so I'll go check it out shorts I wonder how the

433
00:17:57,247 --> 00:18:00,063
People in Brazil feel about the privacy and security as a result

434
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:00,831
Are they

435
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:04,927
Kind of like saying I don't care just get me connected baby I want to live this life

436
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:08,767
That would be very interesting to see so I'm going to go back into the rug surveyed and check that out

437
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:09,791
Yeah cuz

438
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,607
I want to go to Brazil now

439
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,423
Adidas fun

440
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,983
Just because why not

441
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:22,335
Sure is something I enabled and I thought was really cool you guys

442
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,871
May already know about it be

443
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:24,639
Because it was report

444
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,919
Earlier this month but

445
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:28,735
The Google home if you're part of the preview

446
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,527
And you can go and become part of the

447
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:32,319
The pretty version of the software

448
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,855
You get something called

449
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:34,879
Google home

450
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:35,647
Night mode

451
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,439
And if you know what this is

452
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:38,975
You are ahead of me

453
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:42,047
How is awesome

454
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,351
Basically what it does is

455
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:45,375
When it's night

456
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,399
Nighttime

457
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:50,495
You can set particular hours for the Google home to lower volume

458
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:51,263
Intimately

459
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:53,567
Which

460
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:54,847
Yes because

461
00:18:55,103 --> 00:19:01,247
Like my daughter runs around in this is less a Google home thing but she does turn up the volume

462
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,039
11

463
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,319
Turn music loud

464
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:06,111
So you know sometimes

465
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,391
Play tonight

466
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:08,671
Turn off the light

467
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:10,207
And holy cow

468
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:16,607
Okay I have a similar situation the girls go to bed a lot earlier than I do so I'll send

469
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:22,239
In my office I watch TV and we talk to the Google home either to turn the TV off shut the lights dim the lights whatever

470
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:26,335
And it is so loud because I was listening music loud during the day time so the LED is really

471
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:32,735
I'm the only one in the room but boy oh boy every time I go to bed pretty much wake everybody up the Google home so I'm going to get in that bed approach

472
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:33,759
Why didn't

473
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:34,783
But I want this

474
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,063
I don't know why you didn't either

475
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:39,903
Anime

476
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:40,671
Go get that

477
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:41,695
Prettiest

478
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:42,463
Okay

479
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,487
Speaking of matinee

480
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:44,255
That was like

481
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,559
Gluteus

482
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,095
I got the

483
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:50,911
I got it yesterday

484
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:51,679
And started play

485
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,215
It's there two parts to the

486
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:56,031
This one is the Echo Plus is Hardware itself

487
00:19:56,287 --> 00:20:01,407
And then to the stuff that Amazon has now recently done to make it smart home interface

488
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,199
Is it better or just different

489
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:04,991
We're going to go with

490
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:08,575
Different right now but go ahead

491
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:09,599
So.

492
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:11,391
Hardware for the Echo Plus

493
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:12,159
Is

494
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:12,927
Excellent

495
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,719
Substantial piece

496
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:15,743
Equipment

497
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:20,095
Sounds good it sounds a little bit better than the echo it's probably not as good as the Sonos one

498
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,399
And it

499
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:24,191
Has a zigbee radio in

500
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:26,239
So initially I set it up

501
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:30,079
In my own home but since I have a hub for most of my zigbee bulbs

502
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:30,847
Because they're

503
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:32,639
Philips Hue I was like

504
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:34,687
I don't know what is happening

505
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:36,479
I took it off

506
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,271
I reset it up on my guest Network

507
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:41,087
With the pulpit actually came with it which was a

508
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:42,111
Philips Hue bulb

509
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,135
Is a white bulb

510
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:45,183
And I set that up and let me tell you

511
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,207
Super easy

512
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:48,767
So the Echo Plus is not something you need

513
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:50,559
Unless you don't have any

514
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,839
Other hubs that

515
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:52,863
Zigbee in

516
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,399
So and

517
00:20:54,655 --> 00:21:00,799
If I could just add I think that is why they did not include a Z-Wave radio because this is targeted for people who do not already have Smart Home

518
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:01,567
UPS

519
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:03,615
That's my takeaway

520
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:06,687
You probably don't need this most of people listen to the show

521
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:09,503
Fridge is fine

522
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:12,319
If you want to give you know your parents

523
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,087
Or someone

524
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:13,855
A lovely gift

525
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:14,623
Smart Home

526
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:15,903
This actually might be a good price

527
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,952
So I tested it with a Philips Hue bulb

528
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,512
I also had an osram bulb and it worked

529
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:21,536
And

530
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:24,096
I don't know what else to tell you about this other than

531
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,632
Yeah don't by your heart

532
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:28,960
Yeah I reckon so somebody that way just get the list

533
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:33,312
Expensive that goes if that's what you want to do because you also said they changed the software

534
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:35,360
And I have seen some of this

535
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:37,408
Last week in factories are newsletter

536
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:39,456
Bird was a support page

537
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:44,064
That showed how you could add Echo devices to your smart home groups

538
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:50,720
And by doing so instead of having to say the name of the lights in the room with the echo you can then just say

539
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,768
Lights on or lights off and based on

540
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:53,792
Proximity

541
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:55,840
But the group setting essentially

542
00:21:56,096 --> 00:22:01,472
The actor would know which like you're talkin about without naming them and it would take that action which is a beautiful thing

543
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:07,872
I should point out it only works with Echo devices so if you have a smart home speaker that has the voice

544
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:08,640
Services

545
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:09,920
Then it will not work

546
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:11,456
And it only works with

547
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:17,344
Bulbs as we found out where the WeMo switch in my group and Stacy I think you two have a Wiimote and something else

548
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:20,672
I have a WeMo Insight switch I have a Lutron fan

549
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:22,208
And I have a

550
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,256
A WeMo Insight and WeMo dimmer

551
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:27,072
Right so those wemos make gumballs

552
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:27,840
Smart

553
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:33,728
And this setting will not work with those with only work with smart bulbs

554
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,312
But it is a little sad

555
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:39,104
Because I have a hodgepodge of

556
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,896
Different reasons

557
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:46,272
Places like so I have my WeMo Insight switch to test like how much things

558
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:47,808
How much electricity

559
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,136
But it's also nice because I can set sunrise sunset

560
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:52,672
As my schedules on the

561
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:54,464
Insight switch and I like

562
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:55,744
As a automatic

563
00:22:56,512 --> 00:23:00,864
So I don't think I can do Sunrise scheduling yet for the Amazon extra

564
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,632
You can't do schedule

565
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:02,400
Because it's not

566
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,168
Not really a homo

567
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:03,936
Automation platform

568
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:08,032
So we're probably seeing is Amazon moving into a home automation

569
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:12,128
Platform slowly and surely and I will see you interface

570
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:13,408
On the app so if I go in

571
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:15,456
Any devices I see all of my

572
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,736
50 Cent my devices

573
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:22,368
Arrow in two columns it looks very much like a SmartThings does with its devices even

574
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,904
Actually wink doesn't

575
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,720
Into

576
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,280
But SmartThings has

577
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:30,560
And I actually like

578
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:32,096
So but

579
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:42,592
Hard to say I mean for people who again our first time buyers of a hub and they buy this they won't have

580
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:44,128
Have anything to compare it to

581
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,152
So

582
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:49,248
You and I miss you it's a little more complicated than it used to be but they'll never know

583
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:52,576
Yes

584
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:59,744
You can also add scene so remember how we were talking about with the software developers were going to do with

585
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,072
In a Philips Hue if you don't have the Hub do you need the app with is

586
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:08,192
The answer is you do need the skill so you will need to log in on the app

587
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:09,216
If you want to

588
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:10,240
Control

589
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:11,008
Lots of stuff

590
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:13,312
I should have said that earlier and

591
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:15,872
I couldn't get any of the scenes that it pulled in for

592
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:16,640
From Phillips to work

593
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:17,664
So

594
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:20,224
I'm still trying to figure out what I did wrong there

595
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:20,992
Since I

596
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:24,576
I've had it for like 12 hours and some of those hours were Halloween and sleeping

597
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:27,648
I don't have the new help but my wink shortcuts

598
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:30,464
Showing up in scenes and are still working

599
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,488
Cuts of always showed up

600
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,072
Shortcuts have always

601
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:37,888
As they were in the device

602
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:38,656
Craigslist so now they

603
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:40,960
I now have a

604
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:41,728
A lot more

605
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:42,752
So I have things

606
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,288
Arctic Aurora

607
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,312
You know what that is

608
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:46,336
Color Loop

609
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:47,360
I have also

610
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,640
They don't really have them

611
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:50,176
Cuz they don't

612
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:55,552
Yeah I wonder if they would with the Hue bridge in use

613
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:57,088
Could it sounds like that's where they coming from

614
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:57,856
No

615
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:59,392
This was me testing it

616
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:00,672
Unknot the

617
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:01,440
Plus

618
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:03,744
This was me testing it on the other echos

619
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,768
Not the Plus

620
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:05,792
Got you

621
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:06,816
Oh it's okay

622
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,608
I'm going to buy a shed

623
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:12,960
In the shed

624
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:17,824
Look for it because soon I'm going to be rationalizing Miami

625
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,872
Echoes because I have way too many

626
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:20,640
Maybe we'll

627
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:23,456
Give away the Plus for someone who needs a smart

628
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:27,552
Happy holidays to our users

A very smart one

651
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,000
Might I add

00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:09,280

This is Brian Denver Amazon

655
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:15,168
Amazon delivery service

656
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,216
I believe it Amazon Cloud cam

657
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:18,240
Actually there

658
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,776
Check Amazon fraud

659
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:27,712
Talk to him is actually required feature of Amazon in terms of service state that must be facing the door you

660
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:28,480
Use for delivery

661
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:29,760

August

665
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:41,024
Say snitcher someone can't blame the Amazon delivery person

666
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,304
For pre-existing

667
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:45,120
Which probably explains why Amazon is getting

668
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:45,888
Sojourner

669
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:46,912

672
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:53,312
Anyway that's my two bits

673
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:55,872
Already

674
00:26:56,384 --> 00:27:02,528
That is a super astute observation Brian obviously the Amazon Cloud Cam and the key tool

Helps consumers because you know if you're ordering from Amazon Prime and

678
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,952
It's getting delivered in your house where you want it

679
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:12,256
Delivery people are not running a muck in your house

680
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:14,816
You know watching TV while you're gone and whatnot

681
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:15,840
But yes

682
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:17,120
Shame on me for not looking at like

683
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:23,520
The terms of service and all that kind of requires that cloud cam because this does protect Amazon as well you know you not to be able to say some

684
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:24,544
It was not delivered

685
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:26,592
LSA the delivery person

686
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:28,128
Threw it on the front porch

687
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:29,152
Now it's damaged

688
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:31,200
Send me another one ready that soup

689
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:32,992
It really doesn't make sense

690
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:37,856
Photos the consumer and for Amazon to require that cloud cam for the key delivery service

691
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:38,880
Agreed

692
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:40,672
Let me have such smart

693
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:41,696

702
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:57,568
And now

703
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,616
We're going to take a momentary break

704
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:00,384

How to build a connected business

713
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:22,656
And what that's going to mean for any other consumer products companies out there

714
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:29,056

00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:12,832
Aldi's

736
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:15,648
Okay so I could see some real world things which

737
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:16,416
She's really excited

738
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:17,696
What are you most excited about

739
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:24,352
Trust me I'm working on two really interesting area one of them is connected vehicles and in that space

740
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:26,144
We're really seeing the

741
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,168
Continue

742
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:29,984
Conductivity of all the cars in the Telco

743
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:36,640
Where they are offering what we called the OBD Uncle so making any existing cars

744
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:41,760
On the road today connected with an OBD dongcopter going to have a great

745
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:42,784
Company called

746
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:47,392
Emoji of presenting how's that working with SCP and really offering to days

747
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:53,280
Which is the T-Mobile offering which is powered by sap connected vehicle

748
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,864
So that's going to be a really exciting question another

749
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:57,632
Area

750
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:59,168
Is if course blockchain

751
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:01,472
What team is another amazing

752
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:05,824
A new technology that is evolving quite quickly everybody knows them in the contacts

753
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:09,920
But in the end of ties it's going to be used in other ways

754
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:11,712
Specifically in the condo

755
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:12,992
Pics of track and Trace

756
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:16,320
And accountability and ensuring that drugs

757
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:18,624
Which are being distributed are affected

758
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:20,416
We've been working with

759
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:21,184
Mark

760
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,232
Island example and Amerisource

761
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,768
And we're showcasing

762
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:25,536
Windows

763
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:31,936
Technologies Innovations really with sap technology being used in the today out there in the sea

764
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:32,960
Children being piloted

765
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:34,496
There's going to be a lot of Entry

766
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:35,520

That sounds great so there are a lot of shows right now focused on iot

770
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:43,712

Leonardo like it

772

Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast

788
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:29,280
This is your house Stacey Higginbotham

789
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:33,376
And today's guest is Joanna stahovich was the CEO of the Chamberlain

ITT thank you for inviting me I am really excited because

792
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,544
You guys have been doing

793
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,848
It product or products rather for a while

794
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:43,616
And I'm

795
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:45,664
Eager to learn what you guys have

796
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:48,992
Is it also talked to you about a recent decision that is

797
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,272
Controversial

798
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:51,296
Among some of the

799
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:56,672
Let's just kick it up with controversy

800
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:58,720
You guys in the MyQ garage door

801
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:02,048
Which I own an actual

802
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:03,072
That awesome

803
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:05,376
You guys recently decided to start charging

804
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:06,912
Your users

805
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:07,680
Reviews of

806
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:11,008
I'm curious why

807
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,288
Fac

808
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:18,688
We have had them IQ application which works with are Chamberlain and LiftMaster garage door openers for more than

809
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:19,456
5 years

810
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:20,224
Andaz

811
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,528
As a durable goods manufacturer

812
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,064
We initially looked at it

813
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,624
How does this increase our bill of

814
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:29,184
What's the cost of the Wi-Fi chip

815
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,208
And the related

816
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:32,256
Components and what sort of a price increase

817
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:33,280
Do we need to put on her

818
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:36,352
In order to recover our car

819
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:37,888
Over the last five years

820
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:39,168
We have realized

821
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:40,192
That

822
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:41,472
Are MyQ app

823
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:43,008
Among its user base

824
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:43,776
Is it

825
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:44,800
Extremely walrus

826
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:46,080
If you take a look

827
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:46,848
Look at the rating

828
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,640
Other some of the highest out there

829
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,200
It comes with a huge response

830
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:51,968
Stability

831
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:55,040
People expect 99.9% uptime

832
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:58,112
Otherwise they're locked in or locked out of their garage

833
00:32:58,624 --> 00:33:01,440
They expect for there to be a level of security

834
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:06,048
Because for almost 80% of us homeowners this is the front door

835
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,840
Because their garage is attached

836
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:09,376
To their home so they don't want it

837
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:13,472
To be able to be hacked or penetrated and anyway that doesn't get lease

838
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:14,752
Equal if not exceed

839
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:16,288
Regular garage door open

840
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,616
And then to see they like to have ongoing

841
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,152
Features and functionality

842
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:23,712
Such as integration with partners

843
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:30,112
Or new features that continue to be dreamed up once you have the capability of a connected

844
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:30,880
Garage door opener

845
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:33,952
And so we found that really there were to invest

846
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:37,792
Since one was making the product connectable to the internet and

847
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:41,376
In the first place and the second one was the ongoing investment

848
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:42,656
Of creating

849
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:43,680
Uptime

850
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:45,472
From creating security

851
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:50,848
Continuing to upgrade it was features and functionalities that are users would like to see overtime

852
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,640
And when did you realize

853
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:55,712
This product that you were pushing out into the market

854
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:56,736
It was eventually

855
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:58,016
Was on its way to be

856
00:33:58,528 --> 00:33:59,296
More of a service

857
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:00,064
At least in terms

858
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:04,928
When I arrived about 20 months ago

859
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:07,488
I came with background in the connected home

860
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:08,768
Connected building

861
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:09,536
Connected fact

862
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:12,096
And so I came with

863
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:13,632
The benefit of understanding

864
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:14,656
What do

865
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:16,192
Ongoing value

866
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,216
Created by the

867
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:18,240
Company looks like

868
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:20,288
As well as the ongoing cough

869
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:23,104
Responsibilities as a supplier

870
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,640
Call that service or that

871
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,944
Good and and what I found was

872
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:27,968
Gem

873
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:29,504
We had created something

874
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:30,528
That had

875
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:32,320
Agreed amount of reception

876
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:35,392
But not a lot of understanding or thinking

877
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:37,440
How we were going to

878
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,976
Continue to evolve

879
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:40,512
The value of this product

880
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:41,792
And pay for it

881
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:43,584
So it's probably with 20

882
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,376
Months ago when I joined the company

883
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:47,680
That we started having conversation

884
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:51,008
All of these Partnerships that were requested by customers

885
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:53,568
Partners all of these things that we could do to the app

886
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:56,640
But we really couldn't afford because those things work

887
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:58,432
Competing with the core business

888
00:34:58,944 --> 00:34:59,712
Witches products

889
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:00,992
That brought Revenue

890
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:03,552
The profit and we began to look at it a different way

891
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:05,088
And so

892
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:08,416
From your standpoint I thought this was interesting as this idea that

893
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:10,976
It's kind of cannibalizing your existing business

894
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,000
2

895
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:16,864
Put development cost towards the ongoing Security in the ongoing maintenance at this program

896
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:18,912
Because normally those resources are

897
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:19,936
Reviews for selling

898
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:20,960
The physical Hardware

899
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:22,240
Product

900
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:24,288
So have you guys shifted the way

901
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:25,568
Ization

902
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:26,848
The biggest

903
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:29,152
Conflict that we found was in

904
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:30,688
Engineering resources

905
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:31,712
Software developer

906
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:33,504
And we did

907
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,552
Change our entire organization

908
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:36,320
Structure

909
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:38,112
To better align

910
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:40,160
With where we saw our grow coffee

911
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:45,792
Opportunities in the future so one area that we ended up creating was a line of business

912
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:47,328
It's called the emerging businesses

913
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:48,864
Lob line of business

914
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,912
Just that would allow us to focus on

915
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:53,216
On some of these new and disruptive

916
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:53,984
Things

917
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:55,520
That we wanted to

918
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:56,288
Store

919
00:35:56,544 --> 00:36:00,384
And that we wanted to test and that we wanted to incubate and bring it

920
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,968
Critical mass before we put it in the more mature business

921
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:06,016
And they have their own engineering resource

922
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:07,040
They don't have to cook

923
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:08,064
Compete against

924
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:12,672
The more mature businesses that can guarantee growth and profit right at the outset

925
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:14,464
Still allows for some risk-taking some

926
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,232
Experiment

927
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:17,280
The other thing that we did and

928
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:19,072
We separated are

929
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:21,120
Businesses more by end-user

930
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:22,656
Standby Brandon Channel

931
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:25,472
So we now have a residential line of business we have a

932
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:26,496
Commercial line of business

933
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:32,896
We have a premier access line of business International line of business and distribution and Automotive as well as the emerge

934
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:34,176
Line-of-business

935
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:36,736
Talk to you about before and that does allow

936
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:37,504
4

937
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,272
Focus

938
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:40,320
The end-user application

939
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,112
Right now

940
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:43,136
Maybe

941
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:46,720
Hardware durable good base but may just as well be

942
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:48,512
Software systems and services

943
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:49,536
Like we're discussing

944
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:54,656
So let's get to this if service because there's been a couple things that

945
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:57,728
User soap

946
00:36:57,984 --> 00:37:00,800
The first was a few years ago

947
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:01,568
When

948
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:04,384
Chamberlain promised homekit compatibility with

949
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,408
The MyQ system

950
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,712
In the thought was they weren't going to charge

951
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:08,992
Turns out that

952
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:11,296
Homekit requires an extra search chips

953
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:12,576
You have to make new physical Hardware

954
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:13,600
Go for it and

955
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,904
Then Chamberlain charged for

956
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:16,928
Abridge

957
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:19,232
This rubbed a lot of people

958
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:20,768
And now

959
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:25,120
Those are other users like them are really looking at the charging

960
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:26,912
Integration

961
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,472
Promise that she

962
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:31,776
Other services

963
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:33,312
So I'm curious

964
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:34,848
How that happened

965
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:39,456
So I'll refer back to the earlier discussion where when we started this journey

966
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:41,760
Nobody else has really done much as a

967
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:45,344
Before and we were looking at it as to how much can this

968
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,112
Chip Coffey

969
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:48,672
And how much does it cost to just enable if

970
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:49,440
Service in the fur

971
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:52,512
And we thought that we could recoup our cost

972
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:54,048
In the initial sale price

973
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,632
The product that we've been on this journey for almost 6 years now

974
00:37:58,144 --> 00:37:59,680
We've discovered again

975
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:02,496
Send that to deliver on the uptime Promises

976
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:04,032
Security promises

977
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:08,640
The partnership integration promises the extra value added services that

978
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:09,664
Consumers are asking

979
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:11,968
There's an ongoing

980
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:13,504
To the service

981
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:14,528
Start as week

982
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:15,808
Continue to add

983
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:17,856
Features functionality

984
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:18,880
Partnerships

985
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:19,904
Integration

986
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:24,768
Then if we feel that there are customer segments that are willing to pay for it

987
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:26,560
And other customer segments

988
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:27,328
For whom it's

989
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:28,608
Completely irrelevant

990
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:31,168
Then we put that into the premium tier

991
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:32,192
Where we charge

992
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:34,240
$1 a month or $10

993
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:40,640
You'll see more and more going into the premium tier and you'll see more and more going into the base pre-service but ultimately

994
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:42,688
This is something that

995
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,736
We wouldn't be able to

996
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:46,016
Afford to continue

997
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:48,832
Investing in the business if we made everything free

998
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:51,136
And how did you guys come about with that price

999
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:53,696
We have several different we came out at

1000
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:54,976
Several different directions

1001
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:56,256
Analyze

1002
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:58,048
First off

1003
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:59,584
We wanted to understand

1004
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,120
You know what are are caught

1005
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:02,912
We don't price based on cost

1006
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:03,680
But

1007
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:05,216
You do have to have an awareness

1008
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:07,264
Of what sort of cost are incurring

1009
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,080
Because if the value does not exceed the cost

1010
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:11,104
Then maybe it's not so

1011
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,920
And then we did

1012
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:16,480
Some very detailed analysis

1013
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:17,248
Customer

1014
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:18,528
Around what

1015
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:22,112
Value are we delivering and what is the willingness to pay for that.

1016
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,696
And we came back with a variety of different options that

1017
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:32,096
Equilibrium approximately a dollar a month or we got $10 a year might and sent people to sign up for

1018
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:33,120
A year at a time

1019
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:35,424
What percent of your user base do you think

1020
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,448
Will sign up for something

1021
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:41,824
Well we've had a large percentage of our user base sign up for the F10

1022
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:45,920
The homekit integration particularly during the 30-day.

1023
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:47,456
Where there's a free trial

1024
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:49,760
And we're continuing to monitor

1025
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:52,832
The participation rate as the free trial.

1026
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:53,600
Spire

1027
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:54,624
NetSpend

1028
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,648
In some cases

1029
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:57,952
Triple digit growth day by day by day

1030
00:39:58,208 --> 00:39:59,232
Small numbers admittedly

1031
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:01,280
But then the other thing is that

1032
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:03,840
As I mentioned we do intend to keep adding

1033
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:06,144
Features functionality services in apple

1034
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,936
Locations to that premium tier

1035
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:10,496
And so if people value

1036
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:11,776
And enjoy if

1037
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:14,080
And or homekit integration

1038
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:17,152
They find that they get other features and functionality that

1039
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:18,944
Continue to validate that invest

1040
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:22,784
Or it brings in new segments and new users who

1041
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,880
Initially weren't willing to pay for the action homekit integration but they would

1042
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:29,440
For future applications that we bring to Market

1043
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:31,488
So what are some of those future applications

1044
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:33,792
Well I think my product manager

1045
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:34,816
Strangle me

1046
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:36,096
If I were to

1047
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:36,864
Pronounce

1048
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:40,448
But one thing that I can tell you about that would be available but

1049
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:41,728
Time we are this podcast

1050
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:45,056
As many people don't realize that we have an automotive component

1051
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:45,824
HR business

1052
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,128
That we license our technology

1053
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:49,920
For the Homelink application

1054
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:55,808
Is the ability to use an integrated button in your car to open and close your garage door rather than

1055
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:57,088
A removable trans

1056
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,624
At the CMAs show

1057
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,416
Which is one of our industry shows

1058
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:02,464
We announce our partnership with alpine

1059
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:06,816
People who own select Alpine navigation or entertainment

1060
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:09,376
Would then be able to use MyQ

1061
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:10,144
On Alpine

1062
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,728
Connect to open the garage door as they're approaching rather than have

1063
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:15,520
Physical

1064
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:17,056
Transmitter like

1065
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:19,360
So it can further

1066
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:22,688
Allow for integration they can activate their home mode

1067
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:25,248
That would turn on lights for their house is lit

1068
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:30,368
Put their nest learning thermostat so that the house is it a comfortable temperature all from

1069
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:32,672
In the car and so that's

1070
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:34,208
An example of

1071
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:36,000
More and more applications

1072
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:37,792
Become available once we can have

1073
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:40,096
HD devices connected to the internet

1074
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:42,144
And that we can create more value for our user

1075
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:44,960
This idea of charging for subscription

1076
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:47,008
I believe that we're going to have

1077
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,824
Pay for subscriptions for a lot of Arc

1078
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:52,384
It's just part of the business model that

1079
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:54,175
You just talked about

1080
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:55,455
Baidu

1081
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:58,015
About kind of death by a thousand subscription

1082
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:59,295
So I can see

1083
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:01,343
Chamberlain

1084
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:04,415
Ring 30 bucks a year

1085
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:07,231
IOS security thing

1086
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:08,511
X number of dollars

1087
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:12,095
Plus maybe some share cloud storage etc etc

1088
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:14,143
So when I start looking at that

1089
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:15,423
I wonder how you

1090
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:17,471
Your subscription

1091
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:19,007
As part of an entire

1092
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:20,287
Fire systems

1093
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:21,823
A subscription that is going

1094
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:25,151
So I agree there is a little bit of a

1095
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:26,175
Consumer paradigm

1096
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:27,455
That stuff is free

1097
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:30,015
But people are beginning to realize that

1098
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:31,295
Stuff isn't really free

1099
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:34,367
When you upgrade to the latest IOS you

1100
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:35,903
You find out that some of your free apps

1101
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:37,439
Haven't been updated

1102
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:38,463
And may never be up

1103
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:40,511
Jaded and it's hard to complain about that cuz

1104
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:41,535
They were free in the first place

1105
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:47,423
People are beginning to learn that if you want a service without advertisements or commercials or things like that

1106
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:48,959
But you have to pay for it

1107
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:52,799
Some people are also beginning to learn the notion of a freemium model you get the base

1108
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:54,847
Version for free maybe LinkedIn

1109
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:56,383
Evernote or something like that

1110
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:58,175
And then if you want the premium version

1111
00:42:58,431 --> 00:42:59,455
Name something that you may value

1112
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:00,991
And you have to pay it

1113
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:01,759
Subscription model

1114
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:04,575
And so customers are beginning to realize

1115
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:05,855
That if you want

1116
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:06,623
Premium

1117
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:08,159
Service B. Noka

1118
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:09,183
Commercials are extra

1119
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:09,951
Features are

1120
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:10,975
Or somebody

1121
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:14,559
Updating it making sure that it's upgraded and secure overtime

1122
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:16,351
You're going to have to pay some dollars

1123
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:17,375
That being said

1124
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:20,703
Competition for recurring Revenue dollars

1125
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:21,727
Fierce

1126
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:23,519
Everybody wants a piece

1127
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:25,311
Piece of the consumer's wallet

1128
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:28,127
And the consumer only has so many dollars

1129
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:29,407
That they're willing to pay

1130
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:30,431
For a monthly fee

1131
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:34,015
Description your home alarm service is competing against your cable

1132
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:35,039
And people have to do

1133
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:36,319
Decide what's more important

1134
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:42,463
And so really it's we're relying on our ability to create value that the end users

1135
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:43,231
Want

1136
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:44,511
And are willing to pay for

1137
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:48,607
And ultimately there are some that will survive and there are some that won't

1138
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:50,911
Survive but right now it's the Wild West

1139
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:52,703
You know everybody wants to have

1140
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:53,727
Connected

1141
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:55,775
They realize how much it cost

1142
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:57,055
To maintain a Kinect

1143
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:57,823
The device

1144
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:03,455
Further subscriber base over a long. Of time and they're trying to figure out how to get paid for it

1145
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:04,735
At the same time

1146
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:07,295
That these ecosystems are trying to

1147
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:10,367
Consolidate and some of the consolidators

1148
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:11,647
Are looking for

1149
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:13,951
How did they assemble Partnerships but

1150
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:16,255
Keep the recurring monthly Revenue to themselves

1151
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:20,095
Two very exciting time I can't tell you where the equilibrium will balance out

1152
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:22,911
But in order for us to control our own destiny we

1153
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:24,447
We have to continue to develop

1154
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:25,215
Things that

1155
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:27,263
Consumers will value and are willing to pay for

1156
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:30,079
Sure I'm just wondering is eventually they'll be kind of like

1157
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:31,103
Like a cable package

1158
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:31,871
For the smart

1159
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:35,199
Provider ISP

1160
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:36,735
Some third-party

1161
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:38,015
Whereas security

1162
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:41,599
A system just I no longer know what

1163
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:42,623
To you guys

1164
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:43,391
In particular

1165
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:45,439
Part of a package of

1166
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:47,487
Cloud storage Plus

1167
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:48,255
You know if dinner

1168
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:49,279
Decorations Plus

1169
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:51,583
Absolutely

1170
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:52,351
Possible

1171
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:55,167
And there's so many different directions at that taking

1172
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:56,959
You can see the security

1173
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:59,007
Providers taking a lead on that you

1174
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:02,335
Home automation Partners taking a lead on that you can

1175
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:06,175
To see the cable and telephone line companies taking a lead on that

1176
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:07,967
You can see that damn

1177
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:10,783
The world taking a lead on that and that the home assistant

1178
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:12,831
And we're not really sure where it's at

1179
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:13,855
To settle out

1180
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:15,135
But the good thing

1181
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:17,439
Is that every single one of those partners

1182
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:18,719
Want garage

1183
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:22,047
Well maybe you guys will get to be the ESPN

1184
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:24,095
Let's talk about

1185
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:25,119
New stuff

1186
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:26,399
You guys have

1187
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:27,935
Expanded from

1188
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:29,215
You've obviously had

1189
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:30,239
Business outside

1190
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:32,031
Consumer but I know that

1191
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:33,823
Roughly a year ago I talked

1192
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,103
Tacori Cerise over

1193
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:36,127
About

1194
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:38,431
You guys starting to create a service package for

1195
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:39,711
Commercial customer

1196
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:40,991
Merced actually helps them

1197
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:43,295
Understand their business better based on like

1198
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:44,063
Like how much time

1199
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:45,599
Trucks are spinning at loading dock

1200
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:46,367
Bassinet sort of in

1201
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:47,135
Information

1202
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:48,671
So I'm curious

1203
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:50,975
1 how are you guys evaluating these new Hopper

1204
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:53,791
It might be that the business

1205
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:54,815
That you guys are working on

1206
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:57,375
And where do you see you guys going next on that

1207
00:45:57,887 --> 00:46:00,447
So you're right to our reorganization

1208
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:02,239
Did create a commercial line

1209
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:05,823
Fitness now we've always sold commercial door openers

1210
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:07,103
It's part of our core comp

1211
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:08,895
Trauma residential line

1212
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:12,991
And so they're heavier Duty and they do a few different things

1213
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,319
Take advantage of our engineering Act

1214
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:18,623
Toyota open

1215
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:20,159
Commercial doors

1216
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:20,927
Maybe for a disc

1217
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:23,487
Warehouse the issue is is that

1218
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:24,255
The biggest

1219
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:25,023
Competitor

1220
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:27,327
In the commercial line of business is do nothing

1221
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:28,095
Unlike

1222
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:29,375
Residential homes

1223
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:30,911
The commercial doors

1224
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:32,959
Are often manually power

1225
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:34,751
Do you have a worker coming in the morning

1226
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:36,287
And they roll that

1227
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:38,079
Hang up in the morning and maybe

1228
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:40,127
They might close it a little bit throughout the day

1229
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:42,687
But in large part they remain open

1230
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:43,711
For much of the day

1231
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:45,503
Are they closing at the end of the day

1232
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:47,807
And for years we've been relying

1233
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:50,879
On a value proposition that talked about injury.

1234
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:52,927
And workman's comp

1235
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:53,951
Claim avoidance

1236
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:56,255
As one of the reasons for why

1237
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:58,047
Owner-operators

1238
00:46:58,559 --> 00:46:59,839
Distribution center stay

1239
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:01,119
Should invest in

1240
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:02,143
Commercial door opener

1241
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:03,679
But the reality is

1242
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:04,447
Is that

1243
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:06,239
A cost avoidance

1244
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:09,311
For whose cost it isn't even in your operating plan

1245
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:11,359
Is one of the first things

1246
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:12,895
Should be cut it really

1247
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:13,919
Resembles insurance

1248
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:16,223
And when you are resource

1249
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:18,015
That's one of the line items

1250
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:20,575
And so by creating this

1251
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:22,879
Line-of-business where the group

1252
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:24,415
Really focusing

1253
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:25,951
On the End customer

1254
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:28,511
And what are their problems and what are their offer

1255
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:29,791
Judaism

1256
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:30,559
It's all for them

1257
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:32,607
We gained a lot more insight

1258
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:33,631
Around

1259
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:35,423
How their business works

1260
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:36,447
And how we can

1261
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:37,983
Better contribute to that business

1262
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:41,055
Through an automated and connected

1263
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:42,591
Commercial Door operator

1264
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:44,895
That can contribute to things like

1265
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:45,919
Energy saving

1266
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:48,479
ASPCA at the Spaceway

1267
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:49,503
Climate control

1268
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:50,527
Or

1269
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:51,295
Safety

1270
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:52,063
Plaintiff

1271
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:53,599
Say it's a pharmaceutical

1272
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:54,367
Warehouse

1273
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:55,647
They need to

1274
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:56,415
Cooperate

1275
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:58,207
To a regulatory

1276
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:00,255
Security has been in force

1277
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:01,535
Or efficiency

1278
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:02,815
If you think about

1279
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:05,887
Many people have a certain number of doctors

1280
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:07,679
For their distribution warehouse

1281
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:10,495
I think that they're all being utilized equally

1282
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:13,311
And then there are capital requests add on more

1283
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:17,151
If we can provide the data that shows them the actual usage

1284
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:18,687
And the trends that they

1285
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:24,319
Can understand when the right time to invest in then the back of a p&l on

1286
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:27,903
Real insight as to how they can operate their business

1287
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:28,927
More effectively

1288
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:30,719
It doesn't trade on

1289
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:31,487
Fear

1290
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:34,303
And cost avoidance that really isn't even in their planning at 4

1291
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:38,911
Yay

1292
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:46,079
Let's wrap it up with others in your position

1293
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:48,383
Or rather in a similar position

1294
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:49,407
Products

1295
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:51,967
And it cost them money over the long term

1296
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:55,551
What would you do differently if you were building

1297
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:57,087
MyQ today

1298
00:48:57,343 --> 00:48:57,855
And the ground up

1299
00:48:58,367 --> 00:48:59,647
Well if you reference

1300
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:00,927
Starting to charge for some

1301
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:03,487
That has been free for almost six

1302
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:05,279
Sears has not made me the most

1303
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:06,047
Most popular purse

1304
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:07,839
It's been a

1305
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:08,607
Small butt

1306
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:09,375
Vocal

1307
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:12,447
Group of detractors and if I had to do it over again

1308
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:13,471
I would have

1309
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:17,311
I could rewind to 6 years ago I was in a company then but if I

1310
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:20,639
Somehow travel back in time I would have done more thinking

1311
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:21,407
About

1312
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:23,455
What value are we creating

1313
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:25,503
What service are we offering

1314
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:28,063
And what do we want to offer free

1315
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:29,599
But what do we need to charge

1316
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:32,159
In order to help keep the investor

1317
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:35,231
Going if anybody thinks that they're going to start out

1318
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:37,279
Free and once people love it

1319
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:40,351
Then you're going to start charging and people will be happy to pay

1320
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:41,887
Dog probably end up in

1321
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:42,911
The same boat that I was

1322
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:46,239
Once we did start charging for certain integration

1323
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:47,519
Beyond RV services

1324
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:48,543
Got it

1325
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:50,335
You guys build your own cloud pot

1326
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:51,359
Correct

1327
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:53,151
Yes we absolutely did

1328
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:55,455
Being a company that is rooted in

1329
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:56,223
Security

1330
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:58,271
And making sure that we have

1331
00:49:58,527 --> 00:49:59,295
An offering

1332
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:00,319
That controls

1333
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:03,135
Security of what for most people is their front door

1334
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:04,159
The garage door

1335
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:06,719
We wanted to make sure that we

1336
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:08,511
Had full control over that

1337
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:09,535
Okay so

1338
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:10,559
That's still

1339
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:11,327
From your perspective

1340
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:13,887
It's still a good decision

1341
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:14,911
We can

1342
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:15,935
Monitor

1343
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:19,519
And we can make sure that we understand what's happening

1344
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:20,287
100% of

1345
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:21,311
The time and

1346
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:22,079
For us

1347
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:28,479
The other opportunities around commercial or perimeter or other applications just continues to make that a good to see

1348
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:29,247
Vision is weird

1349
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:30,527
Word branching out from

1350
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:32,831
Are base residential business even further

1351
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:33,855
Excellent

1352
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:34,623
All right

1353
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:36,415
