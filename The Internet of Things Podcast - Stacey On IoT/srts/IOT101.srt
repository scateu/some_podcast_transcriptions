New services for the Amazon Echo

6
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:27,136
How to talk about Amazon web services going down and what it took with it

7
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:28,672
We also discuss

8
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:29,696
Hack teddy bears

9
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:31,232
Stuff that makes the smart home

10
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:32,512
I said suck butt

11
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:34,560
Just not very fun for users

12
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:36,864
Go to talk about my Logitech Harmony

13
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,496
And how that worked out for me and we got some cool new smart home gadgets that are coming on them

14
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:46,336
Also have a word from this week sponsor spin dance

15
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:48,896
And our guest is star

16
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:49,920
Jaskiewicz

Of Comedy called Audrey

18
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:58,880
And he's actually going to talk about what it means when everything becomes a service and how that affects the Enterprise

19
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:00,928
Value chain and how small our company

20
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:02,208
Can actually

21
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:04,256
Create value and work with bigger cam

22
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:05,792
It's a really

23
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:07,072
Thought-provoking interview

24
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:08,096
At least it was for me

25
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:10,144
You guys may all be a lot smarter

26
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:10,912
Who knows

27
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:15,264
Before we get to all of that I have another message from our spot

28
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:21,920
This week's weather is Wolf SSL the world's top three automakers use wolf SSL to secure

29
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:28,320
Their vehicles and they aren't alone secures 2 billion connections across a multitude of eye

30
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:34,720
Iot sectors including Automotive connected home industrial military and medical device

31
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:41,120
What the Mirai botnet in the growing threat of ransomware attacks on the Internet of Things companies have to pay to

32
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:45,728
The security or wrist litigation bad PR and their brand value

33
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:51,360
Securing the iot is hard but wolf SSL has the experience and specialized expertise to help

34
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:53,920
Shouldn't you be using both SSL

35
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,200
To find out more

36
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:56,736
Is it wolf SSL

37
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:57,504
Dot-com

38
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:58,784
All right

39
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,064
Kevin

40
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:03,392
Let's pick a topic you want to talk about

41
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:07,488
Oh that's just go right to the big news this week which is

42
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:08,256
So far

43
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:13,120
We should say this week so far because this week is only halfway over when we start recording

44
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:17,216
But on Tuesday Amazon web services

45
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:19,776
Experienced an outage in

46
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,312
Virginia Virginia

47
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:25,920
I was trying to remember what it's called but it's their Virginia Datacenter this guy goes down all the time

48
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:26,944
It's super old

49
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:31,552
85 years anyway

50
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:33,856
It's their least reliable

51
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:34,880
Data Center

52
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,928
Basically when you hear problems it's almost

53
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:38,464
Almost guaranteed to be that pretty

54
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,000
But

55
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:40,768
A lot of stuff

56
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,304
I think it's called East

57
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,120
Stash one cuz they'll have designations obviously

58
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:47,168
And I noticed

59
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,496
It's happening yesterday afternoon

60
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:54,080
When I was listening to satellite radio over the web

61
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:56,384
So SiriusXM was using the app

62
00:02:56,896 --> 00:03:00,480
As I was working at a sudden stop playing music and I'm like well that's weird

63
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:05,600
And then I might go switch to Apple music as a screenplay he couldn't play that

64
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:08,160
Then I told my echo to

65
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,464
Play music you know I listen you age

66
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:12,000
Play new agent

67
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:14,048
She said okay Shuffle new age

68
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:19,936
And then I went to the web and saw that the East one

69
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:22,752
Amazon data center was having problems and

70
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:25,056
That the list of companies that

71
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,080
Were affected

72
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,872
They're at their several dozen

73
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,408
Sympathizer

74
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:37,856
Canary apparently admitted to struggles ring connect to doorbell maker had some issues

75
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:40,160
Piper another all-in-one security product

76
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,440
Hazmat shoes

77
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:44,512
And the assistant that mean

78
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:46,048
Caused a lot of problems

79
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,584
People were complaining that

80
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,888
Oh my gosh I can't turn on my lights

81
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,192
Which

82
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,472
I wish I was a little bit bad

83
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:56,032
Because if this then that

84
00:03:56,288 --> 00:04:00,128
What are you doing tell him to get a proper hug or something

85
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,664
Italy

86
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,224
I know I did

87
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,760
When the internet

88
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,552
Goes down

89
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,600
Sure

90
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,904
If this then that goes down

91
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:14,720
So Kevin

92
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:16,000
Is going to use this

93
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:16,768
Time to

94
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:22,143
You knew I was going to go there today

95
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:29,311
See I had no problems had to test this be right away as soon as I did

96
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,615
Amazon server issue

97
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:34,175
Powercloud issue I started

98
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,735
Tell me my echo to turn lights on and off

99
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,015
And

100
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,295
It still work

101
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:44,927
Because the how did I use the wink Hub does allow for local

102
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:49,023
Type commands and schedules and so on so what it's not completely Cloud Reliant

103
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:52,095
So I know I said it before it's one of the reasons I

104
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:54,911
I decided to stick with it I'm not going to say it's the best hub

105
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,959
But obviously in this instance it was

106
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:59,263
Still working out for my smart home so that was

107
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,543
It's something to keep in mind

108
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,591
And if you want

109
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,383
Would also

110
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:06,175
Turn on things

111
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:06,943
And

112
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,223
I believe SmartThings

113
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:11,039
Would too because they thought local control

114
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:13,855
Even though SmartThings is actually hosted in

115
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:14,879
AWS

116
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:19,487
And so this gets into a topic that we probably should talk about more

117
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,255
We don't

118
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:22,303
But a lot of people were like

119
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:26,399
Oh no this is a problem because everything is hosted in the cloud

120
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,679
It's actually not

121
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:30,751
It's a problem because of the way the systems architect

122
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:35,871
In Amazon is by far the most popular

123
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:36,639
Platform

124
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:40,735
For smart home services it's the backend for services

125
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:45,855
We've already mentioned but it's also the back in for platforms like SmartThings

126
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,159
Ala network switch

127
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:51,743
Actually provides service for Hunter fans and a lot of other

128
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:52,767
The devices

129
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,815
Until what

130
00:05:55,071 --> 00:06:01,215
Companies need to take into account is you need to design for resiliency and Netflix actually doesn't excellent

131
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:07,615
People talking about chaos monkeys what they're talking about is Netflix's design philosophy

132
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:10,431
54 their architecture which is basically like

133
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,199
Plan for

134
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:14,271
Crap to happen and things to go down including

135
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,039
Amazon

136
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:17,343
InDesign across multiple regions

137
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,671
So that means don't put all your eggs in one data center basic

138
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:28,351
This is going to be complicated is going to be slightly more expensive

139
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:30,399
But you're going to have up time

140
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:32,447
When the sort of thing happens so

141
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:34,751
Despite the fact that AWS

142
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,055
And

143
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,103
I think it's a great time to talk about

144
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,223
Finding hubs that work locally even when the cloud is down

145
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,271
People who design their

146
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,551
Cloud architectures

147
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:53,951
Who are hosted on AWS to think about hosting across multiple availability zones and resiliency which can be

148
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:54,719
Be done

149
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:56,767
We also want to talk about some new

150
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,047
Echo skills

151
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:01,375
The big one

152
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:04,191
Is if you have a wink Hub Kevin you're going to appreciate this

153
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:07,007
You can now connect several types of locks

154
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:09,823
You can connect your Schlage Locks

155
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,847
Your Kwikset lock

156
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,127
Fox Andrew yellow

157
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,407
To work with wink

158
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,503
And you can use the echo to check if a door is locked or unlocked

159
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,295
And luck

160
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,111
You cannot use the echo 2

161
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:22,879
Unlocked

162
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:23,647
But you're right

163
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:26,975
It is true that if you have an August lock

164
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:29,023
You can unlock your door using the

165
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,839
Just so you're aware

166
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:32,607
I tested it

167
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,399
I should actually tell you how to do this

168
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:36,447
So if you haven't done it

169
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:38,495
Connect your locks

170
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,287
Through the wink hub

171
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:42,079
Which I done already

172
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:44,639
And you have to set individual names

173
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:47,711
I'm going to tell you that my naming convention

174
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:51,039
My garage door is actually garage lock

175
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:52,575
Don't do that

176
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,367
Cathay garage door

177
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:57,183
Call your front door back door

178
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:01,279
Sep just just a little warning for you

179
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,303
Then

180
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,375
If you haven't been able to link scale with the Echo app

181
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:10,239
And then sign into all that good stuff and then tell the echo to discover new devices

182
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,799
Once that's done

183
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:13,823
You are

184
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,871
Done and then you can say

185
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,407
Is garage door

186
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,431
Locked

187
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:19,711
Ilse

188
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,247
Hold on checking on that

189
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,783
And it's come back and tell you

190
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,063
Or you can say hey

191
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,343
Lock the garage door

192
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,623
So again

193
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,975
When you're naming your lock you may want to go back in and rename it needed something you want to say to

194
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:36,351
Yep and I actually just ran through the steps cuz I already had a

195
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:39,679
Kwikset lockset already connected to my wink hub

196
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:45,823
I went into the Amazon app for my echo and didn't discover devices and I now see you lock

197
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:49,151
Which I don't really like the name of but I can change that later

198
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:52,735
Yes you will probably want value only have one but you may want to

199
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,783
I may have more later I don't know

200
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:57,087
There you go

201
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:00,415
Only because your lock is actually part of a ruler

202
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:05,791
Run through that maybe sometime this week and see cuz one of the things with Smart Home

203
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:06,559
Products

204
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:07,839
Is state

205
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:08,607
So

206
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:10,143
If you change it from

207
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,679
One type of app

208
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,215
Instead of the other

209
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:16,799
Sometimes they don't always the state doesn't match up so

210
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,079
If you lock it in one app

211
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,895
The other apps may still think they not know

212
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:23,967
Yeah yeah

213
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:27,551
Alluding to is the one I set up to automatically lock my front door

214
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:30,623
It's lock is unlocked for 5 minutes

215
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,391
Because

216
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:35,231
Kids are leaving the front door unlocked so it does that automatically survival test

217
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,351
Okay

218
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,887
So I tried this out

219
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,423
Works like a charm

220
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:45,471
It's very nice so

221
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:46,751
I'm excited by this

222
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:51,871
Speaking of the Amazon Echo you can now connect your Netgear orbi or

223
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:54,431
Nighthawk routers to the echo

224
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:56,735
Which means you can ask it things like

225
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:57,503
Echo

226
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,807
Ask Netgear to enable guest Network

227
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:03,135
Ask Netgear to enable disable 5G Gessner

228
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,415
And

229
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,695
What are my WiFi

230
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:06,463
Settings

231
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,231
Which is

232
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:07,999
Is very handy

233
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,023
So

234
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,815
These are all very good

235
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:14,399
We will include a link in the show so you can see which Nighthawk routers

236
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:17,215
And which Netgear routers work with us

237
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:19,519
You're going to have to go enable the skill

238
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:22,335
It's not a direct kind of Hub things so

239
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:24,127
Very easy very fun

240
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,407
And

241
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,455
Are useful if you

242
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,223
Do you have the sword

243
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,247
I

244
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:32,319
I use my Eero settings on the echo to pause the network

245
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,343
Work on occasion

246
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,623
Which is super fun

247
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,671
I'm just frustrated everyone in my

248
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,975
That's nice

249
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:41,279
Evil family dinner time should not be

250
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,839
Put the phones down

251
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,423
Actually they can't unpositive

252
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,191
Akame unpause

253
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,007
Sneaky

254
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,031
Yeah

255
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:54,335
All right before we stop talking about

256
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:57,407
Echoes can I just throw one more thing

257
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,943
I should have been I will

258
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:02,015
I will also it seems like there's a concerted effort

259
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,551
By phone makers

260
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:04,319
2 *

261
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,343
Bringing

262
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:08,415
The echo services in 2 handsets

263
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:13,535
And we saw this at the Consumer Electronics Show I believe it was Huawei that said we're going to have

264
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:17,887
Android app built right into a phone it's not there yet it's still there still working on that

265
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:21,471
But interesting land enough at Mobile World Congress last week

266
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,519
Was it Lenovo

267
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:25,311
Who owns Motorola

268
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:27,103
Showed off

269
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:30,431
A concept video of a new Moto mod annies

270
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:35,039
These mods or add-ons that you would buy the name attached to your Motorola phones

271
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,599
Could be a speaker could be projector

272
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:40,415
A better camera Etc they have a couple of them out right now

273
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:43,231
They're going to have a new one I showed it off at

274
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,511
Mwc

275
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:48,863
And basically it turns the phone into a portable Amazon Echo

276
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:52,191
So that the mod stick to the back of the Moto Z for example

277
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:55,775
You put your phone face down and use the back as a speaker

278
00:11:56,031 --> 00:12:02,175
Even has the blue glow around the edges so it knows so you know rather when you were speaking to it just like you would be true

279
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,455
Additional Echo Hardware

280
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:05,247
So it's coming later this month

281
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,295
Expectedly no price or anything but

282
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,575
It's just interesting that

283
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:12,159
Companies have been working on their own voice Service as an AI for quite a while

284
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,439
And

285
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:15,999
Now they're really embracing Amazon in a big way

286
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,303
Well it's that they did a lot of the high

287
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,327
Work for you so

288
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,119
Why not

289
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,399
Why Google

290
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:24,703
Haven't really pushed its

291
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:26,495
Natural language processing

292
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:28,287
Like its speech recognition

293
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,591
AI for Developers

294
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:31,359
Very much

295
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,383
Because

296
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,175
There's clearly a hunger for this

297
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:36,735
I would say so I'd I don't know

298
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:37,759
What

299
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:41,855
Google has provided to developers in that respect but I do know that

300
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,391
The Google Assistant

301
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:47,999
Which was the exclusive to the pixel phones is now coming to all

302
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:54,143
Android 6.0 and 7.0 phone so that's no yeah I no longer going to be an exclusive

303
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,935
That's kind of interesting

304
00:12:56,447 --> 00:13:00,543
Doesn't answer your question about what can developer so much

305
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:03,103
But at least it's coming to a much wider audience

306
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:07,967
And I'm taking my comments about developers from people who've been developing speech Rec

307
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:08,991
Recognition apps for a

308
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:12,831
What's the weather this is and they many of them in this is about

309
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:16,159
8 months ago hit reached out to Google in

310
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,719
They figured there was something there but Google just

311
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:19,743
WhatsApp

312
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,023
What's this

313
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:27,423
That's interesting and I'm not disputing that at all I just don't know but I look back to my Wink app

314
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,191
And

315
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:28,959
I can create

316
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:31,007
There's a beta for like Google

317
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,311
Voice-activated shortcuts that use

318
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:36,895
Use that so there's got to be some hooks available to folks

319
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:41,759
Creating apps and such but I don't know what they are with to the extent they are

320
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,295
Yes they do have them

321
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,599
Hadn't been marketing them

322
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,135
In some cases

323
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:50,207
You kind of had to ask and then you were stuck in a queue forever

324
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:52,511
But

325
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:54,559
With the Google home that is changing

326
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,327
So

327
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,375
Yay we should also mention

328
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,399
Kevin

329
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:03,007
I do I'm a consultant for Google

330
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:04,543
An Android Chrome sided

331
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,591
Mark was the IRT focuser

332
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:13,247
Google Assistant jokes

333
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:17,087
To make assistant available in other places because I have a Nexus 5

334
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:20,927
Do I have an exercise yes I have a Nexus 5X

335
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,207
And I

336
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:22,975
Very excited

337
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,279
Futures you get an assist

338
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,559
Continue getting the system

339
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:27,583
And you get an assist

340
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,119
I had nothing to do with it

341
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:32,703
It was all over

342
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:34,495
So

343
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:35,775
Let's now talk about

344
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,823
This is also a hot story

345
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:38,847
Hacked

346
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,127
Teddy bears

347
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,759
I wanted a satyr

348
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:50,367
That was actually much saturated it much better than I did. I'm in a good mood

349
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:51,903
This is like

350
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,439
This is aggravating

351
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:59,583
Sounds like a recurring Story 2 because it's not the first time this has happened with children's toys that have

352
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,375
Some type of microphones and so on

353
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:04,191
Yes basically if you're making a children's toy

354
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:09,311
Get your security in at the beginning so what happened here is a company called

355
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:12,383
It's spiral toys to make a product called cloud

356
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:17,759
And they basically contracted out to a company to do there

357
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,295
Connectivity and

358
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:22,879
Grab like they're filled out the backend architecture for this connect

359
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:23,647
Teddy bear

360
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:25,951
And that company basically left

361
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:29,023
An open mongodb database

362
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:32,351
Just hanging out there not secured

363
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:33,631
On the internet

364
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:36,703
Which over 800,000 account records

365
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,983
Yes and

366
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,775
To make matters worse

367
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:46,687
They dropped all of their files the recording files over two million of them were stored in an Amazon S3

368
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:48,223
Repository and like

369
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:50,271
I don't want a server

370
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:52,063
Instant thank you that is the word

371
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:54,879
Imagine it was multiple instance

372
00:15:56,415 --> 00:16:00,511
But you could actually find that file wasn't protected so if you knew where to look

373
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,303
In this this is a little bit less agree

374
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,607
God storing passwords

375
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:07,935
Just on the internet in a database with no security that

376
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:12,543
Yeah that's just a tough time in this toys

377
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,079
Interesting in that you could

378
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:17,919
Record a message to your kids and send it over the Internet to the teddy bear and all

379
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:22,015
But now the account information on an icing recordings are all stored as well

380
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:27,903
Geez I mean as a people getting into these

381
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,951
Teddy bears in like sending

382
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:31,487
Disturbing messages to

383
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,279
People's teddy bear switch

384
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,047
Cool

385
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:40,191
As a hacker I can see how it be super funny in your head to send a terrifying message to a toddler

386
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,215
But you know

387
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:44,287
It's it's Dad that's over the line I mean

388
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,311
Obviously

389
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:48,127
Everybody has their own Line in the Sand it to me that's over the line

390
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,663
Yeah someone had a Twitter

391
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:50,687
They showed it where

392
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,735
I will eat your

393
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:53,503
Face

394
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,271
RushCard

395
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:55,295
That's great

396
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:57,855
Haha but

397
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,183
That is the situation

398
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:01,951
The

399
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:03,999
Okay

400
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:06,303
I swear to God I say this all the time

401
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,327
But

402
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,143
You guys are getting the Internet of Things a bad name

403
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,447
When you build a connected product

404
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,751
You have to think of security

405
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,543
From the ground up

406
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:17,823
Killer Contract

407
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,103
Have to think of Siri

408
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,383
Underground

409
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:22,687
And there are companies out there

410
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:23,455
Who do this

411
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,735
And is a consumer

412
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,271
You're going to have

413
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:31,647
I was just going to say that's what it comes down to I think it's cost

414
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:32,671
And

415
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:33,951
You know it's so

416
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:39,583
A company and I'm not trying to single out that the company that has spiral toys here but any companies making a

417
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:42,143
Device it's connected

418
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:45,471
Different want to keep costs down obviously I totally get that

419
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:47,775
It's not in the end

420
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:50,847
Yeah there you go in this situation

421
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,127
I love

422
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:53,919
The idea of being able to

423
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,455
Do this but

424
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:58,015
Plenty of teddy bears out there that you

425
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,295
You can record your voice and

426
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:05,439
By golly guys and if you're a consumer

427
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,231
Maybe don't buy the stuff

428
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:08,511
Or maybe

429
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:09,535
Don't buy it

430
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,327
Cheap I hate to say that

431
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:15,423
One of the things you can look for is to see if the company making the product

432
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:17,471
Has a bug Bounty program

433
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:20,287
That's actually really good way to look and be like

434
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,103
Care about Security in this case

435
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:26,175
This company was actually informed of the breach

436
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,967
In December and January

437
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:29,759
And never did anything about it

438
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,575
That feels like a situation

439
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:34,879
No

440
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:41,279
It's getting to the point where it like any product it comes down to who do you trust what company or brand do you trust and

441
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:46,143
With Fire TV because it's a relatively new

442
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,423
Industry

443
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,703
Consumer level

444
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:50,495
And we still don't know

445
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:53,567
You don't know all the security practices of all these companies either

446
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,615
So it's it's really ad

447
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,151
Tricky situation

448
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:59,711
Any product on the Internet

449
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:02,527
It's going to be hot or has the potential to be high

450
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:06,623
If your device if you're designing a product is going to be connected

451
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:09,183
You probably want to design for resiliency

452
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,487
Stuff happen

453
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:14,303
So you have to build your product

454
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:18,399
With a mindset that you're always going to be tinker

455
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:21,215
You're always going to be testing it for 6

456
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,239
Breeches

457
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:25,823
You're always going to be testing at for resiliency challenges

458
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:28,383
And this is a very new mindset for a lot of

459
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:29,151
Companies

460
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:31,967
And you got to get it right

461
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,271
Otherwise

462
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,855
You're going to just stick us right back in in in some people are like

463
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,391
Yeah okay that's fine I don't need it

464
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,951
But it's bigger than that that's

465
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:47,583
The problem so it's you know I might want to put a new camera in my house because I've got to be my security system

466
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,631
But do I want to do that

467
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:50,911
Considering you know

468
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:53,471
Somebody might be able to hack in and see

469
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:54,495
In my house

470
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:58,591
Speaking of security cameras

471
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:02,687
Oh I did

472
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,967
I did

473
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:09,855
Really I don't know that I needed any kind of camera but I'm like you know I should have I used to have them

474
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:13,951
That's much smaller house so you know I'm working from home for 5 days a week

475
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:20,351
I got a good discount on it on Amazon site I did my Nest Cam and I set it up on Sunday night in fact

476
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,887
Sunday afternoon

477
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:23,167
Set up Sunday night

478
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,471
And I don't see it paid for itself

479
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:29,823
In the first 5 minutes of us on Monday but boy did it make for an entertaining video

480
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:32,639
Because I came downstairs at 7:30 in the morning on Monday

481
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:33,919
I found my dog

482
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:36,223
The kitchen island as I often do

483
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:37,247
And like you know what

484
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:41,087
I'm going to see how you got up there cuz I don't know and I'm going to see when you went up there

485
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,367
And sure enough

486
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:45,695
I would like 7 in the morning after I went back into the logs

487
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:49,279
I saw my wife and stepdaughter go out the front door to work and school

488
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:52,351
Answered a few minutes later good old Norm

489
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:55,935
I see how he does it now it turns the Barstool hopped up there and

490
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,727
That's why I found them up there so

491
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:00,543
It made for an entertaining video

492
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,335
Kim Kardashian

493
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:05,407
If you don't however

494
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:08,223
Watch the video is a tiny poodle

495
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,759
He is not a dog that

496
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:11,295
And he's very agile

497
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,063
Are you smart

498
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,087
.

499
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,879
Insufficient phrase

500
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:19,744
I do not know why

501
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,792
Missouri temperamental

502
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:23,584
But he is very agile

503
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,352
He is

504
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:25,376
You're crazy

505
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,656
Crazy agile dog

506
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,984
Of course so he's not really in trouble

507
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,032
He made for entertaining video

508
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,568
Yeah don't leave chocolate

509
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,176
We have actually

510
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:38,944
Some

511
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,296
Cool smart home thing you said I wanted to point out because a couple people have been asking me about

512
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:46,880
One is a product this is only available in the UK

513
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:51,744
And it has a camera and it also uses sound

514
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,280
Protect your house so

515
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:57,632
It basically is very powerful microphone to understand

516
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:59,936
Like if doors have been opened

517
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:01,728
It's kind of like a glass break sensor

518
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:07,360
So I think it's kind of an interesting way to do this and then obviously wants it to text something

519
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:09,152
Turn the camera on and then

520
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,688
You can check and be like

521
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:12,224
50

522
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:14,784
It's 159 pounds

523
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:15,808
Again

524
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:16,576
UK

525
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:19,136
Andrew on the sight word Amazon

526
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:21,184
And I kind of want to try it out

527
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,208
So

528
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:28,864
It's an interesting take on security because when you think of home security think I got a table or instrument all these doors and windows

529
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:32,448
And from what I gather

530
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:34,752
They're saying no you don't because

531
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:36,800
It can learn the sounds of your house

532
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:39,360
House doors opening and people

533
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:40,640
And

534
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:42,944
If it detects sound of something

535
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:44,992
Different like glass breaking

536
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,880
Then it can you know whether to send out a 90 decibel siren

537
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:54,208
Show you you know what's going on based on the camera

538
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:55,232
So I suspect

539
00:22:55,488 --> 00:23:00,096
You could use fewer of these as opposed to you know like a good 20 doors and windows

540
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:01,376
Enable 20

541
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:02,400
Sensors

542
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:03,680
Exactly

543
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:04,960
That's kind of what I wanted to ask

544
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:06,240
Cuz right now I don't have sensor

545
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:08,032
I have them they're just now

546
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:12,128
So that's one for people who are

547
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,152
Excited

548
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:14,176
I also

549
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:20,832
This is a pre-order kind of situation so I try not to do too much of these just because

550
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,112
You never know

551
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:26,464
I could spend my entire show telling you about the kickstarter

552
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:37,216
This is a device called brilliant

553
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:39,776
What is the light switch

554
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:45,408
But it's a light switch with a capacitive touchscreen

555
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:46,688
It also has these

556
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:53,344
Touch-sensitive sliders so what you do is if you have a 1 single light switch you're going to replace your light switch with

557
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:58,976
You can also it's got two three and four gang switches basic

558
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:01,024
Which is one screen with like

559
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,048
Four different slider

560
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:07,680
It's got Amazon Echo voice is so Amazon voice Services built in

561
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:10,496
You can talk to it and order it to

562
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:11,264
Things just like you

563
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:14,592
It's got a motion sensor ambient light sensors

564
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,152
And you can

565
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:21,248
Quote you can do like this swiping up and down to turn things on or off

566
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:22,528
Hold your finger to Dimmitt

567
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:26,624
And it's got a mic so you can use it as an intercom

568
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,648
Tom in your home

569
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,208
There's a lot to like

570
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,304
I would agree with you as I look at it though it's

571
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,584
Whitney reminds me of

572
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,400
It reminds me of the wink relay that I have in my bedroom

573
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:44,288
It has a very similar look and feel I do like a sliders as opposed to the two Hardware

574
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:46,592
Switches that the wink uses

575
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:48,640
And the week doesn't had a can beat the Winx

576
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:49,408
Canby

577
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,456
Intercoms butt

578
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:56,320
They don't have Amazon voice Services built-in so that's nice

579
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:59,648
This works with Sonos and nest and other stuff

580
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:00,672
I like

581
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:02,720
The look at this and I just noticed

582
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:06,560
I just noticed that they have it at the Target open house

583
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:10,144
In San Francisco and guess where I'll be next week not on the show

584
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:16,544
I'll be in San Francisco right across the street from the Metreon there in the Target so I may go take a look at this

585
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:18,080
Don't you get my hopes up

586
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:22,176
I will try to take a look I promise I will try

587
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:23,712
I really like to look at

588
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:26,784
Extremely similar and it has more functionality

589
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,392
It kind of reminds me that we talked about this but the nucleus

590
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:38,048
It's a I want to say it's like a picture frame kind of device but it's it's a video conference call it's a dedicated video conference call

591
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:40,096
Or an intercom system for your house

592
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:41,376
So you can

593
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:44,704
Put one downstairs it also has the

594
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:46,752
Echo voice services

595
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:49,568
You put one downstairs one upstairs and you could be like

596
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,848
Hey

597
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,384
Dinner's ready

598
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,224
I'm actually just updated the skill there in case you have them

599
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,760
So you can actually

600
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:58,784
Now just

601
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,112
Hey nucleus call kids bedroom

602
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,392
And it'll do it

603
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:06,208
Which is nice cuz before he had to touch it to make that

604
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:13,120
Do you know the price on this the pre-orders are already done so I don't know what this went for the pre-orders were too

605
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:16,960
$2 for single switch up to 350 4 for switch

606
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:18,496
Yeah

607
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:21,824
And I think the pre-orders had

608
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:23,104
$20 off

609
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,408
Now this won't be available so here comes

610
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:28,480
The cracks you guys

611
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:29,760
It is

612
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:33,856
Not going to be available again for sale until late

613
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:35,136
2017

614
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:39,488
So when we find out that it is for sale again and maybe he'll send a review unit

615
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:40,256
Who knows

616
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,024
Kevin

617
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:43,072
I won't make you do any more light switches

618
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:48,448
That is this product so if you're interested in lighting

619
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:53,568
If you're listening to this

620
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:55,104
Time for some device

621
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:56,128
Updates

622
00:26:56,896 --> 00:27:00,224
I talked last week about the Logitech Harmony which I purchased

623
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:03,808
And I purchased it

624
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:05,344
For the stupidest reason

625
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:06,880
Or the most brilliant

626
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:07,904
And I'm not

627
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,720
Excited yet basically I wouldn't

628
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:14,816
And you know you know modern TVs if you got a receiver you got you know

629
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:19,424
Afro to wear a DVD player and all the stuff I wanted to turn it on

630
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:21,984
So now I can say

631
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,520
Shiva shall not be named

632
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:25,056
Turn on television

633
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,080
End

634
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:26,848
Everything turns off

635
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:29,152
I can say turn on Netflix and we could all the way

636
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:32,224
So I had some trouble setting it up

637
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:33,248
But I don't

638
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,576
I think it was just a glitch

639
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:41,952
But nobody Logitech they were very good on the customer support side night I went through normal customer support

640
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:48,608
And I basically uninstalled everything reset everything from my router all the way down to

641
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:51,424
Turn out the light reflecting and uninstalling the app on my phone

642
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:52,960
And then read it

643
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:53,984
And I will tell you

644
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,288
It has gotten a lot better we actually

645
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:59,104
400th episode I went back and listen to it like

646
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,896
Some of our final episode

647
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,712
Play podcast in

648
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:07,552
Particular episode that I listen to a Logitech Harmony

649
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:10,368
Oh geez that's funny

650
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,416
A lot has changed so

651
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:13,440
The

652
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:15,488
Logitech app actually

653
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:19,072
Send a text a lot of the devices on your home network so you don't even have to set

654
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:23,168
You do have to you know like we said on that previous episode

655
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:26,752
The database is key so all I did was insert the model numbers of

656
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:28,288
My devices

657
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:33,664
And I ran into some trouble because it only allows for 8 connected devices

658
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,432
So

659
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:40,576
Have more than that that work with this thing so I had to make a call so I made the call to only have it be my

660
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:43,648
My television stuff and then a Sonos speaker

661
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:46,976
Because of my sister my receiver so it's kind

662
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:53,888
But I can't actually tell it to play certain songs on the Sonos I can only tell it to start up and it'll play my

663
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:55,424
Right

664
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:59,520
It is still nice to get the receiver

665
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:03,104
Direction control

666
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:06,688
That was a lie

667
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:13,856
Is a much better experience is much cleaner they've done a great job in their Echo skill is really phenomenal.

668
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:15,136
Because you link the skill

669
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:17,952
And you actually get the choice of like

670
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:23,072
It offers you multiple sayings that it thinks will work for what you're trying to do

671
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:23,840
The call

672
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:26,400
The things you're trying to do activities so it's like

673
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:27,936
Return on television

674
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:28,704
It's like

675
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,776
Turn on television and turn on TV and I'll let you know

676
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:33,568
You can even create

677
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:34,848
Amateur

678
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:38,688
So that way you don't have anything say multiple ways which is good

679
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,224
So

680
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:40,992
All in all

681
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:42,016
Yay

682
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:44,832
So I got a product update

683
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:49,184
Hitch all right then Stacy has no idea what I'm about to say I didn't tell her

684
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:49,952
In advance

685
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:50,720
Self

686
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:55,584
I mentioned last week that we got last week or two weeks ago we got a June oven

687
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:58,400
And I'm bringing this up for a couple reasons why

688
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:01,728
People should know that we put our money where our mouth is we both bought

689
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:02,752
I do not but I mean

690
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:08,384
When do you know if it's not working

691
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,992
Yeah yeah so I wanted to give a quick update and tell you how

692
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:16,576
This is being troubleshooted and what's being done about it

693
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:17,856
So basically

694
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:19,392
2 days ago

695
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:21,184
You haven't started freezing up like

696
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,744
Not literally cuz it's nothing nice box

697
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,024
But the display widget

698
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:25,792
Freezer

699
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:26,560
Time

700
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:28,864
Left to cook would you stop

701
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:32,448
Anime what's going on here don't know I'm so

702
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,776
We couldn't even turn it off

703
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:36,800
So

704
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:41,664
We were able to continue cooking cycles and so on so forth any more and more often

705
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:46,272
In addition to that and this may have been from day one I do not know

706
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:51,136
The one of the four ceramic heating elements at the top of the furthest back one

707
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:52,416
I noticed wasn't

708
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:55,488
Lighting up even when it should be on it and even when the app

709
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,816
Does the app tells you which elements are on which fans are on all that

710
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:01,120
The Apple showing it was on

711
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:02,144
But it wasn't

712
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:04,704
So I'm like that's really interesting

713
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:07,520
I did what I should do I

714
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:12,128
Reach out to support I just did this yesterday in fact yesterday morning and explained what was going on

715
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:17,504
And the support Folks at June oven I got to be honest I've been fantastic now.

716
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:23,904
I didn't say ideas podcast I didn't say we're working like that to them as far as I know I'm just regular customers

717
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:25,440
Just wanna put that out there

718
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:27,744
Try and pull anything special

719
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:35,168
They asked me a bunch of questions they also asked me for the serial number so that and my permission to look at the logs

720
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:36,704
Because the thing runs

721
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,264
Connected with Wi-Fi

722
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:45,920
They checked the logs they could really see that the element was not working and I'm not surprised because the

723
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:51,808
What's showing that it was working as well so they asked me to take some pictures of it and I put on broil and take a picture and sound

724
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:53,600
I did all that no problem

725
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:54,624
And

726
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:55,648
They

727
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:58,464
Said seems like a hardware issue

728
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,000
Sears return label

729
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:04,096
Pack it up and original packaging which I still had cuz there was a hundred day no questions asked

730
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:06,144
Florentine all return policy

731
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,680
And they've already

732
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:08,960
Shipped out a new one

733
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:12,544
Did not put a hold on my credit card or anything which I'm amazed for

734
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,824
$59 Prada

735
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:17,152
Simon and the way back

736
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:19,456
Wow I'm sorry you had that occur

737
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:20,224
Experience

738
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:21,760
I'm glad that they were

739
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:24,064
Careful in nice to you about it but

740
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:30,208
Here's the thing I mean you and I are early adopters and our families have to put up with

741
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,232
Right

742
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:33,536
I can only speak for my family

743
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:37,376
But my family is often frustrated by my earlier adopter

744
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:39,424
Product purchases and so on so forth

745
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:41,728
I would imagine you get a little that as well

746
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:43,520
You should have seen me the TV wasn't

747
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:45,824
Okay

748
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,104
But here's the thing

749
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:48,640
My wife

750
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:51,968
Is not upset about this at all which I'm shocked

751
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:53,504
I'm shocked

752
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,296
She said she really likes this

753
00:32:55,808 --> 00:33:00,672
It's working well when we was working it works fantastic I had some of the best food

754
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:02,720
So

755
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:04,256
She's like okay

756
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:07,072
Alright let's see what happens

757
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:08,352
At normal she be like

758
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:12,192
Send it back get your money back I told you not to buy that thing or whatever did she say

759
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:14,496
Not this time I'm really surprised

760
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:16,544
I can only say that

761
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:22,688
I'm sorry this is happening but my husband would be the same way there's only there's very few devices that

762
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:24,480
She actually loves in our house

763
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:27,296
The junas win the echo was another

764
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:29,344
MyQ garage door

765
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:31,136
Everything else

766
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:32,928
Well he likes me

767
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,768
Really everything else can just

768
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:44,448
We have four Echoes and I'm the only one that uses

769
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:46,496
Everyone hates talking to me

770
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:47,776
So

771
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:53,408
They really don't Embrace many of the products so that's

772
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:56,480
Probably why I have a separate office and they just leave me alone with the door shut

773
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:58,528
But this is an exception

774
00:33:58,784 --> 00:33:59,808
So awesome

775
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:01,344
That is a wonderful note to end

776
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,624
And on Kevin

777
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,184
Thanks for spending your morning with me here and

778
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:09,024
Please stay tuned for

779
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,072
Luis Arias kibbutz

780
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:12,608
Of augury

781
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:16,960
Who's going to talk about what it means when everything becomes a service and how

782
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:20,544
Startups can take advantage of that and what it means for big businesses

783
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:22,848
Before we get to sorry though

784
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:23,872
We're going to take a

785
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:24,640
Rake

786
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:28,736
Message from our sponsor

787
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:35,136
Hey everyone we're taking a break for the podcast for a moment for a message from our sponsor this week sponsor is

788
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:35,904
Then dance

789
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,720
And I have Brian told her again to talk about

790
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:41,024
Spin dance and first Bryan

791
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,560
Can you remind everyone with

792
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:43,328
You guys do

793
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,120
Yeah spin dance

794
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:49,472
Develops and builds iot software for Fortune 500 organization

795
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:51,008
Buy Kwikset locks

796
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:52,800
Whirlpool and Ford

797
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:57,920
And we also work with smaller manufacturers and startup we don't just build the software we also host

798
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:02,528
We have a dedicated team that designs and supports infrastructure for iot products

799
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:07,136
So let's talk about this infrastructure what is so unique about designing and hosting a

800
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:08,160
Infrastructure for

801
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:12,768
It's very familiar to anybody who's done any cloud

802
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:19,168
Posting a lot of the best practices in the principles are the same but the fact is winter starting to deal with physics

803
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:25,568
Google devices that can really drastically change the equation for updates cross embedded cloud and mobile

804
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:31,712
Can be tricky and it's definitely a place where you want expert help debugging IRT problems is another important skill to have

805
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:38,112
We recently Tree hours to prominence fanfiber vendors including multiple cell phone providers it was a really tricky to

806
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:44,256
To get to the bottom of what was going on that's not something you typically see which is cloud-based software

807
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:47,328
So what are some common mistakes you see organizations

808
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,376
We see a lot of cloud-to-cloud

809
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:51,936
Free sample six months ago integrated

810
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:55,008
The Nest thermostat with whirlpools Jenn-Air oven

811
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:57,312
Kind of cloud

812
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:58,848
Occasionally quite challenging

813
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:04,480
Secondly we see a lot of organizations making mistakes estimating their ongoing infrastructure costs

814
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:06,784
Especially around integration and regression

815
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:12,416
And we see a lot of companies trying to use their internal it team to manage their iot products

816
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:18,304
Which we think is an anti pattern we really think you need a dedicated team focused on iot

817
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,352
Why do companies need that dedicated

818
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:27,520
The organization's we've seen be really successful iot use a product development mindset

819
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:30,080
Connects not typically the mode of operation

820
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:31,360
Nit group

821
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:37,248
RX station hosting team work side-by-side with our developers in their customers and they kind of have that natural

822
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:41,088
Psychedelic mindset that you really need to make great iot decisions

823
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,928
So if people have questions where can they learn more about spin dance

824
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:46,208
Angular services

825
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:46,976
Including

826
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:47,744
Hosting

827
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:50,304
People can download a free white paper

829
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:03,104
Thank you

830
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:07,712
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham

831
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:09,504
And today's guest is SAR

832
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,272
Jaskiewicz

833
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:11,552
Who is

834
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:14,368
Founder and CEO of a company called

835
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:18,208
I'm doing great thank you

836
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:21,536
Glad to be here I am super excited to have you on the show

837
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:23,584
What we're going to do

838
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,864
Who is first

839
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,400
I'd love for you to tell everybody

840
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:27,424
What artery does

841
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:30,496
Should we listen to machines

842
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:35,616
And based on the noise that they may you can tell if you're working properly used to have them a function

843
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:39,712
And even what type of malfunction they have so we're kind of like Shazam

844
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:40,480
Four machines

845
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:41,760
I like that

846
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:44,320
How do you guys

847
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:47,392
Listen to stuff is it is it

848
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:49,440
Put their phone up next to it is there like

849
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:51,744
How does that work

850
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,304
So we actually have two ways of asking to machine

851
00:37:54,560 --> 00:38:00,704
Our first product was a portable diagnostic tool that connects a vibration sensor to the ticket

852
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,520
Ignition iPhone or Android device

853
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:08,128
And he basically walks up to the machine attaches the sensor with a magnet

854
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:09,920
Wait for a couple of seconds

855
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:10,944
And then he gets

856
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,224
The results on the spot

857
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:15,296
I will also have a continuous monitoring solution

858
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:18,112
Where we leave the sensors on the machine

859
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:20,928
We connect that to the internet and then can give

860
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:24,000
Continuous feedback and alerts if anything goes wrong

861
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:26,304
Basically what you're doing is listening to

862
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:30,400
And you developed an algorithm that can basically tell

863
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:32,448
Howa malfunctioning

864
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:33,472
Machine sounds

865
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:37,824
Straight correct so he's amassed a huge malfunction dictionary

866
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:38,592
If you will

867
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:41,152
Of how different malfunction sound in

868
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:43,200
The machines across the focusing on

869
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:44,992
I will check that are pumps fans

870
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,272
Compressors

871
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:48,064
How did you guys get

872
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:51,392
Definition of chicken leg of every machine learning

873
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:54,208
Right I was out

874
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:56,000
Therefore you don't have any customers

875
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:58,048
Amazon customer service have any data

876
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,144
What we initially did is we partnered with the largest maintenance company

877
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,168
In our Market

878
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:05,216
And had their

879
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:06,240
Ignition

880
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:07,008
Start recording

881
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:09,312
And then we manually

882
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:10,080
Analyze

883
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:11,872
This machine

884
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:13,152
And built the diction

885
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:16,992
That's awesome so how did you build trust with that part

886
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:18,272
Because that is

887
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:19,808
Like you explained

888
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,624
Crux of any sort of startup

889
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:23,648
That's kind of

890
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:24,928
It's a very hard

891
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:25,696
Salt

892
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:29,024
We were lucky to have good partners that are forward-thinking

893
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:34,400
And really wanted to see how technology can improve and and frankly disrupt lyrics

894
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:35,168
Market

895
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:36,448
You guys are

896
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:38,240
Israeli machine learning

897
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:41,312
So when you reached out to these guys did you have

898
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:42,080
Is your company

899
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:44,128
Already did you know what you were going to do

900
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,688
We spent the first two years of the company

901
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:47,456
Bootstrapping

902
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:51,808
And because both of us come from the technology side from engineering backgrounds

903
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:54,624
We built the first prototype by ourselves

904
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:57,696
So when we approach this customer we already had something

905
00:39:58,208 --> 00:39:58,976
Adipose work

906
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:02,560
That connected vibration sensors to an iPhone

907
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:05,120
Send the data to work to the cloud for servers

908
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:08,448
Where we analyzed it and returns a result of the phone

909
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:13,312
Got it and I'm excited about with the internet

910
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:14,336
Is that it

911
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:16,640
Basically

912
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:19,200
We got cheap analytics cheap computer

913
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:23,296
So we have this ability to take information in a scale that is

914
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:25,344
For the impossible

915
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,648
And I think that's really going to change the world

916
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:28,672
So

917
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:31,488
How did you guys kind of come to this idea

918
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:32,768
Why is now the right

919
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:34,048
To do something

920
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:36,608
The iPhone changed ever

921
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,936
So two major trends that happened over the past

922
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:40,704
5

923
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,728
Years is

924
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:45,568
First every technician now has a supercomputer in

925
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:46,592
Pocket

926
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:48,384
Which we can leverage to do

927
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:50,688
Some of the Computing as well as

928
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:51,712
User interface

929
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:53,248
And the second trend is

930
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:54,784
Cloud computing where

931
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,552
As you said

932
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:57,344
Computing became very very cheap

933
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:59,904
And storing data became very very

934
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,184
Cheap as well

935
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,720
These two

936
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:06,048
Abilities or capabilities just didn't exist 5 years ago

937
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:08,864
And now is the time to really connect

938
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:12,448
Everything you can and monitor every Spencer and every

939
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:13,216
Signal

940
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:16,032
In order to create insights from Alta Strada

941
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:18,080
What is changing here and what is the end

942
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,920
So that the end goal is to provide insights

943
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:22,944
Sinatra.

944
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:23,968
So

945
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:26,784
For us to be able to tell the user

946
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,320
The technician or the

947
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:30,624
Reliability manager if you do not

948
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:32,160
Replace this bearing

949
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:33,440
Over the next quarter

950
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:35,232
Your machines Nitro breakdown

951
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:37,792
April cost you this much to repair it

952
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:39,584
Alright

953
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,608
Today

954
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:44,448
Some sensors are wired into a building management system

955
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:45,728
But most of the sensors

956
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:47,264
Uneven wire to that

957
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,032
So you haven't

958
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:51,104
Technician going through the morning and evening crowds

959
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,895
And just looking at all these

960
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:54,687
Data points

961
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:57,759
Temperature pressure and not even walking

962
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:00,319
So you can't create inside if you don't have

963
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:02,111
If you don't have the backlog

964
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:03,135
Behavior

965
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:04,159
The history of the behavior

966
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:05,695
How do I know

967
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:07,231
What track

968
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:07,999
Insulting

969
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:09,535
Heavily industrialized

970
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:11,583
You guys obviously are optimizing

971
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:14,911
Around noise but there's also

972
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:21,311
Or heat sensor anywhere and make meaning from the date overtime and

973
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:25,151
How do you know which one you should choose So today we're focusing on

974
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:26,431
3 sensor

975
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:28,479
I want is vibration II

976
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:32,575
Ultrasound we also have a temperature and magnetic and

977
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:39,231
Well we chose these for sensors because they give us the best value for the least expensive

978
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:40,255
System

979
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:42,047
Right over time

980
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:44,351
As we gain more and more Exodus

981
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:45,631
Into the machines

982
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:48,447
They working with the OEM filter manufacturers

983
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:49,727
We want to use

984
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:50,751
All the day.

985
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:54,591
We can have existing sensors we want all that data

986
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:55,615
To give better diagnostic

987
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:59,711
So don't they want to do this themselves why would they come to you

988
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:02,527
Companies are amazing at

989
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:07,135
Designing and building mechanical systems using very traditional tools

990
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:09,695
But they don't know how to connect sensors to the internet

991
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:11,743
They don't know how to store

992
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:14,559
Petabytes or zettabytes worth of data

993
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:17,119
I don't have the algorithmic abilities

994
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:19,423
To design and run the algorithms

995
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:29,407
I feel like there's a huge value-add for you guys that you are a neutral party is supposed to lock it locked inside

996
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:30,175
1 Bender

997
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:31,711
Correct so if

998
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:36,831
You know if you look at a more complex machine even not even enough time for a fan

999
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:38,367
You have the motor supplier

1000
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:45,023
Right you have the fan supplier you have bearings have a lot of different components and if we are able to work

1001
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:46,047
All of them

1002
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:48,607
We can give a holistic view of the machine

1003
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:50,143
And provide the best eggnog

1004
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:51,679
Other possible

1005
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:56,031
Insights are going to be the huge kind of value-add

1006
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:59,103
In the industrial world

1007
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:02,431
What happens to companies that have historically

1008
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:03,967
Mayday equipment

1009
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:06,271
Which singers are interesting Trent now

1010
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:08,831
Which is very similar to software-as-a-service

1011
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:10,111
Are we called

1012
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:12,927
And it started in the very high-end marker

1013
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:14,975
Queso in jet engines

1014
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:16,255
White Rolls-Royce

1015
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:18,303
Stop selling jet engine

1016
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:20,095
Start selling flight hours

1017
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:22,911
That you have there is that most they can get

1018
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:23,935
Better margins

1019
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:27,775
On the spare parts and the aftermarket services

1020
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:28,799
Then they could

1021
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:29,823
By selling

1022
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:30,591
Add equipment

1023
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:32,895
And we see the same trend

1024
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:33,919
Going down Market

1025
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:35,455
I told you they're in

1026
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:37,247
In Chillers which are the more

1027
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:38,783
Expensive piece of equipment

1028
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:43,903
But we expected to reach all the way to Clemson fans and eventually maybe even two

1029
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:45,439
Washing machines and refrigerators

1030
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:47,743
So the oems are looking for ways to

1031
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:50,047
Preach

1032
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:51,839
And sell more services

1033
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:54,143
And they need to rely on technology in order to

1034
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:59,007
Biscuits into this idea of everything

1035
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:02,079
So how does that change the value chain

1036
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:03,871
For providers

1037
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:05,663
And even the buyers

1038
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:10,527
Paso doble yams should look at the value chain today you have the

1039
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:12,831
Original equipment

1040
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:14,367
Tribution chain you have the

1041
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:15,647
Service companies

1042
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:17,439
And then you have aftermarket

1043
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:18,463
Parts

1044
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:19,743
The OEM One

1045
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:20,767
To own as much as

1046
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:21,535
They cancelled

1047
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:25,887
And this may mean that independent service companies

1048
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:28,959
Will have to consolidate with a larger OEM server

1049
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:31,775
As well as the distribution channels

1050
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:34,847
Because this is what is the big kind of

1051
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:38,431
Conundrums I see as the OEM start

1052
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:40,735
Hey I want to offer this as a service

1053
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:43,039
And they don't want to piss off their distributors

1054
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:44,575
Too much because they also have

1055
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:45,343
This lovely day

1056
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:46,111
Just that his

1057
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:54,815
How did the Distributors and the service companies who are servicing these this equipment

1058
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:57,119
Look at this kid how do they find their own belly

1059
00:45:57,887 --> 00:46:00,447
It's a great question I think we'll need to see how the market

1060
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:01,471
Lights out

1061
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:06,079
And innocence it's not that different from what we see in the automotive in the

1062
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:08,639
Right eye with autonomous car

1063
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:11,199
GM is working on their own fleet of cars

1064
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:12,479
Have together with Lyft

1065
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:16,319
Is working on autonomous athletes as well

1066
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:18,623
So this notion of

1067
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:19,647
Transportation

1068
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:20,415
The service

1069
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:22,975
Is very similar to coolangatta serve

1070
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:25,023
Right on the market

1071
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:27,839
Now we're moving forward in this

1072
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:30,143
Concept new value chain

1073
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:31,167
Basically

1074
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:34,495
Where is a company that provides algorithm

1075
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:38,079
Yeah so by being a jerk party that works with

1076
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:39,103
Are all these

1077
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:41,919
Manufactured

1078
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:44,223
We are impartial

1079
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:47,551
And then we can transfer Knowledge from one market

1080
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:48,319
The other

1081
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:49,855
Boss on the algorithm

1082
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:54,207
Night if we see something working

1083
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:55,999
Which Sans weekend

1084
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:58,047
Shareit with the pump

1085
00:46:59,327 --> 00:46:59,839
And

1086
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:00,863
Hopefully

1087
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:01,887
Will be able to

1088
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:03,679
Build an open platform

1089
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:05,471
That's what moves the whole Market

1090
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:07,519
Okay so

1091
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:12,127
The future being I am an oem so I actually make

1092
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:15,199
I have another role which is

1093
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:16,735
Insight

1094
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:17,503
Delivery

1095
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:22,879
Which is actually tell customers

1096
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:27,231
Useful information but you can also give information back to OEM about how to make

1097
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:27,999
Better products

1098
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:29,535
And then you have

1099
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:31,327
A customer so it's a little bit more

1100
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:36,703
When we look at working with OEM we want to work with him over the

1101
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:38,751
Stages of the product life cycle

1102
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:41,311
ISO initially in the research say

1103
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:42,591
Would help them

1104
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:43,615
Define

1105
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:45,407
The right sensors and

1106
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:47,455
Placements of the sensors

1107
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:50,527
We find you the algorithm for this

1108
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:51,551
Product

1109
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:55,647
Then factoring line will give the much better quality control

1110
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:58,975
So if they can run these tests on the manufacturing line

1111
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:01,023
They can identify a lot of the malfunction

1112
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:03,071
This would have happened during the war

1113
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:05,887
I did then they can save a lot of

1114
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:06,911
Operational cost

1115
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:09,471
The third step you know once

1116
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:11,775
In the Wild on the customer

1117
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:12,543
Sites

1118
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:13,567
We

1119
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:14,847
Keep monitoring this

1120
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:16,895
Operating the algorithm

1121
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:18,943
To get better and better Diagnostics

1122
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:20,735
But as just said

1123
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:22,271
We also track

1124
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:23,295
All of these

1125
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:25,087
Taylor statistics

1126
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:26,623
As well as

1127
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:27,647
Usage pattern

1128
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:29,439
And then

1129
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:31,231
OEM can take this

1130
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:34,047
When designing

1131
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:38,399
And this brings us back to the research base

1132
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:40,703
It seems like you guys would be a better fit

1133
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:42,239
For a service

1134
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:47,359
Media service company that provides

1135
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:48,383
Services to

1136
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:51,967
What happens if the aftermarket

1137
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:55,039
When everything's a service is the OEM one at home

1138
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:56,063
The actor Mark

1139
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:57,087
Parts

1140
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:01,183
For sure that's where they seem or most of the margins today

1141
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:03,487
And they want to login

1142
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:04,511
Customer

1143
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:07,327
Longer contract

1144
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:08,351
Swarthmore

1145
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:09,119
Value

1146
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:11,679
Okay so in this Brave New World

1147
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:14,239
What is that mean for your company

1148
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:18,335
You've only been doing this for five years but

1149
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:19,871
Everybody's thinking about the

1150
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:20,639
Best cell

1151
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:26,271
Building a large company that will be sustainable and independent

1152
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:27,807
We're starting with

1153
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:29,855
The commercial

1154
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:35,487
Air conditioning Market but our goal eventually has to be inside everything that has

1155
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:40,351
And this could be your washing machine refrigerator dishwasher

1156
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:42,143
Even car right

1157
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:44,959
So we're really here to for the long run

1158
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:51,615
Insights not me

1159
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:52,639
Consumer

1160
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:55,711
Because I'm going to be buying my washing machine is a service

1161
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:01,343
Correct end up with

1162
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:06,975
Bright

1163
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:08,255
Hundreds of Millions

1164
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:09,535
Sumer's you just deal with

1165
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:11,071
Eight or nine Giant

1166
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:12,351
Manufacturer

1167
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:13,631
So wonderful

1168
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:19,007
Yes and isn't working very well what's next

1169
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:22,335
Do we have a couple of Marcus in mind

1170
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:23,615
Orc machine types

1171
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:26,943
Commercial

1172
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:29,247
Or industrial market and we're not going to there

1173
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:31,295
Consumer residential yet

1174
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:34,623
Kobe elevator

1175
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:35,647
Example

1176
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:37,183
The whole culture

1177
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:39,487
Wright Refrigeration in the factory

1178
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:41,791
Drink transportation of it

1179
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:43,071
Either

1180
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:44,095
Antrax

1181
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:45,375
Train tour

1182
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:46,399
Overseas

1183
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:48,191
It also has a very lucrative Market

1184
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:55,359
Okay elevators is a really interesting because ThyssenKrupp actually has an elevator

1185
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:59,711
Risky Business

1186
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:00,479
2

1187
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:07,135
I'm sure there's another elevator manufacturer

1188
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:14,303
In a situation like that

1189
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:15,583
Which is kind of a weird

1190
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:18,399
Well it's a good point that the elevator Market

1191
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:21,983
Switch to the desert service model

1192
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:23,263
Because there are more

1193
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:24,287
Expensive

1194
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:25,823
Require a lot of maintenance

1195
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:27,615
The way that we

1196
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:28,383
Yeah

1197
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:31,455
Is we want to work with these manufacturer

1198
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:34,271
So today they offer a service

1199
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:38,111
But if we can decrease their malfunctions by 75

1200
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:38,879
Percent

1201
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:39,903
Weekend

1202
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:41,183
Saving a lot of money

1203
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:47,839
So basically you'll be going to

1204
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:49,375
Already analyzing the data

1205
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:50,911
Salmista

1206
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:55,263
Crack of the question is what data are the analyzing

1207
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:58,847
How advanced are there Outlet

1208
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:02,687
So it's just purely better

1209
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:06,783
Magic Machine learning

1210
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:13,183
Machine learning understanding machine

1211
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:14,975
10/3 m

1212
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:20,095
So I can tell you the fact that you're not

1213
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:24,191
Operational data

1214
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:25,471
Look at mechanical

1215
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:29,311
I can see that.

1216
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:33,407
All right

1217
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:35,455
Latisse or anything else you want to tell me

1218
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:37,759
Another very interesting trend

1219
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:39,039
Is

1220
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:40,575
What happens to insurance

1221
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:44,159
When everything is continuously monitored and diagnose

1222
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:46,207
Yes and

1223
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:48,511
In a sense you can say that the OEM

1224
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:51,327
If they do move to this equipment as a service model

1225
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:52,863
They become an insurance

1226
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:55,679
Cuz they hold off the risk if anything goes

1227
00:52:55,935 --> 00:52:56,447
Bong

1228
00:52:58,239 --> 00:52:59,775
Not wanting to trade insurance

1229
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:01,567
Christine

1230
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:07,199
Moving from a annual rate and annual flat rate

1231
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:11,807
Actions that are based on the actual

1232
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:13,599
Dishes

1233
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:20,511
So if you're a Progressive auto insurance customer to get the small black box that measures if you're a safe

1234
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:24,095
And that just a few name on the side

1235
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:26,143
Or if you drive after midnight

1236
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:27,167
Raining

1237
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:28,191
You pay higher

1238
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:32,543
And very similar in our markets

1239
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:33,823
If you take good

1240
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:35,615
Care of your machines

1241
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:37,919
And they're inaccessible condition

1242
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:39,199
There is a lower risk

1243
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:39,967
A failure

1244
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:45,599
Therefore you will pay in the

1245
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:48,671
We want to become the standard

1246
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:50,207
Pipe for this data

1247
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:51,231
Oxford Insurance

1248
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:57,119
So you want to do this for insurance companies or do you want to do this for the OEM to help them build

1249
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:57,887
Insurance fraud

1250
00:53:58,399 --> 00:53:58,911
So

1251
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:03,775
From our discussions that Williams aren't interested in building Insurance product

1252
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:06,591
But if we are working with the largest oh yeah music

1253
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:08,383
Control 80% of the market

1254
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:10,431
We can very easily

1255
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:12,479
Turn the switch and

1256
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:15,039
Give this data to the insurance companies

1257
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:17,855
So they can sell their products today

1258
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:20,159
Okay well I look forward to this

1259
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:23,743
Brave New World of insurance

1260
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:28,351
You guys see such a huge Market

1261
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:30,143
I hope it actually comes to pass

1262
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:33,215
I used to be very excited about a raw data market

1263
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:35,775
And so

1264
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:37,311
Having an insight

1265
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:38,335
Developed

1266
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:40,895
I think that would be compelling

1267
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:42,431
Is the goal of

1268
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:45,759
Every Big Data or machine Learning Company

1269
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:46,527
How do you

1270
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:48,319
Take the raw data

1271
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:50,879
Transform it into knowledge and then into inside

1272
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:53,439
So why didn't the market

1273
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:54,207
Workout

1274
00:54:54,463 --> 00:55:00,095
Was it just that nobody knew what to do with it or if people just didn't want to share it but people are willing to share it exchanged

1275
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:03,423
So exactly that

1276
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:05,215
Your Facebook see

1277
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:07,263
Instagrammer

1278
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:08,799
Advertising or what not

1279
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:11,103
So much data out there

1280
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:12,639
But you get overwhelmed

1281
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:18,783
And we are putting our trust in

1282
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:20,575
Help you focus on what matters

1283
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:22,623
And it's not that different from what we

1284
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:25,695
Awesome

1285
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:28,255
