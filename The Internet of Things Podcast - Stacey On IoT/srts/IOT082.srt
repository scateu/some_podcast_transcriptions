Hey everyone welcome to the Internet of Things podcast this is your house

2
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:14,336
Stacey Higginbotham and this is your co-host

3
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:15,360
Kevin tofu

4
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:18,432
And today we have an amazing

5
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:24,832
We are going to talk about security for a bit on the Internet of Things We are going to talk about a brand new homekit certified light switch

6
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:26,880
The Amazon Echo has some new skills

7
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:33,792
We got some chips news for people and connected lock story from Kevin and a nucleus video in

8
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:36,096
Intercom system review from me

9
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:37,888
We also have an ad from

10
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,680
Hewlett-Packard Enterprise

11
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:42,240
And our guest this week is Andy Ellis

12
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:44,800
The chief security officer at a cup

13
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:46,336
So

14
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:47,360
Kickback

15
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:50,944
Stay tuned but wait just a moment for a word from our sponsor

16
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:57,600
The days of walking into a sports Stadium sitting down and watching a game are over technology is the fans

17
00:00:57,856 --> 00:01:04,000
Newest companion San Francisco 49ers vice president Sean kondu came to the arm techcon this week 2

18
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:10,400
Describe how his organization is leveraging mobile technologies smart networks iot Technologies

19
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:16,800
And software to revolutionize your in bed you experience streamline Stadium operations and build businesses are

20
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:18,080
Around those services

21
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:22,176
All right here we are let's kick it off with

22
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:23,456
Oh my God

23
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:24,992
Security

24
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:26,528
On Friday

25
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:28,064
Or lack thereof

26
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:32,416
It's not as bad as everyone thinks so here is the message from us for

27
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:34,464
Last week what

28
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,792
And was there was a massive distributed denial-of-service attack

29
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:39,840
Using open-source software

30
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:40,864
Found on the internet

31
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,888
It's called the Mariah

32
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,168
Chopper code

33
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:44,704
People used this

34
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,472
Create

35
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:46,752
A botnet

36
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:50,848
Comprised of a lot of network DVR cameras some routers

37
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:52,128
Some Critters

38
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:55,200
And a couple other kind of connected devices

39
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:57,248
It was a huge attack

40
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,016
It is

41
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:00,064
What are the largest ever seen

42
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:04,672
And these attacks represent a whole new wave like a whole new escalation

43
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:06,464
DDOS attack

44
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:10,816
These guys actually attacked died which is a domain name server

45
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:11,584
Service

46
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,376
Which basically accident address

47
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:14,400
For the internet

48
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,192
What happened is

49
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:17,728
A few people on the East Coast

50
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:22,848
Sabi popular sites go down because people couldn't actually access them using

51
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:26,176
All because it's being hammered by all these

52
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:26,944
Corinth

53
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,712
Iot device

54
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:30,784
The world

55
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,552
Mad

56
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:35,904
I was very mad being on the east coast and affected not once but twice on

57
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,440
It was Friday morning

58
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:41,792
Started out I couldn't access Twitter no big deal I can live with that but then my

59
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,840
Sony PlayStation Vue

60
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:45,888
TV streaming service that I use

61
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,472
Shutdown a problem with Amazon services

62
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:50,752
It was a mess

63
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:51,520
Heaven

64
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:52,544
Ground to a

65
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:55,616
Be wild and I wondered actually I wondered

66
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:57,152
Back on Twitter was finally back

67
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:59,712
I wonder how many people

68
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:03,552
Add iot issues and so many of those go back to the cloud

69
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:07,648
If they can't find their servers well that's a problem and some people actually didn't say

70
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,928
And that they had some issues

71
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,744
Yes actually August send an email to me

72
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,024
Explaining that

73
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,584
Their video doorbell was having problems because of

74
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:21,984
Here's the quick take and I've actually Our Guest is going to talk in depth about

75
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,264
So stay tuned for Auntie

76
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,568
And I've written about this

77
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,592
Basically

78
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:27,872
These devices

79
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,920
Have an open port to the internet

80
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:30,944
They're not

81
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,480
Your traditional iot

82
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:33,248
If Isis

83
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,528
They're basically Giant

84
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:36,576
Computers that have an open port to the internet

85
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:39,648
Your light bulbs are not really at risk for this type of

86
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:40,416
Attack

87
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,696
Because one

88
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:43,744
They don't directly connect to the internet

89
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:44,768
2

90
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:46,560
They don't have a lot of

91
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:48,608
Capacity and compute power to actually

92
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:49,632
Be useful indeed

93
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,216
Real perspective there for you guys

94
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:56,032
As part of this though I did decide

95
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:58,336
Hey we should really have a conversation about coyotes

96
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,616
Security that does more than like

97
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,944
And we

98
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,992
Like most companies are you asking about the

99
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,296
Restore York

100
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:08,576
It is accurate

101
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,344
Manor

102
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,672
You're like Shrek okay and move on

103
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:17,536
It's probably time to go deeper so I sent some emails out to companies like nest

104
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,559
Philips Hue

105
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:21,119
Ecobee Netgear

106
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,423
Chamberlain which makes the MyQ

107
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:25,727
WeMo SmartThings

108
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:26,751
And wink

109
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:29,311
To find out how they're handling security

110
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,871
We're not going to go into a lot of depth

111
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:32,639
Here

112
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:34,431
But I am going to post

113
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,199
This

114
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,735
In the newsletter that I do

115
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,015
Stacy knows things

116
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:40,063
So you can find out more about this

117
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,087
At a greater level

118
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,879
But the upshot was

119
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,927
These companies are actually doing it

120
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:45,695
A good job

121
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:51,327
Most of them have bug Bounty programs most of them are doing pentesting penetration testing

122
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,375
At least once a year if not

123
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,423
Almost

124
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:58,751
A lot of them actually monitor the status of their devices

125
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,799
Either if not through a direct

126
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,335
Network operations center

127
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:03,871
They do it through like

128
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,663
Heuristics on the data so

129
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,711
If the data is like a device stops

130
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:12,831
Recording they're going to notice if it starts behaving weirdly or group of them are they're going to notice

131
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:13,599
And take action

132
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:19,743
And I suspect we will find out when your newsletter comes out with the responses are I suspect however that their little bit

133
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:20,511
Better

134
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:23,583
At women they find a security issue that actual

135
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:26,143
Keep pushing software updates to your devices

136
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:31,007
As opposed to most of the devices that were used for this DNS outage

137
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:35,615
We're older and networked DVRs and such

138
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,663
That don't typically get updates

139
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,431
A large

140
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,711
Amount of them actually

141
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:41,759
Or built upon

142
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,807
Chips in a particular company as well

143
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,343
Yes and

144
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,391
A lot of them had hard-coded

145
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,439
Passwords which will talk about

146
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:51,231
I'll put it in the show notes

147
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:53,279
Also but I did a story for

148
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:56,607
Consumers basically telling you how you know if your device is hacked

149
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,143
How you know

150
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:02,495
Your what should you do and all of that and in some cases guys the news is pretty bad

151
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:04,287
It's basically you know

152
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,823
Set your device on fire and

153
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,615
Send it off into the great beyond

154
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:10,943
I can't I don't know if you talk about this

155
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:17,855
It in your story but I can tell you one thing I did immediately and that is I started monitoring the network traffic of

156
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,415
All of my devices when the outage was going on in my

157
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,975
Do I have any box here that are just

158
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:28,095
Turning in pinyin the DNS servers or what but I do not see anything out of the ordinary which was good

159
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:30,399
Yes and there are Port scanners

160
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:32,703
That you can use so that that'll be in there too

161
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:35,007
Yes monitoring your traffic is actually

162
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,615
Kevin you're so smart

163
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,895
I have a mind reader

164
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:41,919
Alright so

165
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:44,991
That's the security update news etcetera

166
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:48,063
Guys if you're buying devices from reputable vendor

167
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,391
And by reputable I mean they have a brand

168
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,415
You can Google them

169
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:54,463
Look for bug Bounty programs

170
00:06:54,719 --> 00:07:00,607
Look for them to make you change your password the over-the-air updates if you haven't upgraded your router in a couple years

171
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:01,887
My Geico do it

172
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,423
Why you'll probably get that

173
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:06,495
So

174
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:07,775
That's that

175
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,567
Let's go on to

176
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:12,383
Find product news because we know this is not going to make a

177
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,151
Stop buying today

178
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,943
Connected devices

179
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,479
Pish posh

180
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:22,367
But I thought I probably will not be by the next device that we're going to talk about only because it's

181
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,391
Homekit

182
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:25,439
Not really interested

183
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,207
Which

184
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:30,815
I'm not either but I did buy an iPhone and I'm setting up my own home kit setup so

185
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,095
Guys stay tuned

186
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,631
Cuz I could be a lot smarter about home

187
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:36,447
Core

188
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,215
You're going to love it

189
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,239
Or you're going to hit

190
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,567
Tell us about this light

191
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:44,383
So new product literally ages

192
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,479
Hit our inbox is working for the show we actually know about this when we were planning

193
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:52,575
Elgato has the new EVE light switch

194
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,367
449 95

195
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,695
It is homekit compatible as we mention

196
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:58,975
And what's

197
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:01,791
It's kind of interesting about this one too I think a lot of people cuz

198
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,327
Sweet without so much about Wi-Fi

199
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,143
This picture Bluetooth low energy

200
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,679
Percy Sledge so

201
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:08,703
That's

202
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:13,055
Eternally I don't wanna sleep earlier naked it would be unique in my house cuz I do not have many

203
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,335
Bluetooth devices so

204
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:16,895
You might be Stacy you might have more than I do

205
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:19,455
I actually don't in the reason I don't

206
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:21,759
Is because there's actually switchmate

207
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,551
Makes a really that's her

208
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,343
Make savory

209
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:29,183
Nice bluetooth light switch in the benefit here is

210
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:35,071
When you get a controllable light switch but two you can actually put the switch anywhere so if you got a switch in a hard.

211
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:35,839
Beach Place

212
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,375
You can just be like

213
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:39,167
Hey I'm going to screw in bluetooth light bulb

214
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,447
Apopka switch on the wall

215
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,471
Wala

216
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:43,775
So that is Handy but

217
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:47,615
Because Bluetooth mesh has not been super satisfying

218
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:50,175
The remote control on these things

219
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,479
Isn't great so

220
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:53,759
The light will work

221
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,295
The switch

222
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,087
In the light switch to the light

223
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:57,855
Is fine

224
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,135
Because they're usually Within

225
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,671
A wonderful trip close by

226
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:02,463
Read unless you're going to do some

227
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:04,767
Crazy like programmable light switch to turn off

228
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:05,535
All the lights

229
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,559
To your house witch

230
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:09,375
Is conceivable and other switches I don't know if you

231
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:14,239
But that sort of stuff gets a little iffy with Bluetooth

232
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,031
If you don't have a stronger

233
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,311
Mesh Network

234
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:21,407
So this is a product that I'm actually going to order it by so I can

235
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,175
Tested my new

236
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:24,991
Hit thing because everybody really is excited

237
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,271
Connected light switch

238
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:32,671
Elgato also makes the sensors the homekit sensors so they've got a water sensor temperature sensor

239
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:33,951
An air quality sensor

240
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:34,975
And

241
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:39,327
I went open close sensor isn't these actually I've tested those they work really well

242
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,351
So

243
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,887
If your home cat person

244
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,423
This is definitely device

245
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,703
You should look at

246
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,983
And if you do look at it

247
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,519
Let us know because we have

248
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,287
Tested it yet

249
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:53,151
One quick question for you if you're going to get one of these do you have an Apple TV 4 or an iPad

250
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,431
I do I have

251
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:58,271
So you could theoretically set up as a home hub

252
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,039
And then

253
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:03,647
Remotely control lights drunk episode

254
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,671
Is the Bluetooth

255
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:06,463
In the iPad in the Bluetooth

256
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,999
In the light switch

257
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,535
That's the question

258
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:13,119
All connectivity you only go so far

259
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:15,679
New Bluetooth will go further

260
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:18,751
And we'll have better Mesh networking and we are waiting for that

261
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,287
So Bluetooth 500

262
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:21,567
Awesome

263
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,335
Maybe

264
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,359
Okay

265
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,663
Next newspaper

266
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,967
Also in the consumer smart home side

267
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,759
The Amazon Echo

268
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,039
Has

269
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,063
Kind of exciting

270
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:36,159
I'm surprised it's taken as long

271
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:38,207
Is that Amazon has brought

272
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:44,607
The echo functionality to its low-cost tablets it's actually reminds me a lot of like Google Now goo

273
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:47,423
Google Assistant because you can tap and hold

274
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,727
A long press on the home button on

275
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:50,495
A

276
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,775
Fire tablet

277
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,055
And then speak

278
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:53,823
2

279
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,615
Your echo through the tablet

280
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:59,711
Electrical little pop up cards like I do with my Fire TV so like if I

281
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:03,807
Ask for the weather I can get a weather card on my TV using the Fire TV

282
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:06,111
It's very similar just now is down on the tablet

283
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,159
Okay and you could also

284
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,695
Used to be able to tell

285
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,487
The echo to send

286
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:12,511
Data to

287
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,559
Fire tablet and it would show up

288
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:15,839
Right

289
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,887
Right now it's now it's native that's okay

290
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:22,239
Got it okay in my big frustration though with this and I'm curious how this

291
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,007
How fast does a

292
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:25,055
Load cuz I I don't actually have anything.

293
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:27,103
Kick work with us I don't know if you tried it

294
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:27,871
Have you tried it

295
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:29,663
I don't have any fire tablets

296
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,967
Delete ride with my fire TVs

297
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:32,991
In which case it is

298
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:33,759
Quick quick

299
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:36,575
But I couldn't speak to the tablet implementation

300
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,599
Because the

301
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:38,623
We're going to have to say the name

302
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,159
The Earl

303
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:43,999
App

304
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,023
On my

305
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,327
Phone is really slow to load

306
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,375
I'm like Cinderella

307
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:52,959
And I don't know if it's my Hardware it's it's all so slow on my husbands iPhone

308
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,007
I don't know what's going on

309
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,287
I would like it to be

310
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:59,103
But I like this idea I love

311
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:04,223
Because sometimes you don't listening to like if you ask the weather for 10 days out that's good

312
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,247
Will be painful listen to

313
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,271
Yes

314
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:09,087
Sending data onto a visual device

315
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,879
Is really it like a no-brainer

316
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:11,903
So yeah

317
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:16,255
The Amazon Dash program also got a slight boost in some more

318
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:17,535
Colleen meeting list

319
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,071
6

320
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:25,215
They're 62 button so now they've got over 200 Dash buttons these are the buttons you press to automatically reorder stuff

321
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,239
And

322
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,519
People are happy

323
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:29,567
Amazon says what do they say

324
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:34,175
5 times more five times more purchases

325
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:36,479
In the last year or in the past year

326
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:39,807
A95x Pro 35 x growth and I believe

327
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:43,903
Last year they said like a purchase was being made every

328
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:49,279
13 seconds or something crazy like that so apparently people are using them how many we have

329
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,047
No idea

330
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,839
5x more than

331
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,631
Which makes sense there's a mass

332
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,399
Expansion

333
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,191
Not too loud

334
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:59,263
And there's 60 more Brands added to the dash buttons

335
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,055
So I can go over 200 brands

336
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:04,127
You know I look at the dash buttons every now and then I'm like

337
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,407
Is there a place in my life

338
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,943
One of these and so far

339
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:07,967
I haven't gotten

340
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:12,575
The only thing I reorder on a regular basis are these like toothbrushes for my dog

341
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,343
They're like

342
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:15,391
Little toothbrush igbos that smell like Punk

343
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,159
Kanpai

344
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:21,535
I like pumpkin pie

345
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:24,863
Ghetto maybe a state they put that on the dash I would be

346
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:25,631
Be like yes

347
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,911
But right now I just

348
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,191
Turn to

349
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,471
And I say

350
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:30,751
However

351
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,031
Please order more.

352
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,311
And

353
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,591
You really should have a

354
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:38,943
And maybe they do I know that I have been have programmable Dash buttons that you can get in

355
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,223
Do your own tinkering but

356
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:42,271
Why not have a generic one that

357
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,551
But you select

358
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:46,367
We're sign whatever product you want to it

359
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:49,439
I imagine there's probably control over the brand

360
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:51,231
And maybe

361
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,255
Amazon has tax

362
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:54,047
Keep the product in certain stock

363
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,839
Maybe in its warehouses

364
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:56,863
Could be

365
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:57,887
Could they make sense

366
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:01,471
I need a restore 3 record as well

367
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:02,495
Which is

368
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:04,287
And finally

369
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,823
Folks who have the Logitech

370
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:06,591
Harmony

371
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:09,407
You guys are going to be excited because now it's

372
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,943
Swiss the echo

373
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:15,551
So I don't need it to send that cuz I tell people used to do it

374
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:17,599
Well I used to use you know me

375
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:19,391
Which was the software

376
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,671
Spoke to you know me

377
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,463
Spoke to the

378
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:24,511
Harmony Hub that then spoke to the

379
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,279
The echo

380
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,815
And then by the speaker

381
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,351
Lots of things are then everything

382
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,119
Went back yet

383
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,423
So it was no as you know me

384
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:36,287
That was the order of operations there

385
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,567
And it worked

386
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,103
So you'd say something like

387
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,383
However

388
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:42,431
Netflix and chill

389
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,455
Lo and behold

390
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:44,735
But now

391
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,527
That is unnecessary

392
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,319
Other than I sing about

393
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:50,367
The yonomi software is its

394
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:52,159
It comes preprogrammed

395
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:54,463
It looks of the devices you have in suggest

396
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:55,743
Recipes for you

397
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:58,047
So if you don't want to program your own Logitech

398
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:04,191
We have chip news this week I am an arm

399
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,471
Techcon in

400
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,543
Clara I have a hard time with

401
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,311
Please Bay Area

402
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:12,383
City named some like I didn't send sub place

403
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,431
Sometimes I even get a

404
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,199
This time

405
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,015
It's actually good show

406
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,039
I saw

407
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:22,111
You know the plans that SoftBank has forearm

408
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,647
Witcher basically

409
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:25,695
It's a bet on there being a trillion

410
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:28,255
Connected devices by 20

411
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:29,279
23

412
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:31,327
Think of a DDOS we could do with that

413
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,351
Well but

414
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:34,655
These are low-power their arm

415
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:38,751
I know well the cortex the cortex a series could really do it now

416
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,799
DMC use notsobot

417
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,615
Arvest done a couple things so

418
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:48,991
Big number of devices Masa who is the chairman of SoftBank muscle saint preux

419
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:51,807
Ejected The Singularity it was really fun talk

420
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:52,831
And

421
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:54,111
Kind of talked about

422
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:56,671
How in this is with art this is

423
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:57,439
What Kevin and I

424
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,999
Excited

425
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:02,815
All of these cheap sensors are just getting

426
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:09,471
Better and better and cheaper and cheaper and we're going to use them for sillier and sillier things that are just going to change our lives and really unexpected

427
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:12,031
My favorite example from the show

428
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,311
Was

429
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:15,359
From arm CTO

430
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,127
Mike

431
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,663
Mueller who said

432
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,431
That

433
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,223
Someone was working on a

434
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:22,015
Smell sensor for

435
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:24,063
For people's underarms that would

436
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:27,135
Talk to their deodorant until it went to work harder

437
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,415
This is not a real Prada

438
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:29,695
This is an idea of a

439
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,231
But

440
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:33,023
The chips are getting better and cheaper

441
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:33,791
And one day we

442
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:34,815
I have something on

443
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,143
I don't want that

444
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:40,447
Wayback attack

445
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:42,239
But it was just an easy

446
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:44,799
Kevin is stinky right now

447
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:49,151
It doesn't just freaking sensor to tell me

448
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,711
Does bring up an interesting ethical things

449
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:55,039
Look at that person's data the physical data for

450
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,575
But I personally was very nervous

451
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:57,599
And smelly

452
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:59,647
So arm also announced

453
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,183
Really unique service

454
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,463
It kind of baffles me

455
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:08,095
They announced embed Cloud which is their partnering with an unnamed OEM

456
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,375
Call provider

457
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:11,167
Arm is built software

458
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:15,519
Basically handle the first layer of an iot Cloud which is device management

459
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:18,079
Getting the information from devices

460
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,615
And setting devices up on

461
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,919
And I'm just kind of like wow

462
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:22,943
I should come

463
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,223
Heading into the cloud

464
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:27,551
Really at a chip design company

465
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:28,575
Yes

466
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:30,367
The same because arm doesn't create

467
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:33,439
Chips as we all know so it actually could create this in big cloud

468
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:35,999
I'm scratching my head on my way to actually making out

469
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,303
Physical product if you can call the cloud physics

470
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,119
Product they're not hosting their own data

471
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:44,191
Did write their own software though

472
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:47,775
So it's based on some other there is Sansa in

473
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,591
How old is 6 slope an acquisition

474
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:51,615
Sin City

475
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,151
Sensitive sensitive

476
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:54,687
Remember 6lowpan

477
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:58,271
That's crazy.

478
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:02,879
I'm excited about this because it's a really interesting new

479
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:04,671
Business angle forearm

480
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:09,023
I told it's a SAS software-as-a-service kind of bottle so that's interesting

481
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,047
It's also a

482
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,839
Opportunity for them to go

483
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,631
Up the stack from

484
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,935
Not necessarily providing the hardware but

485
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:18,239
You don't getting pretty close to the hardware

486
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,007
And now

487
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,287
Going up

488
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,823
They say that customers

489
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:22,591
What

490
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:25,407
The ease of use they also say that the links to their

491
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:28,223
McLeod and McLeod and their trust Zone in

492
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:29,247
Crypto cell

493
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:32,831
Security stuff is going to be really important and customers want that

494
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:33,599
I want it from one

495
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:35,391
Wilson

496
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,695
I'm not convinced that this is like

497
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,231
A home run or anything but

498
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:40,767
Do you think it's a really

499
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:42,815
It's a logical step when you look at the

500
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,351
Business transformation

501
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:46,399
And we'll see if it's the right step

502
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,215
It's it's interesting because they

503
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:51,007
Obviously known for their computing

504
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:57,663
This is pushing computer a little bit to the cloud which is very unique for them butts other countries obviously have done

505
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:02,271
I agree it's a very logical thing for them to do I just I didn't think about it prior to

506
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:07,135
Central Time

507
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:09,695
Intel launch the new atom 4

508
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:11,487
Connected cars and

509
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:12,511
Gateway's

510
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:15,583
So until causes fog Computing Asda Cisco

511
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:18,143
This is basically the idea that

512
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,423
You'll have some computer

513
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:25,823
Cloud computing Edge in the middle of a Gateway where a lot of like your sensor data comes in and is analyzed

514
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,871
Why is right there and then it sends data back

515
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:30,431
Because it's just too far too expensive

516
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,711
To keep going all the way from

517
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,479
The device

518
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:37,087
Too slow too much latency especially for something like a car what you need instant

519
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,111
Paneer instant

520
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,159
And if it's

521
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:45,791
So Intel chip is ruggedized and it's low power for an Intel chip

522
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:49,631
And still very capable and it also has some of the deterministic

523
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:52,191
Teachers that that help enhance the safety

524
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:55,007
Robotics and autonomous driving kind of applications

525
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:58,335
So that way it looks a lot like the recently-launched arm

526
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:00,639
It was at the r52 architecture

527
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:02,431
The r52

528
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,967
So the r52 that we talk

529
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:04,991
About a cup

530
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:05,759
4 weeks ago

531
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:07,807
This feels like

532
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:09,343
This isn't hugely

533
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:13,695
You're surprising but it feels like we're starting to see a coalescing around

534
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:15,743
What we need in these kind of

535
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:18,559
Gateway devices and four

536
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:19,839
Autonomous cars in

537
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:22,911
That's so it's it's like oh everybody agrees that we need these

538
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:27,263
Where are T2 Kevin story Kevin it's story time

539
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:31,359
So it is not a very exciting story let's not build it up too much your butt

540
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:37,759
It actually illustrates the difference I think between having connected devices and actually having a quote on quote Smart Home

541
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:38,783
So many people put

542
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:39,807
These products

543
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:41,599
Into a house

544
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:42,623
And then

545
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:45,695
Don't take advantage of the smarts behind them whereas

546
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:47,231
I actually had to because

547
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:49,791
Quick story of my son comes in

548
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:52,863
After work sometimes 12 1/2 in the morning

549
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,143
Is not locking the door

550
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:58,239
Orange and then yesterday he went to work everybody was gone he went to work at 11 the morning

551
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:00,543
And we came home at 4:11 in French

552
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:05,151
And again they did not lock the door so we've got wide open house all hours of the day and night

553
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:09,247
And I'm like you know what I have disconnected a lock that Stacy sent me and I

554
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:11,551
Hamden hard over installing but finally did

555
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:12,575
And it really

556
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:14,879
Use it in an intelligent way

557
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:17,696
When this is a perfect opportunity so sure enough

558
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,256
I went to my Wink app

559
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,816
And I'm like oh I can just make a robot that says

560
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:25,120
Anytime that the lock

561
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:29,728
Is an unlock status for 5 minutes I just arbitrarily chose 5 minutes

562
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:30,496
Lock it

563
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:32,800
And it works like a charm and

564
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:36,128
Lock the door when they leave the house

565
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,920
The house will always be

566
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:40,224
Locked within 5 minutes on that so

567
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:40,992
Just a

568
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:44,064
You know handy little tip that think about your devices

569
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,624
And use them in a smart while use them to their potential

570
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,392
Joseph

571
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:50,976
This is great A lot of people in this is a perfect example of

572
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:56,864
This is how the smart home will eventually work but it's hard for people because people do not automatically

573
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:58,912
Think about all the things things can do

574
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,192
I will warn you though

575
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:02,496
Do not like go out to Garden

576
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:03,520
And

577
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:05,312
Forget your key or your smartphone

578
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:07,104
Because when I have Auto

579
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,408
I I had a lock that I had auto lock on

580
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,968
It was a little bit faster but it's still surprise me

581
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,248
Crappie like

582
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:15,296
Watering the plants Abednego into

583
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,320
Add to go into the house

584
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:21,696
Well that is a good tip but I'm actually covered

585
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:23,232
Because this lock is push button

586
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,024
It's got the keypad

587
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:28,864
Correct which we don't carry keys to the house we have the push button

588
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,424
I love it I think keypads are actually way better

589
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:38,080
And that's a Kwikset Z-Wave

590
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:39,616
Lock right

591
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:40,640
Correct that is

592
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:42,944
Easy quick set

593
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,968
Z-Wave lock

594
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:45,248
Power through the wink hub

595
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,064
You could also do something like this using smart

596
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:52,160
Alright my show-and-tell for this week

597
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:56,000
Is the nucleus this is a video intercom

598
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:56,768
System

599
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:59,072
Could I showed it to my husband he was like

600
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,096
I don't get the point

601
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:06,240
It's basically like a dedicated Skype client

602
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:08,288
Which is what they literally everybody says

603
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:11,104
It is like a dedicated Skype

604
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,128
Client accept

605
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,200
It also doubles as an echo of sore

606
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:17,504
It does not play your Spotify playlist

607
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:19,040
And it does not

608
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:20,576
Play Pandora

609
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:24,160
But other than that it can control your Hue Lights and

610
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:26,208
Do a lot of things that the echo.can do

611
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:29,024
So if you don't have one and you do have

612
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,048
A nucleus

613
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:37,472
This is a device that works better in pairs one is about $250 the other

614
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:40,288
If you buy two they're $200 a piece

615
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,336
And people by a median of

616
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:44,384
3 according to Jonathan Frank

617
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,152
Call the CEO

618
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:46,944
And that is because

619
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,016
They're using them to replace these old school intercom systems

620
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:53,088
It is actually really useful for this

621
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:53,856
So

622
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:55,392
We put one in

623
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:57,184
Are upstairs one in our kitchen

624
00:23:57,696 --> 00:24:00,000
We actually turned off the echo feature

625
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:01,536
And it's not cold

626
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:02,560
I love Auto

627
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,680
Consistent

628
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:12,288
Star Roamer future you can actually turn that off since we have an echo downstairs in

629
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,824
The kitchen we did

630
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,592
Turn the downstairs

631
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:21,248
But you can now we can now just when my daughter is upstairs pacing in my office or I'm up in my office working my husband needs to

632
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:22,272
Ask me where something is

633
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,552
Refrigerator he's just like

634
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:25,856
And you know it

635
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:28,672
You can set it up so it connects automatically

636
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:29,696
Four people within your name

637
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:33,792
It's like hello

638
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:34,816
Oh yes this

639
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:42,496
It does sound very much like Skype only if limited to your

640
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:44,544
Wireless network your own house is not like you could

641
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,104
Put one at the neighbors house and have a video chat with us

642
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:49,920
So you can

643
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:51,968
That's the other interesting

644
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:57,088
So now it's now it is interesting to me other place we have ours cuz we were at 3

645
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:58,880
Is my husband's office

646
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:02,208
So now whenever I want to talk to him

647
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:02,976
I just

648
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,512
Basically press the button.

649
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:05,792
There's a bun

650
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:07,840
The home screen looks like a button up all the

651
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:09,120
Call basically

652
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:11,424
And you go

653
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:13,472
I call my husband's office and

654
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:14,752
He's like why are you

655
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:18,336
But it's super fun and you cannot voice

656
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:19,616
Only if you were

657
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:24,224
And so grandparents you can give this to

658
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:30,624
Somebody wasn't text Abby it's very easy to set up on your network you basically set it up on your Wi-Fi network and then you enter a code that says your

659
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,648
You're part of this family

660
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,696
Family unit this nucleus

661
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:34,464
And it's

662
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:37,024
How to cool so the downsides are

663
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,304
Hear it outside

664
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:39,584
Things I'd like to see

665
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:42,400
One there's no missed call function

666
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:44,960
And maybe that's cuz I'm not thinking of it is it

667
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:46,496
An intercom truly

668
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:48,032
But I would kind of like

669
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,128
Purdue score

670
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:53,920
And

671
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:56,736
We had some issues with one of the devices

672
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:59,552
I don't know if this is representative it anything but

673
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:01,600
It just bricked itself

674
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:03,136
And then we had to restart it

675
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:03,904
And waiting

676
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,440
And it took a bit

677
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:06,208
To restart

678
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:14,912
Relatively minor issues are Kansai it's actually it's much more interesting to me now because it works outside

679
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:20,544
Another thing I just thought of it I'm guessing you can do this this would be an interesting feature to me

680
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,824
So Shaggy said you have it

681
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:24,128
The parents are grandparents house

682
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,432
Since you can set it up for Auto

683
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:28,224
Connect 4 Auto

684
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,528
Yeah

685
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:32,576
Yes auto answer

686
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:34,624
Could you theoretically use it as a

687
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:36,416
Remote monitoring tool

688
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:37,952
I

689
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,000
Auto answers

690
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:40,768
It doesn't

691
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:41,536
Have video

692
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,584
Sono Chi

693
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,144
Auto answers I believe it is just voice

694
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:47,424
Inow kind of

695
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,984
Oh there's one other thing though that's

696
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:57,920
That there's an app on your phone and that becomes part of your network to so when your aunt like I'm on the road right now but I

697
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:58,944
Call my daughter

698
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,224
Vici

699
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,040
So if I read my office

700
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:04,832
I said she heard it she can go answer it

701
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:08,160
We just established a connection without hurting a smartphone without

702
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:11,744
You know any effort on her part except answering a

703
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:13,792
If not it's a nice picture

704
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:14,560
So

705
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:15,328
I'm liking it

706
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:16,096
Kind of fun

707
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:18,912
Is it worth $200

708
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,704
In our house maybe not

709
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:24,288
But I can see setting up it would be worth

710
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,568
400

711
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,384
It'd be worth $100

712
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,408
Search for like a connection with

713
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:34,528
I think so

714
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:36,064
I will also say that

715
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,136
So if your family is TekSavvy maybe this isn't

716
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:40,160
Like the best for you

717
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:44,000
My mom for example I'm always like I have to call her

718
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:45,024
My mom will you get

719
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:45,792
Skype

720
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:48,608
Or I text her to like a mom let's do a Duo call

721
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,680
There is no spontaneity

722
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,728
And sometimes it's

723
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:55,264
How I would

724
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:57,312
Phone isn't plugged in

725
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,408
Skype's not on this computer right now because I doing something else

726
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:03,968
So this would be kind of fun for the

727
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,272
Yay

728
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:07,552
Okay so

729
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:09,856
That is the show for this week

730
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:10,624
Stay tuned

731
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,416
An interview on

732
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:13,696
Home Security

733
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:18,304
And iot security featuring Andy Ellis the CSO of Akamai

734
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:20,864
You're going to learn a lot of really good stuff in this

735
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:22,400
Or we do that

736
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:28,800
Let's have a message from our sponsor we are breaking into the Internet of Things podcast

737
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:32,896
With a message from our sponsor this week sponsor is Hewlett-Packard Enterprise

738
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:38,528

739
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:39,808

00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:44,928
Here with me today to talk about how HP handles analytics at the edge

741
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,256
Tom hpe has introduced a new product

742
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:50,048
Call The Edge line boxes

743
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,352
And they have 64-bit

744
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:54,400
Computing at the edge

745
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:55,936
Are these gateways

746
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:57,472
Juggernaut gateways

747
00:28:57,728 --> 00:29:03,872
And that is the the difference here in fact it's 64-bit

748
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:06,432
Which as you know is Intel's high-end

749
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:07,968
Architecture that we can play

750
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:14,112
Gateway category and we have products and sucked my competitors

751
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:19,232
Atom Processor sometimes

752
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:22,304
No processor

753
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:25,632
What will you need to do deep analytics fast

754
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:30,240
Then you need the horsepower of proving enterprise-class

755
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:31,264
Such as

756
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:36,384
64 Intel Xeon cores that we have and therefore we had to create a new product

757
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,920
Category

758
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:42,016
And that new categories called

759
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,296
Convert 70 system

760
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:47,648
And in that category we convert several things in a single

761
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:49,184
Environmentally hardened box

762
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:52,000
And that chassis or box is temperature

763
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:53,536
Shocking vibration pardon

764
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:56,608
Q64

765
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:59,424
230 lb

766
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:01,216
And this has something

767
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,032
In the same box it also houses

768
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:05,312
Data acquisition

769
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,616
And control systems

770
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:12,224
Call my partner National instruments in the same box and then we also converge

771
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,552
Hpe ilo integrated lights-out

772
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:16,576
Remote

773
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:17,856
Management psychology

774
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:21,952
Because again what's more remote than the other called The iot Edge

775
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:23,488
Listen products

776
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:24,768
Vines

777
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:26,816
Amazing benefits in his conversion

778
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:27,584
Also

779
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,400
Amazing benefits and its ability to do

780
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:32,960
Analytics that's normally reserved for the Datacenter

781
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:34,240
And you come fast

782
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:35,520
Because they're out of the edge

783
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:37,312
Freddy turn around time in the response

784
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:38,336
Candy

785
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:40,128
What's quicker and many times a meeting

786
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,920
Do I still need a Gateway box

787
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:43,200
In the scenario

788
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:46,784
The Edge line iot converge systems can do the job of a gateway

789
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:49,344
Wechat customer applications now

790
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,368
We have

791
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:51,136
A gateway

792
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:53,184
Connected to the iot convergence

793
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:56,256
So you guys are essentially putting a mini Datacenter

794
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:57,024
At the edge

795
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:57,792
Why

796
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:58,560
Do we need some

797
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:03,424
What's a good way to put it because it has tremendous high performance Computing capability

798
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,192
And

799
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:09,056
I need a quick example in the world

800
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:11,616
Artificial intelligence machine learning and cognitive

801
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:12,384
Computing

802
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:14,432
There's a notion of building the model

803
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:16,736
Machine learning applications

804
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:19,040
Takes a lot of CPU power

805
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:19,808
To build

806
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:24,928
The cloud has a sensor and it's shifting

807
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:26,208
Which such

808
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:28,000
Bill demott

809
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,584
Augmentin and run

810
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,704
The banlist the security issues the latency in the cost issues

811
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,984
Are eliminated when

812
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,264
All done at the edge

813
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:40,544
Oktap

814
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,848
Where can we find out more about Hewlett-Packard in

815
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:45,664
You can find more by going to our website

816
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:52,064
Hpe.com iot

817
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:58,464
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your house

818
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,744
Stacey Higginbotham

819
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,120
And today's guest we have Andy Ellis who is the chief security officer at Akamai

820
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:08,448
I'm doing fantastic

821
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:09,728
Sick today Stacy how are you

822
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,520
I am super great

823
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:13,824
I can't believe you're doing so fantastic

824
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,592
Play because

825
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:15,872
On Friday

826
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:17,664
The internet was under attack

827
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,224
I feel like you guys probably were noticing that

828
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,248
Had some opinions on

829
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,272
Yes

830
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:28,672
So we saw your the attack against dying it's worth noting that you're dying like Akamai Mini

831
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:34,048
Other companies your parts of the infrastructure that make up the internet and the web as we know it

832
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:36,864
Internet

833
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,448
It wasn't under attack the routing fabric with holding up fine

834
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,728
There were just a bunch of

835
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:44,544
Really popular websites that weren't available

836
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,848
The East Coast on Friday

837
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:48,640
So in the wake of this

838
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:49,920
Security researcher

839
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:52,224
Discover that once again this massive

840
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:53,248
Adidas

841
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,808
Distributed denial-of-service attack

842
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:56,832
Against

843
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:58,624
This actually was

844
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,904
Done by the sea

845
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:04,000
I don't know if it's the same organization but using the same source code that was used a couple

846
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:06,816
Weeks ago against you guys to attack

847
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:08,352
I think it was Brian Krebs

848
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:09,376
Website yes

849
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:14,240
Yep. There's the Mirai code which is used to build this botnet

850
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:18,080
Mostly of your network video recorder some other things in iot

851
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:21,152
Hard-coded default password

852
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:24,736
And we see some of the same devices showing up

853
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:26,016
In both the tax

854
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:28,320
That could be the same actors

855
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:30,880
It could be different actors now the source code is out there

856
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:33,952
And one of the things we have certainly seen in the past

857
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:38,560
Some other denial-of-service attack see when people are taking over WordPress sites

858
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:40,864
Is once it became well-known

859
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,168
Great source of botnet material

860
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:45,728
Lots of people in fought over that botnet

861
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:48,800
It would take different parts of it for themselves to go to attack

862
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:52,384
That's a pretty normal thing you see in the DDOS For Hire world

863
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:55,968
Okay so these people are basically they have a massive network of

864
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:56,736
Devices

865
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:57,504
They can use

866
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,784
The hammer someone servers

867
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:00,320
What you're saying is

868
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:01,856
Other people then

869
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:03,648
Take over parts of

870
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:04,928
They steal it okay

871
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:07,488
So it's Bots battling Bots

872
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:08,768
Effectively

873
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:10,304
I never seen a lot of

874
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,376
Scanning traffic in the background noise of the internet

875
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:15,680
People looking for machines to compromise

876
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,752
So let's get to these machines

877
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:21,056
I feel like everybody is attacking me

878
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:22,336
According to the Internet of Things

879
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:29,248
Really feels like it's a lot of these devices appear to be routers Network DVR cameras some printers

880
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:31,040
And they feel like things that maybe

881
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:32,832
But is it fair to

882
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,672
Call this The Internet of Things or should we maybe come up with better

883
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:37,696
Better terminology

884
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:40,000
So one of my calling

885
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:41,536
It's called it things on the internet

886
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:43,584
Which is probably a little more apropos

887
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:46,656
I like it how do we want to make a distinguishing lime

888
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,192
Two types of

889
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:54,592
So I'm not sure yet but I know where I draw the line between the things on the internet and the stuff that came

890
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:55,616
Before

891
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:56,384
Legal terms

892
00:34:56,896 --> 00:35:00,992
Is if we think about everything that came before it was always associated with an entity

893
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:06,112
You think about PCS or laptops or tablets is being tied to a human

894
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:09,440
We think about servers has been tied to some business venture

895
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:10,208
Oregon

896
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,744
Rupert coalition

897
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:13,536
And all the sudden you have these

898
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:16,864
People die they put on the internet and they abandon them

899
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:21,216
And they're really not part of a network Fabric and not a mess

900
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:25,824
It's not like your fitness trackers we have 85 things monitoring your health that are talking

901
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:30,432
We have these devices to just get plugged in and put on the internet

902
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:36,320
Really associated with the person that bought them maybe it's the network video recorder at your local convenience

903
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:37,088
Store

904
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:40,928
Maybe this is your home router that you buy a new drop-in

905
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:44,256
It's doing traffic all the time that has nothing to do

906
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:46,816
If it's human there's no human sort of behind it

907
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:49,120
And for me that's where we've does become

908
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:50,400
Mustang on the internet

909
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:53,216
I guess I had to make a hypothesis

910
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:55,776
For where Internet of Things takes over

911
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:57,568
Is this really where those become

912
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:59,872
Part of something greater than themselves

913
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:02,688
Turn objects the truly is Network

914
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:04,992
Not just in the TCP IP centos

915
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:07,296
Who was in the day of an application there as well

916
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:10,880
I like to see I was making a division based on

917
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:11,904
Things that were

918
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:15,232
Modern design to be updated over the air

919
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,072
As opposed to like older stuff that they're like oh that's connect this

920
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:21,376
And it's kind of directly connected to the internet

921
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:22,656
Maybe just go through a cloud

922
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:24,192
I like yours better

923
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:26,496
I think the reason that's an important

924
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:32,896
Extinction is not just about modern versus Legacy we are still seeing devices put on the internet

925
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:34,432
It look more like things

926
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:35,968
Just don't have this

927
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:40,064
Over-the-air updates is over the updates are updates is really hard

928
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:42,112
What makes these old devices

929
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:44,416
Sister just sitting out there and attach to any

930
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:45,696
So

931
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:46,720
Problematic

932
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:49,024
I think what makes some problematic kits

933
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:52,608
So first of all is the fact of their omnipresence on me

934
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:54,400
Network video recorder

935
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:56,448
You think about its functionality

936
00:36:56,704 --> 00:37:01,056
Is the ferry first version of the no network capability right you plug it in

937
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:03,872
You plug a monitor and keyboard and a mouse into it

938
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:05,920
And so you could look through all of your camera

939
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:11,808
Let's put this in the back room and we've got all these monitors everywhere

940
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:14,112
Searching for the web server on it

941
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:17,696
But it wasn't designed to be over the internet web server

942
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:21,280
MSA designed to be an amusing very liberal

943
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:24,864
I use of the word design apologizing software architect

944
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:27,936
It was really sort of Cobble together in many cases

945
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:32,800
He space and now it's there

946
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:35,360
Cassidy that just shows up

947
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:37,664
It is a fully functioning Linux server

948
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:39,456
You can login

949
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:40,992
You can do whatever you want

950
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:42,016
General purpose

951
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:43,040
Computer

952
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:46,368
No longer sort of very specific Hardware design.

953
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:47,136
Only do one thing

954
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:49,440
And that's where it starts to become a problem

955
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:52,000
Got it to send you have this massive

956
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:55,072
Capability that's no one no one is really paying attention to the

957
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:56,096
The to be harnessed for

958
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:57,632
All kinds of Shanaynay

959
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:01,472
Yeah as long as the cameras are still operating like

960
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:03,776
When a convenience store is going to notice

961
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:07,872
Well that brings me to my next question which is if I'm a consumer

962
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:09,152
How would I ever know if

963
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:09,920
Is my devices

964
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:15,040
Saudi really hard it's in that category of difficulty that moves

965
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:21,440
Small businesses and even medium businesses don't even look at whether or not their bandwidth is being used

966
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:22,720
To do

967
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:24,256
You have to do the monitoring

968
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:26,048
If I hold out of Hope

969
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,352
Why I'm fantastic

970
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:32,960
Wonderful idea if anybody wants to execute on it can totally take the switches

971
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:34,496
Parental controls

972
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:39,872
The monitoring software and Hardware that people to play for parental controls whether it's

973
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:43,200
Your Disney Circle or web nanny or any of these

974
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:47,296
Why does the opportunity to think of these devices as children

975
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:51,648
Adults and the way they use the internet changes

976
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,488
If I put a network video recorder in my home

977
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:01,632
It seems like the sort of thing that a small device that used to profile in traffic and preventing unauthorized uses

978
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:05,728
Would be wonderful and ensuring that I'm not participating in one of these.

979
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:09,568
Okay so I everyone should have some sort of software

980
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:11,104
It would be on their router that would

981
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:17,760
Possibly on your router's possibly as a home device I'm I got to order it circle from Disney

982
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:21,088
Cuz I got some Ayo to my house I'd love to filter out

983
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,112
There you go

984
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:23,136
Okay

985
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:25,952
So you wouldn't know accept it

986
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:26,720
Is being used

987
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:28,512
What can you do if

988
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:29,792
You do have one of these

989
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:32,096
Set it afire

990
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:34,912
Sadly that might be the best

991
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:36,192
Quotes for a couple of days

992
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:38,752
Do some of these devices that actually

993
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:41,568
Have hard-coded into their software the password

994
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,128
So it's not even as I can tell you to go in

995
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:46,176
And change the default password

996
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:53,344
Right and that means that it's written in the code the consumer can't change it it's just

997
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:55,136
A remnant of something

998
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:56,416
Can I say lazy

999
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:02,816
I don't like attributing malice or incompetence

1000
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:06,656
The people put the user authentication is really hard to do right

1001
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:11,776
And so once you start down the path of a will how would I do user authentication in this world

1002
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:15,872
Your building these devices here and going to business to your Kickstarter

1003
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:18,944
Are you going to ship devices out to all these people

1004
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,224
As soon as you say

1005
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,528
You don't want to have a default password

1006
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:25,856
What's the initial password on this device

1007
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:27,648
What are user opens up the box

1008
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:28,672
What is barracks

1009
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:29,440
Experience

1010
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:31,232
Now you could build something

1011
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:33,280
This says okay well it has to do autotune

1012
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:36,352
Discovery Inn connect

1013
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:37,120
Password

1014
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,472
Like it

1015
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:44,032
Impossible

1016
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:46,336
Right password management software

1017
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:48,896
Android user experience only friendly

1018
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:52,992
That's really what the Internet of Things is about

1019
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:58,112
Surrounding yourself with the internet in ways that makes your life better not worse

1020
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:00,416
Soda biscuits

1021
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:04,512
Sin 2 - what should I look for in the devices that I buy

1022
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:05,536
Basically

1023
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:07,584
There's no sticker in the box that says

1024
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,376
Hard-coded password

1025
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:11,168
Where

1026
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,192
So

1027
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:13,728
What are the types of

1028
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:14,752
Questions I should

1029
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:16,032
To be asking even a

1030
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:17,568
Honestly even as a reporter when I'm

1031
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:19,360
How do I curl them

1032
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:22,944
Tyson question number 0

1033
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:23,712
Is

1034
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:24,992
Is this a server

1035
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:29,088
Activate very different set of problems if you have a device that is only a client

1036
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,392
It makes connections out

1037
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:33,696
It does pulling together data

1038
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:39,840
Did you have if you have a machine that is running a TCP server that people could fit with connect to

1039
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:44,192
DP server into problems is where you are a service

1040
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:46,752
Do people can interact with because that interact

1041
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:49,568
If the only way you can interact

1042
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:50,848
Uconnect out

1043
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:52,384
I'm not saying you're perfect

1044
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,455
Solve a lot of challenges you have how do you authenticate

1045
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:57,503
Who you talk to their legitimate

1046
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,295
But that would be the first Quest

1047
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:00,319
Used to figure out

1048
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:01,599
Is the server

1049
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:04,159
And if it's a server did it really need to be

1050
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:05,183
Okay so

1051
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:06,719
A popular name

1052
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:10,047
Device that people think of is a server is a nest thermostat

1053
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:11,583
Does that meet your criteria

1054
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:14,655
So I don't know how this did the implementation

1055
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:18,495
The Google has a okay home I believe it is

1056
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:21,055
Other devices

1057
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:25,151
But I don't believe the original Nets needed to be a server I did sits here

1058
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:27,967
It monitors your temperature it makes a call out

1059
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:28,991
And it does stuff

1060
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:32,575
Okay but do you run a web server that you talk to

1061
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:36,159
From your phone didn't you

1062
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:36,927
Your phone

1063
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:40,255
No but did you talk directly to it or did you talk to nest

1064
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:47,167
It was a client your phone with a client they're both talking to a server somewhere else

1065
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:50,751
Such a different problem right that's it but it's not

1066
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:53,823
This case where an adversary can login directly to your nest

1067
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,103
Start sending out packages

1068
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:56,127
Necessarily

1069
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:58,687
Necessarily

1070
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:03,807
Okay and I think architecture Lee

1071
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:06,111
What are the things I've been hearing is that

1072
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:07,647
Having a device that has a

1073
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:08,927
Cloud interface so

1074
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:10,463
Utah to

1075
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:11,231
The cloud

1076
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:13,023
It talks to the cloud weibo

1077
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:14,047
There's cloud

1078
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:15,839
Nothing is directly

1079
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:17,119
Connecting out to the intern

1080
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:18,399
Annette in that feels like

1081
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:19,935
Probably a good way to go

1082
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:20,703
Bradley

1083
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:21,471
Devices

1084
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:22,751
That's it

1085
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:29,151
Great way to go to for this problem now on the flipside that means that if the vendor goes out of business your device stops

1086
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:33,247
Alright so then what do I do

1087
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:39,903
Except bricks in exchange for security

1088
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,439
Doctor from within your home

1089
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:43,743
Oh wait but we just said that's a bad idea

1090
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:45,791
Butcher Trading

1091
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:47,839
30 goal against security goal

1092
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:54,495
So one is you want to have availability in the event of a failure or business model change on the part of your

1093
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:56,543
The other is

1094
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:58,335
Do you want to be a public health

1095
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:00,639
Cash

1096
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:02,175
So excited

1097
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:04,223
So there is no middle ground

1098
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:06,015
Can we put a hub in and have that

1099
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:09,599
Be the brains of the operation at just the server in the hub

1100
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:11,391
I could talk to the cloud but then there's local stuff

1101
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:12,415
Never goes out

1102
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:13,695
Isn't that what

1103
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:16,511
Your Apple homekit and Google with onhub

1104
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:22,911
And perhaps ultimately Amazon with Alexa are aiming at used to be that central point of contact within

1105
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:25,983
It would broker these interactions for you

1106
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:27,775
I believe it

1107
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:28,543
Okay

1108
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:31,871
So that's how I should be thinking of my

1109
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:34,431
My new secure architecture that is also convenia

1110
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:37,503
Got it so like what happens now

1111
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:40,575
The I believe one of the vendors

1112
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:44,671
Actually just did a recall of all of their devices it was a Chinese IP

1113
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:47,999
Butcher its name

1114
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:49,791
Hong's uchiyama

1115
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:51,839
Technology

1116
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:53,375
I gotcha by I feel like that's

1117
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:54,399
Enough

1118
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:56,191
So these guys did a voluntary

1119
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:58,751
Should we be looking for more of that s***

1120
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:00,543
Government get involved in

1121
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:02,591
Bad actors get

1122
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:07,711
They have a recall well it's going to be interesting to look into what is the effect of the voluntary recall

1123
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:10,527
Because remember these two devices that mostly

1124
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:12,063
Purchase

1125
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:13,343
Deployed in a band

1126
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:16,927
Oh my goodness mine is one of those

1127
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:19,743
I want to participate interesting to look at

1128
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:23,583
Details of the recall are they give you your money back

1129
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:24,607
Acquire a new one

1130
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:25,887
What are they actually going to do

1131
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:28,959
That's yo question number one that's always been

1132
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:31,007
Will it be in business

1133
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:33,311
Or will they show up as a different company neck

1134
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:35,359
Weed selling a slightly different product

1135
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:36,895
Skeptical

1136
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:41,759
The Challenger and regulations going to be the global problem

1137
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:47,903
The Chinese manufacturer I want to blame all Chinese manufacturing buses run with this one for a moment

1138
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:50,207
Let's imagine the US how to login

1139
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:51,231
Something

1140
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:55,071
That we believe that actually work for what was that loud really did what it is

1141
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:58,911
Stop this botnet from being accessible to be groomed

1142
00:45:59,167 --> 00:45:59,935
Absolutely not

1143
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:03,007
Most of the Bots aren't even in the Uso

1144
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:06,079
It makes these devices not available in the US

1145
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:11,455
What you'd also do is you would inhibit the production of a lot of devices by us company

1146
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:18,111
Think about how many objects on Kickstarter would be affected by regulation here and would that have a net good

1147
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:20,159
Negative for us

1148
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:26,815
That's true and this particular company actually does

1149
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:30,143
Software and other connected

1150
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:34,751
We haven't even gotten into the fact that a lot of connected devices

1151
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:37,823
Have a supply chain that is just really opaque

1152
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:42,687
Very opaque and let's be honest

1153
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:43,711
Ravens today

1154
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:50,111
You probably only care about three things you care about the resolution of the attached cameras you care about that how much disk

1155
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:52,415
You have and whether you could expand that externally

1156
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:53,695
Can you care about the price

1157
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:57,279
If you ever use one there they're all horribly on YouTube

1158
00:46:57,791 --> 00:47:03,167
Like the interfaces are not the most graceful and beautiful things because that's not what people are paying for

1159
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:05,471
Give me a video feed

1160
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:07,775
Make it as good as I can get at the Dollar Tree

1161
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:08,799
That is true

1162
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:12,895
Alright so we have to change some things the industry has to change some things in

1163
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:14,687
People shouldn't be surprised sensitive

1164
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:15,455
I don't know

1165
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:22,367
This is one of those tricky problems where we have externalities in the system oh my goodness anytime you see

1166
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:25,951
Systemic flies look for the externality the

1167
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:27,487
Acquirers

1168
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:29,279
The companies that make these

1169
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:33,119
The Network's at their hosted on are not the ones that feel the pain

1170
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:35,167
But they're the ones who make all the financial

1171
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:37,471
People feel the pain

1172
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:38,495
Are the targets

1173
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:40,287
They're hosting Networks

1174
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:41,311
And their fender

1175
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:43,359
So we have this yoke

1176
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:45,407
Beautiful dichotomy where

1177
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:46,943
Do all of the

1178
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:49,759
Initial costs are born by one group

1179
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:53,343
But the secondary costs are completely born by the second group

1180
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:58,719
We know from The Economist if we believe they know what they're talking about

1181
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:04,607
Is it that leads to externalities were the first people act to minimize their cost of maximize the cost on others

1182
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:06,143
Right so

1183
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:07,423
Given this

1184
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:10,239
Andy do you have a solution for us

1185
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:12,799
Do you have any sort of recommendations on

1186
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:14,591
How we can kind of make

1187
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:17,919
Iot more secure cuz right now people are looking at this and going

1188
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:20,479
Holy cow I want none of this crap in my

1189
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:21,759
Or

1190
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:24,575
Holy cow this stuff is terribly dangerous let's regulate the heck out of

1191
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:29,183
First reaction might be slightly better than the second react

1192
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:34,559
Which is the user saying I don't want to be part of that that's imrie internalizing

1193
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:37,119
The externality and that's a Market Force

1194
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:41,471
So maybe we will see people shift until I want to go to this Hub mode

1195
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:45,055
And maybe this house mode will also protect you against devices doesn't

1196
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:47,615
Like I said there's a market there

1197
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:50,431
For parental control devices for your robots

1198
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:55,039
So that's my that's what I'm holding out for the other thing I'm holding out for is

1199
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:57,087
This is not something that is new

1200
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:58,367
Even though it feels

1201
00:48:58,879 --> 00:49:00,927
Do we see harbingers like this

1202
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:07,583
Every few years on the internet bill when we discovered all the empaths WordPress in Joomla site Severus like oh my goodness

1203
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:08,863
Anybody survive that

1204
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:11,935
The answer is not only did we survive those attacks

1205
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:14,239
But by today's standards dos attack

1206
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:15,263
Arbutus

1207
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:17,823
Because the internet has grown so much

1208
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:19,359
Defensive Brown

1209
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:21,663
It's at the internet has grown so much

1210
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:23,711
This is such a small

1211
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:25,503
Percentage of the traffic now

1212
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:30,879
This those when it's a big percentage of traffic it's noticeable

1213
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:36,767
But my expectation and belief is that the internet will continue to grow

1214
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:41,631
Will deliver you a larger and larger videos and more and more people that's capacity

1215
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:46,239
It is important to be there for us to be able to handle denial-of-service attacks since well

1216
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:48,031
But doesn't that capacity

1217
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:50,335
Increase also increase

1218
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:51,103
Pain

1219
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:52,383
Power of a denial-of-service

1220
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:53,663
What is a tax because as

1221
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:57,759
As you're pumping out more internet content at higher resolutions

1222
00:49:58,015 --> 00:50:02,879
I is a consumer in tempted to upgrade my Broadband which gives them more bandwidth to

1223
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:05,439
Intern point

1224
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:08,767
It's I believe that you are the tax from the network video recorder

1225
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:13,375
Well within a few years we'll tell why were we worried about care of it for second attack

1226
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:15,935
Now we're worried about

1227
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:22,847
But that'll be a world in which we talked about your pet a bit scale networks that are delivering huge volumes of traffic

1228
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:24,639
Awesome I hope you guys

1229
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:25,663
Can keep growing the network

1230
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:30,271
I keep up with these attacks all right Andy thank you so much for coming on this week
