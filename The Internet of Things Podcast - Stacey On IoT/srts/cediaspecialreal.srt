10
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:34,560
That's s t a c

11
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:35,584
Ey

12
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:37,888
And now enjoy the podcast with

13
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:38,912
My take it first

14
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:40,448
First and then several interviews from

15
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:41,728
People I met on the Shelf

16
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:45,056
Last week I went to CD in San Diego

17
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:48,896
And CD is this trade show aimed at the custom installer Market

18
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:50,432
These are the professionals

19
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:52,992
To put those awesome AV systems

20
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:57,344
High-end lighting and other electronics into the homes you might see in places like

21
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:59,392
I don't know architectural Digest

22
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:00,416
So think of

23
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:05,536
Easy things like a TV screen that unfolds to show you a movie by the pool

24
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:11,424
Or something that takes your lighting and controls it based on your mood or time of day

25
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,192
I

26
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:16,544
Probably could come up with other crazy examples except I am just not fancy enough

27
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:22,176
Much of the show is dedicated to professional AV audio visual equipment

28
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:25,504
There are so many speakers

29
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:30,368
Fairmount and row after row Movie Theater seating

30
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,952
But smart home stories still wherever

31
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,072
I saw several startups worth calling out such as Neo which is Bill to Hub

32
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,864
I know it's a hub

33
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:45,216
But it has all the radios you need like Wi-Fi Bluetooth zigbee Z-Wave

34
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,008
Cute

35
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:48,032
Is it okay to say cute

36
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,312
It's askew

37
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,848
Black and silver

38
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:51,616
Housing

39
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:53,920
And then it also has a remote

40
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:56,224
That goes with it in this remote design

41
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:56,992
Is gorgeous

42
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:59,040
It is very Sleek looking at has a

43
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:02,880
Beautiful screen on it and it has a sensor on the back

44
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:04,672
And what that sensor does is it

45
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,976
What is a reading the palm of

46
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:07,744
Your hand

47
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:10,304
And in doing so

48
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,584
It is able to tell

49
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,472
Who has the remote control in their hand and so it will offer personalized recommendations for that

50
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:19,776
Person so you may have many different net

51
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:20,800
Accounts

52
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:22,336
But when you pick up that remote

53
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,360
You're only going to see

54
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,384
Your Netflix

55
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:25,920
I'm a little

56
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:26,944
Worried about the

57
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,224
The startup it's based income

58
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:31,552
I'm worried about its ability to actually

59
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:36,928
Last for very long but I'm hoping that someone snaps it up because it really looked

60
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:38,720
Compelling it was a Kickstarter

61
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:42,560
Another cool startup that I saw was called hibersense

62
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:46,400
And this startup is trying to make my dream of not having a thermostat

63
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,168
On the wall

64
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,704
True what it does

65
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,472
This is

66
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:51,520
Like many of the companies that offer

67
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,544
Control of

68
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:55,104
Vents in your house like kinor

69
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:55,872
Ecovent

70
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:59,968
This company offers control of both dampers and vent sweeties

71
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:01,504
Connected

72
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,528
Motorized

73
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:07,136
Opener thingies but it also has a sensor that goes in every room

74
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,928
The sensors measure the temp

75
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:09,696
Temperature

76
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:14,560
City all of that and they use that to control your AC and HVAC on an individual room

77
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,864
And every time I talk about

78
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,912
Companies doing this again about you notes for

79
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:21,472
HP AC installers Clear Lake

80
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:24,544
You blow out you know your ductwork with too much pressure

81
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,128
So these guys actually say they take all of that into account so

82
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:33,248
If you're in only one room in the house and everyone's there and all the others you want shutdown it actually probably won't

83
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,040
Do that cuz it would create too much of

84
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,320
Pressure on your deck

85
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,088
But

86
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:38,624
I loved the startup

87
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,696
I loved the idea that one day you won't have a thermostat

88
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,744
And they're trying to make that a reality

89
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,024
Again

90
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,560
I don't know if they're going to hit it for

91
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:49,120
They're going to be around for the Long Haul but I liked where they were going

92
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,912
There are also some

93
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,192
A lot of router

94
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:55,264
Companies running around so I saw some companies that were offering

95
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:57,568
Basically the ability for you

96
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:59,616
To put parental control inside

97
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,640
Security software

98
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,432
On a router made by

99
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:05,248
Another OEM so the OEM has to buy

100
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,272
The software

101
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:09,600
But then you can also extend it through apps on people smartphone

102
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,392
The benefit there is

103
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:12,928
If you tell your teenager

104
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:14,976
That

105
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:15,744
At 10

106
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,791
Heater turning off WiFi throughout the house

107
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,583
For their devices

108
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,655
Then most likely they're going to hop on their phone and

109
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,959
I'll just use the LTE networks text

110
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,775
But in this way you can actually

111
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,055
With a pond

112
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,079
Their phone

113
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:30,847
You can actually

114
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:31,615
Turn off

115
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,151
Their LTE network

116
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:35,199
As well so I thought that kind of offer to

117
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,223
Hole

118
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,783
A whole device solution maybe that was worth noting

119
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:42,111
Cool stuff from big companies to

120
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,647
So LG

121
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,975
Had this $20,000 television

122
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:49,023
That was to OLED screen

123
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:49,791
Mountain

124
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:50,815
Back to back

125
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:51,583
Initiative

126
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,119
It

127
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:53,887
Was gorgeous

128
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,679
It is for

129
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:56,447
Retail

130
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,215
Primarily

131
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:58,751
And it's only in portrait

132
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,055
But holy cow you guys

133
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,847
They offered this at landscape

134
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:05,663
And I had $20,000 I would totally put

135
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,735
Actually maybe you don't need it back.

136
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:09,759
I would just like my TV

137
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:12,831
That was

138
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:13,599
That was awesome

139
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:17,695
Lutron also launched a new product line that sits between is

140
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,719
Professional-grade

141
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:19,487
Maestro

142
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:22,303
Dimmers and switches and it's DIY

143
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,071
Acetylene

144
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,607
The Maestro lion uses

145
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:26,655
Is a different radio protocol

146
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,959
Best facial Denver

147
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:31,007
But what Lutron is done

148
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,543
Is a taken things like

149
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,591
The concept of a smart bridge and

150
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,383
Programming based on an app

151
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:37,919
And they brought that up

152
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,711
To its Maestro radio

153
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:40,735
Saratu

154
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,783
Radio now

155
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:46,879
Professional installers this is only through professionals is not for like

156
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:47,647
DIY people

157
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,439
But if you have more than I have

158
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:51,999
50 lights you can't control

159
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,327
So you're going to move up into this

160
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,351
Pro-Line

161
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,119
And

162
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,655
You can program it with an app

163
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,935
Which means someone might

164
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,727
Come in and install it for you

165
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,007
But then you can tweak it

166
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,079
The rest of your life without calling the

167
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:11,199
That actually ties into a lot of Trends we're going to talk about me

168
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,223
Little bit on the show soap

169
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,503
Keep that in mind

170
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,551
This idea of having a pearl come in

171
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:18,623
Install it for you and then leave your life forever

172
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:19,647
And

173
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,439
I also found out

174
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:25,535
Kevin and I couple episodes were kind of a little bit wrong

175
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:27,071
Not that we would have known it

176
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,119
I ran into some SmartThings p

177
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,655
At the event

178
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,447
And they were showing off smart thing

179
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:33,727
In

180
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,263
Wi-Fi routers and

181
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,287
Is the SmartThings Hub

182
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:39,359
But what they weren't showing is SmartThings in a TV

183
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:42,431
So I asked him about it and they said Hold Ya weave

184
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:44,735
But that basically we're not doing that anymore

185
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:48,319
It may one day come back but they're not doing it now be

186
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:51,903
Because they think that TVs are trying to make them skinnier

187
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:52,927
And flattered

188
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:55,231
And adding more videos just runs

189
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:55,999
Counter to that

190
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:56,767
But

191
00:06:57,023 --> 00:07:00,095
Don't worry SmartThings The Hub is not going away

192
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:02,655
It's still going to exist and what they are doing

193
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:05,983
Is putting SmartThings into Samsung's new line of Wi-Fi

194
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,287
So they've got a mesh Wi-Fi

195
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,055
A system that will

196
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,335
SmartThings software

197
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,383
Zigbee and Z-Wave radios in there

198
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:13,407
And

199
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,431
It should be

200
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,711
Out there ready for

201
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,271
You're looking for SmartThings in a TV

202
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,039
Stop looking

203
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,575
Even though they said that would happen to

204
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,111
Just not going to have

205
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:25,695
Now those are some of the cool things that I saw

206
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,743
But I decided that since

207
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,023
This is my first year at

208
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,815
I should probably get more

209
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,119
So I talked to Julie Jacobson

210
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,911
Who is the founding editor of CEO

211
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,191
She is like

212
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:36,959
The city

213
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:42,079
She knew everyone there and actually what we were doing our conversation

214
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:44,127
Someone even walked by and said

215
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:46,943
Is that Julie and then they snapped a picture during the interview

216
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:50,527
But before we get to the things that Julie thought were

217
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,831
Let's take a moment

218
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:53,855
For a message

219
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:54,879
From our sponsor

220
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:55,903
Rick

221
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:04,863
Everyone we are breaking into the

222
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,143
Special CDF

223
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,167
Episode of the internet

224
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:08,959
Podcast for a message

225
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:10,239
From our sponsor

226
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,639
Talk about

227
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,663
More than doorbells

228
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,943
Hey Jamie how are you doing

229
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,223
Good how you doing

230
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,271
Awesome

231
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:24,063
Let's just get started with what

232
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:26,367
Because you have moved

233
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,391
Beyond doorbell

234
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,415
Into this

235
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:30,207
Concept of building a ring of six

236
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:32,255
What does that even mean

237
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:38,911
Bring a company our mission is around a different kind of neighborhoods

238
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:45,311
What is a Solutions company until you started with

239
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:51,711
Important place for any homeowner any Resident to secure

240
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:55,551
Delivering the presents to naturally help protect homes in neighborhood

241
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:58,111
And then we moved to the ring a straight down the hall

242
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,647
The other products

243
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,183
Thornell coming out look like

244
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:06,815
Spotlight cams and all these other cameras and now can go around your home

245
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:09,631
And then later in the year will be

246
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:12,447
Okay write an alarm system

247
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:14,239
But before we get to that

248
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,263
Which is exciting

249
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:17,567
Talk to me a little bit about how

250
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,335
Cameras

251
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,103
Doorbells

252
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:20,639
Help

253
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,407
Your neighborhood

254
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,175
Not just you

255
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:24,735
What we found is that what

256
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:27,807
Really impacting neighborhood is the lack of

257
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:30,111
Cousins in the neighborhood

258
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:33,439
Delivering presents

259
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,207
What are products

260
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:36,767
Intellectuality a motion detection

261
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:39,583
Allowing you to answer your door from wherever you are

262
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,143
Russia able to reduce crime in neighborhood

263
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,471
A real true that we did a study with the LAPD when we play

264
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:49,055
10% of homes in a neighborhood with the ring video doorbell

265
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:52,639
And in that study available to reduce crime by 55%

266
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:59,295
By just having 10% of the homes with having that presence of the Ring video doorbell and adding that presents back into the neighborhood

267
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:00,831
That is awesome

268
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:07,231
And we're going to hear more about that in a little bit

269
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:24,639
And now to Julie Jacobson of ZTE Pro on the cool stuff she saw it CDA

270
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:31,807
I think we've been sort of saddled with complete custom work in our industry and what happens is

271
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:38,207
An integrated will go into a home and complete completely set up a configured system and when they walk away the consumer

272
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:44,607
Kind of stuck with that may have to call the installer for every little change so what we're really saying is a trend towards person

273
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:51,007
Conversation were you giving the end-user themselves many more tools to configure their systems once the install is

274
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:52,287
Household

275
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:55,103
What do you think is going to be

276
00:10:55,359 --> 00:11:01,503
The impact of DIY type stuff and smart home stuff on the industry

277
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:07,903
Canyon early on was Ohno everyone's going to go DIY but I think it's been clear not just to the

278
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:12,767
Integrators but to the larger industry as well everyone from Amazon and Google

279
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:19,167
Down to the Nick markets that the integrators provided very necessary service I mean let's face it we can

280
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:25,567
Lawn mower Lawns but not everyone wants to mow their lawn so he mass-market is bringing so much awareness and

281
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:31,967
So much attention so much excitement to the mass-market about smart home technologies that are really good

282
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:38,367
Can only benefit those who install the stuff for a living what is some of the most exciting Tech you seen at the show

283
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:44,767
Fighting is kind of a strange word in our industry because it's little things like control4 is that an if-then

284
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:51,167
10 engine into their home automation software to allow as we discussed earlier to allow consumers to

285
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:54,239
Create their own scenes after the installer is left

286
00:11:54,495 --> 00:12:00,639
But there's also a bunch of mass-market things you excite me that the Samsung frame TVs I think they're fast

287
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,407
Mating

288
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:04,223
For single lot of applications for

289
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:07,551
Motion art moving art barcode very high-end

290
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:14,207
Producer of video projection screens is teaming up with Neo that's in Rio

291
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:16,767
With a motion art

292
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:23,423
Service and you're saying some fantastic applications about here in the show so it really runs

293
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:29,823
Pogamat from Amazon Echo is huge and it's having a huge impact even on premium products Georgia

294
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,871
Acoustics of showing a product that

295
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:38,271
Pair Echo streaming and control with the premium multi-room audio

296
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:43,903
So we're staying at really a wonderful blend of DIY with premium products and services

297
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:46,207
Is Julie mentioned origin acoustics

298
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,743
Scare was awesome

299
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:53,119
You have to buy it from a professional installer but the capability it gives is really compelling

300
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,399
The system

301
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,679
Call the valet

302
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:58,751
And it's a more powerful speaker Plus

303
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,311
Power and ceiling cover for the echo

304
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,127
So you'll end up buying for Echo dots for about

305
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:04,895
$200

306
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,943
And then you get this kit with

307
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:10,015
Set the mounting system and a superior speaker for about six

308
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:10,783
1600

309
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,831
And suddenly you have liked

310
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:17,951
The premium in-ceiling speaker setup that acts as a microphone to capture any command set

311
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:21,023
But it wasn't all cool technology

312
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:23,583
The biggest things I think I saw at the showare to

313
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:25,631
1

314
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:28,959
Is the business model challenges facing the professional installers in

315
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:30,751
Companies like control4 in Crest

316
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:32,799
And the other

317
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:33,567
Was

318
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:34,591
Perhaps

319
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,615
What might say that

320
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,199
Which is I'm going to call it the rise of something called

321
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,223
Do it for me

322
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:44,319
So if you consider that many of us RDI wires that do it for ourselves

323
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:47,903
And then there are those people who pay for fancy systems in their home

324
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:50,207
And how other people install it for them

325
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:53,791
The do it for me concept is somewhere in the middle kind of like that

326
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:54,559
New Lutron sir

327
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:59,167
Basically you take consumer-grade technology like a nest thermostat or hue bulbs

328
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,703
And you get someone else like

329
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,007
Custom installer to come in and do it for them

330
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:06,591
This is kind of what Amazon is doing with its installing server

331
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,383
Best Buy's betting on that for

332
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,151
The Geek Squad

333
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,687
And you even see it from some

334
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:11,711
Professional monitoring

335
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:12,991
Like alarm.

336
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:14,527
Honeywell

337
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:15,295
And

338
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:21,439
Tim Becker day the director of product marketing at a company called savant

339
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,231
Which I like to think of his Apple

340
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:24,255
A smart home

341
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,327
Talks about why the do it for me model

342
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,887
Might not be the worst thing to happen

343
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:30,655
Professional

344
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:34,239
What are the trends that we're seeing here is the

345
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:35,775
Do it for me

346
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:39,103
Concept which is where the custom integrators come in and

347
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,127
They are

348
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,151
Starting people

349
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,687
What do you think about that

350
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:45,759
First thing you know some of them see it as an opportunity to

351
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,039
Get clients

352
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:50,111
Early to get them started on maybe a simple any

353
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,951
People in Hawaii Market

354
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:54,975
Yuge

355
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:55,743
But

356
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,559
You're my friend he's a banker

357
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:01,887
And he does not want to deal with his own technology

358
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:02,655
He wants to

359
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,703
Come home and just have it work

360
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,495
But he also doesn't want to spend alot of money

361
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:09,055
So you know he can have a cup

362
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,079
Masala come in

363
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:10,847
And put in

364
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:11,615
Some of those

365
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,151
Consumer-grade

366
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:15,199
Pieces for a door lock

367
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:19,295
And security and you know maybe thermostats and maybe some lights

368
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:22,367
That you can pick up today at a Home Depot

369
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,391
But they don't

370
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,927
People don't want to install themselves

371
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:27,231
From the air that it comes to me the greater hazard

372
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,767
Customer that has a

373
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:29,535
Brass Durga

374
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:32,863
Going to get married

375
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:35,423
The step up the same way someone who's

376
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:38,751
Buying a Toyota today might be buying a BMW tomorrow and

377
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,543
They might be in the market for a Ferrari

378
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,079
Hope

379
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:43,871
A lot of these

380
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:44,895
Oh here in the channels

381
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:46,431
Field that customer base

382
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,455
Give them that

383
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,479
That service

384
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:50,527
Throughout their lifetimes that when they

385
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,551
Move up

386
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:52,575
They get older

387
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,855
They get to know

388
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:54,879
Maury

389
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:55,903
And one

390
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,183
Bigger better

391
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,719
You know more integrated

392
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,023
However

393
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,607
Even as companies find a business and helping install things like nest

394
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,399
Amazon Echo

395
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:08,191
This could be very disruptive

396
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:09,215
To the business model

397
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,751
Foremost custom integrators

398
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:12,799
Richard Gunther with digital media Zone

399
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:16,127
Who has his own podcast on the smart home explained

400
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:23,807
All right Richard so big thing we're seeing here is all the diy things are trying to go pro

401
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,343
Is it going to work

402
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:32,767
Time when all of these big companies

403
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,559
Microsoft and Apple and

404
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:36,351
Google are

405
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:37,887
Putting product out there in

406
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:39,935
Setting expectations for users

407
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,239
You

408
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,775
Have people paying

409
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,079
Top dollar for custom systems

410
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,383
If they don't have access

411
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,711
Products that are just as cool as this

412
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:54,527
They're just going to go and buy these things themselves

413
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:55,807
Potentially your baby

414
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:57,087
Look for a different

415
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,879
Provider

416
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:01,183
What we're seeing here is

417
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,719
I moved where

418
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:04,511
The Lord companies

419
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,303
Are trying to get

420
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,583
The Dealer's when bored

421
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:08,607
I'm trying to help them under

422
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:09,375
1st and Wyatt

423
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,143
Oyster benefits

424
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,167
Afraid

425
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:17,823
And at the same time the dealers are trying to figure out how to make that work because it's a very different Financial

426
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:23,199
Familiar with that financial model can you break that down for me

427
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:28,319
Looking for a

428
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:30,623
Music service in your home

429
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:34,207
You are working with a dealer that

430
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:34,975
Cells

431
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:38,815
Control4 Crestron or something like that

432
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:41,119
Thousands of dollars

433
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,191
Likely

434
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:48,031
Hard drives

435
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:52,639
Stores all of your music for you and it's all local in this wonderful but

436
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:54,431
Frankly it's not necessary

437
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:56,735
Seymour in what you probably really want

438
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:57,759
Is

439
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:00,575
Your Deezer and your Spotify

440
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,111
And services like that

441
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,159
The problem

442
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:06,207
I think

443
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:06,975
Realize

444
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:09,279
These products aren't as expensive

445
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,559
Bose dealers

446
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:13,119
Make their money on Market

447
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:19,263
You sure there's money in installing it for you they also make a share on Market

448
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:22,591
Product is a product only cost $169

449
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:24,639
Instead of $4,000

450
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:31,039
That's a very different financial situation so I think the challenge for the four installers is going to betray

451
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:36,159
About this alot

452
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:42,559
We monetize long-term.

453
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:54,335
And we're back with Jamie siminoff to CEO of

454
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,103
Ring

455
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,127
Talking about

456
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,407
Is products

457
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,687
How to make your neighborhood

458
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:01,503
You mentioned

459
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:02,271
That you guys

460
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:03,295
Reducing crime

461
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,367
And that sounds awesome

462
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,647
What other features

463
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:08,671
Are you building into

464
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:10,719
Product line

465
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:11,999
The app itself

466
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:18,911
So what day was closed recently is

467
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:23,775
A camera which replaces a motion detection flood light

468
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,055
HD camera

469
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:31,455
Etsy motion detection of flood lights when you walk by you get the light on but now

470
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,223
Play audio

471
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:35,807
So that we came out with judicial products called Spotlight cam

472
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:39,647
Little bit smaller one is battery operated and what is power

473
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:41,951
And so now you can add light

474
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:45,535
And Camera all around your house regardless if you have power or not

475
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,815
That is awesome so if

476
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:47,583
You see something

477
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,119
You can actually say something

478
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:51,679
And that's the whole thing with

479
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:55,263
Presence of being able to not only

480
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:58,847
What's going on and get the alert on your phone

481
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:01,407
Something happened

482
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:04,223
Now that this alarm set

483
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:07,039
Any more details on that

484
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:10,623
To the alarm we haven't given any like real details on this

485
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:11,391
Specific

486
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:12,159
Around

487
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:13,695
Features

488
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:19,327
Largest alarm company in the world ATT is so scared about it that they're suing it's over it

489
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,631
I was just the only reason why we talk about it

490
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,935
Will be coming out in the end

491
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:25,983
A lot of your product

492
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,079
You started in

493
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:32,127
Professional installer

494
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:38,783
Yes Elite Wheel of the professional install

495
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:44,159
Initially started answer the DIY consumer market we've come out with the elite line

496
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:45,439
And that started with

497
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:49,279
The doorbell the ring video doorbell Elite that's a power over ethernet

498
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:52,607
I really I can install the time top of the line

499
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:57,727
Products and so we're going to be continuing that Elite line throughout our product line

500
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:04,383
And adding those two of those features to other products rehabs that we have a full line then

501
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:07,455
Installers to install a professional line in homes

502
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:09,247
Power over ethernet

503
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:12,063
Yeah did you see a lot of power

504
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:14,879
Future products that we have in it

505
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:17,952
The lines that we already have out there attic power

506
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,232
For sure

507
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:21,024
Awesome that's a lot to look forward to

508
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,072
Thank you so much

509
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:30,240
Thank you very much for attestation

510
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:36,640
And now back to the show to understand further some of the distress

511
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:38,432
After Trends facing the industry

512
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:42,272
I spoke with a custom installers been to the show for The Last 5 Years

513
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:45,088
To find out how he's thinking of adopting his business

514
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:47,136
Reagan Mena

515
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:48,416
Owner and president

516
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:50,208
Audioseal in Austin Texas

517
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:54,048
Says he's seen the products from Big consumer Brands infiltrate

518
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:54,816
Great the show

519
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:59,424
In this segment he talks about how his business has changed with the influx of new tech from

520
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,448
Startups in Tech

521
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:04,544
We'll get a new pilot comes out into the market and

522
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,640
Nothing ever goes out to any of our clients houses must we do some thrill testing

523
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:10,176
Lucy it adds value

524
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:13,504
To whatever type of automation system reporting it

525
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,576
Sometimes these products are so popular that

526
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:18,624
Google head and

527
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,440
Install them as part of a

528
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:25,536
An emerging Trend but most of the time we'd like to see how well they can integrate

529
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:26,560
Santa Barbara

530
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:28,608
Are custom automation

531
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:33,216
So that that's really the key is to seeing how well plays with all the other products we currently

532
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:40,384
It's an adoption or you're going you're going the way of the dodo essentially it comes down to knowing those type of products and

533
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,992
Applying an hourly rate for insulation and also supporting that as well to

534
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:48,576
Some companies Implement a recurring Revenue aspect of it

535
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:50,368
Are the times at the one-off and then

536
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:52,160
Accountable call back if they need

537
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,696
More assistance

538
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:57,280
I just kind of Line in the Sand between some integrators who

539
00:22:57,536 --> 00:23:01,120
They do large-scale installations and they have a

540
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:03,680
Recurring relationship with their clients and then

541
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:05,472
You start to see a lot more

542
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:12,128
With clients these days that they have smaller setup still need as much because they become a lot more tech-savvy and we're just there

543
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:16,224
To help support the things they don't understand or don't want to install

544
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:22,880
And what would you like to see from the industry that maybe they're not giving you or maybe some people are giving it to you but as an s

545
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:23,904
A custom installer

546
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,184
What do you want

547
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:28,256
When it comes down to it it would be nice if

548
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:34,144
Coyote side of things and also the custom guys could find a little bit better common ground in terms of

549
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:40,800
Alder oldwyn play well together in the future either sides not going away I would say the iot and

550
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:43,616
Great products that are coming out on a consumer level

551
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:44,384
AR

552
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:50,784
Fully encroaching more and more the custom side of things but the way I look at it is you have to look at these things and

553
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:57,440
Find Wade Implement them with some custom products or quite frankly look to see if those those type of products can act

554
00:23:57,696 --> 00:24:03,072
LeapFrog what you currently have and it's sometimes hard for integrated to look at that and say

555
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:05,120
Here's a $250 device

556
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,400
Quite frankly

557
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:11,008
Performs better than my $2,500 X Y and Z product

558
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:14,848
And it's just something you have to look at hard but then also realize that

559
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:19,968
There is a business model behind approaching these products installing amuse have to be smart about it

560
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,064
There are plenty of other trends that I saw at the show

561
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,648
Such as an emphasis on both voice control and Apple's homekit

562
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:30,464
Energy management was also a big trend

563
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,232
People at boots

564
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,512
Ranging from Sonnen

565
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:36,352
2 Savant showing ways to manage power generated by residential solar

566
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,912
As I departed CDA though

567
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:43,008
My focus was on trying to figure out how the world of high-end home automation

568
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,568
Would react and adapt to the encroaching

569
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:47,104
Consumer technology

570
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:48,896
From the outside

571
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:50,688
It seems as though they've been caught

572
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:51,456
Flat-footed

573
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:52,992
Reacting with me to Prada

574
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,784
Instead of delivering

575
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,808
A lot of innovation

579
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:01,696
McKay's

580
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:06,560
Man doing so he makes me wonder how any industry can withstand the onslaught

581
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:07,328
The big Tech

582
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:14,752
A lot of the Innovations are coming out of companies like restaurant in control for which at CVS seem like very big companies

583
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:21,152
But they're tiny compared to Google and apple and so when does Innovations are coming out of companies that really aren't that big

584
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:27,808
It's hard to do things like voice control which takes hundreds of Engineers a lot of brainpower to pull off we had about set

585
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:34,208
7 years of research and development before even launching his company we had our own natural language processing engine before we went in

586
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:35,488
Productized it

587
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:41,632
So we really started with the hard stuff and then the control system stuff isn't easy by any means but

588
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:43,424
In this landscape

589
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:48,032
We did the thing that no one else hears really able to do first and then we both around it
