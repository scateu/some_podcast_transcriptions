00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:12,192
We're keeping

30
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:13,728
Update

31
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:16,800
All right

32
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:20,384
First we have a message from our sponsor

33
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:21,408
Arm

37
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:53,664
Arm techcon 2016 October 25th through the 27th in Santa Clara

38
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,016
A-arm petco.com

39
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:58,784
So

40
00:01:59,296 --> 00:01:59,808
Let's gets

41
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:00,832
Started with the show

42
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,112
Kevin guess what I did

43
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:05,184
I'm guessing you got a new wink

44
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:10,560
I did actually I got that earlier but they told me to wait to make sure my my software was all up-to-date

45
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:15,680
So last night I transferred my old wink Hub my V1

46
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:18,496
To the V2 version 2 Hub

47
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:20,288
And I will say two things about

48
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:22,336
It worked

49
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,640
Two words

50
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:26,944
This is really exciting it actually work

51
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,224
So

52
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,504
So what's the process like

53
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,040
The process is like

54
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,064
This you

55
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,088
Plug-in

56
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,880
The new hub

57
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:37,440
You keep your ass so you keep your old Hub plugged in

58
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,464
You plug in the new hub

59
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,488
You can either connect

60
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:42,560
Headed to ethernet or you can use because now it has an Ethernet port

61
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,192
Or you can connect to Wi-Fi I like to just to do it over Wi-Fi because

62
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,216
One of the hubs to

63
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:49,984
Senior each other

64
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,520
So

65
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,288
You

66
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,568
Open your Wink app

67
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,848
And it's like

68
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,384
Wink

69
00:02:56,896 --> 00:03:00,224
It's okay I think there's any wink you're like there is anyway

70
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:01,504
And you put it on your network

71
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:06,368
And this is the first time as an Android User that I've had something come on to my network

72
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,160
In a way

73
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:11,744
It was seamless because normally I actually have to turn off my

74
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,304
Cellular data on the Android because it's constantly

75
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:15,840
Trying to

76
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:19,936
Whenever I try to connect to a connected device the Wi-Fi process

77
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:20,960
Becomes all wacky

78
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:21,728
My phone's like

79
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:25,312
No we cannot be connected to the internet so that it dries and it messes up

80
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,848
Right because

81
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:27,872
Four people have

82
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:31,200
No setup say it echo or something similar

83
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,480
When can your case

84
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:38,112
You're actually connecting your phone for the app to whatever the device is directly over Wi-Fi

85
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:41,952
So the phone says hey I need my connectivity and that's probably what happens if

86
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:43,488
Falling back to Cellular

87
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,768
Exactly in

88
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,304
It's big frustrating thing

89
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,144
Is it happens to you a lot in her life is that happening just turn off your cellular

90
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,216
Temporarily just temporarily

91
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:54,752
Unless you like me and you

92
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,568
Please call me

93
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:59,872
Nobody calling me anymore

94
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,408
That's true

95
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,432
All right

96
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:04,992
That was a notable thing and I was excited about that

97
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,272
Sewveryeasy

98
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,320
Then it's like

99
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:13,952
You got an old wake up and would you like to transfer your programs and everything over

100
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:15,488
Like people yes I would

101
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,863
So if it bought for a minute and said the process will take approximately 10 minutes

102
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:24,191
And you will have to manually reconnect your Lutron light

103
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,215
And I was like

104
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,567
I was like that's okay cuz I've got a couple

105
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:30,335
What programs

106
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,383
So I said yes

107
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:34,687
The lights flashed it was very exciting

108
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,991
Pink blue green colors

109
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,015
And then

110
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,807
It was like hey I'm done

111
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,343
Now let's connect your Lutron

112
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:44,671
Actually it was really nice because it said hear the

113
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:46,463
Here are the four light switches we see

114
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:48,255
Do you want to connect them

115
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:55,679
It's at and I was like okay so I clicked on the connect button I walked over to the light switch and you basically hold down your light switch

116
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,983
Until it flashes

117
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,007
And then

118
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,567
Stop holding on and the wink makes his connection

119
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:02,847
So

120
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:06,943
That's how it's supposed to happen and that's actually what it does but for me and this is

121
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,479
This is actually been abuse of mind

122
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:09,503
For like

123
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,783
Ears

124
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,575
It has this affirmation error

125
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:14,367
It never tells you it's succeed

126
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:17,439
Might only about 50% of the time will tell me that

127
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:19,231
The connection has been successful

128
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:22,303
So mine actually timed out was like

129
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,839
Something's gone wrong

130
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,375
And then when it

131
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,911
I was like okay cancel

132
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:27,935
Then it would show up as

133
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,007
So

134
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,287
That's kind of odd

135
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,079
It is but it's not

136
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,103
For me it wasn't it

137
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:38,175
Especially

138
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:40,735
If you guys are going to do this and you know that's going to happen

139
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:43,551
Just wait and see if it connects cuz I was like dang it

140
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,087
I'm failing at this

141
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,623
But then I was like

142
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,743
YouTube manually had to do your Lutron stuff

143
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,023
But did you have other

144
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,303
Other things

145
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:59,935
Yeah okay so we'll be so it just carry over all the connections as for lack of a better word

146
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,471
To your other devices

147
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:04,031
And probably any robots and

148
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,823
Shortcuts on

149
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:06,591
Song

150
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,871
I was mid

151
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:10,943
Schedule item so my Halloween lights were on

152
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,271
They were scheduled to go off later that night

153
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:17,855
And lo and behold they did it was like nothing had changed

154
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,391
Titan Magic

155
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,695
And my doors unlocked and lock

156
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:22,975
So the Z-Wave

157
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:23,999
Just fine

158
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,279
Yes yes

159
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:27,071
It also works with the Zippy stuff

160
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:30,655
Garage door open and close just fine

161
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:32,447
And

162
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,727
I'm trying to think what else might be on there

163
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:38,847
I have some outlets on there and they worked so everything transferred seamlessly and it was

164
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,895
Other than the minor like

165
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,431
The Lutron isn't working

166
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,967
Oh wait it is

167
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,503
It was great so

168
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,039
If you're going to buy a new wink

169
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:50,623
I haven't live with it long enough to say wow this is

170
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,647
A real Improvement

171
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:54,719
Write more processing power there's

172
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,487
Bluetooth

173
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,255
In here

174
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:58,047
I don't have anything that I was like

175
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:00,607
So

176
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:03,167
I haven't lived with it enough to know that like

177
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,959
Do you really need this Hub if

178
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:05,983
If you have an existing

179
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:06,751
Happy wink

180
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:13,407
When this was first announced that's kind of where I was. I do I'm very happy with the wink Hub. I haven't liked do I need to upgrade

181
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,247
People again why I think the big draw here is the

182
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,271
Ethernet port

183
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:19,551
Ethernet maybe blue

184
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:20,575
Who has more things

185
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:21,343
StarTalk

186
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,671
You haven't

187
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:32,351
Right I don't have a lot of fun fact I don't think I have any Bluetooth devices in the house or smart home anyway

188
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:37,215
If I were looking at something then maybe I would upgrade of the sea

189
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:39,775
It would be nice I mean cuz like Bluetooth Mash isn't

190
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:40,543
All that

191
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,103
Two lights

192
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,407
Alps

193
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:46,687
A little bit better

194
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:48,479
But that's really the only reason I can think

195
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,271
Pick up right now or if you have the locks in your life

196
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,039
Woobox

197
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:55,135
That is the wink Hub and I really enjoyed it

198
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,671
And now Kevin

199
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,951
It's time for your show

200
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,231
Oh

201
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:03,583
Well actually not show until cuz I don't have something in hand to

202
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,887
Talk about

203
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:09,983
Oh okay so yes yes I do I'm holding right now

204
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,775
To the Google pixel

205
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,055
Reviews came out

206
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:15,359
And why do we care about that on the show

207
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,407
Welco's Google

208
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,687
As assistant

209
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:21,503
Built into the phone it's baked right in and

210
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,527
In fairness

211
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:28,415
Google Assistant if you're not familiar it really is a updated or rehash version of the

212
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:31,743
I don't want to say it so I'll just say the assistant

213
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:34,047
I want to say in exit off people's phones right now

214
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:36,863
The assistant feature that's already been an Android

215
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,911
Plus the Google on tap

216
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:45,567
Function which could scan your screen and show you web information based on what's on your screen so if your

217
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,847
You know searching for

218
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,639
Hotel monatik

219
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,431
Could pop up with directions and such

220
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:54,271
In any case it's all Now call Google assistance what's a rebranding its

221
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:56,575
Exclusive to the Google pixel phone

222
00:08:57,343 --> 00:09:03,487
And you can speak to it and it's like a boss that will when teligent we speak back to you and

223
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,767
Show you information

224
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:06,303
But what it doesn't do

225
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:07,327
Yet

226
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:10,911
It really didn't somebody over computer wrote this article answer

227
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,447
It's actually pretty good article it says

228
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:14,751
Google pixel phone packs a powerful

229
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,031
Voice assistant

230
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,567
But it's no

231
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,591
Amazon Echo

232
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,895
And actually the article is dubbed

233
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:21,919
By The Echoes

234
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:22,943
Name

235
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,223
An impression

236
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,759
They were exactly

237
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:26,783
And that's really

238
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,831
A good observation and good point

239
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:29,855
Why isn't that

240
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:30,623
You know it

241
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:33,439
There just isn't enough third-party integration yet

242
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,719
And yet this

243
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:39,071
Service has been around for at least two maybe three years

244
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:42,655
And I would love to be able to get my new pixel which does arrive next

245
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,959
Text will have it not to show and tell but I'll have it

246
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:45,983
For the show

247
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,007
Next week

248
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,543
But it's just like

249
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,871
Will the episode which untapped potential there

250
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:53,407
And I'm sure Google is

251
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:55,711
Google is play nicely with others in the

252
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:56,735
Past so

253
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,015
You know it took

254
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:04,671
People forget this but Wendy Echo launched in December in the preview mode it didn't actually have any of the smart home stuff until

255
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:08,511
March and I didn't buy it until March 4th at recent that's a good point

256
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:13,887
And in it we also do have Google home that is

257
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:14,655
Coming out

258
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:15,423
Which

259
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:18,239
When I get mine

260
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:22,591
Yes or yes we are so that will actually directly

261
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,383
Compete against the Amazon Echo

262
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:28,223
For music and information and Smart Home

263
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,503
Capabilities although

264
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,551
Again comes down to Partners

265
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:33,087
There are not as many partners

266
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:36,415
With Google home there are with Amazon Echo so

267
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:42,559
Nests and if this then that I think

268
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:46,911
Yeah so it's on my wings not going to work with and that's all I can live with that

269
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:48,703
A Time

270
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:53,055
ESO the pieces are all there but they're still being put together I guess is my point it's kind of

271
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:55,615
I'm just disappointed that they're not on this

272
00:10:55,871 --> 00:11:02,015
True first Google made by Google phone which is really one of the Keef exclusive features is the Google app

273
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:02,783
Assistant

274
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:08,159
But yet you're not going to be able to at least yet you don't control things with your voice from your phone

275
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:11,743
Just another Asian little disappointment on my part

276
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,559
I'll get over

277
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:15,839
With the echo

278
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:16,607
You can't control

279
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:19,679
Phone unless you download something like Rogers or

280
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,447
Lexi

281
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,007
I've been disappointed that for a while

282
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:24,543
Download Lex

283
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:28,127
INRI I know I could do that absolutely

284
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,151
Play it just it just

285
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,943
Now Amazon if you're listening

286
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:35,295
We don't need Bluetooth remotes when we have bluetooth on a phone that has a microphone

287
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:36,575
Anyway

288
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,343
Okay

289
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:38,367
Start

290
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,207
Let's talk about

291
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,487
Stats

292
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:44,255
Yeah

293
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:45,535
What do we have here

294
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:50,399
What do we have here what we talked about the ecobee Lite

295
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:53,983
That was sleet rumored Etc official

296
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,263
And it really is

297
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,359
Light because it's lighter and price at $169

298
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:06,271
Enoch little later and functionality because I do not see any mention of the ability to add one of the key feature

299
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,831
Pictures of ecobee remote sensors

300
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,647
I love Simon on that one

301
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:15,487
I can see their thinking in the thinking here is

302
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,767
They want to compete

303
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,815
With Nest at a lower price point

304
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:19,839
So

305
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:20,863
David she's not here

306
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,143
Yes

307
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:23,679
Kananaskis

308
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,447
Full price

309
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,215
Ss250

310
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:30,079
A lot of people actually say that they don't the sensor functionality isn't a huge thing to

311
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,615
The people who aren't crazy Cooling

312
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,663
Right right so

313
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,991
You know it's a learning thermostat connect all these things they're like

314
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,783
Hey that's cool I'll take it

315
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:41,087
So I can see is this like

316
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,367
World-changing news

317
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,415
Is it smart

318
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:46,463
And maybe we'll see a lower price nest

319
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,231
Possibly

320
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:48,255
And I

321
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,279
Because Honeywell

322
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,351
Actually just a couple weeks ago released

323
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:55,423
There were they actually change their thermostat lineup down for

324
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,191
I'm like 32

325
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,799
The lyric T5

326
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:03,359
And that is $149

327
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,663
Tyler's basically does everything

328
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,199
The Nest Inn

329
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,479
I guess that you could be like that

330
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,295
It doesn't

331
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,087
$150

332
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,367
Right

333
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,903
Directions to home

334
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:16,671
Catan

335
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,023
Isn't that so

336
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,583
It's a learning thermostat as well it's just not a

337
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,119
Not a digital thermostat

338
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,655
Yeah it looks what is it

339
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:27,679
Avenue said it look

340
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:30,239
It looks to me

341
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:34,847
Like an Apple Watch just not on your resident with a strap it's a it's a square

342
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,895
With rounded Corners thermostat

343
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:39,199
Just very basic looking

344
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,991
Looks nice I think it's appealing

345
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:46,367
It's kind of funny because Honeywell actually sued Nest over there circular design

346
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:49,951
How do you spell pioneer that circular

347
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,023
Babies harder to

348
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,303
Build I don't know enough

349
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,327
Enough about Manufacturing

350
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:59,679
So the other thermostat news in the section

351
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:00,447
Because why not

352
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:02,751
Nest changed its Auto away

353
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,543
Praising to eco

354
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:08,383
Because AutoWay confused people or people would put their

355
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,455
Thermostats on to Auto away to try to get the little leaves

356
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,015
Sleeveless vest

357
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:15,295
I forgot how to say

358
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:20,671
So they were like you know what let's just call it go and make people feel good cuz that's what they're being

359
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,695
Eco-friendly

360
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:24,767
Yeah I'm just looking at the

361
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,815
The news on this

362
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:30,143
Didn't really it like so now you've got you know

363
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,983
You can actually turn it to Ego in like turn it automatically to the leaf

364
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,263
Used to be

365
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,287
Like if you were right

366
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,335
Really jonesing for a leaf you had to turn in

367
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,615
Up in the

368
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,407
Summer or down in the winter

369
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,479
For me it's always up

370
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:46,527
Because Texas is still ungodly High here

371
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:47,807
October

372
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:48,575
But

373
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:49,855
That's how

374
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,647
I triggered Alief but

375
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,951
Now you can just turn it to eco

376
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:54,975
Feel good about yourself

377
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:56,767
Interesting

378
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,071
And you have to manually switch it back

379
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,143
Correct

380
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:05,983
Integer multiples of deer on each one of those Nest thermostats

381
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,335
There we go

382
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:13,151
Then they still have a way so

383
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,175
When you wander off

384
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:17,247
Your home will still going to a way and will trigger all these other thing

385
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,015
EXO

386
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:22,879
One of the reasons they did it is because people would be like let's tell that I'm away

387
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:25,951
And then like their lights and all sorts of stuff would go

388
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,743
Go crazy another were still at home and

389
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:29,791
Make sense

390
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,327
Make sense

391
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,607
So there we go

392
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:34,143
Very exciting

393
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,007
Like I said there was a light section

394
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,287
Light section

395
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,567
Alright so

396
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:42,591
The other thing

397
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:44,127
I wanted to talk about this week

398
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,407
Is Phillips

399
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,711
Neither is there we go

400
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,599
I had to talk about these because I got the new richer color

401
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:54,623
Philips Hue

402
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,391
Light bulb

403
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:56,671
And

404
00:15:56,927 --> 00:16:01,023
Amazing I used it like the gold standard for me was the life Expo

405
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:06,143
Because they could do these amazing greens and it made this beautiful turquoise blue that I love

406
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,703
Philips conduit

407
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,239
Until now

408
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,543
So now they have the richer color light bulbs

409
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,591
And I'm like well hot diggity

410
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:18,175
Everything is better although I still have unifor of the

411
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,967
Actually I like six of the old

412
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,295
Choose him like I don't want to upgrade them but

413
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,855
They can't do turquoise

414
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,391
I'm not spinning

415
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:34,047
How much are these out of curiosity are the same price as the old Philips Hue bulbs so that is 60

416
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,071
Taxable for

417
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,119
Downlights and

418
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,423
204 a starter kit with

419
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,191
The Hub Ann

420
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,215
3 volts

421
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,007
Ceph

422
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,799
It's not like I'm more expensive

423
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,335
They're the same price

424
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:50,175
Are you to replace with wood cost a lot of money but for people are buying the first time

425
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,711
The same price as before

426
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:52,991
Enable

427
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,271
And I like them

428
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,039
And

429
00:16:55,807 --> 00:17:00,159
You know I know that I talked about a lot of different light bulbs on the show off tuck also

430
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,439
Starting this month

431
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:05,023
The new Philips Hue down lamps that I've been

432
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,303
Denso jonesing for

433
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,327
The last few years

434
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,863
BR30 flood lights that are

435
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,167
Are the white ones those are out

436
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,215
Now I believe

437
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:15,519
And they or maybe next week

438
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,823
And they're going to be 40 bucks Apple

439
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,127
So

440
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:20,895
Yay

441
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,175
Very exciting

442
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:27,295
And all the accessories that Phillips has makes this

443
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:31,391
Really like it's hard for me to go into other light bulbs now

444
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,927
Cuz they got everything

445
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:36,255
Fairly reasonable price these are $10 more than I think

446
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:38,303
Actually only $5 more than the osram

447
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,071
In color

448
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:41,631
Osram white lights in the BR30 s

449
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:42,655
So

450
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,215
I just feel like

451
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:47,263
Because of the The Hub that you need

452
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:49,311
For Philips bulbs

453
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:53,407
I just feel like there's a lock in kind of thing there because

454
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:57,503
But github doesn't work with many other things

455
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,527
Github works with

456
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,295
Everything

457
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:01,599
It even works with the Google home Kevin

458
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:05,951
Well I'm not saying it right you're you're correct your

459
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:08,255
I don't know

460
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:11,839
No yeah I guess that's what it is I guess that's what it is

461
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:14,399
Observing like you should see my little

462
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,959
Yeah I did

463
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:21,823
I don't want a hug for everything I add to my house I mean that just kind of silly to me

464
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:22,591
Do you know

465
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:24,895
I'm in Ontario makes a Drake has so many things

466
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:26,943
Work with existing outside I get that

467
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:32,575
You enjoy them that's all music

468
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:39,231
A picture a picture of your house like the Willy Wonka Factory with all these colors and

469
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:41,023
Lights go in them

470
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:45,119
Chocolate River

471
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:51,263
No chocolate River in Filipino you have to buy all these apps to actually do some really cool stuff with it because their app is pretty

472
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,543
Like run-of-the-mill

473
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,383
And nobody has a great UI yet for doing color transfer like

474
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:58,687
Changing colors in lights I'll be honest

475
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:03,295
Now if you want to change the color or cetacean you got to manually create it and then you

476
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:05,599
Call it something that you remember and then

477
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,903
You know you can you can do like

478
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:09,695
You can tell the echo

479
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:10,463
Pocono

480
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:11,743
Turn it to Sunset

481
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:13,791
That feels real

482
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:15,839
Silly silly

483
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:17,375
So

484
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,399
That's still something

485
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:20,191
Like I can't say make it turkey

486
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:24,543
All right final little thing because

487
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:28,383
Maybe you guys are as obsessed about this as I am but I like

488
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:33,503
Actually I don't like counting calories I theoretically want to count calories but I'm really lazy

489
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:35,551
I'd also like to eat so it

490
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:36,575
Depressing

491
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,855
I like consuming them

492
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,135
I like

493
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:42,207
But you can now ask the Amazon Echo

494
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,487
Hey

495
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:44,255
A

496
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,559
How many calories are in

497
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:48,095
A cinnamon roll

498
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,631
And she will tell you

499
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:51,167
Yes

500
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:57,567
And that's yes and that thank you Stacey for making me do that before the show detest it I will never have one again that I love them

501
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:58,335
I love.

502
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,871
How many calories are in a

503
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:07,295
I think it was around 330 per hundred grams of cinnamon roll at 9 just ordered 100 grams of 7

504
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,319
I can tell you that

505
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,903
But I actually have no idea what I

506
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:16,511
About a hundred pickup weight of a hundred paper clips which is

507
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:18,815
Not that much

508
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,095
Thank you

509
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,631
Not that much

510
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:23,423
So there we have it

511
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:27,263
A lot of calories in a cinnamon roll the echo will tell you in

512
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,287
You will probably

513
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:31,103
All right

514
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:32,383
Stay tuned

515
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,151
We have

516
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:37,759
A message from our sponsor HP and then we also after that

517
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:39,551
A conversation with Michael Wolff

518
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:40,319
About

519
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,343
The smart kitchen

520
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:45,183
Where the service fits Reddit

521
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:51,583
Hey everyone we are breaking into the Internet of Things podcast for a word from our sponsor this we sponsor is Hewlett-Packard

522
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:56,703
Enterprise in to talk to us today about analytics at the edge we have dr.tom

523
00:20:56,959 --> 00:21:02,847
Brad it she was a VP and general manager for servers and iot systems at hpe

524
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:04,383
Tom

525
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:07,967
We talked about the internet of things being about data

526
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:14,111
And you want to take it further and say that it's also about insights

527
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:16,159
And in fact the data

528
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,184
At the edge

529
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:18,976
At The Internet of Things

530
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:21,792
Is older and faster and bigger than all

531
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,584
All the types of Big Data come on

532
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:29,472
But what is more profound and I like to take to another level is it's the inside that's the right from the day

533
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:30,496
That's the Renwick

534
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:33,568
And then further after the inside is dry what action

535
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:38,688
Staking and I like to look at innisfree age there's the acquisition of the data analysis

536
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,968
Ebony action

537
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:41,760
And the business value or the

538
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:45,344
Scientific or engineering value is manifested in that flask

539
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,880
That's what you called the action

540
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:52,768
This whole segment is on analytics at the edge so why is doing this at the edge so essential

541
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,840
Action is the address where the Saints resign

542
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:59,424
NBC15 Flora city tram

543
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,192
Smart

544
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:01,984
Carsmart the building

545
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,032
And doing analytics at the edge

546
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:06,080
It's so crucial for 7

547
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:08,384
I'm very very quickly

548
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,200
It takes time to go to the cloud or just a location

549
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:13,248
With the information and get an answer back

550
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,784
What is bandwidth

551
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,112
Internet of Things presents a big analog data

552
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:20,416
Tremendous amount of data logging

553
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,440
Bamboo spikes

554
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,464
30 cost

555
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,000
One has to pay for

556
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:26,304
The bandwidth even if one has the bandwidth

557
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,840
Security

558
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:30,400
Location

559
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:33,728
Is exposing more vulnerable to cyber attacks and hack

560
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:34,752
This is

561
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:40,640
A duplication of resources when one caches and storage data at the engine the needs to send it all back to

562
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:42,688
Play center there will be some

563
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:47,552
Duplication of resource is this notion of corruption and reliability

564
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:48,576
It's too flat

565
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:50,112
And packets to drop

566
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:52,160
And descendants of 7 is

567
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:56,768
Are there a corporate or federal rules and regulations that govern

568
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,560
A transfer of data

569
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:00,608
Alright give him those 7 reasons

570
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,632
What is h

571
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:02,912
Have. For hair

572
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:05,216
Hpe offers both

573
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:09,824
The cloud approach to doing analytics in the aisle seat and also the edge approach

574
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,360
Two doing analytics in the iot

575
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:14,176
Depending on what is needed we offer very deep

576
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:14,944

Aerobus manageability

578
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:22,112
And we manifested those

579
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:24,928
It systems Analytics

580

Keep computing

581
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:27,232
Accelerate insight

582
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:30,304
Sherwin new product line called edgeline systems

583
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,608
East Edge line systems converge

584
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:37,472
D Computing with enterprise-class manageability right at the edge computing

585
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:38,496

Concours out of the edge

587
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:43,872
Where can we find out more about Hewlett-Packard

588
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:46,688
You can find more by going to our website

589
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:48,992

590
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:55,392
Flash iot alright thank you

591
00:23:55,648 --> 00:24:01,792
Hey everyone this is Stacey Higginbotham and we are back with the Internet of Things podcast

592
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:06,144
Today's guest is Mike Wolfe who is the creator of the smart Kitchen Summit

593
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,192
And an analyst who covers this Ma

594
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,984
Hey Mike how are you doing

595
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:11,776
You forgot friend of the show

596
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:15,360
Download why did I forgot friendship not just a friend of the show but if

597
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,128
A friend of mine

598
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,432
Work together known each other

599
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,200
For a long time

600
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:22,528
Before I had this show and even worked with him at gigaom I used to

601
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:24,064
Call him because he was a

602
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:26,624
Your wireless analyst covering things like Bluetooth

603
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:29,440
Wireless in digital home

604
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:32,000
At ABI research way-back-when about 10 years ago

605
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:33,024
I know

606
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,048
We're so old

607
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:34,816
We are

608
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:35,840
I'm old

609
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:37,888
You look the same I've got a lot of gray hair

610
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,960
I'm a vampire in

611
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:41,728
You got gray hair

612
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:42,752
Here we go

613
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:44,800
So Mike you recently did

614
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:46,592
This event is smart

615
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:48,128
Kitchen Summit which was

616
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:48,896
Awesome

617
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:50,688
I loved it I loved attending it

618
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:52,736
And I walked away from it and I said

619
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,552
Bismarck kitchen is dumb

620
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,368
So that was my take

621
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:00,160
You'd loved it

622
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,696
But then you said this Market

623
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:02,464
Is dumb

624
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,256
You know nothing works together

625
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:05,792
You tell me

626
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,584
What is the smart

627
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,680
Kitchen what is this tell me what your vision is here

628
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:14,240
It's about

629
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:18,080
New technologies coming into the kitchen surrounding food

630
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:23,456
And in just kind of hoping to reinvent that way then that's something as simple as that connected

631
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,480
Meat thermometer

632
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:27,296
To something like the juicero which isn't it

633
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,576
Like an entire

634
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:32,928
Indecision trees were like an ecosystem where this is complete vertical integration

635
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:34,208
Based on the fact that

636
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,512
Music connected device

637
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:38,048
It looks up and down

638
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,584
Of the supply chain

639
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,168
There's a lot of different aspects to it enough reasonable to read mention of cooking

640
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:45,216
Was that Sia Precision cooking

641
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:47,264
Etc there's just a lot of different

642
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,616
Things that are now trying to change the way we cook Away by food we eat

643
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:55,712
That's one of the reasons I wanted Savannah just kind of Explorer all that together

644
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:56,480
So

645
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:58,784
Let's break this down because you have

646
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,832
Basically cover the entire

647
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:03,648
Basically what you're talking about is like adding intelligence to the

648
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:05,952
Where is the most

649
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,816
Stuff happening where is the real like where where we making actual strides here

650
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:12,352
There's obviously

651
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:18,752
Big Appliance makers that are looking at okay now we can actually connect these things at intelligence

652
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:21,568
And have data you know we've never really had

653
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:25,664
If you're an appliance manufacturer even you're a food maker you never had

654
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,456
Point of consumption data

655
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,480
Before

656
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:31,552
And so that's actually possible you're starting to see

657
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:36,928
These platforms be put in place with an arsenic in it but also you know, like perfect company

658
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:43,584
Jackie spun out of data business I'm were there actually doing datametrics for people who sell things like vodka

659
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:44,864
And they can give you

660
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:51,520
Did around the types of drinks people are making it in Fairly real time so that's actually pretty fascinating stuff all that

661
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:54,592
Information that Sgt based probably on surveys before

662
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:56,640
Or Nielsen type of panels

663
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:58,688
That's why I think that's really exciting

664
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:00,736
If you're some sort of company that

665
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:03,808
The mix food or provides consumables into the home

666
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:05,088
Okay and we should

667
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:07,392
Stop here and say the perfect company

668
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:08,416
Makes

669
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:10,208
It's a scale

670
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:10,976
For the kitchen

671
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,000
And

672
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:15,584
It is a scale that can be used to measure out cocktails

673
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:17,120
Stood for baking

674
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:19,680
Or even they just launched at your show

675
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:20,960
Making like

676
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:22,240
Smoothies in a blender

677
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:23,776
That's

678
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:25,568
For everyone who's like what who's this

679
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:31,968
It's a cheap scale it's a cheap scale but it's a skill that actually provides metrics they actually partnered with Vitamix

680
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,760
Two people probably know from

681
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:37,088
People making platters slender Evergreen

682
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,392
And they met last year might have been

683
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,416
I think big

684
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:46,816
Harder makers who sell stuff in the small pint division at Target or whatever want to make these things more intelligent

685
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:49,632
Where you at you and I know that this is true that is okay

686
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:52,960
What can you do with that makes it interesting I think

687
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:54,240
Xiaomi providing data metric

688
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:57,568
To the people are selling food and somebody that is interesting

689
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:04,224
Prophetic a lot of it's about like how can you make the consumers lives better cuz the consumers who's the one who puts down the hard-earned cash

690
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,320
Two different themes I saw emerging out of this as you know

691
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:11,392
Automation and intelligence could be out at 2

692
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,672
Devices for cooking

693
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:14,464
So let's go into this cuz

694
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:15,744
There are

695
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:19,328
I heard two kind of different audiences kind of jumped out at me

696
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:20,096
83

697
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:21,120
At your show

698
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,144
When was

699
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:26,752
We're going to teach people who don't know how to cook how to cook cuz Millennials have grown up and they know nothing about cooking

700
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,080
To was

701
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:31,616
People who want to make

702
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:34,176
Crazy fancy or esoteric stuff

703
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:36,480
Like the picobrew and all the sous vide

704
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:42,624
And there's the Practical Cooks who just want a fast dinner on the table this is me I was bugging people I was like

705
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:48,512
When can you have something that looks at what I have in cheddar it's a grocery list or looks at my family's likes it is like

706
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:49,280
Like cures like

707
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:51,328
4 meals you can make this week in less than 30

708
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,120
So

709
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:56,448
Starting with that let's talk about what you saw for the kind of

710
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:57,984
Learn docker

711
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,544
Can a fancy expertise kind of

712
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,312
Area

713
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:03,104
What interesting things I think

714
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,944
A lot of the same underlying technology service both of those archetypes

715
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,480
Is Iran a panel

716
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:11,552
During the day and we talked about this some of these archetypes

717
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:13,856
What are things we can I reach the conclusion of

718
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:15,392
I may be one of these

719
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,672
These people in the middle wig

720
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:18,208
And I may be a different person

721
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:20,512
On the weekend so if I'm tired

722
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:22,304
My kids are beating it out for me

723
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,608
I know I have to provide them with some food I made

724
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:25,632
Have some sort of

725
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:28,960
Device that has a web automation that makes my life easier

726
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:35,360
Button on the weekend I want maybe some sort of guidance to give me a safety net to take my scrap a higher level

727
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:38,944
I don't know if you served those two audiences with the same piece of technology

728
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:41,504
Maybe you can with something like a thermomix

729
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:48,160
Or or something like the Hess in Q thermomix is like I had never heard of this but this is like

730
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,952
$1,800 piece of

731
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:56,096
It's a crazy I have one of my house I'm trying it out it's mainly been sold in Europe

732
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:58,912
To the tune of a couple million a year

733
00:29:59,168 --> 00:29:59,936
Well in Europe

734
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:02,496
Just now bringing it to the US it's

735
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:05,056
It's a device that's like one of these 10 in one devices

736
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:06,592
It's like the instant pot

737
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:07,360
Steroids

738
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:09,408
Is it is it is

739
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:13,504
But it's not when he's crazy and if you seen in these are craske robotic

740
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:16,576
Types of cooking devices from somebody San Francisco

741
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:19,136
Took him to sing is more

742
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:21,696
Two more practical and then ready for Market

743
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:24,512
To get back to where you asked about there are these different

744
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:25,280
Audiences

745
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:29,632
A lot of the same technology in particular Automation and in some sort of like intelligence

746
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:30,656
Surenos

747
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,960
But ultimately is probably different type of product

748
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:39,104
That is serving those types of people and we have both cuz I I have two practical me that I have like the guy wants

749
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,384
To be like a better home chef

750
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,456
What seems like a good idea for

751
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:44,480
People who are like

752
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:49,088
For People Like Us in the middle of the week

753
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:50,112
My weekday shift

754
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:54,976
Acting like a really cool party sure could be something like the Artesian like actually some sort of like robotic

755
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:57,792
Drink mixer I think with itin terrible mixing drinks

756
00:30:58,048 --> 00:31:00,096
That was another start that we had

757
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:03,680
Call the bar startups I will say I love them and Theory

758
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:05,216
And for a party trick

759
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:11,872
But they all have these tubes and you got to fill things up with alcohol

760
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:18,272
I feel like something like that the scales are a little bit nicer because you could just stick everything on there and they take care

761
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:19,296
Portions for

762
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:25,952
I will say it having you use the thermomix which is a scale bass system that there's real utility there cuz you just

763
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,536
You're literally just pouring drinks in it and you watch the little

764
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:31,840
Geico

765
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:33,120
So you're right that actually

766
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:37,472
That works really well scale BAE systems work really well if you

767
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:41,056
Don't want to pull up measuring cups to catch raso

768
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:45,408
Yeah

769
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:48,480
The Gooden Center I think it was called the the Nema

770
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:50,784
I like that I mean I do think

771
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,552
Having

772
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:54,112
Routers with serious food allergies

773
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:56,160
If that they could provide some sort of

774
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:58,208
Device where they can go out

775
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:02,304
Teeter or even something at home then know that they're not going to flake pop up like a

776
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:03,328
Puffer fish

777
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:05,120
I think there's real value in that

778
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:08,448
Those are just a couple of Pokemon that I think there's a lot of different technology

779
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:10,496
Did you try the juicero juice did you like it

780
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:11,776
I did like the juicero

781
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:13,568
Snail to me this feels

782
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:15,104
Less like a home Gadget

783
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:16,896
More like a

784
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:18,688
A commercial kitchen kind of

785
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:20,224
Anything because

786
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:23,296
There are two things that I learned about

787
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:26,624
Did you Sarah is a $700 device

788
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:29,440
What is 5 to $7

789
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:31,488
Packets and it's cold pressed

790
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,816
Juice in the ingredients take hold the whole time

791
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:38,144
The first thing that was really cool is

792
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:41,984
The CEO is trying to build a business around basically

793
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,008
Iot everywhere

794
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,568
So he's taking for granted that he's got to guarantee

795
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:47,616
Cold Supply Chain which is really awesome

796
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:48,896
Cuz that's

797
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:52,224
So far been really hard to do really Out Of Reach unless you're like

798
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:52,992
Like really wealthy

799
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,016
Refrigerated

800
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:55,808
Tracks right

801
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:57,600
That I didn't know is that

802
00:32:57,856 --> 00:33:03,232
These juice packets because they're fresh fruits and vegetables you can actually use them in cooking which I thought

803
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:04,000
It's kind of fun

804
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:05,792
The reason I wanted

805
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:11,424
Him to get out season 2 like a kind of almost a case study because Lake Easton something really unique way

806
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,472
What you would do with this end-to-end

807
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:14,752
From the home all the way back

808
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:16,544
Supply chain created this entire

809
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:19,104
Secretion and delivery system

810
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,432
If he talked about how he tried to go out and talk to food processing plants

811
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:23,456
Create this

812
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:24,224
In Dino

813
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:27,808
Tino Martinez, she really did that in her how much she had this vision is headphone

814
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:28,576
Beginning

815
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:31,904
Yeah that's why they raised on $1000000 to kind of Bill out this entire

816
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,696
Everything I think you're right

817
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:36,768
I think initially it'll do well in

818
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:39,072
Restaurants near Michael vultaggio

819
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:40,608
This that's what we chef

820
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:41,888
He really said about the juicer

821
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:45,216
Because he says don't want to necessarily put cold pressed juice

822
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:46,496
Juicers in there in there

823
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:48,288
Space-constrained kitchens

824
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,592
I also they're going to do well in my

825
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,176
Cafeterias like places like Google

826
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:56,992
High-end cafeterias within not Heinz Ketchup

827
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:03,648
But over time if they get to the point where they can reduce the cost and I could see you like this one really popular

828
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,464
I think you get it pulled out of three or four in the dollar price point

829
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:10,816
This is a premium product people who get cold pressed juice or not

830
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:12,096
People hurting for money

831
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:15,424
They're willing to spend $10 at retail for a glass of juice

832
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,448
So I don't think this

833
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:19,264
The sticker shock of $7 is really that shocking to them

834
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,080
Cuz they have this lifestyle with their want to spend that type of money

835
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:23,360
That is a lot of money

836
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:29,760
That was one of the other things I noticed so all of these devices that you know oven is $1,500 I can't remember

837
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:31,296
How much the hestan cue

838
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:33,856
Cooking setup which is a pan and

839
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,160
Induction cooker that

840
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:39,488
You don't know what's the temperature of the pan and what you're trying to cook it

841
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,512
Basically cook set

842
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,816
All of these things feel

843
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:47,424
Like I don't know you remember bread machines from like the 80s

844
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,448
They feel like

845
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:49,216
Bread machine

846
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:49,984
Switch

847
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:54,592
You know everyone loves warm baked bread but very few people kept their bread machine somewhere like

848
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,896
Yeah. I'm still making it

849
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:01,248
When asked

850
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,320
Chris Young chefsteps hear what is going to be

851
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:07,648
The fondue Machine versus like something that has

852
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:09,440
Real sticking power that's still

853
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:11,232
Ultimate Eternal question ever talk about

854
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,072
New devices in the kitchen cuz if you know it's kind of become a cliche now

855
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:18,656
Major Innovation microwave in the microwave

856
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:19,936
So you know

857
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:26,336
I hope you know I was just going back into asking a damn Visa buys it and I know what's going on with your cooking tonight

858
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:27,616
That's really interesting to me

859
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:29,152
Cruises embracing that

860
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:31,200
Cuz I feel like that that's really interesting

861
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:36,832
The guys from Nova Steve got up and talked about okay we want to do a Combi oven I sent you a copy of them for the kitchen

862
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:41,952
No one's really down a really good consumer, Ava and end in does no doubt that steam actually adds water

863
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:44,000
An oven that has

864
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:47,584
You know heating but I'll sounds like steam Alamance excetera Apso

865
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,120
They're really popular in

866
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:52,192
In professional kitchens but no one's really consumer eyes. Well

867
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,728
So

868
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:55,264
That is the ultimate ROM

869
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:59,616
Question what is a gadget in like a parlor trick versus what has real staying power

870
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:06,272
I don't think that all these things are expensive we talked about the high price but I think you know you're obviously sing low price sous vide circulator as you have another perfect

871
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:07,040
Scale

872
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:08,576
Any price went down there

873
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:11,136
What sticks is can be really interesting

874
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:16,256
I think the appliance manufacturers big Appliance manufacturers embracing things like in it is really interesting

875
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:21,120
How fast has become common features and how much consumers use those walls also be interesting to watch

876
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:22,656
Okay fair enough

877
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:23,680
And then

878
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:27,520
I feel like cooking and kitchens today like everything's pretty attitude

879
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:31,104
Even if I get like another device in my

880
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:31,872
My kitchen

881
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:33,408
Is there anything that

882
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:36,736
We're going to replace so should I be like hey

883
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:38,784
My next house isn't going to have

884
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:40,064
Adamant

885
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,392
I didn't like I-4 like in in 10 years my house will have a thermostat

886
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,160
Right

887
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:48,256
Some people like you won't carry Keys is there anything in the kitchen that you're like

888
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:49,024
Hey

889
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,072
Stacey you're going to get rid of your garbage.

890
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,120
I don't know I don't know

891
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:58,240
If you get rid of things I think that's one of the things we're talking about on the first day is like

892
00:36:58,752 --> 00:36:59,520
Jonny Gray

893
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:01,568
Talk about your there's only so much space you have

894
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:02,592
Anyang

895
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:03,616
Kitchen countertops

896
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:06,688
That is a real consideration Bachelor

897
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,736
You're fighting for space

898
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:11,040
And so if something comes maybe something else

899
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:11,808
To go

900
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,880
So that's really interesting conversation I think that's why

901
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:17,696
People like home builders need to be part of this conversation

902
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:19,232
I think that's Broderick

903
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:20,768
The Justice smart kitchen right I think

904
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,304
Overtime

905
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:24,864
As more technology comes into our lives

906
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,912
We have technology goes into the fabric of

907
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:29,472
The countertops in the beams and all that

908
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:32,800
Like that's a really interesting conversation to have

909
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:35,104
So the built-in appliances

910
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,152
If you build an appliance like an oven

911
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:39,456
And it has technology for home builder

912
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:42,016
You better make sure that that has a lifespan of

913
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:43,296
10 / 20 years

914
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:45,344
And Samsung doesn't decide to say

915
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:49,184
Okay we're going to move on because we thought this would be really great I did have a Twitter client

916
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:50,464
In our oven

917
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:52,000
So we could

918
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:52,768
What is baking

919
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,352
Now it's not going to work this we decided not to support that software anymore so

920
00:37:56,864 --> 00:38:03,008
I don't know if I answer your question directly as in the say I think that's a big important conversation for not only the pipe like home builders accept

921
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:04,800
You did not answer me

922
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:10,688
But that's okay I'm just thinking back like high-end kitchens now usually have to have a wine

923
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:12,224
4hr beverage fridge

924
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:13,248
The kitchen

925
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:19,648
And that's probably the last big new appliances microwave but I think wine fridges

926
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:20,416
Probably

927
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:25,536
Settle Inn

928
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:32,448
I think if you're just talking about small appliances that's a limited conversation to mean old family the appliances we buy or getting

929
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:34,240
Smarter whether that's like a

930
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:37,824
Adding Wi-Fi or Bluetooth to a coffee maker

931
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:42,688
But I also think it's going to go beyond that so there's a lot of starts doing things like okay how can we

932
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:43,456
Do

933
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:47,040
Right pantries that are smarter to kind of know what's in there and in

934
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:48,576
And how does that work

935
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:49,600
How does a

936
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:53,184
I drink a grocery list I really do I want

937
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:54,720
My kitchen to tell me

938
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:57,024
What I need to buy to make

939
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:58,048
My Nail Spa

940
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:01,120
And you want it to happen where it's not more work

941
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:01,888
Write like

942
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:03,424
That's the challenges like

943
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,192
Don't make

944
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:06,752
Give me at like something like a smart refrigerator

945
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:13,664
We're have to like inventory everything and read NFC tags like that just sounds like a nightmare so I think the challenge these guys is

946
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:16,480
Making things work better

947
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:22,880
I think the Samsung family Hub refrigerator was interesting I think the image recognition Technologies get

948
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:23,904
Anymore Basswood

949
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:25,952
I don't feel like it's quite there yet

950
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:27,232
I do feel like

951
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:28,512
With the Giant

952
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,072
Yeah yeah yeah

953
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:33,632
So we focus on the tablet because it is freaking

954
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:38,240
Ridiculous but inside it also has computer vision to recognize what's inside

955
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:40,288
Yeah you play with on the ratchet

956
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,336
It's pretty cool cuz you can do

957
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:43,616
Dragon soul

958
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:46,432
This has to be really hard to explain on the podcast

959
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:48,992
Speak to some limitations of Audio Only format

960
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:49,760
It's

961
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:53,856
Has a huge screen on the front and you can see inside and you can

962
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:56,160
Take your finger and say okay this item

963
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:59,744
The smoke I bought two on Tuesday and fairly quickly doing

964
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:01,024
Add a date to it

965
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:02,048
So it's

966
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,072
There's some

967
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:05,888
Pretty interesting features around adding

968
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:08,448
Inventory and making sure it has time stamps on a butt

969
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,752
Still a little bit too much work

970
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,544
Right now I just put a thing in the

971
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,104
Colony milk in the fridge and you know when it's gone it's gone

972
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:16,384
Or if it's chunky

973
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,152
Well Ico

974
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:24,320
But I've been really trying for last year just me personally you know cuz I've had the stomach to think about the food I buy

975
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:26,880
Because I waste so much food Stacy and for you to like

976
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:28,672
Maybe you're better than person I am but

977
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:30,464
I waste a lot of food I hate it

978
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:33,536
Like and I haven't found technology help me really good

979
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:34,304
My arms are on that

980
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:37,376
Exo-m better than you but I'm going to recommend

981
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:38,912
A wonderful curry recipe

982
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:40,448
Knorr vegetable soup recipe

983
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,472
Awesome

984
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:43,776
Quikrete

985
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:50,432
Put him in the show know I'll put that in the show I have leftover vegetables

986
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:51,456
Wasted

987
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,016
Final thoughts

988
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:55,040
How long

989
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:57,600
Let's say let's say I wanted to make a smart

990
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:58,368
Kitchen

991
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,696
And I wanted to do so before the holidays at this year

992
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:05,536
What would you recommend for people to get into it now and

993
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,840
What do you think I should wait on

994
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:09,888
I would suggest

995
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:16,288
Maybe buying like like I don't I don't want to push specific companies like I think it's scales good way to go I think that's how you got started on

996
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:18,080
The orange Chef scale

997
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:19,616
The drop scale

998
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:26,272
That's kind of a good Swiss army knife at a low-cost point I think you know you can get the perfect scale for like the $50 price

999
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,552
Makes a lot of sense

1000
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:28,576
I think

1001
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:34,976
If you want to try Precision cooking anything could get a sous-vide machine for you know hundred to $200 that's a good way

1002
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:36,768
Obviously you know this guy

1003
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:39,840
Freely if we're going to take the new sheptoff one is coming out in May

1004
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:41,888
Wood product investment in their software

1005
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,936
Around daddy cooking

1006
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:46,240
So that's an interesting one

1007
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:49,312
And you know just to talk about replenishment

1008
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:55,711
I have diesel Dash buttons around my house that's I think that's part of Connecticut as well just Auto

1009
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:56,991
Refinishing

1010
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:57,759
Your kitchen

1011
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,039
What supplies

1012
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:00,575
Using the dash button

1013
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:02,623
The normal street are they five bucks Maybe

1014
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:04,415
If I bust minus a credit

1015
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:05,183
First order Sith

1016
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:10,303
So longer-term I think you I I don't even know 7

1017
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:13,631
Brewing beer with my picobrew at by backing on Kickstarter

1018
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:15,935
It's got a few Kinks to work out

1019
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:17,215
But it's actually

1020
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:18,751
Pretty easy to brew beer

1021
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:21,567
So that's what happened if you want to spend a little more money

1022
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:22,335
I might be up

1023
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:25,663
That's probably who I think six or seven dollars post Kickstarter

1024
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:26,687
Is your beer any good

1025
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:27,967
It is good

1026
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:31,295
Every all of my friends

1027
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:32,319
Homebrewing expire

1028
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:36,671
I would hesitate

1029
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:43,583
That's why I schiphol like let's do it in my bathtub phase and I had said when technology makes us where I can make it

1030
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:45,631
Easy I'm going to do it then so

1031
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:46,911
That's why I backed

1032
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:49,471
A Kickstarter what is connected bedroom appliances

1033
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:53,311
And then what about the apply if you were going to buy an appliance

1034
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:56,895
Like a dedicated cooking appliance what would you

1035
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:58,687
Firewood you wait on those

1036
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:01,503
I would wait cuz I think price is going to come down

1037
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:04,319
I'm Cermak and spend over $1,000 on a

1038
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:06,367
But you know what I think some people might

1039
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:09,695
But I think you're going to see those overtime come down in price

1040
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:11,999
And I see no one thing to talk about my panels

1041
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:13,791
How do we get the entry to work

1042
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:14,559
Together

1043
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:16,863
You know if you're a Whirlpool within it

1044
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,655
Will that work with the Samsung

1045
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:21,727
Dishwasher you know I live in a multi-vendor

1046
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:24,799
Kitchen like I don't have like all one manufacturer

1047
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:29,663
So I want to see a world where all the stuff starts at work together so that's a conversation that she needs to have

1048
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:31,199
Yes and they're totally not having

1049
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:35,551
More depressed than ever after listening to the Jenn-Air Keitel

1050
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:36,831
Well

1051
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:38,623
We don't necessarily want to

1052
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:40,159
Work with others because we want our stuff

1053
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:43,231
We want you to buy all eight appliances from us

1054
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:47,327
That was what I was trying to get you on my mind

1055
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,607
Buckeye Lake industry

1056
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:49,887
Have this conversation

1057
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:51,167
Because

1058
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:52,703
In the real world

1059
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:58,335
Stacy and Mike's the world moved into the house and it had like a KitchenAid refrigerator

1060
00:43:58,591 --> 00:44:00,127
But then I bought this dishwasher

1061
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:01,407
And I don't

1062
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:03,711
1up 10 apps to try to make them all work together

1063
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:05,759
All right

1064
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:09,087
Will Mike thanks so much for coming on the show I really appreciate it

1065
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:09,855
