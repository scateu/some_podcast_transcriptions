00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:18,688
Are you guys here

6
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:19,456
Talk about

7
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:21,504
European

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,272
Appliance

9
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:24,832
Bad bottoms from AT&T

10
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:27,136
Cat M1 testing and after

11
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:30,464
And a big philosophical debate about what makes

12
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:35,072
Brother

13
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:36,352
Receipt

14
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:37,120
Keep them coming

15
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:38,656
And we've got

16
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:43,776
A message from one of our sponsors for track which actually just raised 88 million dollars this week

17
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,824
And our guest

18
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:48,128
Landon borders Who is the

19
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:52,224
Head of connected products at I can't say the full name of the company but is the big

20
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,760
Beep fanco

21
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:56,320
You can talk about what they've learned

22
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:58,112
By jumping in early into the

23
00:00:58,368 --> 00:00:58,880
The connected Prada

24
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:00,416
And it's a really good interview

25
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:02,464
Stay tuned for all of that

26
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:03,488
But first

27
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:04,256
Another message

28
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,328
This response

29
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,704
Did you know on average it takes companies 18 months to lunch and iot connected product

30
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,568
But it doesn't have to get your product into the hands of your customers faster with cycling

31
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:23,968
Go from concept to connected in 4 months or less and get everything you need to run your connected product business cycle

32
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:30,368
Play offers everything needed to get up and running including Hardware integration a launch ready mobile app

33
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:36,768
And if I stayed up and prebuilt Integrations with tools like salesforce.com that's

34
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:43,168
I v e l y. Com for more information

35
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,192
Now

36
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:45,472
Moving on

37
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:46,496
To Eva

38
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:49,056
Oh Kevin I wish I was there

39
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,616
You know I feel the same way I have

40
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:53,664
Turn down going so many times

41
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,480
In the past and this year I think I'm good at most

42
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:59,040
Of all just because of all the connected products

43
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,320
Disappointed

44
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:03,904
So having never been this feels like it might be even more fun for a smart home

45
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:05,440
You know

46
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:11,584
UCS was always I think that big show to go to 4

47
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,656
Phones tablets and such but even that has bled over into

48
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:19,520
Even more this year and then because the smart home and iot categories are growing

49
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:22,592
There's just tons of stuff at you for this year and in that segment

50
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:24,384
So we were going to talk about.

51
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:25,408
The Crazy Ones

52
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:26,432
Since neither of us

53
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:31,808
Woot Germany hearing

54
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,344
All right all right

55
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:34,880
I was excited

56
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:35,904
Because higher

57
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:39,232
French

58
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:41,280
All right

59
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:42,560
If you know me

60
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:44,352
You know I'm super psyched about this

61
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:46,656
Kitchen talking about

62
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:51,008
Bridges I'm like I don't want to touch pad on it I just want a camera so I can see what's in there

63
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:51,776
So

64
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:52,800
Higher history

65
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,592
And this is their link

66
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:55,360
Cook series / 4

67
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,688
The next cool thing they did is not just attic

68
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,224
They also

69
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:03,040
Let's see what's in your fridge at offers you a recipe

70
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,088
What's for dinner tonight

71
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,184
I like that because then you don't to worry about

72
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,976
What ingredient to do or don't have

73
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,256
You can just say hey fridge

74
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,536
You know what I have what can I make

75
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:18,912
Right so the freaking come with 10 ideas that you would live on your own and you don't have to go run out and buy anything else

76
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,448
See this is where they

77
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:23,008
Like even I'll just say it IBM's Watson

78
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,032
The chef

79
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:26,080
Contact would be really interesting

80
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,360
Although many of those recipe

81
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,408
Having

82
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:31,200
I'll take you guys I own the shuffle

83
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:38,112
Time into these kind of databases feels fun

84
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,904
My concern is in

85
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,440
There's no details on pricing

86
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:43,744
When the sun be out so right now consider this kind

87
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,304
But what I'm worried about is

88
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,120
We're going to get these stupid like limits on

89
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:53,728
Because we don't have like a unified recipe format really yet

90
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,520
You're going to have to use the following

91
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,544
Place to get your recipe

92
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,848
And really I want my recipes from

93
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,640
Wherever I want all recipes

94
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,712
Recipe

95
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,248
Annie Frazier

96
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,808
Open source recipes

97
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,880
So hopefully that's going to happen

98
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:11,648
Right now it's

99
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,208
What we're getting today is things like

100
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:16,000
Drop which is the maker of a connected

101
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,839
To do the recipes for all of ge's connect

102
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:24,191
We just got news this week that sidechef is going to

103
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:26,751
Do the recipes for sharps u.s. Appliance

104
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,543
Is swelling good

105
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,871
This is really a first world problem

106
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:32,895
Like oh my God

107
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,991
A recipe online I'm not going to be able to have my oven

108
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,015
Automatic

109
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:42,879
Two things one yet I'm glad you mentioned drop because I was going to bring it up

110
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:43,647
Because

111
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:45,951
Drophead me that Bluetooth connected scale

112
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,231
Maybe 2 years ago

113
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:50,303
And it would do something sort of similar in that

114
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,583
If you didn't have

115
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,375
Maybe sugar for a recipe

116
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:56,447
It would recommend what you might have instead and it would

117
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:59,519
Yo Gotti wait and tell you exactly how much of a substitute it was

118
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,567
Not to the scale of a fridge that could

119
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,591
Do all this obviously

120
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:08,735
Number one and the other thing is this gets back to that question that we asked a show or two ago are you buying Hardware or a service

121
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:12,319
It's so cool to have a connected fridge with a camera and everything else

122
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:18,719
What is the service light that goes with it who runs it where's that day to come from and then all the other obvious IRT question security

123
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:20,255
Personalized data Etc

124
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:24,095
You got to think about where they're going to get this information from her recipes

125
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:28,191
I wouldn't buy this fridge unless I knew it had a broad range of recipes for example

126
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,215
I agree

127
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:31,263
Because otherwise it's just to be like tonight

128
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,543
I see you have a cat

129
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,847
Crunch cereal

130
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,127
But I want

131
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,919
Captain Crunch crusted trout

132
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,551
I don't actually

133
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:47,391
Also in really cool and random

134
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,671
Bridges we have

135
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,695
Panasonic

136
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:51,231
Connected sake fridge

137
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,511
Which is basically

138
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:54,303
I feel like anybody who

139
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:58,399
Was an engineering student in college probably built one of these it's a fridge that you can

140
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,423
Call to you

141
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:01,983
And it will come to you and bring you your

142
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:02,751
In this case

143
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,031
Sake I'm sure it would also

144
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:06,079
They sold in the us to bring new cold beer

145
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:09,407
Just tiny little fridge looks like it sits on top of a Roomba

146
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:12,479
Has voice commands and

147
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:15,039
It's got lighter so it can map its way around your home

148
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,343
Just feel like Africa

149
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:20,671
Yes yes yes

150
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:27,327
Yes I had a R2D2 programmable robot couple years back and I actually

151
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:31,935
Metal extendable arm I read program the route from the fridge to my

152
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:34,239
Temperature in the TV and I would have it

153
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,263
Bring me a beer

154
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:40,895
Unfortunately it couldn't reach into the fridge to get a beer or store and everything so somebody

155
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,199
Put the beer in the armpit

156
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:43,967
Get the

157
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:44,991
Idealist

158
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:53,439
Since this looks like a concept or talk to anybody been putting like

159
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,999
This isn't actually for the Fret set

160
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,047
Have Mobility

161
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:01,631
Yeah my son has parties all the time

162
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:08,287
It's a sucky fridge but it's for people with Mobility problems and I'm not saying the people with Mobility problems aren't drink

163
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,055
Sake

164
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:13,151
So okay that probably does it for the

165
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:13,919
Crazy

166
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:20,319
Fridge stuff I just got to restate for the record that I do not think a fridge really needs a giant touchscreen on the front

167
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:22,623
Even though manufacturers are really trying to sell this

168
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,671
Alright just you know

169
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:25,951
If you disagree

170
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:26,719
Can call and let me know

171
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:27,999
I'm or Justine

172
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,559
So I also saw I didn't see

173
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:31,839
Coverage of

174
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,631
A washing machine that looks pretty cool

175
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:36,447
It is the AG 9000 series from

176
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,215
Okapi

177
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,495
And it is a

178
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:40,287
Combo washing machine and dryer

179
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,079
Not the US market

180
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:45,663
Because we are giant space pigs who have room

181
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,431
For both

182
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:50,527
What this does is it has all kinds of sensors

183
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,063
To detect

184
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,855
Your Washington is

185
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:54,879
How much

186
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:58,207
Washing is actually in there and then it also can detect

187
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:00,511
The type of clothes

188
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,279
Fabric

189
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,327
And we'll wash it based on that

190
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:09,215
I'd be curious how does this and I'm actually interested in something like that because

191
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:11,519
From my running gear which is snow all

192
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:14,591
Berkeley polyester Dri-Fit stuff Nike or whoever

193
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:17,407
You're not supposed to use fabric softener on those

194
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,687
And sometimes I forget

195
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:21,759
And it'd be nice to have this stuff automatically

196
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:25,343
Detective don't put in the fabric softener you know cuz it'll just

197
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:31,743
I'm thinking they'll just dropping fabric softener automatically but you know if I need a shower or not suck

198
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,023
Yes 4 all that money

199
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:36,863
So I'd like to hear a curious how they can tell the different Fabrics apart

200
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:40,191
I talk to people from like P&G and they talk about you.

201
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,471
Either having messaging

202
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,519
Indications on the tags

203
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:48,127
Or just being able I mean if you think about a camera it could look at the fabric

204
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:53,247
Other option because then you could really tell Lake

205
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:56,319
The Weave based on maybe not later but at 3 DC

206
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,623
What that feels like

207
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,767
Also you should not dry

208
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,303
You should always

209
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,655
I know I know so I don't even know why you're sticking

210
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:11,679
Dryer in the fur

211
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,263
All right but this is

212
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,543
This is not a show about laundry

213
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,639
Let's talk

214
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,919
You know what else happened

215
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:22,943
This is not even news

216
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:24,735
Cool stuff from

217
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,575
Juicero

218
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,623
Down last week

219
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:31,647
And guys

220
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,671
Sweet wine

221
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:35,487
You may recognize juicero we talked about it

222
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:38,047
A couple times it was a $700

223
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,839
Cold pressed juice machine

224
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:40,607
They later dropped

225
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:41,631
Price $400

226
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:42,911
But

227
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,191
Really what it was

228
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:44,959
Is

229
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:45,983
Service

230
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,519
That was trying to bring you

231
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,287
Fresh

232
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,567
Vegetables get you

233
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,591
Eat your vegetables

234
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:51,359
Convenient easy way

235
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:52,639
Fortunately

236
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:53,919
Crazy expensive

237
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:55,967
Very tough distribution model

238
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:56,735
Because

239
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,271
These cold pressed juices only

240
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,551
I kept for like 7 days

241
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,319
And

242
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,855
Is very expensive cookware

243
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:03,903
Yeah it's almost like they took the

244
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,695
Razer Blade Pro

245
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:08,255
To this by saying we'll make up a lot of money on

246
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:12,607
Description in the juices and saucer with the hardware itself was just so darn expensive

247
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,143
Hardware was not

248
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,359
I don't know

249
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,127
I don't know

250
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,919
So yes and

251
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:28,479
I caution companies were building connected products

252
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:29,503
Hardware

253
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,807
To think about this are you really selling Hardware

254
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:32,575
If you aren't

255
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:34,623
Don't spend too much on it

256
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,391
Because

257
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,463
That is sadness

258
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,559
I'm not surprised

259
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,143
So yeah

260
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,679
If you have it you Sarah though

261
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,007
This is not a product that can be really replicated

262
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:53,055
So you bought something that

263
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,847
There are no other things to fit into it

264
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:57,663
Keurig when they stop producing cake

265
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,943
Cups

266
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:01,503
My life would not go on for me

267
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,599
Yeah okay

268
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,903
Now into

269
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:08,927
A little bit of

270
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:12,511
Industrialist news we've got this is not Industrial

271
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,279
This is

272
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,559
Security Eros

273
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:15,839
Kevin Wendt

274
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:21,727
We are so if you have AT&T U-verse

275
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:28,127
Service and you have an Arris modem router or Gateway that was provided by AT&T I guess where you could have

276
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:32,479
About yourself listen up because no motion security

277
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:37,855
Has said we found five laws that are so easy to

278
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:40,159
Pax that we just go public with it

279
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:44,767
Fact they didn't even go to the vendor like I normally do with a waiting. To see if Eros would fix it

280
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:51,167
They just went public with it so there's a couple of issues here and I think we should have a link to the new motion

281
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,191
Blog because they

282
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:56,799
They show how you can close some of these holes and that's what they are there holes

283
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,335
Cute cute cute

284
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:00,639
And to be fair I think some of these

285
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,943
May have been included for

286
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,735
AT&T 2

287
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:11,391
Provide customer service get logs and things like that that's not an excuse I think this is inexcusable I think regardless of Harrisburg

288
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:16,767
Reducing is modems AT&T is the service provider and they are the ones that should be on the hook to fix this in my opinion.

289
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:17,791
That's just me

290
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:20,095
One of the issues is

291
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:22,655
The exposure of an SSH

292
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:23,423
Shell

293
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,959
Remote access

294
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:27,263
To the internet from these routers

295
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,287
And

296
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:32,895
Username or password is hard-coded right in the firmware so you have

297
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:38,783
Access to have access to the mall so that is not good there other default credentials that are sitting in there that are just

298
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:45,183
Available for people exploit not good Motel said I see basically it just too many ways of poor

299
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:49,791
That's open for remote access that shouldn't be open just not good at all

300
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,327
Indeed

301
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:56,959
And you got a little rule in here saying you shouldn't be renting your modem about 80% of people in the US

302
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:58,495
Apparently do get their modem

303
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,519
Straight from there is

304
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:05,919
Please stop please stop people from 2 that there's actually some interesting things that are developing with the internet of things here

305
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,199
Will just take a note 2

306
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:09,503
Talk about it if you are a Comcast customer

307
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:12,831
You actually have to get their modem and Gateway because it's got software that

308
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:14,879
Works with their Pokemon

309
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:19,999
What's happening there is Comcast is like

310
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,279
Trying to make that

311
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,815
I think it's up to $10 a month

312
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,375
A little bit more worthwhile

313
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,167
But

314
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:27,935
If they're doing

315
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:29,471
They should darn well make sure the

316
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:37,151
I'm I'm okay with paying a modem rental fee if you're going to have those additional features or years we paid a fee for just

317
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,431
Access Electric

318
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,199
Terrible

319
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:43,039
Not to mention the other reason I had this rule is as one you can save money by

320
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:45,343
Getting a cheaper modem never launched

321
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:47,135
The third-party routers

322
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,671
Offer features

323
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,951
Far faster

324
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:56,351
For earache far faster than what is provided by the isps you know today we got Mesh networking through various

325
00:13:56,607 --> 00:14:01,215
Options that are out in the market you got faster speeds I think up until a year or year-and-a-half ago

326
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:07,359
Verizon was trying to get me to rent at 8 to 11 for a while get out of here

327
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:11,967
Very few reasons in my Pinto by rent a motorized if you can help it

328
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:12,735
Yes

329
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:13,759
All right

330
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,087
In the show notes

331
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:17,855
So

332
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:18,879
Let's talk about

333
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:21,439
Cat 1 Test

334
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,487
That's right

335
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:26,303
You really like cat M1 for some reason

336
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,071
I just

337
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:29,375
Actually I like it be iot

338
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,215
What is

339
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:33,983
One of these

340
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,263
Low power

341
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,031
Wide area network

342
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,335
Technologies but it is a cellular

343
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,103
So

344
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:41,919
Think of it in the same kind of mental space

345
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:44,223
Sort of as sigfox

346
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:45,759
Lorawan nb-iot

347
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:48,063
The difference is it actually has

348
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,087
Way bigger

349
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,719
More Gatorade so this is

350
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,487
Better

351
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:56,511
Cellular

352
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,583
Right in the news

353
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,607
This is not

354
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:04,191
Earth-shattering news but I want to bring it for two reasons one the first reason is that

355
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:10,591
MTN in South Africa is trialling their new cat M1 network with Ericsson and Qualcomm

356
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:15,455
That is the first test in the continent so that's kind of cool importantly I

357
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,991
Notice this little nugget

358
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,015
In that

359
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:23,135
They're adding Erikson's added support for voice over LTE

360
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:27,231
This platform for cat M1 that's been implemented trial

361
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,023
And like why would they do that

362
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,839
Will Boise is relatively low bandwidth so it's

363
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:38,239
There's enough speed enough pipe there to handle the why would you do it it's all for Internet of Things what Erikson said is that the

364
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,007
Addition of

365
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:41,311
Voice over LTE on Cottman Ave Network

366
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:43,103
Let's telcos

367
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,663
Connect to iot devices in the apps and services

368
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:48,991
They could benefit from these boys services such a security alarm panel

369
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,015
First aid kits

370
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,295
Wearables digital lock

371
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:52,831
Disposable security garments

372
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:59,231
I'm like that's actually good idea so if you have a security system that's using say cat in one network to have its constant connectivity

373
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:00,767
G2a monitoring service

374
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,047
You could actually

375
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,839
You know in case of a break-in

376
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:05,119
Make a call

377
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,143
On that same network

378
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,471
Or to those people I never thought about that

379
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:10,495
Okay

380
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:12,799
And I don't disagree with that and I see

381
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:19,711
That's one way that Cellular Connection Ali win in this area cuz I think right now it's pretty expensive like for example and a half

382
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:21,503
Africa I know of several

383
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,063
I feel like

384
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,623
That's going to be a hard sell but

385
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:28,159
That's a good way to try to

386
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:29,695
Yay

387
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:31,743
I think it's time to talk about

388
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:32,767
Assistance

389
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,303
All the philosophical Quest

390
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,119
Question

391
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:38,911
So yeah

392
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:39,935
Antifa

393
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,215
Everybody had enough

394
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:42,239
Assistant

395
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,519
Baker, Laura

396
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:44,799
In Kevin and I were wondering

397
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:47,359
When do you need a smart speaker

398
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,895
What features do you need

399
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,175
Assistant speaker

400
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:51,455
Do you need a speaker

401
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:54,527
My gosh

402
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:57,343
What kind of features do we need in these smart

403
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,111
Home assistant

404
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,391
Should be calling them

405
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:06,815
I don't know if we should call them smart home assistants not all of them because you have and I haven't most people that was in the show

406
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:11,167
A digital assistant integrated to their phone already weather is Siri

407
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,703
Weathers Google Assistant

408
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:14,751
Whether it's Bixby whether it's

409
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:20,383
Even Amazon Echo Services because that is coming on more phones so

410
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:24,479
That's not a smart home assistant that's a digital assistant what I'm asking for information

411
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:28,063
Contextual information popping up reaching out to me that kind of thing

412
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,391
Like the number of times I use

413
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,415
Google Assistant

414
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,207
Is Winn-Dixie

415
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:36,511
And I don't know why I really don't know why

416
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:40,607
Let me ask you a question that may give you an idea

417
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:44,447
How often are you away from your Echo

418
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:46,751
Your Google home and other things like that

419
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:49,311
I am away from it but then I'm usually in

420
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,079
In public life

421
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:52,383
Stepping out so the only time I use it was probably in my

422
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:53,663
Okay

423
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,991
So I talk to my phone whenever I'm out of the house

424
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,271
And want information

425
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:01,599
Because there is no dedicated assistant around I mean it's just

426
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:03,135
There isn't there these are all fixed

427
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,415
Assistance in my house

428
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,439
Right

429
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,207
And I guess

430
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:11,327
State is not very social outside of the house

431
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:17,215
So you just walk up to people and say hey do you know how far it is to the Moon

432
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:22,335
B6 don't often come up when I do I actually usually

433
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:29,247
No it's a it's a different anything wrong with that seriously

434
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:31,551
Beijing ribs

435
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:36,671
We are sure you're not no you're not weird there are people who still do not want to talk to devices

436
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:39,487
Outinpublic not to their watch not to their phone and so on

437
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,279
I get it I don't judge that's fine

438
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:42,559
No I might go

439
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:43,839
I might still judge

440
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,655
Alright so

441
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:51,775
And it just a friend of mine actually just asked me if they should buy the Echo Show

442
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:52,799
The echo

443
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:53,823
And I was like

444
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:56,127
You know it's kind of cool

445
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,663
Show me some

446
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,687
Corgi videos

447
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:05,087
I don't have anyone really to talk to drop and capability

448
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,367
Right

449
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,951
I don't think I would spend that much money on the echo show again

450
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:12,767
So I feel like I don't need a video screen

451
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,303
Because I don't

452
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:15,839
I got a TV

453
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,119
Really functions

454
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,143
Perfectly

455
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:19,679
If you have a Chromecast you can

456
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:21,215
Use Google to say hey

457
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:23,775
Show me this on the TV. Easily anyway

458
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,591
I think it's an intriguing product but I don't

459
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:27,359
Think it's

460
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:33,503
How can I be a speaker hit as maybe the original Echo devices quite honestly because it requires to get the most out of it

461
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,039
Requires more than one

462
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,831
So you can do the video call and so on

463
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:39,903
But that kind of stuff I just do over the phone or computer wherever I am anyway

464
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:42,463
I don't want a dedicated video box

465
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:44,255
They're definitely use cases

466
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:48,863
With kidney touch with his family that's far away that maybe they're not very technical I get that but

467
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:49,631
That's on me

468
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:53,983
I would love to have more Bass

469
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,007
What's a Google home

470
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,335
Things I would love to

471
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:00,383
Hey

472
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:01,663
Speaker assistant

473
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,479
Person add such-and-such at 12

474
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,039
I think

475
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:09,087
That kind of interactivity

476
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:14,207
In the ability to affect other apps would be really cool and no one's really

477
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:15,999
I breathe I'm hungry

478
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,279
What else do we need

479
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,303
We need good quality

480
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:25,983
I think it's fair I mean a lot of people buy these things now because of they're tapping into music services that can connect and they want

481
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:29,823
Voice Control music music

482
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:30,847
Chola people

483
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:34,431
Summer fine with say the standard assistance are available today that you

484
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:40,831
Echo is your Google home and so on so forth

485
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:42,367
New Google Assistant

486
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:44,159
Enable speakers coming out soon

487
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:46,207
Now that you Frozen play we got

488
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:47,231
Whole list

489
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:47,999
Of

490
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:50,815
Smart speakers and I've noticed something very interesting

491
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:55,423
They're all coming from big-name audio companies such as Harman Kardon

492
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,447
Sony

493
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:57,471
Panasonic

494
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:58,495
Onkyo

495
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:04,895
Their stuff is typically not cheap and sure enough these quote-unquote smart speakers or digital assistants are also looking.

496
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:08,223
Gucci prices look much higher than the echo products for example

497
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:09,759
And that's because

498
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:15,391
They have more robust speakers maybe some more features and so on and I think it's also because

499
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:21,536
They're getting in because they saw Apple's homepod for 350 and figure hey Apple can make a good sounding speaker

500
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:22,816
With additional assistance

501
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:26,144
350 we can do the same for two three four hundred dollars Etc so

502
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:28,192
It's just interesting the number of

503
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:33,824
Large audio companies getting it on the skin PPL is another for example

504
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,664
Fourth is expected to announce their digital assistants be

505
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,224
So it'll be

506
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,296
And whether or not my existing

507
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:46,624
Chris compatible through the echo is supposed to have

508
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:52,000
Cross your fingers on that way you know it's really nice though about all this

509
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:53,536
There there are

510
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:54,304
Smart

511
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:58,656
Home digital assistant speakers for every type of budget

512
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:00,704
And every type of listener right now

513
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,520
You couldn't say that a year or two ago

514
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:04,800
Now you

515
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:07,360
There was only one

516
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:13,760
But even even so even the ones that have come out since then have been relatively inexpensive and some munchies

517
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:20,160
I know we talked about the UV before I think it was actually on sale for $29 but you know your Echo dot is $49

518
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,976
We talked about one called the fabric

519
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,000
With a Q

520
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:25,024
And that was like

521
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:25,792
Ridiculous

522
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,584
Low priced it was like

523
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:30,144
That wasn't one

524
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:35,776
Yep right wasn't always listening you've got more great choices again for every budget every sound level

525
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:38,592
Tell the speaker said I'm seeing that we're now sativa

526
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:41,152
This could be your whole sounds

527
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:46,784
System for your house and you get the added benefit of the connectedness

528
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,552
So this is

529
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:48,320
I think

530
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:50,880
You know it

531
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:52,416
I like playing music

532
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:54,208
Over my existing speaker

533
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:55,488
I don't want to

534
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:57,024
I don't want a constant

535
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:58,560
It is kind of a pain

536
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:01,376
But

537
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:03,936
You got the Amazon is built into

538
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:08,800
Lighting it is built into things like the ecobee so you've got a bunch of products that

539
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:10,080
Their justice system

540
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:12,640
They're not even not speakers exactly

541
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:17,504
Exactly they are the interface really for your smartphone that's what started all this and I think that will still open

542
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,856
To be Central to all the types of products speakers is a big one because

543
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:28,000
The dual purpose of listening to these Music Services since most people are now streaming music not no uploading or playing CDs or

544
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:29,024
Vinyl Runner

545
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:34,400
I have my. I have the entire Beatles collection on vinyl thank you

546
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:38,496
Once a month or so

547
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:39,520
Versatile

548
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:43,360
All day everyday on SiriusXM

549
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:45,152
That's what I thought

550
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,176
We should do a

551
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:47,712
Minor quiqup

552
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,528
I got yelled at so badly by my child

553
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:54,368
Because I switched the multi-room audio on the echo

554
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,392
Just try it out last

555
00:23:55,904 --> 00:24:00,256
Are you guys on Amazon music settings

556
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,024
Spotify didn't

557
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:05,120
And she was getting so frustrated cuz she was trying

558
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:05,888
Play her

559
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:09,728
Music she's like nothing is available to me

560
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:10,496
I realized

561
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:13,568
Leominster dog

562
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,848
It's still broken yellow

563
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,152
Until I can play the music I want

564
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:18,432
When I want it it's just not you

565
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:24,832
Especially for everybody who still trying to build off these clothes Chico CA

566
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,880
If you don't support everything

567
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:28,928
Hi God it's like you support nothing

568
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:32,256
Are at this point

569
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:34,304
What's a good sex

570
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:35,840
Ruined it into

571
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:36,608
Voicemail

572
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:38,912
Okay so last week we started

573
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:39,680
Highline

574
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:43,264
Can dial it

575
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:45,568
You know the number I have

576
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:50,176
63

577
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:52,224
85122

578
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,504
6 to 3

579
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,040
742 4

580
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:58,624
We've already had a lot of gall so thank you guys

581
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,440
We will play some some we're going to hold off on

582
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:02,208
Just for now

583
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:04,256
And some are actually lovely

584
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:06,816
Questions that don't want to be on the air which is totally fine

585
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:09,888
We had a voicemail from Jonathan

586
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:13,728
Then and he noted that it's kind of interesting with like the Microsoft

587
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:16,544
Amazon Cortana speaking to Madame a

588
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,312
News

589
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:19,872
Connected speakers are

590
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:20,640
Now talkin

591
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:27,808
And he didn't really have a question he just threw that up and I was like you know he's right it is and I think this is actually a disturbing

592
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:29,344
Worrisome trend

593
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,672
Because what we're seeing is Brands getting in there and saying

594
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:33,952
Hey this

595
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:34,976
Smart home stuff

596
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:36,000
It's going voice

597
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:39,584
Okay if voice has been extra why I need to get my brand in here

598
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,864
And how many do that

599
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:44,448
Yeah and

600
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:50,848
It is interesting I drew Jonathan it's concerning to me because I don't want to do prison with Jonathan

601
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:54,432
Said he'd said that there's an Amazon Echo skill that talks to Google

602
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:59,808
So you would ask the echo to reach out to Google to get information but that's like second and third hand

603
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:02,368
Commands and I don't want the interface

604
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:07,488
Just gets me my information I don't want to have to think about who I'm asking the question to an how to ask it right

605
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:10,048
And probably this means that we should have

606
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:12,096
Oh my gosh you know we talked about open recipe standard

607
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:13,376
Voice UI

608
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:16,448
Getting access to this data should probably be something like

609
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,216
XML

610
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:19,264
Or HTML and not

611
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,288
Controlled by

612
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,056
Central

613
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:24,384
And I say that because I'd rather just be like

614
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,664
Computer just do this for me

615
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,944
Right as opposed to

616
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,808
What's happening now is one you have to pick between the Amazon Echo Google home

617
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:35,648
Apple's homekit and then those guys are going to have their own skills that

618
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:39,488
Can't wait so right now GE actually has Geneva

619
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,280
Will tell you how

620
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:42,816
How to cook your

621
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:43,840
Cakes

622
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:46,144
Roast chicken in your ovens

623
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,960
That's well and good except you got to be like oh hey

624
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:52,800
You know mattimeo let me talk to Geneva Geneva I want to cook something

625
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:54,080
Preheat my oven

626
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:55,872
When really you just want to talk to

627
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:57,152
One thing and say hey

628
00:26:58,944 --> 00:26:59,968
And then you were at at 2

629
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:06,624
I agree with you I think it's going to be a challenge until we decide that we want to separate the interface

630
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:12,000
From the data if we have a standard interface for voice perfect and then everybody can compete

631
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:16,352
Who's got the best data to answer the question get the best recipe etcetera but I don't

632
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:22,240
Think that's going to happen because everybody's push for their own natural language processing technology in addition to the data

633
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,264
So

634
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,544
It's kind of a mess

635
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:25,568
We broke the open

636
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:29,408
All right here

637
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,432
The lovely Quest

638
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:32,480
Craig

639
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:35,296
Hey folks this is Greg here first

640
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:36,832
Time caller long

641
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:37,856
Time listener

642
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:41,696
Feel free to embed my message in your show that would be awesome

643
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:45,536
Question about a bunch of light switches I've been putting in my home lately

644
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:49,120
They're made by a company called homeseer I believe that

645
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:51,424
The New England area maybe New Hampshire

646
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,192
Vermont

647
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,728
What do you know about these folks

648
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:56,032
Have you experimented with the products before

649
00:27:56,288 --> 00:28:00,128
And you have anything to say about the Hub that they build I currently want to wink hub

650
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:04,992
At home ear would sure love to see me used on HUB I'd love some comments for you about that

651
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:10,880
I do I have an opinion I guess I should

652
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:13,184
Did say I'm because I'm not used homeseer

653
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:19,328
Ever and I don't think Stacy you have either a couple questions so I just told Kevin that we should get a hug

654
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,608
Start playing

655
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:25,472
Which I agree we should definitely do that but in the meantime just to give an opinion on Craig's question I think

656
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:27,264
Hamster has some nice qualities

657
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,080
Is that you know your data can be local now.

658
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:34,688
The cloud so you know maybe your internet connection goes down and you know all your stuff still work

659
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:38,784
The problems that I see though with homeseer even though it may be a stellar solution

660
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:42,624
Is a couple things one it is not cheap the cheapest

661
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:49,024
Smart home controller right now from Home Series 19995 and then there's a second one that has more stuff in it

662
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,816
399 95 and then the

663
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:53,376
Best one is $899.95

664
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:57,216
So it's not cheap compared to a wink or SmartThings or some other hub

665
00:28:57,472 --> 00:29:02,592
In addition to that not all of the service Integrations are free in fact if you go to home Siri

666
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:03,360
Site

667
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:05,920
You can see that you can purchase plugins

668
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:06,944
For homeseer

669
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:13,088
Some of these are free which is great you know you can say work with Z-Wave and insteon

670
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:13,856
No problem

671
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:15,136
But if you want

672
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:20,256
To add Lutron caseta

673
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:23,584
Yeah it gets expensive and

674
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,888
I want to go throw them cuz there's a whole list of plug-in

675
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:27,168
Summer free

676
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:33,568
My fear is that you really have to think ahead what products you want your husband support before you invest in a home syrup

677
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:34,848
Because you're going to

678
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:37,920
Implement this and then if you want to add something later is that going to cost me

679
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:39,968
Were you $50 as I get the drivers and they asked

680
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:46,368
Will say that you get to try all the plugins for free for 30 days so it's not by have to keep buying

681
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:52,768
Get to try stuff but I just worry about that it's an interesting business model but it's not one that I would personally want to

682
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:58,656
Go for I would go for something that has much broader product range that is included or included at no extra charge

683
00:29:58,912 --> 00:29:59,424
All right

684
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:04,032
Next week more listener questions and in the meantime though I did want to do an update

685
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:07,360
To me this week we lost internet

686
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:08,896
Access we lost power and internet

687
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:12,480
Access so as a reminder to everybody who's dealing with connected

688
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:13,248
Homepro

689
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:19,648
It's important to understand how these things behave when your power goes out so for example your hue light bulb

690
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:21,696
ABS because your switches on they will

691
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:25,280
Power goes out they all and comes back on they all go back on

692
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:27,328
Everywhere in your house all your hue light bulbs

693
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:30,144
Turn right back on max power

694
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:34,752
There are other things like the Amazon Echo Power and Boots back up

695
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:36,032
It will also go

696
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:39,360
And I believe

697
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:41,408
So

698
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:42,944
As a fun little test

699
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:46,272
If you want I can do this for you by turning my house off

700
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:47,296
I'm telling you what

701
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:48,064
Brakes

702
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:51,648
Hit your power button just to see what happen

703
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:52,928
Because

704
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:55,488
You're likely if you've invested a lot of smartphone

705
00:30:58,816 --> 00:30:59,328
We ran through

706
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,632
Because we didn't want to wake up

707
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:04,704
My daughter and turning off the Hue Lights at the switch that we

708
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,472
We remembered we had

709
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:07,776
And I think we still were surprised by some

710
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,568
I don't remember what it

711
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,384
Oh it was our air filter but that is not connect

712
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,664
So it just talks to us

713
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:14,688
Just for fun

714
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:16,992
So not even connected products

715
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,552
And then the other thing is a couple nights ago

716
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:20,832
We lost internet access

717
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:23,136
Normally The Echoes will let you

718
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:24,416
You know if it has no enter

719
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:25,440
Access but

720
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:26,208
It doesn't

721
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:28,256
I guess in the middle tonight I'm not sure what happened there

722
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,536
Put my WeMo

723
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:31,584
Dimmer switch so that the product

724
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,608
To put in my bedroom

725
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:34,144
To my chagrin

726
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,448
It started blinking

727
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:37,216
Bright red

728
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:38,752
And it was very bright

729
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:40,800
Is a very bright LED

730
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:41,568
I was like oh

731
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:43,104
Is Boogie bright red what does that mean

732
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,384
So at 4 a.m.

733
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,664
Consulting my WeMo app

734
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,200
What is this

735
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:50,784
Psycho it needs the internet's out I don't care I'm sleeping but I couldn't get back to

736
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,552
So I

737
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:52,576
A washcloth

738
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:54,624
Because that's how I

739
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,464
Where is painters tape

740
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,048
But I did find out that I could actually manually hit that

741
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,096
Even though I swear to God I did on that button

742
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,680
And it's supposed to turn it off

743
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:14,336
24-hours so should your I still think this is

744
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:17,152
Little baby don't have to Blink the light in

745
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,432
Maybe I'm sleepy

746
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,200
Agreed

747
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:22,016
If this happens to you apparently if you hit that button

748
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:23,040
It will

749
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:24,320
Turn it off for 24 hours and

750
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:26,368
You don't have to

751
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:29,440
Shuffle around for painters tape

752
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:30,976
All right

753
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:32,512
That is all the smart

754
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:35,328
Dick and Let It Go

755
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:36,096
From one of our sponsor

756
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:41,216
Before we do stay tuned for Landon borders from big

757
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:43,776
Bleep fans I can't say the name

758
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:47,360
And still retain our PG rating on iTunes but it's

759
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:48,384
Big butts

760
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:51,968
I really don't know what

761
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:53,248
You guys fight

762
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:55,296
I like big phones and I cannot lie

763
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:56,576
Like big fan

764
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,648
You really got to sing this

765
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:02,464
Not going to happen

766
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,232
Okay

767
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:05,024
Landed is going to tell us

768
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:10,144
What is company learned by building a connected product all the way back in 20

769
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:10,912
T12

770
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:13,728
Which is you know ages ago in Internet time

771
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:17,312
Re-echo so stay tuned

772
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:23,712
Hey everyone we are breaking into this week's Internet of Things podcast with a message from our sponsor this week sponsor is

773
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:29,600
Forgerock and I have Ashley Stevenson who is the identity technology director at Fortress

774
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:35,232
If we're going to talk about what companies are doing with your digital identity management solution

775
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:40,352
So let's just get started with what you guys are doing with TomTom

776
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:46,240
Identity platform to secure and manage a business asset that really is becoming an increasingly hot commodity

777
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:50,592
These days and that is digital identity

778
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:51,872
Manager growing range

779
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:55,200
Including those of iot devices

780
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:57,248
And I need to understand the relationship

781
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:58,016
Between

782
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:59,040
Their customers

783
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:00,320
Across the different business

784
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:02,368
The spine and how they relate to those device

785
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,952
See this with many of our customers they had

786
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:08,512
Digital identity living in a lot of different places

787
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:10,560
There's a lot of different disconnected places

788
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:12,608
Which made it very difficult for them

789
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:17,472
Single picture of what their customer is doing what their customer needed

790
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:20,544
And it made it difficult for them to give their customers

791
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,104
Experience across their different offerings

792
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:25,152
So what does that mean in practice

793
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:32,320
They were able to connect with the Ford rock-a-dundee platform all of the different psilocybe ID

794
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:34,112
And that would enable them

795
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:36,160
Provide different and better service

796
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:37,184
For their customers

797
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,744
Single sign-on across

798
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:40,768
Services

799
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:42,816
And the ability of their

800
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:44,096
In-car device's

801
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,400
This is actually have digital identity

802
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:48,960
The identities of the devices

803
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:50,752
Customers

804
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:51,776
Cross all of the

805
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:57,664
Difference

806
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,456
What's the identities of the devices

807
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:00,480
In the cars

808
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:01,760
And the customers wear

809
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,552
And give the customer the best

810
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:04,832
Possible sign in

811
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:10,208
User experience possible

812
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:12,512
So what does it do to add to it

813
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:13,280
The business value

814
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:16,608
Personal single sign-on really is the culmination

815
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,448
We talked about on the back

816
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:23,008
Ties together integrated

817
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:24,288
What sites done

818
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:25,568
It really does ADD

819
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:28,384
Three main business benefits for the customer

820
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,920
Experience it's easier

821
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:31,968
It's more efficient but the other one is

822
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:35,808
It's more efficient not to single sign-on but bringing together all these identities

823
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:39,648
Springs more business efficiencies as well because now

824
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:40,416
TomTom

825
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:44,512
Doesn't have to try to understand their customer and their data across all the

826
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:46,048
Silo's lacrosse

827
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:46,816
Alien

828
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:52,704
They actually have a more efficient method of providing services to their customer and understanding their customer

829
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,984
Last but not least

830
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,312
Security is another large business benefit of

831
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,128
Single sign-on

832
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:03,968
Capability because it effectively reduces the attack surface

833
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:06,272
Compromising one of the TomTom customer

834
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:10,880
Because when there's only one account to authenticate and if you're up in any one of them

835
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:15,232
Push authentication where you don't even have a password now you only have one

836
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:19,328
Places open instead of 15 or even more

837
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:22,400
And where can someone go to find out more about

838
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:29,312
Definitely recommend for draft.com where we have this and many other case studies lots of other information about our

839
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:43,392
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham

840
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:48,256
And today's guest is Landon borders who is the director of connected devices

841
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:55,424
So this large fan

842
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:59,264
I'll put it in the show notes

843
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,800
Landon you guys make

844
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:01,824
Ceiling fans

845
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:06,432
Residential or commercial you guys also actually have a bunch of other products

846
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:09,248
Right exactly you know we started as a

847
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:11,552
A company that makes large-diameter ceiling

848
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:15,136
Dan's but got into the lighting business and we sell lights

849
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:17,952
For industrial applications and for the home and

850
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:19,488
Residential ceiling fans

851
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:23,328
Things we do controls for our products so yeah we kind of branched out a little bit

852
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:26,656
All right and I first discovered you guys actually probably in the pages

853
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,472
But it was back in

854
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:36,896
How to say the 2013 2012 time frame when introduced

855
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:40,736
Haiku can you talk to me about what was going through your mind

856
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:42,016
Back in 2012

857
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:43,296
Cuz you were doing this

858
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:45,088
What were you guys thinking about

859
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:47,136
What was the impetus for logic this

860
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:51,744
What we wanted to really provide our customers was a fan that just

861
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,280
Knew how to keep you

862
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:58,400
We wanted to get rid of the pull chain we wanted to get rid of the dimmers on the wall and

863
00:37:58,656 --> 00:37:59,680
We wanted a fan that was

864
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:01,984
Smart enough to just keep you comfortable based

865
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,312
Two ponds the room temperature whether not you were in the room

866
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:08,128
And so forth so that's when we launched the sense

867
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:10,688
Give me technology feature for the haiku

868
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:11,968
2014

869
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:14,016
Okay so up until 2014

870
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:14,784
Your products

871
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:16,064
That's correct

872
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,880
All right in this sense me though was amazing

873
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:25,280
Because like you said it was kind of like bringing that Nest mentality of algorithms and intelligence happening behind the scenes

874
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,304
To just be like oh

875
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,840
It's warm in here we should totally turn

876
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:29,120
Yeah

877
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:32,192
Exactly and you know really we also launched app

878
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:32,960
Control and it was

879
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:35,264
Was primarily at the time we saw that is up

880
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,800
Configuration tool

881
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:37,824
First scheduling

882
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,104
In setting the fan

883
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,664
Settings just as you wanted them but ultimately

884
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,504
You know our philosophy was get our users out of the app as soon as possible

885
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,064
We wanted the fan operators autonomously is pause

886
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,624
Batman that was actually kind of novel

887
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:57,024
Because I had a lot of companies I would be trying their devices

888
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,096
You have to remember that this launch before the Amazon Echo

889
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:03,168
So it came out the end of 2014 but the

890
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:05,728
Voice control for smart home devices

891
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,008
March or April

892
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:09,824
I just got to set the stage for ever

893
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:12,128
All right so back in this history

894
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:14,176
And what happened

895
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:15,200
What

896
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:16,224
Did you learn

897
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:16,992
From this process

898
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,784
Yes we launched

899
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,576
The sense me feature

900
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:26,976
And it wasn't for us it was never a you know we're going to launch this and make it available to our customers and then

901
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:32,352
And that's just what it is we had a very ambitious roadmap we were working on Partnerships with

902
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:34,144
Companies like nest and others

903
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,960
We had a plan and we wanted to

904
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:38,240
Continue building and can

905
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:39,776
Continue providing value

906
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:40,544
To darkest

907
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,896
Tremors through software updates and through the launch of

908
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:45,664
Integration

909
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,944
As frequently as

910
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:47,712
Sweets office

911
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:49,760
So that's exactly what happened

912
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:51,040
And you guys were also

913
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:53,600
As soon as part of your roadmap but you actually helped

914
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:54,880
With the development of

915
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:56,160
The thread protocol

916
00:39:56,416 --> 00:40:00,256
Which is a wireless protocol with nest in Samsung

917
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:01,280
Now

918
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:03,072
Your first sense me did not have

919
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:06,656
But how did that go and how did that align

920
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:10,240
Yeah it was all part of our strategy

921
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:12,288
And we works with nest

922
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:14,848
What's the early stages actually pre-acquisition

923
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:16,896
And as you noted we shared

924
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:18,688
Very similar philosophies

925
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:19,712
Somehow these products

926
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:20,992
Working operate

927
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:22,016
And

928
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:26,112
We got to understand the vision For Thread and how it relates to the home

929
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:27,648
So we invested

930
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:28,672
Eveleigh in

931
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:29,440
Helping to

932
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:30,208
Develop

933
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:31,744
That specifications

934
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,792
I believe it's red just was

935
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:35,072
Wildly amazing

936
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:35,840
In terms of

937
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:37,376
Membership and in terms of

938
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:38,144
Contribution

939
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,448
So that was a pretty amazing adventure

940
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:42,496
Okay thread has not exactly

941
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:47,360
I know the formal specification took awhile to come out but it's been out for about a year

942
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:50,432
And I still don't see a lot of thread

943
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:51,200
Products

944
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:52,224
Does that disappoint

945
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,016
Yes or no

946
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:56,064
I mean I'm very proud of the work

947
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,344
That's thread group

948
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:59,648
Put into building the specification

949
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:01,696
I think the technology is great

950
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:02,976
It's designed

951
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:06,304
Quite well by a lot of very smart people but

952
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,120
Thread is more analogous to Wi-Fi

953
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:11,424
Then it is to Bluetooth in what I mean is

954
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,704
Frozen Network

955
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:14,496
Lair

956
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:18,848
Templates the networking layer stack only it does not contemplate the application

957
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:22,176
An application layer is what end users

958
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:24,736
Understand and know so I think

959
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:27,296
One of the reasons why adoption is not

960
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:31,648
Widespread is that this industry is still trying to solve for the

961
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:33,696
Unified application layer

962
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:37,280
Problem if you will and so there appears to be a convergence

963
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,304
Chinese ecosystem

964
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:39,840
Such as the one

965
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:41,632
Provided by Amazon

966
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:42,400
And

967
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:43,936
Google home and

968
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:45,216
Homekit but

969
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:49,824
Again the adoption of those ecosystems if you will don't include

970
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,616
Fred as of yet so

971
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:52,640
Because that's just

972
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:54,175
My opinion is that

973
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:55,199
You'll see

974
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:56,991
Larger or widespread adoption

975
00:41:57,247 --> 00:42:01,087
Kenneth read once it includes or is included by those he goes to

976
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:03,903
Well maybe the new Echo will have a

977
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:05,951
Thread radio eyes closed

978
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:06,719
Okay

979
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:09,535
So let's talk about your CEO did an article

980
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:11,839
The Harvard Business Review that I read in

981
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:14,143
I said I was part of my newsletter in a lot of other people

982
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:17,727
And he basically we're talking about the lessons you learned

983
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:18,751
From connecting

984
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:24,383
Your products with this idea that not all of your consumers really wanted

985
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:25,663
Connectivity so

986
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:29,247
Is it only half of your users actually use some of the sense miracle

987
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:30,271
Connected options

988
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:33,855
Yeah that's correct so at roughly half and

989
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:35,903
As I mentioned we were

990
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:37,439
Extremely proud of

991
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:42,815
Listen to me products that we launched and we continue to build and introduce new features

992
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:46,143
As time went on and what we decided was

993
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:47,935
Well you know these

994
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:48,959
Other half

995
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:49,727
Of our customer

996
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:50,751
Base they would

997
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:55,103
Really appreciate these features to and use them if only they had access

998
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:57,407
Rather than

999
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:59,711
Charge extra for them let's just make this

1000
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:03,295
Standard offering in all of our Haiku fans

1001
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:05,087
I thought that was great now

1002
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:07,903
You also talked about the adoption curve like

1003
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:09,951
Who is getting curious

1004
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:11,487
If you can talk a little bit more about

1005
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:15,071
That's because like for ceiling fans are really interesting product

1006
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:17,119
Me because they are something consumers

1007
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:18,143
Yours are

1008
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:19,167
Kind of expensive

1009
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:19,935
But there

1010
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:20,703
Well worth it

1011
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:22,495
But I haven't installed them

1012
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:26,079
Because it's a big job and I already have some that work just fine and

1013
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:27,103
Extra

1014
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,127
Seamlessness

1015
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:29,663
Is it really work

1016
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:33,503
No so I'm curious where your other customer

1017
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:35,551
Why you think they are

1018
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:36,831
Adopting the

1019
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:38,367
Quite as rapidly

1020
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:40,159
I think what we learned

1021
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:43,487
You know cuz we made this a standard feature the beginning a toy

1022
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:45,279
In launch today

1023
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:46,047
CES

1024
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:49,887
But since then what we've learned is that nothing has really changed the p

1025
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:51,679
People that really want these

1026
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:55,263
Smart features on our products are the ones that use the mullet

1027
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:56,543
And there's

1028
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:59,103
Just a large portion of our customer base that

1029
00:43:59,359 --> 00:43:59,871
Values

1030
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:03,199
The beauty of the fan that values the energy efficient

1031
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:08,063
And all these other features of the fan that make it a great product less the technology

1032
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:12,927
I think in hindsight and when you read this article that's the message that were really trying to

1033
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:13,695
I convey here

1034
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:14,975
Is that thrust

1035
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:16,767
This is a feature that we build we thoughts

1036
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:19,839
Your people had it they would adopt it but in hindsight is just

1037
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:21,375
Some people don't want the tech.

1038
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:25,983
And which is fine with David are we still value those customers just as much as any other

1039
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:27,263
Of course

1040
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:28,799
Unlike your ceiling fans

1041
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:29,823
So exact

1042
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:34,175
This is another element of connected products that I think a lot of people

1043
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:36,479
Belt connector products may be ignored it

1044
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:38,015
First but this idea that

1045
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:43,647
If I buy a ceiling fan I expected to last for a really long time which includes maybe software update

1046
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:45,439
It's overtime if I'm using those pictures

1047
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:48,767
So would you change anything differently and maybe it's

1048
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:51,583
Budgeting for software development over a 10-year life

1049
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:55,679
Maybe it's introducing a an expiration date for software updates I don't know

1050
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:58,239
Anything about the business of building a Connect

1051
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:00,287
Good product that you've learned in your life

1052
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:01,823
We should adapt this way

1053
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:02,847
Yeah I think

1054
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:05,151
Let's face it we are at Midwestern

1055
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:06,431
Product,

1056
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:07,455
And

1057
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:08,223
This was

1058
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:10,271
Speedo blue ocean for many of us

1059
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:13,087
And we know we're isolated from binos

1060
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:17,439
The San Francisco technology braintrust and we're learning a lot of things

1061
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:18,719
As we went along

1062
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:22,815
And you don't understanding where the market wood trim to and

1063
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:26,143
Cost of the technology over time as we

1064
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:31,519
In the background you know pay for PRI AWS bill

1065
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:36,895
And so forth right so I'd say that we didn't have good foresight into that but we certainly do now

1066
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:39,199
I know by the way that market is changing

1067
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:41,247
Quite a bit right it's getting a lot less

1068
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:43,039
Expensive for manufacture

1069
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:44,319
Like ourselves

1070
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:48,159
I think we wouldn't change much I think actually our philosophies

1071
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:48,927
Still a great

1072
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:53,791
And I think the only thing that we would change in hindsight would be to just simply

1073
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:56,351
Make this feature available to the people that want

1074
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:59,423
What's in the people that don't we still have a great product and then

1075
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:00,447
You know I think that

1076
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:01,727
A very unique

1077
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:03,519
Approach to this Market

1078
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:05,823
What does it mean to say make

1079
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:07,615
That feature available to those who want

1080
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:10,431
I know that you guys talked about making only one

1081
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:11,711
All of your products are

1082
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:18,623
Because otherwise you're carrying different skews in that's complicated so what is it mean when you say

1083
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:22,463
We talked about the modularity of our

1084
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:25,535
And we designed them in a way such that

1085
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:26,559
The technology

1086
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:28,607
You can be easily added or removed

1087
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:29,887
The technology that

1088
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:30,911
Ads cost

1089
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:32,447
Basically to the product

1090
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:33,983
Sofa manufacturers

1091
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:34,751
Perspective

1092
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:39,615
As our products are going down the assembly line theoretically then we can add a removed

1093
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:41,919
This technology before it goes right custom

1094
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:42,943
Send it doing this

1095
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:44,991
The customers that want these features

1096
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:47,807
We can provide those to them by just simply adding

1097
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:49,087
This module

1098
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:51,647
If you will and then those that don't want it

1099
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:54,207
Just get the same product when I'm less the technology

1100
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:56,511
So we see that taking this modular

1101
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:58,815
Approach works really well for our cus

1102
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:00,095
Got it

1103
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:02,399
Have you changed to start doing

1104
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:05,727
Yeah it's been a work-in-progress you know starting with

1105
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:07,263
BL series fan that we launched

1106
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:08,031
26

1107
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:09,311
Superstar to take

1108
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:14,943
Approaching not to give away too much but we've ever as you might expect lots of products in development

1109
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:18,783
And have been taking this approach to designing New Prague

1110
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:20,831
Over the course of the past several months

1111
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:24,415
And there's an idea about you guys had

1112
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:26,463
Common in there about dealing with customers

1113
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:27,743
And customer service

1114
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:29,535
So what have you learned

1115
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:35,935
Has you've introduced

1116
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:36,959
It's starting to come into

1117
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:37,727
To the market a little

1118
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:39,519
What if you learned there

1119
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:42,079
Well starting with your first question

1120
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:43,103
Regarding

1121
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:45,151
Customer service

1122
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:46,431
I think some Growing Pains

1123
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:47,711
The early days

1124
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:50,271
We had to become networking experts here

1125
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:52,319
But you know that was anticipated

1126
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:53,087
When did we adapt

1127
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:54,623
Quite well to that

1128
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:55,903
But of course you know there's a

1129
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:56,927
Expense associated

1130
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:58,719
But we have a very unique

1131
00:47:58,975 --> 00:47:59,743
Sales Channel

1132
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:01,023
Soho cigar products

1133
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:01,791
Sold directly

1134
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:02,559
You are customer

1135
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:05,375
So as a product developer such as myself

1136
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:06,911
That provides us with

1137
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:09,471
Very direct feedback to and from our cost

1138
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:10,751
What we've learned

1139
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:13,823
To do and to value is to really invest in

1140
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:14,591
The customer

1141
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:18,175
And we're in at because of our unique position we can

1142
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:19,455
Can do that and adapt

1143
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:20,735
Quickly whereas

1144
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:22,271
List lot of manufacturers in the

1145
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:24,319
Space really rely on retail partner

1146
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:26,111
So they lose that connection

1147
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:28,415
As a customer start

1148
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:30,975
Using Integrations how does that change

1149
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:32,255
Customer service

1150
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:35,327
It probably does

1151
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:36,863
Yeah it does

1152
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:39,935
So you know we did launch our integration

1153
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:41,215
Chicken with Amazon

1154
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:41,983
And

1155
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:42,751
The Voice

1156
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:45,055
Control features in again it was

1157
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:46,079
Huge success

1158
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:49,407
For us and our customers loved it and in fact

1159
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:51,455
They use it a lot more than we

1160
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:54,783
Originally anticipated to control our fans and lights in the

1161
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:56,063
That mean it's quite amazing

1162
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:59,647
So that he knows we course correct when these types of things happen in

1163
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:01,183
When we look to invest in

1164
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:04,255
And similar Integrations as you might expect

1165
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:05,791
Now let's homekit

1166
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:12,191
Specifically you know that is as I mentioned before we have this direct line if you will try our customers and that is something

1167
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:13,215
Thing that are customers

1168
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:13,983
Want

1169
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:15,775
And ask for a lot

1170
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:17,567
But frankly it's not been

1171
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:18,591
Azizi

1172
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:19,615
To develop

1173
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:20,639
Homekit integration

1174
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:21,919
As it has been

1175
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:22,687
For sale

1176
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:24,735
Nestor the Amazon

1177
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:26,271
The integration

1178
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:29,087
Is complicated I guess for manufacturers and

1179
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:31,391
I would venture to guess that's why you haven't

1180
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:32,415
Cny

1181
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:33,183
Brand adoption

1182
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:35,487
At home care by other similar me

1183
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:41,631
Okay yeah well I was Casino, kid it seems that there is kind of a moving Target

1184
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:43,167
And it feels like just

1185
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:46,239
Recently we got a lot of good news from Apple

1186
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:47,775
Quit home-based voice can

1187
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:49,567
Supposed to just Siri Bay

1188
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:52,639
On the phone this

1189
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:54,431
Doesn't have to be a hardware Serta

1190
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:55,199
Vacation ship

1191
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:57,759
Was I think a big deal for companies for like

1192
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:00,831
Modular home kits Pacific lines

1193
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:03,391
Terrible so it feels like that's been

1194
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:04,415
A bit of a moving toy

1195
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:05,951
Yeah I think that's

1196
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:09,535
Fair to say it has been but you know just as well

1197
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:10,815
Everyone's learning center

1198
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:13,887
Exactly what I was going to say and even here just is

1199
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:16,191
The little guys if you will like us or learning

1200
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:18,495
On the way does the big guys are too and

1201
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:19,519
Dark Horse correct

1202
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:21,055
That's just how this

1203
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:22,079
Is going to evolve

1204
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:25,663
So how do you build a product that's flexible enough to

1205
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:26,431
Course correct

1206
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:32,063
Because I do think in the past and even going forward I think we're still we are not at the finals

1207
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:34,367
Someone who's got a

1208
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:36,927
Like a semi-permanent install in someone's home

1209
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:41,023
How do you build a product is flexible enough to handle that course correction Dothan

1210
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:42,815
Hardware but also in software

1211
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:45,887
You hit the nail on the head you have to treat both of those

1212
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:46,911
Differently in

1213
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:48,191
You have to have strategies

1214
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:52,287
And so on the software side I think that

1215
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:54,847
Companies like ourselves and most iot

1216
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:58,687
Companies provide a means for updating the software in their Prime

1217
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:01,247
Typically over the Internet or through an app

1218
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:02,783
I think that's how you

1219
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:03,807
Accommodate

1220
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:04,575
Implants

1221
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:05,343
Tour

1222
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:07,135
The future on the software

1223
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:09,183
But the more difficult

1224
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:11,487
Thing to plan for is only Hardware

1225
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:14,815
So it wasn't that long ago that we all had

1226
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:16,863
802. 11 B

1227
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:18,143
Wi-Fi routers that are

1228
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:19,935
Our home and those are now obsolete

1229
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:21,983
And then you have other technology such as

1230
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:24,799
Just thread that are up-and-coming and you know how do you plan for that

1231
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:25,567
And

1232
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:26,335
For us

1233
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:27,103
Especially

1234
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:30,431
Our company the products that we still have very long

1235
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:31,199
Life cycle

1236
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:34,271
And are warranties are conducive to that

1237
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:35,039
So

1238
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:36,831
We have to be thinking 30 years

1239
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:37,855
And

1240
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:39,391
With the way that we've

1241
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:40,415
Accommodated

1242
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:42,207
The hardware that I've it is

1243
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:44,255
By taking this modular approach

1244
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:45,535
You know just as

1245
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:46,303
We can

1246
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:49,887
Add a remove this Hardware feature in our product

1247
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:52,959
Internet on the assembly line we've done it in a way that

1248
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:54,495
It's simple for customers

1249
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:56,031
To do that so that

1250
00:51:56,287 --> 00:51:57,567
If yours to come the neck

1251
00:51:57,823 --> 00:52:00,639
Great networking protocol comes out than week

1252
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:01,919
Develop that

1253
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:05,759
Portion of the hardware and shipped to our customers that I want

1254
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:12,927
Okay that makes sense no a 30-year warranty on the hardware are you prepared to offer like 30 years worth of likes

1255
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:13,695
Security update

1256
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:14,463
For those fans

1257
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:17,023
I'll just so that our sales team

1258
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:18,047
Doesn't kill me

1259
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:18,815
For saying that

1260
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:20,863
Sitar lifecycle I mean

1261
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:21,887
Fans are expected

1262
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:22,911
The last 30

1263
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:25,727
But our warranty is

1264
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:27,007
15 year war

1265
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:28,031
So

1266
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:29,055
I wanted to clarify

1267
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:32,127
I don't get in trouble

1268
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:33,663
15

1269
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:35,455
All right

1270
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:41,855
Warranty on these things doesn't mean you're going to warranty or software you guys have plans to update and do all of that

1271
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:44,671
We're still all in

1272
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:46,207
And you know our plan is to

1273
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:46,975
Continue.

1274
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:47,999
Support these customers

1275
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:48,767
And

1276
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:54,655
They are the products that they bought and they know as of right now I don't we have no other plans other than

1277
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:55,679
N to continue to

1278
00:52:55,935 --> 00:52:56,959
Support these customers

1279
00:52:57,215 --> 00:53:00,543
Provide software updates as the world around us changes as

1280
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:02,079
There's new iOS

1281
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:06,175
Update or new networking updates we continue to

1282
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:07,967
Provide that extra value.

1283
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:08,735
Our customers

1284
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:10,527
Okay that's a tall order

1285
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:12,319
Because like if I think about you guys

1286
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:13,855
Just spending

1287
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:15,391
$3 a year

1288
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:16,927
On AWS for a

1289
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:19,743
Example or 8

1290
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:21,023
87 million fans

1291
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:23,071
You've got a $3000000 line-item

1292
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:23,839
Every year

1293
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:24,607
For the next 50

1294
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:26,399
And that feels

1295
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:27,167
I don't know

1296
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:28,959
Balance sheet

1297
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:30,239
Cuz your private company

1298
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:31,519
I feel significant

1299
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:34,335
Yeah well you know it's not for everyone

1300
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:35,615
And you know IR

1301
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:39,199
Again premium fans that were selling to our customers in

1302
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:39,967
Materials

1303
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:40,991
And Technology

1304
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:42,271
And performance

1305
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:44,831
And so you know we have that affordance

1306
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:46,623
But you know if we were

1307
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:48,671
Not to pick on anybody but if we were

1308
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:51,743
Selling at a light bulb then that's a whole different ball game

1309
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:59,679
So maybe it's a different ball game but they have the market will dictate what they're willing to pay for these products and

1310
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:03,263
I think we've all seen the smart light bulb market is

1311
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:05,055
Continue to go down in price

1312
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:08,127
And more manufacturers have gotten to that game

1313
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:12,223
It may not make sense for those companies to offer that level of support for that.

1314
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:16,319
