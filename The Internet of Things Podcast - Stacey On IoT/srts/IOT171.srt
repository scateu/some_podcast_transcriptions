Get it started

38
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:18,496
Our first call is from

39
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:19,264
Frank

40
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:20,288
Yes

41
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,824
Really good question

42
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,896
Penn State game

43
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:31,296
Homeowners insurance and the guest you had on

44
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,624
Naomi Campbell Technologies

45
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:37,696
Homeowners insurance

46
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:41,024
Places that offer discounts or some kind of antenna

47
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,328
Houses with Smart Home

48
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:47,168
Unlike other than just alarm just wondering if you guys had any information about

49
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,216
Camino

50
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:53,568
Frank this is a great question

51
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:54,336
And

52
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:57,152
I'm sad to say that a lot of them still Focus mode

53
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,688
Mostly on home security

54
00:02:58,944 --> 00:02:59,456
Not

55
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,272
But we got a couple

56
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:05,600
In all of the sensors in this case are basically here

57
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:06,368
Nest

58
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,392
Smoke detector

59
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,928
Actor so American family

60
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:10,720
Insurance offers discounts

61
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:12,256
Four people have a Nest smoke

62
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:15,584
Tractor and who opted into sharing if their batteries are

63
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,400
This is a big question for ensure

64
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,960
Liberty Mutual does the same thing

65
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:23,264
And I know this is security-related

66
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,080
But American family also offers a discount

67
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:30,944
For people who install the ring doorbell and then ring actually offers some Disco

68
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,992
Counts to people as well

69
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,272
And finally

70
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:36,576
State Farm has a deal with Canary

71
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:38,368
Where they will offer you

72
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,904
I think it's $20 off

73
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:44,256
The purchase of a canary but then also $20 annually

74
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,280
Off the

75
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,048
Canary subscription

76
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:52,960
Right and that's a $10 a month subscription I know because I have the canary and I pay that so that's like getting two months of the

77
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:53,728
The service are free

78
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:58,080
So we're not get to the place where Insurance firms are saying

79
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:01,152
Hey we're going to subsidize your water sensors and that sort of thing

80
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,944
But I will say

81
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:09,344
I think we're going to get there and I think we're probably going to get there next year so 2019 I think we'll start seeing policies

82
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,440
Is start seeing more discounts but we may even start seeing some of these

83
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,976
Policies built around

84
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,327
The insurance firms are really into this but as we said

85
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,375
Before they need that data

86
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,167
All right

87
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,191
So

88
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,727
Stay tuned in your life

89
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,519
For insurance discounts on Summer

90
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:28,543
Homegear

91
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,823
Next question

92
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:34,943
Hey Kevin and Stacy my name is Jeremy and I have been thinking about getting a

93
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:35,711
Smart Lock

94
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:38,271
But sometimes you know when somebody shots

95
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,295
The door they don't

96
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,575
Closing all the way

97
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:46,463
And some wondering if you guys have had that experience where maybe it's not shut all the way and then you're somewhere else like

98
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,255
Maybe you know I'm not at home or

99
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:51,327
Using the app to lock it like do you know

100
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,119
Door doesn't lock

101
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:56,703
Because of that boat can go into the hole because the doors not shut all the way

102
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:57,727
Man

103
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:58,751
Jeremy I have

104
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:02,079
I've tried like half a dozen smart locks and I literally have

105
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,871
Never thought about this

106
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:08,223
It is until August actually introduced something called Dorset

107
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:12,063
Which is basically a magnetic sensor that you stick near the deadbolt

108
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,111
Or inside your door for

109
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:17,951
And it will actually detect if the deadbolt has been engaged

110
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:18,975
The door is actually

111
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:21,279
Still open this is literally never happy

112
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,583
But it's a really good question

113
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,863
And right now

114
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,911
That's really the main

115
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:30,239
Option out there so you could buy the August door lock

116
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,775
With doorsense in it

117
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,335
Has it integrated as part of the package or

118
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,103
Kevin came up

119
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:40,479
Well it's clever that August has done that's because they have integrated the sensor with the lock

120
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:46,879
However the center itself appears to be just a magnetic sensor and you can certainly buy any one of them

121
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:47,647
The number of

122
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:51,231
Magnetic sensors that use typically zigbee or Z-Wave

123
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:57,631
Which would replicate exactly what door sense does so if you don't want an August door lock you can certainly try a different Smart Lock

124
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:04,031
And add your own magnetic sensor it may not look as pretty because most of those are not in recessed options so you'll have a little

125
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:10,431
Sensor on the door and the door frame but still that would work and give you more options to choose from if you

126
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:16,575
Like that actually makes a lovely recessed sensor that you do then have to drill the hole in your door

127
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,111
Mordor and

128
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:18,879
Put it in there

129
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:20,159
But it is recessed

130
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:23,231
The final option I'll give you

131
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:24,255
Is pretty low

132
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:27,071
It's pretty easy pretty cheap so you can

133
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,863
Can get a wyze camera

134
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:32,959
And stick it so it faces your door and then you can always check in

135
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:35,519
With this $20 camera and be like oh hey

136
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,823
My deadbolt engage but my door is actually still open

137
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,591
If this is

138
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,615
Like a big concern of

139
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:43,967
The downside to all of these actually is if the door is still

140
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:44,735
Open

141
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,527
You do have to go back home and

142
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:47,295
Close it

143
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,575
Or maybe it's just call someone

144
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:55,743
Right I would probably set up some type of automation that triggers if the door magnetic sensor

145
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,023
Is showing open

146
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:02,655
For more than a couple minutes or something to that effect when you're not at home that way you're not too far from home and you can just go back

147
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,423
There you go

148
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,727
So if you do the external door sensor

149
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:06,751
You're going to need a hug

150
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:07,775
Cuz they are zigbee

151
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,823
If so you're really getting into

152
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:10,847
Investment charity

153
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:13,151
But then you got a lot of fun with your

154
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:16,479
Alright next

155
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,527
Stop is a question from Rob

Let's hear your question

162
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,463
Hi Stacy

163
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,743
My name is Rob

164
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,535
I'm a retired electronics engineer

165
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,559
Here in Austin

166
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:32,095
I got into Electronics

167
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,887
In the early 60s as a kid

168
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:37,471
Now after several years of retirement I want to get back into it

169
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,007

Home automation gadgets

172
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,847
Seemed like a fun Avenue

173
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:45,407
But I don't want my gadgets to be too dependent on

174
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,199
Proprietary protocols

175
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:47,967
Or

176
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:50,271

177
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,575
What tips do you have

178
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:58,463
But you can give me to find DIY friendly devices plans parts and protocols

Thanks for a great podcast

183
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,423
Okay Rob

184
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,191
This

185
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:12,031
Is I think I actually really common desire among the lot of our audio

186
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:14,079
Yes you guys do not want stuff sent to

187
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:14,847
The cloud for the most

188
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:15,615
Parrot sounds like

189
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,383
Mike and

190
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,991
You don't want to have the compromises that come with the incredible lack of standards that we have in the

191
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:21,759
The industry today

192
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:22,527
I get that

193
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:23,295
But

194
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,575
We don't have a lot of

195
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,343
Options for

196
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:26,367
So

197
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:29,183
You want to control it all on your own

198
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,999
You could do something like load openhab

199
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,535
Are home assistant or

200
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,815
Homebridge on lyca

201
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,863
Hi it control everything

202
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,911
Locally from your pie

203
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:45,823
That's pretty complicated thing but you do say that you're doubly so you might be totally comfortable with that level

204
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:46,591
Love

205
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,615
Effort in

206
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:48,639
Granularity

207
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:51,711
I will say that I put openhab on

208
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:52,735
Can I use pine sol

209
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:57,087
Xt4 who's difficult to get it on there but man the level of control I had was

210
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,367
Awesome

211
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,135
And sky

212
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,695
But there's a downside

213
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:05,023
There is a downside if you do any of these things

214
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,047
You have a problem

215
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,607
Which is if for example your door isn't

216
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:13,727
And you're like my door is unlocked I will remotely control it from my smartphone while I am at dinner

217
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,263
You can't actually do that

218
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,823
And that lack of remote control

219
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:18,591
That made

220
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:21,407
Ear problem for you it kind of depends on the things you want to do with

221
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,175
Secure Smart Home

222
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,199
I would like

223
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:23,967
To have the remote

224
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:24,991
Access myself

225
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:27,551
I'm the same way I like my remote access

226
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,319
But I

227
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:32,927
Don't know that I want everything going to the cloud and you can do that you can have a local hub

228
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:39,327
Still have remote access so it sounds like you don't even want that so you can pick and choose what you'd like to do there is another new

229
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:42,399
New Option out there which is no cloud

230
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,423
Data an app

231
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,703
Is the habitat

232
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,263
Hub which we have a review in it

233
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:53,407
Hopefully coming soon so we'll be able to tell you a lot more but I know it's at least on paper it would meet your specifications

234
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:59,807
Because it is totally in your network does not go to the outside for its Smart Home Smart

235
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,855
Habitat where do they come from

236
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:04,415
Beef Elders actually built the rules engine

237
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,439
For the SmartThings

238
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:06,463
So

239
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:09,023
These guys they looked at SmartThings Chevrolet

240
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,559
Like I like where this is going

241
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:11,583
Pretty granular

242
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:13,375
Can go as deep as you want to

243
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,399
But they

244
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,703
Did not like a lot of the aspects of the

245
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,727
Cloud connectivity

246
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:18,495
So

247
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:21,311
They were like hey I want to control all of this on my own

248
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:25,407
Yeah well once we have that in-house we can

249
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:28,479
Tell you more how it works one other thing I'd like to mention if

250
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,503
Rob really wants

251
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:35,903
Tinker and not have a ton of different apps because obviously certain devices that not necessarily certain protocol

252
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,951
Close but just kind of use their own app

253
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:44,351
Controlling things like that you could actually get into some very light coding and use apis that are available from a lot of

254
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:50,751
The different device makers I control a lifx bulb using a Raspberry Pi and some python

255
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,543
It's literally just a couple lines of

256
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:58,943
Code to actually enable of lighter so on so forth so if you don't want a ton of apps as well and you want your own controls you could do that too

257
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:04,831
I will warn you and I will warn anyone who says I don't want to depend on proprietary protocols

258
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:07,135
I will say that it's not just the

259
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,671
Proprietary protocols that

260
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:13,791
Okay let's go with another question we have got one

261
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:14,559
From

262
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:15,327
Eric

263
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,375
With kind of a doozy so

264
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,399
Let's hear it

265
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:21,471
PlayStation Kevin Dwyer up some wise cameras

266
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:24,031
Problem before today would make a

267
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,567
Small USB

268
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,847
Tension wire

269
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:27,871
Power only

270
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,151
With a

271
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,431
Plug in the middle of it

272
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:34,271
Very small such said I can go maybe a quarter inch hole

273
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,295
Ancestry

274
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:37,599
We connected on the other side of the wall

275
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:39,135
Minimize the hole size

276
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,159
Of course.

277
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,183
Most USB

278
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:47,071
Hey connectors are pretty big in the night camera connectors are still fairly big so I want a midpoint disconnect

279
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:49,375
Push it through a hole

280
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:52,191
Anyway thanks for your help and love you podcast

281
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:54,239
So Eric I look

282
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:56,799
All over the web like the entire web

283
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,079
4 USB

284
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:02,431
Cable that has a disconnect in the middle and I struck out and I don't know if that's

285
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:05,759
Because there's no demand for them or the USB spect

286
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,039
Not allow for those

287
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:13,439
So the short answer is there is no cable it's going to work for what you want to do and I get while you want to do what you want to do

288
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:16,767
You want to limit the hole that you're drilling to pass through Power

289
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:17,535
4

290
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,071
A wyzecam in another room

291
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,351
So

292
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:25,983
I came up with some Alternatives and I'll let you decide if any of these are workable one is that

293
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:31,103
You could if you have an outlet within 5 Mi of the wise

294
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:37,247
Camera that you're going to put up what you could do is swap at Outlet out with another Outlet

295
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:41,087
That still has three prongs but also has additional USB port

296
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:47,487
Sports and these are inexpensive maybe $15 I have a couple of my office that are easy to wire and what that'll do is

297
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,791
Is it a let you use a regular USB

298
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:56,191
Cable from that outlet unfortunately you're going to see the wire because that's going to be in the same room but that is an option and I

299
00:12:56,447 --> 00:13:00,287
I said five meters because that is the spec USB for length

300
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:06,943
Shouldn't be more than once you get repeaters and all but you wouldn't need that I'm trying to think of some other options there just aren't too many I know

301
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,991
I know Stacy you thought of something if

302
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:14,879
You want to have an electrician come in the house and drop a new outlet

303
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:17,951
Because of my life I need more outlets in weird places.

304
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:19,999
Under my sink

305
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:26,911
So you just have the electrician come out if there is a light switch or an existing outlet they can run some

306
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:29,727
Something up the wall down the wall anywhere on the wall

307
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:33,311
It cost about in Austin it cost about $25 to get

308
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:37,407
Added onto your visit so there's usually a small visit fee and

309
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,687
That so

310
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,711
And while they're out there they could

311
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:40,735
About all your lights

312
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,807
So that's really the only option I had

313
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,087
Which is not proper

314
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:49,183
Okay sorry bad news there but

315
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:50,463
We have some good news

316
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,487
Next color

317
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,511
Who is from

318
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,279
Canada

319
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,303
Hi Kevin

320
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,887
Canada

321
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:58,911
Work

322
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:01,215
A girlfriend

323
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,455
Canada

324
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,015
Affordable

325
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,295
Lucia Nutley

326
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,831
Hear from you

327
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:18,623
First off

328
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:21,439
Your girlfriend with the SmartThings Hub she's a keeper

329
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,999
Because it's hard to find people who you love and who

330
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:26,047
One day you might live with who like

331
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,583
Having the destruction of a smart

332
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,607
Courthouse cell

333
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:33,471
We went and looked for this particular product I used to try smoke alarms out

334
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,239
End

335
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:36,031
The challenge was my dogwood

336
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,311
So I stopped trying

337
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,359
But I did go and find

338
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,383
A First Alert one

339
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,223
Because I know that they actually work with lots of different options

340
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,247
Kitty

341
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:47,807
Kidde I'm not sure how you say it they have a

342
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:50,623
Proprietary radio so not all if there's work with

343
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:52,159
Other devices that

344
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,183
Don't have that radio in them

345
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:56,511
But I look for a First Alert Z-Wave smoke detector

346
00:14:57,023 --> 00:15:01,119
Because the Wi-Fi ones 8 they need to be wired they require a lot of power

347
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,191
All seem to have secret surveillance

348
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,471
Cameras in them which kind of fruit

349
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:06,751
Is that real

350
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:09,567
I went searching for a Z-Wave smoke detector

351
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,847
On Amazon

352
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:12,127
Canadian site

353
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,663
By golly I found one

354
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,687
I found a

355
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,991
Lovely one that actually does work with smart

356
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,015
It does not work

357
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,063
And

358
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,087
It costs

359
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,879
Roughly $88 Canadian

360
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,927
So it felt a little expensive

361
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:29,279
But you know you can do the cool things like when your smoke alarm goes off

362
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:31,583
You can set a program and SmartThings so it

363
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,887
Like turn your lights on and off

364
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:34,655
If you want

365
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,959
Text you can do lots of fun things

366
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:43,103
It's a bummer that doesn't work with wink I know it'll work for this particular call or would not work for me my

367
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:43,871
Family is awake

368
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:47,455
Maybe I should be on your Tinder profile do you like SmartThings or wink

369
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,247
Your profile

370
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:52,319
No comment node of course not

371
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,599
Of course not

372
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,903
Like I'm going to have to tell your wife

373
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,695
No no no she's awake

374
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:58,975
There you go

375
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:02,815
So yes and Kevin I think actually before the show

376
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:03,583
He pointed out that

377
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:13,567
No because you know I looked at The Nest smoke alarms and see you know you can spend a hundred $2,250 a month

378
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:19,967
More for each one and that adds up quickly and 88 Canadian dollars is roughly around 65 you

379
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:26,367
U.s. dollar so it's a lot cheaper than the nest options that we have here so I don't think it's too terrible but again I don't know

380
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:28,159
This particular individuals budget

381
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:30,463
His first girlfriend he's going to spend the money

382
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:31,487
Spend the money

383
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:32,255
Yeah she's

384
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:33,791
Scrapy she's twerking

385
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:34,815
She's worth it

386
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:35,839
Apus next

387
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:37,887
This week's

388
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:39,423
Winner I wish we

389
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,215
We have little bells

390
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,239
I should really invest

391
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,543
This is Robert

392
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,311
And

393
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,079
He

394
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:48,127
Has a question that actually surprisingly

395
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:48,895
Easy to answer

396
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:49,919
Very short answer

397
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:51,711
With a very long explanation

398
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:52,479
Exactly

399
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:53,247
So let's

400
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:54,015
Tear it

401
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:59,391
Another time but I'm just getting into the home automation thing

402
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:02,463
I was looking at the home assistant

403
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:04,767
Be my first project

404
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,559
Start in a new home on 3rd

405
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,351
Getting

406
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:11,423
I just want to know if

407
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:16,031
First timer into the

408
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,311
World

409
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:18,591
Okay Robert

410
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,871
Here is the short answer

411
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,407
No no

412
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:26,015
And why is that

413
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,367
We don't have any sense Robert of how Adept you are technically

414
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:32,671
Play End like I was saved when I installed

415
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:33,439
Openhab

416
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,463
Home assistant

417
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:37,279
Looks actually a little bit easier to install

418
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,815
Then openhab

419
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:44,191
But it still requires you to be familiar with having a Raspberry Pi and

420
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,983
Loading software onto it

421
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,263
And the interface

422
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,543
Looks amazing

423
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:52,639
But man I'm going to tell you getting the software on these things is like a

424
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:53,663
Journey ended up

425
00:17:55,967 --> 00:18:02,111
Yeah this is one of those that you would install on Raspberry Pi so that's why we're leaving towards you know but Robert if you can name for Lee

426
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:06,463
Linux distros off of top of your head that would tell me you're Savvy enough to make this happen

427
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:09,279
So if you are then yes would be our answer

428
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:15,679
Is your not then know this would be similar to as you said Stacy the hoping to have Mozilla things Etc

429
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:21,823
Probably better off as a first-time smart home buyer to get a smart home hub such as SmartThings or

430
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:24,383
Wink work will say more about habitat

431
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:26,431
Once we have that in-house it can tell you

432
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:30,527
If we would recommend that so that would be a recommendation

433
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:34,879
So on the one and you have openhab you have home assistant

434
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:35,903
Homebridge

435
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,439
Super powerful

436
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:40,767
Requires a lot of expertise and it also requires a lot of time like

437
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:44,607
When I was playing with openhab man I could spend an hour

438
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:46,911
Setting up one light bulb

439
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,215
Because that's how much greater than it was

440
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:54,079
Wonderful for anybody who ever like played D&D and spent hours designing their character

441
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:56,383
I mean that's kind of what I felt like

442
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:58,687
Now

443
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:01,247
The next level above that I would say smart

444
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:03,551
Switch gives you a lot of programmability

445
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:05,343
It's a little less

446
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:09,695
Is that a lot with the reliability but still there sometimes

447
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:10,463
Some issues

448
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:12,511
It's a little less user-friendly

449
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,815
I think it was idiot-proof and then wink

450
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:15,839
Is just

451
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,887
To me it's the gold standard of hubs for

452
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,167
Cuse and then

453
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,447
Homekit is

454
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:25,567
Also super easy probably easier than wink but you have your than in a tall Apple

455
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:26,335
Ecosystem

456
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,359
Which doesn't work

457
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:29,919
Right I would agree also have some limitations and that

458
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:32,223
Would be in the device choice because

459
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:37,599
You can't using Peter Z-Wave with homekit you're stuck with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth type devices

460
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,135
So that is our

461
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,671
Gradient of home hub

462
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,743
All right

463
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:45,023
And congratulations

464
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,583
You in the Schlage

465
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:49,887
Lock so that's actually a good start

466
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,191
And now

467
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,471
A question

468
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:54,495
From Twain

469
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:58,079
Atlanta

470
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:00,383
Stacy I just saw your twin

471
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:06,783
The post referring to Kevin's article on the routers and smart home hub

472
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,319
I have a question

473
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:10,111
I'm actually looking

474
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:14,207
Getting the Samsung connect home 3 pack

475
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,743
Actually for

476
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:18,047
$99 which is unbelievably

477
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:20,607
Just low and I'm wondering what are your thoughts

478
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:27,263
Is it a good unit I'm considering also get into the Google wi-fi system but I just wanted to know your salt

479
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,799
Samsung

480
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:32,127
Prices

481
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:34,431
Thank you

482
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,711
And thanks Michelle

483
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:38,015
Dwayne we are really sorry that we

484
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:40,063
We did not get to you in time

485
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:42,623
For this deal because it was a smoking hot deal

486
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:43,391
But

487
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:44,671
Is Kevin will explain

488
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:46,719
We're a little confused as to what you're asked

489
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:47,999
We think you're asking too diff

490
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:51,583
Right you should mention the Samsung connect 3 pack

491
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:56,959
Which is a mesh Network and you also mention Google Wi-Fi as a contender which is also a mesh Network

492
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:01,823
So that's fine those are on par right there there's a some subtle differences that I mention II

493
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:03,103
But there's one key

494
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:06,431
Prince the Samsung connect is also a SmartThings

495
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,967
Hub for your smartphone

496
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:12,831
Google Wi-Fi is not a smart home hub so it is strictly a network

497
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:14,367
Set up for your home

498
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:16,159
So if you're looking for just

499
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:16,928
A network

500
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:17,952
In your eyes

501
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:22,560
Either would do the Samsung connect uses slightly faster Wireless

502
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:28,960
Radios that are up to 1300 megabits per second theoretical real world is not going to be quite that fast.

503
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:33,824
Google Wi-Fi is 1200 megabits per second you probably wouldn't notice the difference

504
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,592
You may not have it

505
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:42,272
Right exactly it all depends but even for internal transfer from computer to computer that's where you would gain some benefit and see the fast

506
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:45,344
Speed regardless though if you don't have a hub

507
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,696
And you're looking for a hug the only choice of the two you mentioned would be the Samsung connect

508
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:50,464
Because

509
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,256
SmartThings is built in

510
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,304
Hopefully that helps

511
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,072
Hopefully

512
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:56,864
You see that awesome deal again

513
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:57,888
Keep decided you were

514
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:03,008
What do you pull the trigger on that $99 deal on save two hundred bucks

515
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,568
If so good deal good on you

516
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,616
All right

517
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:08,384
Final

518
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,920
Question of the

519
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:11,456

548
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:08,288
And I wouldn't say we went through all of them but we went through a bunch

549
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:10,080
And we installed and use them

550
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:10,848
To come up with

551
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:16,736
Five recommendations here granted you can go through yourself and find additional ones but we really enjoyed using these

552
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:17,760
Yes and

553
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,552
Smarter and

554
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:22,624
We weren't

555
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,904
So first up

556
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,464
Is the National Geographic

557
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,232
Wiz

558
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,768
Skill reputable name

559
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:29,792
And

560
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:34,656
A very functional quiz so what this does is it every single day you get 6 dude

561
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:35,936
Geography based question

562
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:36,960
And the Americans

563
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:40,544
This was good Kevin and I however

564
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:44,896
I believe we scored 6 out of 6 on AR quiz

565
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:49,504
And there's a range some of them are very easy and some of them

566
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,808
We're a little more challenging I wouldn't say any of them

567
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:53,344
With your liking

568
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,624
Jeopardy champion

569
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,440
Quiz Bowl champion these are probably not going to stump you but

570
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,976
Definitely good for the classroom

571
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,256
Then we have

572
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:02,816
NASA NASA Mars

573
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:06,144
Yes That's Amore as I thought it would be

574
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,936
Good and it was

575
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:09,216
However it

576
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:15,616
Was very information dense it sometimes we'd asked what we thought was a simple question and we would hear a 5 min

577
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:19,968
Answer so there's a lot of detail in here this is me by JPL

578
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:22,528
Who would certainly know what's going on on Mars

579
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:28,928
That's correct

580
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:33,792
And you can get information about Mars but what we thought was really cool you can get

581
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:36,608
What is a real time but same day information

582
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:37,376
On the

583
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,656
Curiosity Rover

584
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:40,960
And when we happen to ask about it

585
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:41,984
Curiosity

586
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,568
Actually did not go as far as planned on Mars that day

587
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:51,712
And we found out exactly what the problem is and exactly what NASA is doing to resolve it I mean it was

588
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:54,016
Serious information really really cool

589
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:57,856
It was awesome and they had you know we asked I didn't realize this but

590
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,184
And we found out

591
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:02,208
The Moon's name

592
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:03,744
And we also found out

593
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,768
Why they were named

594
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:08,864
Complete mythological history very very very

595
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,400
So if

596
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:13,984
I was just asking about how many moons it had we got all of that information

597
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:14,752
Yes

598
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:15,776
We did not have to

599
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,384
It's actually probably a lot

600
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,712
Why does this work and then I'm like

601
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:25,504
Let me explain it to you

602
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:31,648
A half an hour and two drinks later you'll get your answer

603
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:32,416
Exactly

604
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:35,232
So we like that is probably for older

605
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,512
Patient people

606
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,048
We also tried for younger

607
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:39,328
Kids smart math

608
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,376
Which there a lot of smart math

609
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:43,424
I was looking for a math fact skill

610
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,216
Basically for my daughter

611
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:48,032
Because not too long ago we were in that realm of like

612
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:49,568
Hey what's 2 + 2 2

613
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:50,336
2 * 2

614
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:51,104
2 / 2

615
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:53,408
All of those fun things and

616
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:55,712
How cool would it be if you could just ask

617
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:56,992
Mate for your man

618
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,272
And it's

619
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:00,064
Pretty cool but it's also

620
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:02,624
Bus RTC it starts really easy

621
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,464
And this skill basically gives you 40 seconds and

622
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,024
Matinee will ask you math facts for that

623
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:09,792
Amount of time

624
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:11,328
I really wanted to go like

625
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,400
All out super fast but Madam is not super

626
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:16,192
But I did get 40 seconds

627
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:18,240
Which was 8 questions and they were like

628
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:19,520
OnePlus 4

629
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:20,544
Kevin heard me

630
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,336
Answer this at first I was like

631
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,616
Nervous about doing math

632
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:25,408
Nothing from the Kevin but it was not hard

633
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:27,200
But you can level up but I

634
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:27,968
I think it's a Time

635
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:31,296
Ruidoso baby for younger

636
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:32,832
And then

637
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,368
Kevin and I

638
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,464
You want to talk about our secret shame

639
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:44,608
Yeah I'm very disappointed in my performance on the periodic table quiz because I just

640
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:47,424
Went through the periodic table in the big history project

641
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,496
Switch I highly recommend for people if you could have big history project

642
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:51,264
X.com

643
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:56,384
I screwed up my alkaline metals in my transition metals in this one is really

644
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,688
Really challenging but educational

645
00:26:58,944 --> 00:26:59,712
Tons of

646
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:00,480
Good

647
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:03,552
Good tough questions but I learned so much

648
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:05,088
I forget how many questions it asks

649
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:06,368
Fastest 5K

650
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,648
Sweet By the way

651
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,672
Only got

652
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:11,488
Two or three

653
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:12,768
We were not great but

654
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:13,536
Will be better next

655
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:15,584
I'm actually I kept that on there cuz I'm like

656
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,608
You will not pass

657
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:17,376
Best me.

658
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:19,168
But it did

659
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:21,216
But not again

660
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:25,568
And it's also better more for the sciencey kids that are in a folder or

661
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:31,968
Higher grade level so it's not Elementary School obviously which we had some pics in there if this was more towards the middle school and heck maybe even

662
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:32,736
High School

663
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:34,272
Or adults

664
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:36,064
As we sold our

665
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:39,392
All right in our final one is educational for anybody

666
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,416
I just liked

667
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:43,744
This and hopefully you guys will too it is the Autobahn

668
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,768
Bird songs

669
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,048
Scale and

670
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:48,864
You basically you ask madam A2

671
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,144
Ask Audubon

672
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:51,424
What a Mockingbird

673
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,192
It sounds like

674
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:53,728
And it will play

675
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:54,752
Mockingbird

676
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:57,824
I just thought this was needed it's not like Shazam for birds

677
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:02,176
Which would be even cooler but it's still for anybody who likes the animals or

678
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,456
To hear what's around them

679
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:11,392
Yeah you can ask it about any different bird I forget how many it actually has how many birds that actually covers butt

680
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:17,792
There are 2,000 bird calls in the skill and anything is with the Mockingbird and obviously with several other birds if

681
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:24,192
The bird has multiple sounds or calls it will play all of them I think for the Mockingbird played for different ones all in a row

682
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:27,008
Rose we can hear the different calls of a Mockingbird for example

683
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:28,288
Because that's what my king

684
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:30,848
Yes

685
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:32,128
Super cool

686
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,480
Those are some skills I recommend going digging through that we found a couple

687
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:37,760
Like we found a spelling test

688
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,040
Skill that we thought was great

689
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:42,112
Because it let you import your own spelling words but then

690
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:44,416
If you spelled something incorrectly it was like

691
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:45,184
Yeah

692
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:46,208
Didn't say anything

693
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:47,232
Nix that one

694
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:50,304
That was disappointing because I had such promise because

695
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:54,144
Stacy created around list online with the skill and then

696
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,448
Matabei regurgitated the list perfectly

697
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:59,264
But when you misspelled something you just didn't know

698
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:00,544
Didn't say anything

699
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:04,640
Kids with low confidence well it might be good for them but yes

700
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:07,456
So I would recommend all of these skills

701
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:08,736
Look for what you want

702
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:11,040
And then I would say test them out

703
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:13,088
Because some of them are of dubious quality

704
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:14,368
The ones we kiss

705
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,904
I feel pretty confident in

706
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,696
Because we've tried them out but

707
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:18,976
There's a lot so

708
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:26,144
It's so easy to enable the skills right from Amazon the website to so it's not like I could go into your app

709
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:26,912
Testes

710
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:27,936
It's also easy to any

711
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:32,032
Kevin was like I'm not getting my

712
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,312
Or I'm not

713
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,104
I don't need to do that

714
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:37,920
All right well this was super fun you guys think

715
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:38,944
Thanks for sending it

716
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,760
Great questions we had a good time answering them

717
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:43,296
Hope you enjoy the show

718
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:45,600
And we will do this again I'm sure

719
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:46,368
Because

720
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:47,648
