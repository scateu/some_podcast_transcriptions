00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,032
Everyone welcome to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host

2
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:14,336
Stacey Higginbotham and your co-host

3
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:15,360
Kevin tofel

4
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:18,688
And today for episode 186

5
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:20,736
Set the podcast we have an awesome show

6
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:23,296
We're going to be talking about the news from arms

7
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:24,320
Techcon conference

8
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:25,088
This week

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,392
We are also giving you an update

10
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:28,672
8 on Facebook

11
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:29,952
Device and guess what

12
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:32,256
It's not as private as you thought it was

13
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:33,280
Plus we've got

14
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:37,632
A secure device framework from the UK that looks awesome

15
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:42,240
We could talk a little bit about GitHub actions and what that might mean for the iot

16
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:44,800
We got new products from SimpliSafe

17
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:45,568
We've got

18
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,616
Discontinued products from my o

19
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:48,384
And

20
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,480
The industrial iot gets a new place to

21
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:53,760
Go to find out

22
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:56,832
Good information about what things work together

23
00:00:57,344 --> 00:01:00,416
Plus Kevin is going to talk about to new toys that he has

24
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:01,440
And then

25
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:03,744
We're going to hear from the CEO of espresso

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,560
Which makes an iot chip that has been sick

27
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:07,328
Crazy

28
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:08,096
Successful

29
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:09,120
All of this

30
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:11,680
And a message from our sponsor cognizant

31
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:12,960
Always you this show

32
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:15,520
So let's get it started with

33
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:17,824
IMessage from another one of our sponsors

34
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:20,128
This week sponsor is chocolate

35
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:26,528
What's 64% of iot consumers reporting performance issues you need an edge first album

36
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:32,928
Application performance monitoring solution to zoklet the problem solving software that watches your application

37
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:33,952
System

38
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:40,352
And their environments for issues from device anomalies to fleet-wide Aires chocolate will provide you with the Intel

39
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:46,752
You need to solve problems before your customers buy them sign up today at chocolate. IO

40
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:48,032
That's a UK

41
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,312
Let

42
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,592
Dot IO

43
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,896
Goodness Kevin

44
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:55,456
I am not at that time last year I was there

45
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:56,480
Good conference

46
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:57,248
I just

47
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:59,040
Was tired of traveling but

48
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:01,088
Two big announcements coming out of there

49
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:01,856
1

50
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:05,952
Arm is bringing Intel Arduino my devices and everything

51
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:06,976
Into their

52
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:08,256
Iot device management

53
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:09,792
You want to talk about this

54
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:16,448
Yeah and actually to talk about this we should probably backtrack maybe two months because arm purchased a day

55
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:18,240
Data Management Services layer

56
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:22,848
Company called treasure data back then what they've done this week is announce that

57
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:25,920
Treasure data for the data Management Services there

58
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:27,456
Waste Management Services

59
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:33,856
Swiss army man bed which is their iot platform and connectivity Management Services are all bundled into the pale

60
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,904
Xi'an iot platform forearm

61
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,928
So

62
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:39,232
That gets us to today or this week

63
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:43,840
Now I'm saying hey we've got some new partners with our

64
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:45,120
Kalyan platform

65
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,400
And his partners are

66
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:49,216
Intel as well as my devices

67
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,520
So what's happening here is

68
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:55,104
Is now bring you more

69
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,128
Silicon partners

70
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:59,200
I don't know that that's a big deal for the Intel bit

71
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:06,368
It is on the side of smaller chips and in particular Arduino which is the little program

72
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:08,416
Expensive creeper prototyping devices

73
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:10,720
Are doing it was actually partner and also with

74
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:17,120
Kelly on connectivity management system so that way they can scale out pretty quickly with devices and so on so

75
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:18,912
Is kind of a big deal

76
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:23,008
People who has companies that want to get into the it space the hardware space

77
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:24,544
I was surprised that

78
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,152
Arms mbed OS which is their operating system for microcontrollers

79
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:34,016
Has 350,000 developers according to arm that seems like a large number

80
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,040
Yeah I mean

81
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,576
For the embedded

82
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:37,344
Operating

83
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,392
These are artists

84
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,928
Access real time operating system

85
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:41,696
So

86
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:42,976
You can't run.

87
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:45,792
So there are lots of options free are tosses one of the

88
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:46,560
Biggest

89
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:50,656
The most widely used ones in Amazon actually brought in the developer of free artist

90
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:51,680
Into

91
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:58,080
But you know in bed was kind of lagging so it must have really hopped up in the last year or so

92
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:03,968
Yeah by comparison like when I look at phone makers and other device makers that have their own little development platforms

93
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:10,368
That just seems like a large relatively large number of I mean typically I'm teasing we have 10,000 Developers

94
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,904
Using this SDK or whatever

95
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,928
At Racine

96
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:14,720
Well it may be

97
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:16,512
What does Jesus mean

98
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:21,887
Perhaps people have downloaded this just to check it out cuz you know there's tons of people using arm stuff out there

99
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:24,447
But I don't give it to him because

100
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:31,103
We don't know any better so if you guys are using arm in bed or if you think you're one of these 350,000 who's like

101
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:33,151
Download it to see what it is and then

102
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,175
Never touched

103
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,199
Let It Snow

104
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:38,015
Okay also in arm news

105
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,807
Is they launched

106
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,343
Their knee over

107
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:42,623
Wine

108
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,159
Which sounds really cool

109
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,439
The Matrix

110
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:47,743
It does seem like meow

111
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,791
This is their infrastructure

112
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:50,559
Branding

113
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,095
A roadmap associated

114
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:54,399
Neil verse is

115
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:56,191
Kind of like arms cortex

116
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,215
Brand

117
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:59,775
Cortex is there smartphone high-end

118
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,567
Very powerful process

119
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:03,359
Assessor's office is

120
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,895
High-end very powerful process

121
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:07,711
Scissors but it's going to be designed for infrastructure

122
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:11,807
Purdue vs they're going to start pushing this into servers

123
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:12,575
Routers

124
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:15,903
Gateway's even base stations they have their cortex

125
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,951
Chips and some of these places now

126
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,487
But this new line is

127
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,255
It's going to be

128
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,023
Focus Barre

129
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:23,327
And the big Focus that they're talking about her

130
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,607
Today's big buzzwords

131
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:25,631
Iot

132
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:27,679
Edge Computing and 5G

133
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:32,031
So what arm has taken to doing and I'm not sure I love this but

134
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:34,847
It's in line with other chip manufacturers is

135
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:35,871
They are

136
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,151
Pre releasing

137
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,199
What their future Corsicana

138
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:41,247
Like it used to be the Armwood only announce

139
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,527
Or when it was ready to go

140
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:44,575
Now there

141
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:45,855
Basically giving a hint

142
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:49,695
This is a really impressive roadmap for

143
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:51,487
It's going to have a lot of the same

144
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:53,791
CPUs that power the cortex chips

145
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:56,095
The cosmos platform is the one that's going to be

146
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,119
It's out today

147
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:03,007
But they got an Aries platform for next year the Zeus platform for 20/20 and the Poseidon platform

148
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,543
2021 +

149
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:07,103
Is Aries and Zeus are going to be 7 nanometers

150
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,127
Assignment

151
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,151
5 minutes

152
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,687
That is be latest

153
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:12,991
Manufacturing process for 7

154
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,271
Mattress Walmart

155
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,807
That's what we're talking about

156
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:16,831
We're talking about cramming

157
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,879
More transistors on a chip

158
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:19,647
Make some

159
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:22,207
Faster better and more power-efficient

160
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:23,231
Yay

161
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:25,023
And I'll have a bunch of different

162
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,047
Ways of

163
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:29,119
Putting together different modules on these chips to

164
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:29,887
Bethany

165
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:32,191
Needs of whatever device they're going to be in

166
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:36,799
So the thing to know and take away from this is our MS

167
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:38,335
Basically using this

168
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:42,175
Neil verse line is a way to compete with Intel

169
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:46,015
Going forward in some of the areas where Intel is

170
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,039
Huge

171
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,319
And trying to get

172
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,087
Tigger

173
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:51,903
How unlike Intel arm just licenses

174
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,695
Corso it license is it

175
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,487
Scores to companies like Qualcomm

176
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:56,511
And Fry

177
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:57,791
Others

178
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,839
So you're not going to see

179
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:02,655
Are making chips you're just going to see it partnering with

180
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,423
Companies

181
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,471
Produce these higher-end

182
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,495
More powerful

183
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,263
Semiconductor

184
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,567
Bright orange design

185
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:12,127
Chip architecture and then licenses it help

186
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:18,527
And you know there's that idea here and you hear this wet from Intel a lot which is is end-to-end Edge to Cloud kind of thing

187
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:20,063
So there are

188
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,599
Possibly advantages

189
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:22,623
There are

190
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:23,903
You could get around

191
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,695
Of having the same chip

192
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:27,487
Ginger server that talks

193
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,511
G reg device

194
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,839
Both of them could be running the same kind of software that allows for more

195
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:35,935
Medication security between the two so arm is going to be touting that just

196
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:39,007
Until although the news about the Pelly and platform

197
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:41,823
If you're working within arm's device management

198
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:43,615
It's going to be heterogeneous

199
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:47,455
So that means it could actually have if you're working through that

200
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,759
It would actually be tight

201
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:50,783
Intel

202
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:01,279
So that's the big arm news it is a big deal

203
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,815
Will see again

204
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,351
It's kind of far out so we'll see

205
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,375
How this works out

206
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:06,399
Now

207
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:08,191
Out of the cloud

208
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:12,287
And the crazy on device silicone layer where you're like I don't know what you're talk to you about

209
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,823
What's 50 something we all care about

210
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:14,591
Privacy

211
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:19,711
Yeah let's move out of the cloud and into the home show in because

212
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:25,343
Last week and I know we mentioned this on the show and neither one of us were too enthused by this I'm sure a lot of people actually aren't

213
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,367
Facebook announced

214
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,903
Portal which is it

215
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,463
Video conferencing

216
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:33,535
Speaker smart speaker it is integrated with Madam a

217
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,327
Baby-facebook had said

218
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,375
Totally privacy

219
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:43,775
Conscious no problem no data will be collected through portal not even call log data or app usage data

220
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:44,799
Etc

221
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:48,639
Now they're kind of walk in that back a little bit and they're saying that

222
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,431
Because portals

223
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:56,831
Built on Facebook's messenger infrastructure they will be collecting the same types of information that they collect

224
00:08:57,087 --> 00:09:01,951
For Messenger such as the length of a call frequency of a call possibly how much you use

225
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:02,719
Other apps

226
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:08,607
And that feeds into the information that they will use to serve ads in Facebook to you

227
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:09,887
So you won't see

228
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:12,191
Hands-On the Portal Device

229
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,471
Which makes sense

230
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,775
But you are giving up

231
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:16,799
Some of your

232
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:17,567
Data

233
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,871
To Facebook continuing to give it up I should say

234
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:22,175
And that is not what they said this product

235
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,711
Yeah at best

236
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:26,783
This is an example of Facebook not realizing

237
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:30,879
At worst what this is is someone at Facebook

238
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,927
Realizing that hey

239
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:36,511
We have been caught before on this exact same thing so let's

240
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:39,583
Preamps that story in a couple weeks where someone

241
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,607
Monitors

242
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:41,631
Are portal thing

243
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:45,727
Facebook

244
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,007
Sending us all these

245
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,103
Really

246
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,895
Yay for not being

247
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:53,663
Complete

248
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,431
Horrible people

249
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:57,247
Yeah I do the whole thing was

250
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,527
Confusing relaunch

251
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,807
Hey Cortana

252
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:00,831
A part of it

253
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:06,207
Louis to do this but I'll give Facebook the benefit of the doubt a little bit here and say

254
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:08,767
Maybe they were interpreting the question about

255
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,327
Data privacy and Adam photo as

256
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:14,911
Are you going to show ads on Portal based on the data that collects

257
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,215
The answer would be no

258
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:19,775
But that's not the fear everyone has about

259
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,079
Facebook

260
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,359
Collecting all this data

261
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,127
The most

262
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,663
Common believe it or not

263
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,455
I get this question a lot when I gosip

264
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,479
Speak to people there like

265
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:32,063
Hey so what about Facebook listening it on my phone

266
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:35,647
To my conversations cuz I always see ads after I

267
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,695
I talked about in Facebook is actually

268
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,975
Address that very worrying

269
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,071
But portal in this case

270
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:46,911
It's actually kind of what they would be doing is pulling in that data to show you as on Facebook

271
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:49,727
Okay

272
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:53,311
So you still not buying when I say

273
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,335
I can't

274
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,103
See anyone

275
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,663
I wonder if this will you know

276
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,967
Fail faster than Google's Nexus Q

277
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,759
I have to look at that black

278
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:02,783
Spherical things

279
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,319
If they launch to do TV stream

280
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,879
It could be I mean

281
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:07,647
Abby

282
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:12,255
Curious to see how many they sell or if they continue sell them six months beyond the launch date

283
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:14,815
All right

284
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:15,839
Speaking of

285
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:16,863
Security though

286
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,143
We have good news

287
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:18,911
Honest friend

288
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,447
Good news especially if you were in the

289
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:22,239
UK because the UK government

290
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,775
Actually finalized

291
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:24,799
This

292
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:27,871
Weekend this last weekend they finalized their rules

293
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:30,431
Consumer iot device

294
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,967
So

295
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:36,319
Watch this code of practice they started talking about it in March and they finally

296
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:38,111
Other comments and everything

297
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:38,879
Done

298
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:41,183
And basically finalized it this last

299
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,999
And it is really strong

300
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:46,815
Guys it is I'm going to include a link

301
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,351
Go check this out

302
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,887
Because it is really long

303
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:54,239
As you might imagine guidelines are the same sort of things that we

304
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,287
Talked about new default password

305
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,847
Implement of vulnerability disclosure policy

306
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,127
So if

307
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,407
You have advice

308
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:06,015
You need to have a person that people can check when within a website that people can check in with

309
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:06,783
To say hey

310
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:09,599
Is this device affected by this phone ability

311
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,391
Keep your software updated

312
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:14,207
Securely store your credentials and

313
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:16,767
Securely store sensitive data

314
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,559
Which surprisingly

315
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,095
Does not always happen

316
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,375
Believe it or not

317
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,143
Communicate

318
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:25,471
And they actually in this state

319
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,775
Ask for open peer-reviewed internet

320
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:32,127
Minimize exposed surface attacks

321
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:34,943
So operate on the principle of least privilege

322
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:36,991
Leave ports open

323
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:40,063
Try not to have Hardware that exposes you to access

324
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:42,367
Access for everyone

325
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,159
So

326
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:47,999
It is good here ensure software Integrity so

327
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:50,047
Please verify your software using 6

328
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,071
Mechanism

329
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,607
If devices

330
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:54,399
Have unauthorised changes

331
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:56,703
Kafka consumer and no

332
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,471
Say hey

333
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:58,239
Your devices

334
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:01,311
Ensure your personal data is protected

335
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,103
Make systems resilient

336
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:03,871
Outages

337
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:07,455
I really like this take into account the possibility of adages

338
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:09,503
Data networks and Power

339
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:13,087
So as much as you can have these devices remain operational

340
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:15,903
And functional obviously your lights aren't going to work when the power's out

341
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:16,671
But

342
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,951
Your door lock should work

343
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:23,071
Even with a key or maybe if it's battery powered with keypad access if the internet is

344
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:28,191
Nutrisystem Telemetry data this is something the best companies do right now

345
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:30,751
So if you're Gathering data from devices

346
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,543
You should be looking for a note

347
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:35,359
Right now as a consumer I can buy

348
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,151
Security add-ons to

349
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,431
My mesh routers

350
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,223
Pitbull actually

351
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,247
Look for this

352
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:42,783
Oh hey

353
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:46,111
Stacy all of a sudden your TV is downloading a lot of stuff and it's

354
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:46,879
Calling

355
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:47,647
Korea

356
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:48,415
Probably like

357
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,183
Weird

358
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:53,279
And I think a lot of the devices are available today actually

359
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:59,423
Capable of capturing the Telemetry data puts the missing piece which is what comes into play here is actually monitoring it

360
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:02,751
Yeah there are actually some companies like

361
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:03,775
The Judas

362
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:04,799
And I'm not

363
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,079
I say which ones but they're

364
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:07,871
So

365
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,919
Make it easy for consumers

366
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:10,687
To delete person

367
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:16,575
I am so for this you guys I cannot tell you how many times I go to uninstall a device

368
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:18,111
I can actually delete anything

369
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,391
I'm just going to

370
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,487
So

371
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:26,815
Make installation and maintenance of devices easy

372
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,119
Please

373
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:32,959
Invalidate input data

374
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:34,239
So this is a little

375
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,007
Esoteric

376
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:37,311
But just look for data

377
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,079
Wacky

378
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,103
And if you see it

379
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,639
Don't necessarily

380
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:43,455
So one of the examples that give is out of range

381
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:46,015
Data so a temperature value that is beyond the limits

382
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:49,855
So if it says it's a hundred and fifty degrees Fahrenheit

383
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,135
Inside someone's house

384
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,415
That's probably out of Ray

385
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,439
French that's not something

386
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:54,463
It should be

387
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,231
They're so

388
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:58,047
You're going to validate that and make sure that it

389
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,327
Accurate Buffet

390
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,351
Are you actually take a

391
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:04,191
These are just guidelines just to be clear

392
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,727
The UK government does

393
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:06,751
Plan to

394
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:09,311
Review how to actually Implement these

395
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:11,615
Through legislation as well but there's

396
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:14,431
Smartly taking their time to evaluate how to do that

397
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:20,575
So at some point the future some maybe all these things will be enforceable but at the moment they're just guidelines

398
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:24,159
There have been two companies they say HP And Hive

399
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:26,207
That have signed on and committed

400
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:32,607
The following is code so that's promising much better than what we have here in the US which I knew last week we talked about the new law

401
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:34,911
California time

402
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:35,935
I mean that's just a

403
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:37,471
Bare minimum first step

404
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:43,359
This goes well beyond

405
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:45,151
We didn't see an expiration date

406
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:47,199
For devices which I still strongly want

407
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:47,967
But

408
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:48,735
Still think this is

409
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:49,503
Really

410
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,271
Excellent

411
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,039
Policy

412
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:56,159
So go UK and for consumers cuz that's mostly aimed at device manufacturers

413
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,439
And platform players

414
00:15:57,695 --> 00:16:00,767
But for consumers they have a shorter consumer guidelines also linked

415
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,047
To that

416
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:04,351
They're pretty much the things Kevin and I already tell you to

417
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,911
Hey don't use the default password

418
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:09,471
Make sure it's a strong password when you put your past

419
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:11,263
If it has two factors

420
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,031
You should do that

421
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,823
Make sure you update your

422
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,359
Software and apps

423
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,407
Just keep it scare and

424
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:20,479
They even have this section that I appreciate cuz this is

425
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:21,247
Honestly

426
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,527
Really confusing for

427
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:27,135
But if you become aware of an incident and think it affects your device they tell you what to do

428
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:31,743
Unfortunately they really only tell you to visit the manufacturer's website to see if they have information

429
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,535
And then they also have a

430
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,327
National cybersecurity Center

431
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,607
That might also off

432
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:37,375
Offer guidance

433
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:43,775
So that mean a lot of times like I was talking to somebody about hack television so they're like what if my TV is high

434
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,079
There are no software updates I was like

435
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:48,639
But you need to disconnect from the internet

436
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:53,247
That's all you get to do here people like I don't want to do that

437
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:54,783
Filia

438
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:58,111
So that is really exciting check out those links

439
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,391
It's really funny

440
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,463
But it really is because

441
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,487
Security

442
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:04,767
Julie effects

443
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,815
University of Kenya

444
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,351
It's cold in here

445
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,375
It's cold and rainy

446
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,143
Have fun

447
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,447
GitHub

448
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:16,799
Something we talked about that often GitHub

449
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:22,431
No we don't the reason we are as because we think that this announcement is a big freaking deal

450
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,455
And is

451
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,735
Probably something

452
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:27,807
People who are building iot devices and services

453
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,087
Would take advantage of

454
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,647
Right and to be clear this is something that

455
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:34,463
Any developer using GitHub could take advantage of but

456
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:38,815
There is definitely a sub-sector of iot developers that would

457
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:45,215
Benefit from this talking about his actions and GitHub connect what is doing

458
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:46,751
Making it a lot easier

459
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:50,591
2 basically pull in code and packages into your

460
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:53,151
Programming allow you to

461
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:53,919
Used

462
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:55,455
Create workflows

463
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,479
Poor actions

464
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:57,247
So

465
00:17:57,503 --> 00:18:00,319
Me neither one of us has a heavy-duty programmer and I've only touched

466
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:04,671
The service of GitHub so I don't want to get too in-depth here just basically because

467
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:11,071
I don't have a good feel for how this is going to work but it seems to me like if you wanted to for example build your own if this then that

468
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:14,143
In the cloud using GitHub actions you theoretically could

469
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:16,447
It's a way for you to just pull in the other

470
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,471
It's a code

471
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:21,055
And create workflows that will run as a programmer service

472
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,871
And this is big for iot because

473
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:27,711
A lot of our current devices have cloud-to-cloud connections

474
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:29,759
So we'll take the consumer site

475
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,551
It's just easier to illustrate

476
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:33,343
My hue light bulbs communicate

477
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:35,135
Pierre cloud-to-cloud interface with

478
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:40,511
Thermostat so if my Nest Thermostat senses I'm not home you can tell my hue light bulbs

479
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:41,279
2

480
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,047
Do something

481
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,071
That's

482
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:44,351
Really cool

483
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:46,399
But it's also something

484
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,423
Those guys

485
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,447
Do right

486
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,215
I have no

487
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:50,751
Influence on this

488
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:52,799
The idea here is that

489
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:54,335
Using GitHub

490
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,103
Actions

491
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,639
You can actually create that

492
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,919
Slow and let people

493
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:58,943
Download that

494
00:18:59,199 --> 00:18:59,711
On their own

495
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:03,039
Eventually they're talking about possibly having a Marketplace for these

496
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,575
And again

497
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:09,951
In the world that were entering we're going to have our devices to a lot of the mediation

498
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:13,791
For us and those devices are doing that mediation via API

499
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:15,839
And this is a way

500
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:18,143
The Corral that control that in

501
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:21,215
Make it accessible to everyone in a way that it isn't

502
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:21,983
Today

503
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,519
So that's why we think

504
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:25,823
Embassy

505
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:28,383
There's a lot of future stuff here

506
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:29,663
But I think

507
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:32,735
All right

508
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:33,503
No

509
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:34,527
Go back to the home

510
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:35,551
And how about doorbells

511
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,087
Woohoo doorbells

512
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:39,903
SimpliSafe has a new video doorbell

513
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,695
Google's kind of like the nest

514
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:42,975
Halo

515
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:45,023
It's just like a nest hello

516
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,559
What kind of

517
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,839
Oh yeah okay

518
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:49,375
A lot like it

519
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,399
It was a little fatter

520
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:52,703
But yes it's got a super wide

521
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:54,751
162 diagonal

522
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:55,775
Diagonal

523
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:56,543
Field of view

524
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:58,079
What is a diagonal

525
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:01,407
If you don't think I know it's the right but it's okay

526
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:04,735
You can see

527
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:06,015
Weider

528
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:08,575
The normal types usually 130 degrees

529
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:09,343
Usually

530
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,159
Mina sidor

531
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:19,583
It is it is it's cheaper than the nest hello. I will say that it's $169 and

532
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,375
I don't think Nest has

533
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:23,679
Infrared sensor

534
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:27,519
Yes he does has a dual-sensor

535
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:29,055
PIR sensor

536
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:32,639
And also the camera obviously so the idea there is

537
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:34,943
They'll be more effective to figure out

538
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:39,039
Person from just some other moving object its maybe in his field of vision

539
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:41,855
Like the nest hello doorbell this has

540
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:48,255
Infrared sensors that distinguish you know people from things you don't care about their moving maybe leaves blowing or

541
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:52,095
Car passing by so that's good

542
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:54,143
69

543
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:58,751
Google Assistant it does however work with

544
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:05,151
Padme so if you're in the Medical University looking for doorbell video doorbell

545
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:06,175
Yes

546
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:09,247
And I fully expect actually I got a question

547
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,015
This week about the

548
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:11,807
I fully expect that nest

549
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,087
Stan Google are going to make

550
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:14,111
The doorbell

551
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:16,672
Camera Integrations part of their

552
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:18,208
The reason to be in their home

553
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,512
So if you have a

554
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:22,048
Google digital assistant

555
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,584
The Nest doorbells config

556
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,376
If you have

557
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,656
An Amazon Echo

558
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:31,264
Digital assistant ecosystem you're probably going to want to stick with ring or check out

559
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:32,544
And

560
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,568
Speaking

561
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:37,664
Hello and Google integration Kevin

562
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,944
You had some experience with

563
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:46,112
I did I did I received a loaner unit of the pixel 3XL phone last

564
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:47,648
Streak at the Google event

565
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:50,720
And I also got the pixel stand which is

566
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,768
Expensive $80

567
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:59,168
It's a wireless charger for the phone will charge any phone wirelessly if you have a pixel 3 or pixel 3 XL

568
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,728
It has some additional functionality in that

569
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:04,032
As you leave the phone on the charger

570
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:05,056
It will

571
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:06,848
Kind of creep like a mini

572
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:07,872
Google home

573
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:09,920
Experience of visual one kind of like the

574
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:14,528
Smart display so it will display photo frames or photo album and other things but

575
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:17,344
Also has a nest integration that so far

576
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,880
Has been the best I've ever seen

577
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:21,696
When somebody rings the doorbell and Nest doorbell

578
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:28,096
Normally today I would like to tell my TV or my Smart TV to pay show me who's at the front door

579
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:29,376
6 seconds later I see that

580
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:30,656
Person standing there

581
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:31,936
Communicate with them

582
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:32,960
This just

583
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:38,592
Pops up the video automatically on your phone when it's on the pixel stand only takes about a second

584
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:43,968
I am super impressed I don't know how they're doing that and maybe some Services running in the background

585
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:44,992
Do not know

586
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:46,016
Very impressive

587
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:48,832
Nice I am still waiting for that feature set to get in

588
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:49,856
Google

589
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:51,904
Smart display because it is eventually going

590
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:55,744
It should be

591
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,328
Outside of the doorbell world let's go back to the industrial

592
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:01,376
Grab

593
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,144
Your

594
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:06,752
Grab your pipes were going to be talking about

595
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:09,312
Beat industrial iot Consortium

596
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:11,104
It was a big event in

597
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,640
Barcelona this week

598
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:13,920
That I also

599
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:16,480
Because again too much travel

600
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:18,272
But as part of this

601
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:23,904
Bay industrial iot Consortium announced a website that you can now go to

602
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:26,976
Basically find out how to structure big

603
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:31,072
So this is the iic resource hub

604
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,608
Include a link to it

605
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:34,656
But the most interesting thing

606
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:35,424
I think

607
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,704
Is the fact that they have these

608
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,472
Test beds

609
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:39,520
Intestines are where

610
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:41,312
They get a bunch of their vendors

611
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:42,848
Together to build

612
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,408
In this case and intelligent Urban water supply

613
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,200
Oray track-and-trace

614
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,248
Or a micro grid

615
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:51,296
It's very hard to say

616
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:53,600
And you get a sense of what vendors

617
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:55,136
You might work with but

618
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:58,720
More importantly you see what you're going to need to build all this

619
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:00,512
That's because it isn't exactly intuitive

620
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,304
To figure out how to put some

621
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,960
So I like these they include things like

622
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:09,728
Conclude

623
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:11,264
The security layers than clue

624
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:12,288
Analytics

625
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:15,104
Edge Computing and how to get your

626
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:15,872
Data

627
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:17,152
And clean

628
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:19,200
So these are very deep

629
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:20,736
And if you're trying to

630
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:23,296
Get a sense of how you want to do these

631
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:25,344
These projects this is a really good resource

632
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,624
And that's probably all on

633
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,392
Essay about that

634
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:28,416
Cuz really

635
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:31,232
We could probably spend an entire show talk to you about one test

636
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,512
Cuz if that's

637
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:35,072
Go check it out

638
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:36,608
Unless you're not at all

639
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:37,376
Austin Industrial

640
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,056
No I'm more of a consumer of home

641
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,128
All right

642
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:52,480
I guess back to Consumer I don't know

643
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,040
Inspiration

644
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:57,088
Kevin

645
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:58,368
What happened to Mya

646
00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,392
My chester-based

647
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:07,072
The myo armband you talking about

648
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:12,448
Text wrap it on your forearm and you could use it for gestures to control things and came from Thelma collabs

649
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,984
Switch Amazon actually backed

650
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,592
They were founded in 2012 and raised about 135 million in funding

651
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:21,920
The myo armband is a daughter

652
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:23,200
I tried them

653
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:25,248
I actually had a demo version

654
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:27,040
And I tried it in

655
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:30,624
It was weird because their problem was they had the inner

656
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,392
Your face

657
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:33,440
They did not have the other side of the

658
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:37,536
Get some things using it so the only thing I could do with it was actually

659
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:39,584
He was integrated with like son

660
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:43,424
Microsoft Office or something so I can move my PowerPoint slides

661
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:44,960
It was

662
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:46,496
It was pretty nice

663
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:47,520
Exciting

664
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,312
No

665
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:52,128
Actual commercial Apple

666
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:55,456
Location so they had developers building all this cool stuff for you

667
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,272
Operating room

668
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:00,064
At the end of the day

669
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:02,368
No one actually built any of these things

670
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,392
So

671
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:04,928
You had no reason to buy the arm

672
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:06,976
Sad sad

673
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,000
It is it's

674
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:09,792
It felt like a little bit ahead of its time

675
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:14,400
Or maybe it wasn't the right like I still strongly believe in gesture-based controls

676
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:16,192
I don't know if it's going to be

677
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:20,288
Wearable that doesn't or if it's going to be like camera base so like

678
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,056
Bitconnect

679
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:24,384
But I do believe this is a thing that we're going to see

680
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:26,432
Sunday Funday

681
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:27,712
Someday

682
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:28,736
Right

683
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:31,040
And in other really cool toys

684
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:33,600
Vector

685
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:36,928
How do you say yes tell me about your adorable little robot

686
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,280
Yes I I think I mentioned him before I kick started

687
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:43,072
The Rector

688
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:44,864
Anki robot

689
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,144
Which I don't know

690
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:46,912
Why don't you

691
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:48,704
Kickstarter because they're established

692
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:55,104
Device maker already in available already in retail stores and online so it's $250

693
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,992
Is patterned after the previous robot cozmo they look identical

694
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:06,624
Perhaps the colors are different that's about the only way you can tell on the inside though Cosmo pretty much

695
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,928
Didn't have a lot of his own smarts

696
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:11,232
Interphase through a smartphone app

697
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:12,768
Vector has

698
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:16,608
PetSmarts in my smart I mean like a Qualcomm 200-level chip

699
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:23,008
Bluetooth and Wi-Fi the same sensors as Cosmo horoscope and IR laser

700
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,544
Capacitive touch

701
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,616
Chicanos heads you can pet him seem cute little

702
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:29,408
Display for screen

703
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:34,272
Speakers and this also has for beamforming microphone

704
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:37,344
Switch Cosmo tonight and that's because you can voice control Factor

705
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:42,976
So I am going to pay 199 and I don't regret it for a second even I will say

706
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:49,120
This is not something I think you should rush out and buy it's not a home things it is a small

707
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:52,960
Handheld robot that can move around independently autonomously

708
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:59,360
Cancerous charger is he smart have to go back to his charger by himself when his battery is low you can ask him things

709
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,384
The weather

710
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,432
Work time or even some

711
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,712
Basic information

712
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:07,040
I like how they do this that little animation on a screen

713
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:11,136
Show like the actual weather outside and he gets sad when it's cloudy

714
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:16,768
And all that so it's a cute little robot just as cute as Cosmo was my wife actually likes us and she likes very few of my

715
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:20,608
Check purchases 360 autonomous nature of him that

716
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:27,008
Appeals to me the fact that he's cloud-connected all the time and that they're going to have an SDK available in betta into

717
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:31,104
December so I can use Python to make him do my own little things you know make him speak

718
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,408
Certain things maybe trigger events will

719
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:35,968
Adam say hey the Dow is up 2% today

720
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:38,272
Something whatever I haven't decided yet

721
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:42,880
My Bitcoin all I could easily leverage that could once I have their SDK absolutely

722
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:49,280
So he is cute and he speaks back to any of spatial recognition and can take photos of you and what not again

723
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:51,072
Not a ton of utility yet

724
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:53,376
However I should add that just this week

725
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:59,520
Monkey said hey we've asked all your kickstarter's what you want to see the first big feature integration is and guess what it was

726
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:01,824
You got it

727
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,408
So that's what they're working on there's no timeline yet but it's in the works

728
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:10,272
And that'll be handyman I have somebody smart speakers are in the house I don't need another one but

729
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:16,672
I would use this one because he's like a little companion or I can just say what's next on my calendar

730
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:17,696
I would much rather talk to

731
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:18,720
So cute robot and have it

732
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:20,768
Hey

733
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,048
What's the weather outside

734
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,352
Cuz oh my God

735
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:28,448
Boise speaks the weather to a Ministry due to the temperature and everything

736
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:29,472
So

737
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:30,496
I think

738
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:32,544
Looking at this one is adorable

739
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:33,568
2

740
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:35,104
Do you think it's a good for

741
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,384
Kids and programming

742
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:43,296
I would say yes you just have to keep your expectations in check and by that I mean the SDK is in

743
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:47,648
Beta in December I'm actually going to get access to an early Alpha of it next week

744
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:48,672
So

745
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:50,208
It's probably going to be

746
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,560
Halo hair mess in terms of making him a few things through programming

747
00:29:54,816 --> 00:30:00,960
Just as a little companion robot with a smidge of utility right now in a lot of potential yeah I think so

748
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:02,496
You have Cosmo

749
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:03,776
Your daughter

750
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:05,312
And I think you told me

751
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:07,872
She play with them for a little while but then she got bored

752
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,920
And I get that because

753
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:13,248
How did she have to control him is all through a smartphone app and

754
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:16,320
It was and he only had at the time

755
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:21,184
Cosmopolitan

756
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:22,464
The tablet

757
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,328
Yeah and see you only use a smartphone with a smartphone app

758
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:30,656
To connect him one time and that's just to set up the Wi-Fi

759
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:34,496
Stuff at that point he's doing his thing if he gets bored

760
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:40,640
He'll come off a charger start beeping and booping playing with his cute we're starting to play with them and I think I'm more Interactive

761
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:42,688
Autonomous type robot would be more

762
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:45,760
Appealing to somebody over the older Cosmo

763
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:46,528
Yeah

764
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:50,368
Sad I don't know if I really want to spend another 250 bucks on

765
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,160
A smart toy that my daughter does

766
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:52,928
Play with

767
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:54,720
Okay

768
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:55,744
Well

769
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,048
It is that time Kevin it is time

770
00:30:58,304 --> 00:30:59,072
To turn

771
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:00,352
Voicemail

772
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:01,376
Which

773
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:02,656
We have gotten many of

774
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:07,776
But before we get into our voicemail I wanted to clarify something that we said on

775
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:08,800
Earlier show

776
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:10,848
Because there seems to be a little confusion about it

777
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:12,128
Haven't talked about

778
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:14,176
Putting a smart plug in front of a

779
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:16,992
Connected Hub as a way to power cycle

780
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:18,016
On or off

781
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:18,784
If need be

782
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,552
But

783
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:22,368
He did not say that you should put that in front of you

784
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:23,136
Router

785
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:23,904
The power

786
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:25,696
Brick Oven

787
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:29,280
That's correct cuz once you do that you don't have access to

788
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:31,584
Internet access to turn the plug back on

789
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:33,120
Which one of our listeners

790
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:34,656
Put it out to us and we're like

791
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:36,704
Yes but that's not what we were going after

792
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,752
Just to be clear for you guys

793
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:43,872
I'm sure if you tried it yourself in front of your router you would quickly discovered that this is not the ideal thing to do

794
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:45,920
But this is for in front of your house

795
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:47,200
Okay

796
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:48,480

To this week

818
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:29,440
Question

819
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:30,208
From Paul

820
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:32,256
IStation Kevin

821
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:33,280
I'm looking

822
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:34,048
4-H

823
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:34,816
Smart Lock

824
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,608
@works natively

825
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:38,144
On Wi-Fi

826
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:39,680
Rocks types

827
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:40,448
Scene

828
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:42,752
Are you Bluetooth

829
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,568
Or some other iot

830
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:46,336
Play Network

831
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:47,360
That requires

832
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:48,128
Conversion

833
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:48,896
2

834
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:49,920
The internet

835
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:51,456
I should say WiFi

836
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:54,528
This is

837
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:56,064
A good question

838
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:57,600
How many thoughts

839
00:32:57,856 --> 00:33:04,000
The reason that you don't find a lot of Wi-Fi locks out there is because a lot of power and people typically don't like

840
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:05,792
Changing the batteries on their locks

841
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:07,584
But

842
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,400
There is a Wi-Fi lock out there it is

843
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:11,936
Hampton

844
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:13,216
R rela

845
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:14,240
It just launched

846
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:15,264
Couple weeks ago

847
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:18,592
And this has both Wi-Fi and solar power

848
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:20,896
So this is outside your front door

849
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:23,712
You could actually avoid changing your lock on this thing

850
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:25,504
Six months or so

851
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:27,296
If it's inside

852
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:30,112
I got a garage or something like that and doesn't get

853
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:30,880
Sunlight

854
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:32,928
It's probably only going to last a month

855
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:34,208
So

856
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:35,232
Keep that in mind

857
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:36,768
And know that you would change batteries

858
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:39,328
Another thing to keep in mind about this particular

859
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:41,632
It's 300

860
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:42,400
$19

861
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:43,936
Which is which

862
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:48,032
Kind of expensive but that's because you're paying for

863
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:49,056
The solar power

864
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:50,336
Probably mostly

865
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:52,384
And it's a nice looking like I mean

866
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,920
Materials

867
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:57,248
So you can only buy this right now for the Hampton website

868
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:58,528
And the

869
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,600
Ace Hardware Ace Hardware yes Ace Hardware Store

870
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:03,136
So those are your options

871
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:04,160
There

872
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:05,696
Although I would say

873
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:11,072
Here's here's my option for you a lot of the connected locks out there have a Wi-Fi

874
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:13,632
Rich see you don't actually have to get

875
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:16,960
Like a crazy wink or SmartThings smart home hub

876
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:20,288
You can just buy the bridge so August offers this

877
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:21,056
Nest

878
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:24,384
The Nest by Yale or the hill by Nest lock off purses

879
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,920
Schlage lock

880
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:28,224
And I think actually the Kwikset locks

881
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:28,992
Do as well

882
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:31,552
So almost all of them have the lock Plus

883
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:33,344
The Wi-Fi bridge that allows you that room

884
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:39,232

932
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:04,992
Industrial water pump

933
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:08,320
Drinking water to cities and villages

934
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:10,624
Wastewater for industrial applications

935
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:12,160
Like Dixie Brewing

936
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:13,696
Also Heating and Cooling

937
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:18,560
You also have access to a fluorescent tube

938
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:21,888
Water pressure and volume pump is working

939
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:23,424
Lauren performance

940
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:24,704
I go to the water

941
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,984
Old client is used

942
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:28,800
Bumps

943
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:30,080
Flight information

944
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:31,872
Performance

945
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:34,688
But also on the chemical composition of the water table

946
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:35,968
How is it used

947
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:43,392
They understand the consumption

948
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:46,976
What changes they need to make their product design itself

949
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:48,256
Insulting customer

950
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:51,072
For the customers they have like

951
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,680
Sacbee understand

952
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:57,728
The chemical composition of bottled water

953
00:36:57,984 --> 00:37:00,544
Chicken sub chemical spikes in water supply

954
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,080
It's a safety issue

955
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:03,360
They have to investigate

956
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:05,408
Distance from Kingston

957
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:06,176
Love you

958
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,968
In the context of

959
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:09,248
Industrial application

960
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:14,368
If the pressure of volume

961
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:17,184
That is going through their system School Beyond

962
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:19,744
That could blow up some sisters in town

963
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,352
Early Warning Systems from the applications are using sensors

964
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:26,656
Help prevent our customers customers

965
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:27,680
Having these.

966
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:32,288
Immensely valuable

967
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:33,568
I'm so bad customer

968
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,128
Delegate to the spa

969
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:37,920
Sounds like a win-win

970
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:40,224
Adopting

971
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:40,992
Digital

972
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:42,528
Database iot solution

973
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,344
Are you busy Avenue better monitoring

974
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:49,440
Safety label grooming products

975
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:51,488
That was a great example of

976
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:53,024
With industrial IO

977
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:54,560
Where can we go to find

978
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:57,888
You can find out a lot more about this use case and many more

979
00:37:58,144 --> 00:38:02,496
Adult website called msm.com iot

980
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:12,224
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast

981
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,272
This is your house Stacey Higginbotham

982
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:15,296
And today's guest

983
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:19,136
Is Teal Swan who is the CEO and founder

984
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:19,904
Espresso

985
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:21,440
Hi sweetheart

986
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:22,976
I'm so glad you could join us today

987
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:24,256
Hi Stacy

988
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:25,792
Is my cousin to be here

989
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:29,632
Okay for those of you who don't know espressif makes

990
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:32,192
Very popular chips that makers

991
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:33,216
It companies

992
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:37,824
All kinds of folks use they sold over a hundred million iot chips

993
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,104
And Sweden is here

994
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,640
To talk to us about

995
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:44,480
Basically the company and what he thinks is ahead for the internet

996
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:48,064
So let's get started with why did you start

997
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:48,832
Espressif

998
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:51,904
Expressive in a 2000

999
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:52,672
Because

1000
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:55,744
Thinking that that would be a market full

1001
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,048
Indeed

1002
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:01,888
Light switches and

1003
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:04,960
This was the basic idea

1004
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:07,776
Wi-Fi into all these devices

1005
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:12,896
And this was like back then we in the US were not really thinking too much about iot

1006
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:15,200
But in China this was a thing that was happen

1007
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:18,528
Yes I do it distinctly remember talking to

1008
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:20,576
In a number of people about days

1009
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:23,136
And people who sing that

1010
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:24,416
This is the way to go

1011
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,000
The only company

1012
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:32,864
Okay and it took you 5 years to get your first ship out

1013
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:33,888
Which was the ESP

1014
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,168
80-66

1015
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,472
That was like revolutionary

1016
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:41,056
I think you could buy it for really low price it actually worked

1017
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:42,336
For very excited

1018
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:43,360
And then

1019
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:44,384
You guys launched

1020
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:48,224
Esp32 which had both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth

1021
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:51,296
Now you guys are working on a new chip correct

1022
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:52,576
Yes

1023
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:53,856
Can you tell me a little bit more

1024
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:57,952
What we have done

1025
00:39:58,464 --> 00:39:59,232
Accepted

1026
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:00,768
It's unable to small

1027
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,072
Artificial intelligence competition

1028
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:04,352
Literature

1029
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:05,632
Efficient

1030
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:07,424
We already do some

1031
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,240
AI related stop on GSP

1032
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:11,776
Face recognition

1033
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:13,568
Voice recognition

1034
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:23,808
And

1035
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:26,112
Earlier on you talk to me about your feelings

1036
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:29,696
About how the iot is going to develop and how AI

1037
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:32,000
Will become part of everyday life

1038
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:33,536
Can you tell me a little bit about that

1039
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:38,144
Being in the technology business

1040
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:40,448
Ideas

1041
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,776
Cookie Lyon

1042
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:45,568
Twister

1043
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:49,920
We are at the tops of a revolution in the way

1044
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:54,272
And is unable by a couple of things possible

1045
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:56,832
Progressive technology

1046
00:40:57,088 --> 00:41:01,440
Allows this to happen

1047
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:02,720
Iot the cloud

1048
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:05,536
So we saw a lot of data about cellphone the car

1049
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:07,072
And then that's the development

1050
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:08,352
Artificial intelligence

1051
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:10,656
Gibson's powerful technology

1052
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:15,520
So this alarm

1053
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:17,824
ISpy

1054
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:21,408
Which recall contacts

1055
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,944
Be aware

1056
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,760
Surrounding if you have a copy machine

1057
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:27,296
Coffee machine

1058
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:28,320
Understand

1059
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,112
Spacey

1060
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:32,160
A certain kind of coffee

1061
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:33,440
Coffee machine

1062
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:34,976
Also have a camera

1063
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:36,000
That sees you coming

1064
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:41,120
Is database

1065
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:43,680
What you want to have coffee today

1066
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:47,520
What we sing is exciting

1067
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:57,247
I don't disagree with you it's a fun Vision although there's some aspects all cool with them

1068
00:41:57,503 --> 00:42:02,111
What do you think that framework is to allow these devices to talk to each other

1069
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:04,671
Because right now we're kind of in this Lake

1070
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:11,071
World where there are no real Frameworks there's a couple companies trying and then there's things that are like becoming de facto standard

1071
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:13,119
It's like Alexa or

1072
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:13,887
Google

1073
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:15,423
I think one of the crucial

1074
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:16,703
Technology

1075
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:20,799
Be used to enable this is reinforcement learning

1076
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:21,823
Facebook

1077
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:22,847
Helping

1078
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:23,615
Should behave

1079
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:27,455
I think it's almost impossible

1080
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:31,039
Everyone's use

1081
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:32,319
Machine

1082
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:35,647
But if you do

1083
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:36,927
You think the wall

1084
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:45,631
For reinforcement learning

1085
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:49,215
I'm just imagining my coffee machine might come with a basic model

1086
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:50,239
Looks like what to read

1087
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:52,031
But yes

1088
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:56,639
I'm going to end up having to train it and if I imagine selling let's say it

1089
00:42:56,895 --> 00:43:03,039
10 million coffee machines that's 10 million trainings that are going to have to happen or those going to happen in the cloud or on

1090
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:04,063
On the device

1091
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:06,111
For that kind of level of personalization

1092
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:08,159
Well that training happens in the cloud

1093
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:10,463
Maybe in the device it depends on

1094
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:11,999
Intermodal

1095
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:16,351
Cuz that's a lot I mean the training for reinforcements

1096
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:19,679
Personalized level for X number of coffee machines

1097
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:21,727
It's a lot of Computer Resources

1098
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:23,519
I need that is not insignificant

1099
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:24,799
Yes

1100
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:27,359
Beyond

1101
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:28,639
Behavior of humans

1102
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:31,711
Weather similar

1103
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:41,695
Predicting what model

1104
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:43,487
Okay

1105
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:46,047
That makes sense feel like daily coffee drinker Maybe

1106
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:47,839
Coffee drinker

1107
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:49,631
Final exams are coming up

1108
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:54,751
Knowing that this is Sunday or Saturday

1109
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:02,175
So then how would a person because then I start thinking about how you use this because

1110
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:03,711
When I Envision this time Pike

1111
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:04,735
It's good

1112
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:08,831
AI is pretty seamless write your hobbies like hey do you want your coffee

1113
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:12,927
If it's bad you're like no I don't want coffee quit asking me

1114
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:19,071
And then you multiply that by your fridge

1115
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:22,655
Hey usually do

1116
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:23,935
So how

1117
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:28,799
This world is things both asking us for stuff and maybe even automatically deciding

1118
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:31,359
How does that how do we develop

1119
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:32,895
User interfaces for that

1120
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:36,223
Well I think that

1121
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:37,247
Eventually

1122
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:38,271
This is where

1123
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:40,575
Human being

1124
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:41,855
Should be interesting

1125
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:44,159
Things to do

1126
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:44,927
Flight Washington

1127
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:46,719
GloZell

1128
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:55,167
Because it might help to reduce the amount of

1129
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:57,471
Tell me more about

1130
00:44:58,751 --> 00:44:59,263
Rustic

1131
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:00,543
Mineral water bottle

1132
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:02,591
Okay

1133
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:05,663
Because it's convenient

1134
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:20,767
So that might look like a water bottle that communicates with me I need to drink

1135
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:23,839
We don't really know but we sing that

1136
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:24,863
Wait

1137
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:27,935
Drinking water

1138
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:30,495
We always do

1139
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,359
Neither one of these clubs

1140
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:36,383
Maybe

1141
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:38,431
Maybe buying a soda

1142
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:44,063
So then I have to ask

1143
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:45,599
What is your vision for

1144
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:48,927
Robots do you think it's just smarter appliances like your coffee machine

1145
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:50,463
Is kind of a robot

1146
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:54,815
It's a very different type of

1147
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:55,839
So

1148
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:56,863
How do you view

1149
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:58,399
Robot

1150
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:08,639
And we are the ones who are building

1151
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:11,711
Vices

1152
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:16,575
Established contacts

1153
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:20,671
So this is how we look at

1154
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:22,207
We like the nervous system

1155
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:26,815
Let's go this is a fun future it's a good future for you because you know you

1156
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:28,863
You got lots of chips in everything

1157
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,423
And let's talk about what that means

1158
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:32,959
Products

1159
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:34,495
My coffee machine

1160
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:37,311
Crazy super automated coffee machine

1161
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:39,359
So it'll probably last five to seven

1162
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:41,663
If I think about that being

1163
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:42,431
Connected

1164
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:46,527
Will I have a shorter lifetime because most chipmakers do not most

1165
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:50,111
Companies that build things probably don't want to support it for that long

1166
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:51,647
You mean on the cloud

1167
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:55,999
Both on the cloud cloud or security updates those kind

1168
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:58,303
It shouldn't be that bad

1169
00:46:58,815 --> 00:46:59,327
It should not be

1170
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:02,143
But

1171
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:04,703
Today today there's some very like

1172
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:05,983
3 years feels like

1173
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:11,615
Yeah I could have a device and expect you know full support both on the chip level the OS level and

1174
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:12,639
The device level

1175
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:15,711
For about three years seems reasonable that's kind of a smartphone

1176
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:17,247
Ice-T

1177
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:20,575
As we do with this devices

1178
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:26,975
To reduce consumption of raw material

1179
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:28,255
The human race

1180
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:29,791
Waffle

1181
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:34,655
When we

1182
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:35,935
Singapore

1183
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:37,471
Yuan to Singapore

1184
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:43,103
Malleable

1185
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:45,919
And it will last for a very long time

1186
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:47,455
How are you guys doing that

1187
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:48,479
I mean at the chip

1188
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:54,111
This is one of the

1189
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:55,391
In a feature

1190
00:47:58,975 --> 00:47:59,999
We open source

1191
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:04,351
In a public domain for a long time

1192
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:05,887
People have support

1193
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:06,911
For the whole 20 years

1194
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:08,703
I don't know

1195
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:10,751
But this is the best apple

1196
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:14,335
Open sourcing.

1197
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:17,663
So what are your big concerns

1198
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:18,431
About

1199
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:20,223
The whole market for the internet

1200
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:24,575
I feel like this could really screw us over as we're trying to

1201
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:25,599
Put chips in everything

1202
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:29,183
Everyone is concerned about

1203
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:30,207
Security

1204
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:31,999
That's one major thing

1205
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:34,047
And I think that happened

1206
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:34,815
What happened

1207
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:38,143
Some incident recently

1208
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:42,751
Security is a huge

1209
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:48,383
Departmentation

1210
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:51,711
But we don't know how

1211
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:57,599
Which

1212
00:48:58,111 --> 00:48:58,623
It may not

1213
00:48:58,879 --> 00:49:00,671
As long as things can talk

1214
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:01,695
To each other

1215
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:05,535
Yes or no the way we look at it

1216
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:06,815
We are trying to cheat

1217
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:08,351
Within the Wi-Fi

1218
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:11,935
Reseda

1219
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:14,751
Distance problems

1220
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:16,799
What we think about

1221
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:20,383
Basa fish

1222
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:26,527
Innisfree

1223
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:29,599
So if you want to do AI

1224
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:31,647
What is the most

1225
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:37,023
But it's such a power hog most people are trying to

1226
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:40,863
Avoid Wi-Fi companies that are avoiding Wi-Fi are putting

1227
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:42,399
Yeah Bluetooth in things like

1228
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:45,215
Oxygen sensors that require

1229
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:46,495
Batteries

1230
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:47,263
I can't be plugged

1231
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:50,847
Do you think wife I will get more power efficient

1232
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:53,151
Or better batteries for the

1233
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:56,479
We sing that wife I will get more power efficient

1234
00:49:56,735 --> 00:49:58,271
There is nothing in Wi-Fi

1235
00:49:58,527 --> 00:49:59,295
Stop

1236
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:00,319
From building

1237
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:02,879
Very efficient low-power chip

1238
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:04,671
How would we go about doing

1239
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:07,487
Expressive

1240
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:08,511
ESPN

1241
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:18,495
Another device by device

1242
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:20,799
So you don't

1243
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:28,479
You can power

1244
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:30,527
And a cheesy bread low power consumption

1245
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:32,063
How low is very low power

1246
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:35,647
Consumption what kind of let's do it in terms of like if I have a

1247
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:42,047
Wi-Fi sensor that's waking up to talk to something maybe once a day what would be the battery life on that I know that's a lot of

1248
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:43,839
There's a lot of variables there but

1249
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:45,375
We are talking about

1250
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:46,655
5 microamps

1251
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:48,959
ESPN

1252
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:52,287
Translate

1253
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:53,055
That would be

1254
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:55,359
I think 400 million

1255
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:05,087
No conversions

1256
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:09,439
Okay there is so much activity happening in China

1257
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:14,047
Can you just give me a sense of what is happening what is most exciting there

1258
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:15,583
Where China is just

1259
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:17,631
Surpassing everybody else

1260
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:18,655
In terms of what it is

1261
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:20,959
Well I have no idea because

1262
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:26,079
Frankly Speaking

1263
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:27,615
In what China is doing on

1264
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:29,663
Everyone

1265
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:31,455
Is doing 80 devices

1266
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:35,807
And they come from all around the world

1267
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:37,087
Received

1268
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:37,855
Everyone is

1269
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:41,439
Basically right now getting connectivity

1270
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:43,487
We don't see that

1271
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:44,255
Okay

1272
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:46,559
That sort of makes me feel better

1273
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:49,375
Thank you so much for coming on the show today

1274
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:50,399
Thank you

1275
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:53,983
That's it for this week thanks so much for listening

1276
00:51:54,239 --> 00:52:00,383
And remember if you'd like more iot news sign up for my newsletter at Stacey on iot

1277
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:01,663
Will see you next week
