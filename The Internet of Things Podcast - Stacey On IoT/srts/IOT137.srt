37
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:39,328
Okay Kevin

38
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,352
What started off with

39
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,632
Self-driving

40
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:49,312
It's so funny you said minivans because all the people talking about the new waymo self driving taxis are like hey if you want to be a sock

41
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,616
Your mom just jump in the waymo van cuz

42
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:53,664
Girl Vans I'm kind of surprised

43
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,968
Cuz you don't make sense for you no

44
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:56,736
Taxi

45
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,528
Because she can get more people

46
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,552
Look at you

47
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:05,440
Can get all kinds of stuff plus minivans have these awesome features for self-driving cars which is the doors opening

48
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:06,208
Close on their own

49
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,744
Right right right right

50
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,096
That's very true and in fact we're talk about the Phoenix area and waymo and their self-driving taxis

51
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:15,936
Of course and we talked about this before but they're actually kind of live now which is kind of

52
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:19,520
Crazy you can literally within a hundred square miles of Phoenix

53
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:22,848
Fast travel in a waymo self driving minivan

54
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,128
For now

55
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:26,944
There will or maybe a waymo person

56
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,480
There is a waymo person

57
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:30,016
In the van with you

58
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:34,624
However they may not sit in the driver's seat you may have nobody in that driver seat

59
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,648
Is what waymo is saying

60
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:41,280
So it's pretty cool I think and I think it's really smart that they're doing it where they're doing it

61
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,304
For a couple reasons

62
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,864
Why don't people realize that but just outside of Phoenix

63
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,216
In the area of Mesa there's a massive driving test track

64
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,776
That has been there for like 30-40 years

65
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:56,640
Now there's like they're building solar panels and stuff there but the track is still there for testing so

66
00:02:56,896 --> 00:03:02,272
A lot of companies use that it would not surprise me if waymo use that early on but now they're obviously in the city

67
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:04,576
And that environment that

68
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:10,976
Topography the weather it's all I perfect place and I tweeted out the store yesterday Stacy and somebody said

69
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,792
Well this isn't that challenging Phoenix is just a grid

70
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:18,400
It's flat as dry I'm like but that's what you want to start you don't want to start with the most

71
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,168
Challenging

72
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:22,496
Garments yeah yeah I mean

73
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:24,800
I think it's actually a very wise choice

74
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:28,128
For waymo to do this in the Phoenix area because it is very grid-like

75
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,920
Streets it is very flat

76
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:30,688
So

77
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,992
It gives them their foot in the door here so

78
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:38,112
This is I think this is level for driving as soon as not quite level 5 but

79
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,392
That's pretty darn close

80
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,928
It is it's one number away

81
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:47,328
I was going to say that it is smart that they still have a person in the car and suddenly I realized that

82
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:53,472
Holy cow if there isn't a person in the car eventually will have to develop systems for preventing vandalisation

83
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:54,752
Vandalism

84
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:55,776
Vandalism

85
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,592
So we'll have to

86
00:03:58,848 --> 00:03:59,360
Figure out a way

87
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,944
Play scarves are cameras everywhere

88
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,248
Yeah and I guess you'll have a credit card UK

89
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,368
They'll just lock the doors and pull over until the police come

90
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,000
And other Automotive

91
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,024
News

92
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,607
Has partnered with NASA

93
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:21,631
It's not autonomous

94
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:23,423
But it is a filet

95
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,215
This is just a fun little

96
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:25,983
Video willing

97
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,263
I don't have a

98
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:33,663
I have to say after I mean the video that people should watch this basically

99
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:37,503
It's almost like the fast pass line at Disney World literally would

100
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:41,855
Scan your phone for barcode with Uber you request an Uber air whatever

101
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:42,879
Can you go up

102
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:46,207
To the top of a building where maybe they have today helipad and stuff

103
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,231
Enter these

104
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:50,047
Small little things like glider planes

105
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,327
Is what they're envisioning

106
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,631
And they have propellers that would

107
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,679
Tilt horizontally and vertically so they

108
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:56,447
Takeoff

109
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,471
Vertically

110
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:00,031
And then drive or fly you wherever you need to go

111
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:03,871
And it's interesting they say they're theorizing that you could go from

112
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:10,271
The LAX to the Staples Center in 10 minutes in one of these things as opposed to an hour and a half

113
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,551
Driving your car

114
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,319
So

115
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:17,439
Huge Time Savings and all that there is actually a pilot in the Drone like

116
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,463
Vehicle

117
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,743
It got me thinking

118
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:23,327
It's only a matter of time once they get this off the ground no pun intended

119
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,887
That they do this autonomously as well

120
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:30,239
And that's going to be a bigger challenge than autonomous vehicles because now you have a whole nother

121
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,007
Dimension of

122
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,031
You know up and down and

123
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:32,799
What not so

124
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,335
I just think it's worth watching is my

125
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:36,383
Okay I will keep watch

126
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,919
I will keep watching the skies

127
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:38,943
All right

128
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,223
Outside of car news

129
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,783
We have some exciting news

130
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:43,807
God we're going to talk about

131
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,343
Home Security

132
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:46,879
So here goes

133
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,159
We've got a couple story

134
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,183
1

135
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,975
Ring and ADT

136
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:51,999
Fake news

137
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,279
End of last week

138
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:56,607
ATT was granted a temporary injunction

139
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:57,887
Against rain

140
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,471
So when can no longer sell its ring protect

141
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:02,495
Product

142
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:03,519
Because

143
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,591
And this goes all the way back to March when

144
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:08,127
Ring hired

145
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,663
Almost everybody from Zona

146
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,455
And

147
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,991
As part of that

148
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:17,087
Was like the security system yeah we have gone off but

149
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,879
Zone of had taken

150
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:19,647
Funding

151
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:25,023
Alone from ATT and also was working with ADT to develop a smart home

152
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,303
Security system

153
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:29,119
ATT so ATT was like

154
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:35,263
Turn off that you just kind of sort of took with you because all these people that work for a ring

155
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,287
That's ours

156
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:38,335
And the judge basically

157
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:41,407
Agreed with ADT and that's why this temporary injunction

158
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,199
What is

159
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:43,967
Scary face

160
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:50,367
Users or perhaps a great deal of people seem to be really excited about it ring basically said if you ordered one of our

161
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,647
Products

162
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:52,927
Ring protect

163
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,719
What's going to happen is

164
00:06:54,975 --> 00:07:01,119
Ring is going to offer you a $50 promo code that you can use towards any ring doorbell or outdoor camera as well

165
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,423
Well is an additional $100 off

166
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,471
Ring protect once it's re-release

167
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:13,407
Sell this injunction went in place before ring actually got any product out the door right

168
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:16,223
Yeah cuz I'm just thinking if I ordered one before and Ashley

169
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:16,991
Got it

170
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,039
Can I still supported do I have to send it

171
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,111
It's probably a very small number if any

172
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:25,695
I got out there but what terrible timing we're going to the museum

173
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:30,047
Shopping season of the year here in the US and I'm sure some people going to buy security systems

174
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:35,679
No they don't make great stocking stuffers I just received

175
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,983
Okay then how's your smile

176
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,567
This is true and the pricing

177
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:44,639
Get this was a $199 system if I recall correctly.

178
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:47,711
So that's also going to appeal to people who may not want to pay

179
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,991
For 500 more

180
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:50,527
Yeah

181
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:53,599
So this is big this is sad

182
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,647
Will cibor also

183
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,183
In the security space

184
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:00,511
This is a super hot area right now

185
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:04,351
We've got pricing came out for nest sonesse launched

186
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,375
Nest secure

187
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:08,703
The couple weeks ago and it is 499

188
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:09,727
4

189
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,519
I think it's two sensors The Hub

190
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,823
And to text activate the Hub

191
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,615
Arm and disarm the system

192
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:20,735
So they launched that and they also said that they would offer a monitored security

193
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:21,503
Package

194
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,783
And lo and behold

195
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:23,807
Now they do

196
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,087
And it's kind of pricey

197
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,391
Yeah and it's also

198
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,927
Separate from the

199
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:33,535
Nest aware subscription if you pay for that so if you already paying nestegg IM $10 a month

200
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:39,679
Nest aware for your nest cam that's totally separate going to keep paying. So they're working with Mony Mony or money

201
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:40,703
I don't know

202
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:41,983
Capital m o n

203
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,799
Yeah I know the second largest

204
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:50,431
Security monitoring company in the country last I checked so they're huge they also sell their own security systems

205
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:55,807
Similar to an ATT and so on and they have obviously monthly packages I'll give you the hardware for free and so on

206
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,087
Obviously with nest

207
00:08:57,343 --> 00:09:00,927
You're not getting the harbor for free but the monitoring is optional

208
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:01,951
And you can pay

209
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:07,071
2499 a month if you commit to a three year plan

210
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:09,631
Or you can pay 3499 a month

211
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:15,775
On a month-to-month basis with no plan and I just find that super super high because again you're paying for the hardware

212
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,311
Right so

213
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:19,103
You know maybe give the nest

214
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,639
Oway and do the

215
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,431
Obviously that's not what next wants

216
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,223
To do so if it's just

217
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:24,991
Nest has

218
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:26,015
Just hold me in the past

219
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,551
Sit there still very delicate

220
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,831
Heated to their DIY

221
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:31,135
And the DIY people may not want one

222
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:31,903
Monitored security

223
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,183
Sure

224
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,975
So I think that's kind of

225
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:37,279
Nest also now

226
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,303
This is a little

227
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:41,119
I don't know if Nest is being actively

228
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:44,447
Part of this but Nest now works with security systems

229
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,215
I'm a company car

230
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:45,983
Call notion

231
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:49,055
Innotion actually makes a really interesting system

232
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,335
It is

233
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:53,919
Set of sensors and then a bridge

234
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:55,199
And they're $0.05

235
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,735
Plus a bridge

236
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,527
That's $300

237
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:04,927
And the sensors are really interesting they're cute little circles that you just stick anywhere and they measure things like

238
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:05,951
Vibrations of the

239
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:06,719
Tell if your doors open

240
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:13,119
How close they measure temperature they can do Leak Detection they can do a lot of things and so now what they do is they all

241
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:17,215
Also can detect they work with the nest so if you're

242
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:19,007
Door is open in your air conditioning

243
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,871
I'm not sure if it'll let you arm and disarm

244
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:24,639
Based on

245
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,663
Presence detection

246
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,687
Turn The Nest Thermostat

247
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,455
Which would be Tycoon

248
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,503
But it's yet another Wrinkle in the

249
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,527
Security world

250
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:35,647
It's good to have the integration I mean that more Generations are always better in my opinion so that's good

251
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:40,255
I hadn't seen this before I'm looking at it now it almost looks like a plastic August lock

252
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,279
It's smaller

253
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:46,143
And their peel and stick

254
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:48,447
It is

255
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:56,127
Pretty much as they use a proprietary version of 802. 15. 4 which is zigbee

256
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,943
I know I thought

257
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:01,247
You almost lost me at bridge but now you're really lost

258
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,015
Proprietary

259
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:06,879
It makes sense you can't have a battery-powered sensor

260
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:08,159
That doesn't mean

261
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:08,927
You can't have a wife

262
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,743
That's just great

263
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,511
That's just

264
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:15,583
That's the

265
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,887
But we also have

266
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:18,655
Almond

267
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:25,311
The Almond router switch many people may not be aware of there by a company called securifi that actually all the way back

268
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,591
Back in like 2000

269
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:29,151
11 mm 12 was launching mesh router

270
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,175
Because every

271
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,199
The way routers work

272
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:33,503
It's terrible so they were like super early in the

273
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:35,295
They now

274
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,063
I have created

275
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,087
Security package

276
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:37,855
That

277
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:41,695
It has some sensors in it it works with the mesh routing system they

278
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,999
Long had a security offering

279
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:46,047
Are they have for the last year had a security offering

280
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,839
For ten bucks a month

281
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:49,119
He basically

282
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,935
Have a router that works with sensors

283
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,215
From this company and

284
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:55,775
So I'm like

285
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,567
That's yet another wrinkle

286
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,895
Yeah and I said I could see more of this

287
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,431
Jack built into routers

288
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:08,319
You know it's like so almond actually did the Almond routers when they launch they had like a

289
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:13,439
An LCD screen in the Next Generation had all these radios

290
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:15,743
They're pretty good and then now the

291
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,791
End the latest version

292
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:18,815
It's the almond

293
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,095
3s route

294
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,423
The third router plus that stands for security

295
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:26,751
It has a battery it has a SIM slot for cellular backup

296
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,287
And it has all these great

297
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:32,127
I lied to you it's

298
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,663
Professional emergency Mana

299
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:34,687
Is $20

300
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:38,271
And if you I guess do it

301
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,807
Through the Indiegogo the secured

302
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:44,927
There you go cool stuff from them I

303
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,463
Just like their products so

304
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:52,095
Always worth a look if you are like a security maybe I also need a mesh router

305
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:52,863
Why not

306
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:55,935
Now

307
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:57,215
Moving outside this

308
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,287
Let's go to Congress

309
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,335
Edit security-related Act

310
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,871
Because we're talking about

311
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,687
New legislation that was introduced in the Senate

312
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,455
And the house

313
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:10,783
Call the Cyber Shield Act of 2017

314
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:17,695
I haven't seen the actual legislation Norton space I don't think you have either so we have a write-up on it and I think it's a good

315
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:18,975
Step it

316
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:20,511
Does a lot of teeth

317
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,791
Two at a sickly

318
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:27,935
They're talking about setting up a voluntary program so that device makers can choose to have their products evaluated

319
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:32,031
And certified for meeting certain benchmarks on Cyber and data security

320
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:36,383
They got the right buzzwords in there but there's too many qualifiers such as a voluntary and Ken

321
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,151
Choose

322
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,431
And so on and so forth

323
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:42,015
It's going to take time to get these Benchmark settings put together

324
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:45,087
You're looking at a couple years before I think anything really

325
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,367
Happens here if it

326
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,647
At all quite honestly

327
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:49,951
Yes the legislation basically sets up

328
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:50,719
The committee

329
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,999
Hey Kennedy

330
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,839
Over a period of 2 years to set bench

331
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,375
Parks for cyber security

332
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:58,911
Yay long time

333
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:03,007
And then one size benchmarks are enacted

334
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:04,031
It's voluntary

335
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,847
Yeah so it feels like

336
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:10,431
Let's talk about iot security without actually doing anything

337
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:12,735
To dress what is really actually a quite

338
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:18,879
Two plus two to three years from now the landscape will be very different anyway so

339
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:19,647
Tentative

340
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:22,207
Figure this out the next three to six months in my opinion

341
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,999
Yeah, this isn't going to do anything

342
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,583
We should talk about

343
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:28,607
Decipher

344
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,679
Because this week there been a bunch of reports

345
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,703
About cyber secure

346
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:33,983
From a bunch of

347
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:38,079
So in the newsletter I will highlight a bunch of these

348
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:39,615
Because there are so many

349
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,663
But the big things to take away

350
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,967
I think are pretty simple

351
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:45,759
The first thing to understand is

352
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:49,343
What's happening is there active groups targeted

353
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,111
Industrial

354
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:55,999
Systems so these are your skater these modbus all these old school industrial system

355
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,279
Running power plants

356
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,071
Yes nuclear plants

357
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,095
Dams

358
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,119
Manufacturing

359
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:05,983
All of this so these are all being targeted which is not actually news but

360
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,263
What is worth noting

361
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,567
Is that most companies right now

362
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:12,895
Are still under the belief that things like air gapping their Network

363
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,175
Works

364
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,247
Not only is air gapping not enough

365
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,783
The Based on data coming

366
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,063
Cyber X

367
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:23,135
There's a lot of unpatchable stuff

368
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,159
They're so

369
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:28,511
According to the survey more than three out of four sites have obsolete Windows system

370
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,815
Yeah this is actually a big

371
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:32,095
Ideal hospitals have

372
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:32,863
Gotten

373
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,399
Ding by this when they're

374
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:37,471
An upgradable machines like MRI machines

375
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:38,495
Windows operating

376
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:43,359
Systems which is best five things like XP in 2000 things that are not really supported anymore

377
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:46,175
They also have

378
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,199
Crappy passwords

379
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:48,479
It's nearly three out of five sides

380
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:52,575
Have plain text passwords traversing their control Network

381
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:54,111
No no no u

382
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:59,231
I know you think those networks aren't online but people can get to them and they can be sniff

383
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:00,255
And

384
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,023
Half half

385
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,815
At least one unknown

386
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:05,631
Or Rogue device and 20% have wireless access

387
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,655
Points that

388
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,423
Are unknown

389
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,471
And you don't want your wireless access point

390
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:10,751
Because anything that

391
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:12,287
Connects to them will be vulnerable

392
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:17,663
So say I think anybody's implementing the system just needs to binge watch mr. robot and

393
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,967
I think they'll get a kick in the pants right there

394
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:22,271
There we go so really you guys if

395
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,551
You have

396
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:25,343
Automated systems

397
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:26,367
You have

398
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,903
Monitoring systems

399
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,951
You feel like they're secure

400
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:31,231
You should probably

401
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:31,999
Double check

402
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:32,767
Statuses

403
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:34,815
Target got hacked

404
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,095
This way it was

405
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:38,399
Let us

406
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:40,191
So that's all the bad news

407
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,215
About 4

408
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,495
Z saber

409
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,263
Front

410
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,799
Let us move to

411
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,591
A giant M&M

412
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,663
As an Old Ship reporter I was

413
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,687
Really

414
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,967
Excited is not the word

415
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:53,247
Kind of ostrich

416
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,551
At the idea that broadcom

417
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:56,319
Offered

418
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,087
This week

419
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:58,623
Hey

420
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,159
100 in

421
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:00,927
Pie five

422
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,463
Billion dollars

423
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,999
Billion with a B

424
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,279
To acquire

425
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,839
Qualcomm this is an unsolicited takeover

426
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,119
Offering

427
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,399
70 bucks per share

428
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:11,679
And

429
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:12,959
This isn't the middle of

430
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:13,727
Broadcast

431
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,263
Trying to buy Brocade

432
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,799
After it said it would move it

433
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,335
Back to the US

434
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,615
And in the middle of

435
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,383
Qualcomm

436
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,431
Trying to finish its massive deal

437
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:23,455
Nxp

438
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:26,015
Yeah this is huge

439
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,295
Broadcom is a

440
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:30,111
Big player just in a different way than

441
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:33,439
Qualcomm broadcom Zamora verb Bluetooth Wi-Fi

442
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:35,231
Very low-power type chip

443
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,511
So here's

444
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,535
We all think of broad

445
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,839
Tom is one company but really it's not that

446
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:42,911
So broadcom that Kevin's talking

447
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,959
Is a Bluetooth

448
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:47,263
Powerhouse components and all sorts of

449
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,543
The phone spot

450
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,335
Couple years ago it was acquired by a

451
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:53,151
Which was created by a private-equity

452
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,711
The pot hp's Agilent

453
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:57,503
So this is like super embedded

454
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,551
Detailed stuff and then they bought a bunch of network

455
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:02,111
Alyssa

456
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,135
Plx

457
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,415
Please crazy ethernet

458
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,183
Storage Network

459
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,207
Working all kinds of stuff

460
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:08,255
So what we call broadcom

461
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:09,023
Today

462
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,559
Is actually a mishmash of a

463
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:12,607
Bunch of really deep cut

464
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:13,631
Conant level

465
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:14,399
In networking

466
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,703
Right foot

467
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,983
When we say networking level

468
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:22,335
What I think broadcom gets out of this but it doesn't have today and you can tell me if I'm wrong

469
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:25,407
Qualcomm modem business is huge

470
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:27,711
And not just for phones

471
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:29,503
I'm also thinking ahead to like

472
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:31,039
Capital M and

473
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,831
NB iot and such so

474
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,367
Art person

475
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,135
Respective

476
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:37,439
I think this would be a huge win for blood

477
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:41,279
Yes it would it would get its communication stuff so the bass Man in the Moon

478
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:42,559
Right

479
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:44,351
Also gets the Qualcomm

480
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:45,887
Application processor

481
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,423
Rich

482
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:49,727
Broadcom when it was

483
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,263
Actually Brad, Nut Bra

484
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,823
Avago actually was talking about doing

485
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:58,687
Arm-based servers and some really interesting and they had application processors to we should

486
00:18:59,199 --> 00:18:59,711
Desperate

487
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:02,783
This is a deal that would basically

488
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,063
The new broadcom

489
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,343
Qualcomm

490
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,623
In every single phone

491
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,927
In the world

492
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:09,951
Iot devices

493
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,743
So it's

494
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:12,511
Pumpkinhead

495
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,535
Huge deal

496
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:17,887
The broad, Clayton she said there may not be known for their application processors

497
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:21,471
But they have them for sure I mean the Raspberry Pi 3

498
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,239
Runs on a beach

499
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,007
Township so

500
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:28,383
But you know it's not a new space for them but it would greatly expand the capabilities and reach of that

501
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:30,687
Yeah I mean Qualcomm is

502
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:33,247
Their application processors are the creme Dela

503
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:36,063
Yes Man unless we're talking about Apple's application process

504
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,391
That is

505
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:40,415
That deal

506
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,695
I wrote a bit about it

507
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:42,719
Include a link

508
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:44,511
Put out a newsletter alert

509
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,535
Because I thought it was such a

510
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:47,583
And

511
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,375
So we'll see what happens

512
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:50,655
We'll have some ship drama

513
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,215
And now

514
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:54,495
Let's move to

515
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,775
Holiday iot

516
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,311
Because

517
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,079
Why not

518
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:59,103
Amazon has been

519
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:01,663
Partying hard it did a great deal for

520
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,735
Lutron devices I think was 120 bucks got you

521
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,527
Hub the Lutron hub

522
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,831
Two of the switches

523
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:09,599
And

524
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:10,623
To the little Pico room

525
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:13,183
Switch that basically threw in the hub for

526
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,023
$80 value so that was actually a smoking hot deal

527
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:19,327
I believe the SmartThings Hub is now 50

528
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,375
2% off for Black Friday

529
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,703
Beyond are going to be doing deals on the Amazon Echo all the answers

530
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:25,983
Hardware and

531
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,263
Released

532
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,287
Is there a news

533
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,335
Which has a nest cam

534
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:32,383
Call for a hundred

535
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:34,687
30 bucks that's one of the doorbusters

536
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:36,991
They also are going to do an echo.

537
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:39,295
30 bucks the new version

538
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,087
A little shorter

539
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:41,855
$80

540
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,903
Brighten up the place with the Hub

541
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:46,975
And then fo-sho for a hunt

542
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,535
By the way the Echo Show release

543
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,119
Really sad

544
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:59,775
My daughter told me no because she likes looking at she plays music on it she like seeing who

545
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:00,543
Did the song in the

546
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,079
And personally like

547
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,615
It's not worth that much money

548
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:06,943
What's 220 bucks that keep your kid happy

549
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:12,319

IJustine

559
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:36,384
In case you're like who I want to buy one of these things

560
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:37,920
Now you can

561
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,224
Okay

562
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,016
Let's move this show right along

563
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:46,112
It might be a good time to update your Logitech Harmony remote to

564
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:49,440
Well so this is not the harmony this is the Logitech Harmony

565
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,208
Link

566
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,768
Vegas

567
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:57,120
I don't know if you want to update to Harmony maybe should get like a Chromecast and

568
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:59,168
Google Home Fire TV

569
00:21:59,424 --> 00:21:59,936
Anime

570
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:01,472
Logitech is

571
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:02,240
Ricky

572
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:03,520
D

573
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:04,288
Logitech

574
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:07,360
Harmony link which is a device that you can buy

575
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:10,432
About seven years ago and it

576
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:13,504
Was it basically converted your IR signals

577
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,272
To WiFi

578
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:19,648
So this is not the harmony home hub that was introduced a little bit later and connect to madame

579
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,976
But plenty of people did buy this device in Logitech base

580
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:24,000
Basically said you know what

581
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,536
Guys in a couple months

582
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:27,584
We're going to send a software update and it's gone

583
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:29,632
Poopy heads

584
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:37,056
I don't know what else to say I mean it I said the Stacy before the show or talk about this these guys are not doing themselves any favors in order they do

585
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,592
In the industry any favors here

586
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:42,688
How to get back to that question I keep asking are you buying Hardware are you buying services

587
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,272
In this case you can keep your hard work it just going to be used

588
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,552
Servu

589
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:52,416
I won't do anything and I sort of don't understand why they're doing it with this particular product because

590
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:56,000
It's nothing more unless I'm missing something

591
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:59,072
Then it rich to convert wifi-to-ir

592
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:01,120
I'm assuming they don't want to keep

593
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,144
Hoarding

594
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,680
The software

595
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:07,008
Logitech sent email to the link

596
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:09,824
On March 16th 2018

597
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,176
Logitech will discontinue service and support for the link it will no longer function after this date

598
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:18,272
They are offering customers a 35% discount on a New Harmony

599
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:23,392
And it's basically the same sort of thing IR Wi-Fi but you also get connected

600
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:25,184
So my hunch is they just one

601
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,208
Consolidate

602
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:27,744
No

603
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,536
But not everybody wants

604
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:30,304
Apple Smart Home

605
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:35,168
Some people just want to be able to control their TV

606
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:38,752
Product know and let's face it

607
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:43,616
Keeping software up to date on a device that handles IR codes and Wi-Fi it's not like

608
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:48,480
Guess you could say we're kind of going away maybe it is but

609
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:51,808
But then you go I mean that just

610
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:52,832
I don't like this at all

611
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:55,392
In this ties back so a couple of months ago I wrote

612
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:57,184
But I really do think

613
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:59,232
We should be talking about smart

614
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,512
Devices in the car

615
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:02,304
Expiration dates

616
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,864
So this would be avoided

617
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,632
If

618
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:06,656
Wenzhou

619
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:11,264
Released a product said hey you know what this product we're going to support it guarantee

620
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:13,568
After that

621
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:16,128
That at least gives customers the Opera

622
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:18,176
Opportunity to say no

623
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:20,992
It's some will some won't and I think

624
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:22,528
As we move from

625
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:26,880
Straight up Hardware to Hardware that's supported by software we're going to have to

626
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:31,488
And at first I was like no I don't agree with you but then as I think about it

627
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:34,304
Especially as it relates to a totally different industry that we're all

628
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,096
Involved in smartphones

629
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:36,864
You

630
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,144
So did you have that

631
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:39,168
You have

632
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:43,776
Companies Google for example we promised software Android software updates for

633
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:45,824
2 years on the new pixels

634
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:46,592
And

635
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:47,360
Security updates

636
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,128
3 years

637
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:50,944
Do you know what the shelf life of that is going to be

638
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,480
So I guess I do get it

639
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:55,040
Not saying I like it but I get it

640
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:57,600
The shift in ownership

641
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:58,880
I've never really are

642
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:00,928
Your in software does

643
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:04,000
Requires constant development in upgrades for security

644
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,048
Requires

645
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,584
Someone to support it

646
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:10,400
All of those things cost money and

647
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:13,472
It's possible that you won't want to have that happen

648
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:14,496
For the rest of the

649
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,544
The rest of the physical life

650
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,080
Right

651
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:20,896
So I think we're going to get into this I think

652
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:22,176
The industry should be

653
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:23,968
Really rushing

654
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:26,784
So guys in the industry

655
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,064
Think about this

656
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,136
Really think about this and start discussing it and buy

657
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:31,904
Gosh

658
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,184
Start Ashley in

659
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:35,232
Because in the industry

660
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:37,536
It's already in Enterprise iot

661
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,096
You get a device with

662
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:40,864
Asset

663
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:42,400
Expiration date asset support

664
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:44,704
We need that is

665
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:46,496
It's going to suck

666
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,616
Real quick that one alternative I can think of I'm not saying it's a good idea is to start making this

667
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:52,384
Ace Hardware

668
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:58,272
Modular and or agreeable that look at this little hug device you know maybe I should be able to pop it open

669
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:00,832
Grab the board out of it pop new insert a new board that

670
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:03,904
Bring me new wireless Technologies and new capabilities and so on

671
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,184
And that way you

672
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,232
Kind of res to replacing it but

673
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,000
It's more of a

674
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:10,048
Update to the device already have

675
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:12,608
I think that would work on some devices

676
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,632
Unsung

677
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:19,264
Answers to Penny I mean most consumers are not going to be like

678
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:24,896
No you have to make a consumer-friendly. There's a plug-in type module again

679
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,712
Yeah but I'm not trying to

680
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:28,480
Who your idea

681
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:33,344
Let's see we have we have a party

682
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,904
Kevin and nobody was invited

683
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:40,256
Yeah that's just a funny story actually leads into our listener voicemail because

684
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,280
Car related

685
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:43,840
An Amazon Echo in Germany that started a rave

686
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:47,680
And nobody was home so the police had to actually break the door down

687
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:49,984
Because of all the noise complaints from Neighbors

688
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,288
Nobody knows how long this person's

689
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:56,128
Echo started the crazy music party but it did on the six

690
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:58,176
Open window

691
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:59,456
Does not like somebody could have

692
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,736
Told madamaiyada

693
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:01,760
Crank up the

694
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:03,552
You know Electronics

695
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:05,344
Pump up the jams yeah

696
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,904
That's what I don't understand how this happened but it did

697
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,672
I just think it's funny

698
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:09,696
That is fun

699
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:11,744
And that brings us to our

700
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,280
Question of the week

701
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:15,840
For the iot podcast listener hotline

702
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:17,632
Which is brought to you by Schlage

703
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:18,656
Maker of Alexa

704
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:19,424
China clocks

705
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:20,960
Schlage electronic lock

706
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:22,752
Offer unparalleled

707
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:24,800
We all on there

708
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,336
Right out of the box

709
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:28,128
So you don't have to have a smart

710
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,688
To see what's possible

711
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:31,712
Schlage

712
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,040
Jacobina Stacy

713
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:36,320
Atlanta

714
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:40,928
I'm loving the show I did have a question actually this

715
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:44,000
What company was last week show when you guys

716
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:45,024
Talked about

717
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:47,328
Google home

718
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:51,168
Does a night mode feature I haven't tried it out yet but I'm definitely

719
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:54,496
Get out but what I've been thinking is

720
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:56,800
Usually and I know this is especially

721
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:58,336
True with the

722
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:01,152
When I would whisper to the echo

723
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:02,944
It would usually responds

724
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,504
Obviously Amazon has a profile

725
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,528
Whispers

726
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,320
Does he know when you whisper

727
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:09,856
Obviously does not sound

728
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:12,160
Like a regular and irregular speech

729
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:14,976
So I'm just wondering why

730
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:17,280
They are not able to identify that

731
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,560
Body is Whispering

732
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:19,584
And then

733
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,400
Taylor response as it pertains to the volume

734
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:23,168
Accordingly

735
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:24,192
So it fits

736
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:26,240
In the morning and I said

737
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:31,360
Why can't Amazon recognizing I'm whispering

738
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:32,128
And then

739
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:32,896
Just automatic

740
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,432
Anyway

741
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:36,480
I don't know if they are complications that I'm

742
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:39,040
Not aware of what I would love to hear your take on it

743
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:39,808
Thank you guys

744
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:41,600
Odoo weight

745
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:43,136
What is a brilliant idea

746
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:46,464
Although I will say that when I whisper to my Madam and she never respond

747
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,000
But she does respond to my

748
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:54,912
So I love the idea I think it may be a bit of a technical challenge because you have to figure out

749
00:28:55,680 --> 00:29:00,544
Somebody if the voice levels are low because somebody just further away or they're actually whispering

750
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:04,128
Right because if you're further away the noise level to whisper like

751
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:05,152
Sound level so

752
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:08,480
It could be tricky but I love the idea I hope that they could

753
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:11,296
Try I mean let's try it beta test it let's do it

754
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:14,624
Yeah well it it's a very human thing to do because like if

755
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,928
If I suddenly whisper to you

756
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:21,024
And I will respond at the same level

757
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:22,048
Exactly

758
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:23,840
So it's kind of like

759
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:24,864
My electronic device

760
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,400
Is my AI is now

761
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:27,680
More like me

762
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:28,704
So

763
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:29,728
Charlie

764
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:30,496
Amazon

765
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:31,776
Get on it

766
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:32,800
What did happen

767
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:34,080
Just let us know why

768
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,640
There might be

769
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:38,688
If you

770
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,736
Want to leave a message for the internet

771
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:41,760
Kings podcast

772
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:44,576
You should call us at 5 1/2

773
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:46,624
62374

774
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,392
R24

775
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:48,416
And we

776
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,184
Mets

777
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:50,208
Answer your question

778
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:53,536
Yeah that Raspberry Pi server is always running

779
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,328
Now we are going to

780
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,864
Take a small break for us

781
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:58,144
Message from our sponsor

782
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,704
And when we get back we're going to talk about

783
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:04,288
Thread because there is actually some big news this week

784
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:07,104
And it doesn't sound good for the thread standard

785
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:09,920
So I could Grant Erickson coming on the show 2

786
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:11,456
Talk about what's happening

787
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,224
And

788
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,248
And what is it

789
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,528
What isn't happening

790
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:17,856
So stay tuned for all of that

791
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:24,256
Haverwood we are taking a break from the podcast for a message from this week sponsor this week

792
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,536
Sponsor is Spark

793
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:27,840
Cognition and I've got Guzman

794
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:28,608
Shuja

795
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:32,448
Who is general manager of the industrial internet-of-things effort

796
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:33,472
To talk about

797
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:34,752
Sparkcognition

798
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:40,128
Respond spark ignition is an AI company and you guys are really working to help

799
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:42,176
Industrial iot companies

800
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:43,712
Improve their efficiency

801
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:45,504
And improve their safety

802
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:47,296
That is correct we are drinking

803
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:51,904
Together a lot of different capabilities with an artificial intelligence and data analytics

804
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:52,928
B1

805
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:53,952
Caviar dressing

806
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:57,792
Use cases such as predicting failures or catastrophic events

807
00:30:58,048 --> 00:31:00,096
And also automating a lot of the process

808
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:01,632
She's been in the industrial world

809
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:06,240
Looking at security data Within These industrial environments to make sure that no

810
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:07,520
Activities happening

811
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,568
Show data analytics is a big

812
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:10,336
Peace effect

813
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,872
But we are bringing different people

814
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:15,456
Pictures of artificial intelligence to make that analysis and make that

815
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:16,224
Application

816
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:16,992
More robust

817
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:22,880
Do you have an example of maybe one of your clients and how they used AI to change their business

818
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:24,928
Absolutely closer

819
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,208
Which is the largest pump

820
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:27,232
Manufacturer

821
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:28,768
And the US is one of our client

822
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:29,792
Take a break

823
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:31,072
The failure in a bump

824
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:32,352
A few hours in advance

825
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:33,888
They applied are algorithms

826
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:34,912
And now they can

827
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:35,680
Extent

828
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:40,288
Forewarning of a pump failure by 6 days that is fundamentally changed their business

829
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:44,640
This Mortal they can sell prediction of the service which is really supercharged

830
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:45,408
Aftermarket

831
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:50,784
What are some of the critical steps to ensuring a successful

832
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,552
Plantation

833
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:54,368
To the key to successful implementation

834
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,904
Could be the pink bag

835
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:56,928
Strategically

836
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:57,696
An act

837
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:58,464
Tactical

838
00:31:58,976 --> 00:31:59,488
What that means

839
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:01,280
Addressing the big picture problems

840
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,304
Concerning the Border

841
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,072
The c-suite

842
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:04,096
And the dressing

843
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:04,864
The business

844
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:05,632
Outcomes

845
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:09,984
Building a good Roi story at the end of the day that technology

846
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,008
It should be tight

847
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:12,032
Clothes liquid

848
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:14,592
The the second thing that very important

849
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:16,384
Is the people Astor Cafe

850
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,920
Because it's new technology

851
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:18,944
And fix

852
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,736
Controller technology or Lord

853
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:22,272
The client's feet got to

854
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:23,808
Engage the people and get

855
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:27,136
Goodbye and so they don't feel nervous about it and their stock price

856
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:28,416
Technology

857
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:30,976
I can deliver the business outcomes that are looking for

858
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:31,744
Okay

859
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,304
And what are some of the risks of limitations

860
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:36,096
The biggest restaurant

861
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:41,216
Seen as people jumping to conclusions about what the technology can do

862
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:43,008
The dog building the right foundation

863
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,544
Safari examples

864
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,360
The organizational structure could be something.

865
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:49,920
It's not supportive of an AI implementation

866
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:56,576
It could be the lack of data or available data within the ideal environment to be able to support some of the artificial intelligence

867
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:58,880
Algorithm so between the organization

868
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:00,160
Structure in people

869
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:01,440
And the

870
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:02,208
Technical

871
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:04,768
Infrastructure needed to deliver a i Solutions

872
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,816
Dota 2 big things that I've seen

873
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:07,840
Penn State majorettes

874
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:10,912
And where can we find out more

875
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:12,448
To find out more

878
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:28,320
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest

879
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:30,368
Is Grant Erickson Who is the

880
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:32,160
President of the thread group

881
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:33,440
Hey Grant how are you doing

882
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:36,000
Good morning sissy thank you so much for having me on this morning

883
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:38,048
I am super excited

884
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:38,816
Because

885
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:42,400
How to say you got news today and you guys are watching something

886
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:45,728
But I want to hear you explain in your own words cuz I'm a little worried about the

887
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:46,496
So

888
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:47,520
Let's talk

889
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,312
Thread

890
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:53,408
First offer people who are unfamiliar thread is a wireless protocol

891
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,992
It's like zigbee Z-Wave Bluetooth all those Wi-Fi even

892
00:33:57,248 --> 00:34:02,880
Except it's a little different because it is a mesh base protocol it is also low power

893
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:03,904
And it's

894
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,208
IPv6 compliant which means

895
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:09,280
A device can talk directly to the internet as opposed to going

896
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,048
Rahab

897
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:12,608
So now that we know all of this about

898
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:13,888
Fred letzter

899
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:16,704
Talk about your news first.

900
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,728
Good news

901
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:19,264
Thread is used in more places

902
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,288
Let's talk about that

903
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:21,056
Aptoide

904
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:27,456
So we have an exciting pipeline of products coming into the marketplace today we have just shy of a dozen

905
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:28,224
Components

906
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,296
Facts of people in use build exciting iot products

907
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:32,064
Today

908
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:38,464
And because of this actually spending the number of places that you can go certify thread products and solutions

909
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:40,768
Spanish

910
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:43,072
Including a locations in Southeast Asia

911
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:44,864
And your looks to be closer

912
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,704
Mazar

913
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:50,240
So we have

914
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:51,520
Two categories of

915
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:53,056
The people who really want to

916
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:54,848
Tell the world

917
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:59,968
We have something to talk about for quite some time which is our thread certified products

918
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:04,576
One of our first and most prominent companies in that category 0 who announced their stuff

919
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:05,856
Next generation Wireless products

920
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:08,672
Stutter hopefully soon-to-be thread certified

921
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:10,976
We have a second category of products

922
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:17,120
What is a member-driven organization and we have people who are really excited about touting their uses red in pots

923
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:20,192
Even though that maybe not all the way quite there

924
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:23,264
Program called shred ready

925
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,080
To support the interests of members who really won at out

926
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:28,896
They are using thread but they're not all the way to

927
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:33,504
Completely open trade system

928
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:36,064
That's one of the first example of that it messed

929
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,600
With a recently released

930
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:38,368
Nest

931
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:39,648
Acure product line

932
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:42,464
How's it's been running designation for their nest

933
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,512
And for their nest guard.

934
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:45,792
Okay so

935
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:49,120
What we're seeing here is threat certified which means

936
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:50,144
Ian Fleming

937
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,424
All parts of the

938
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,448
Thread protocol

939
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:53,472
Exactly

940
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:57,312
There is a second category which is

941
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:58,080
Thread ready

942
00:35:58,336 --> 00:36:00,384
Which is implementing some parts

943
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:03,200
Exactly

944
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:03,968
Okay

945
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:06,528
So let's dig into this cuz this feels like

946
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:08,064
China

947
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:09,344
One day

948
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:11,904
So let's start with ness

949
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:14,208
So they are thread ready

950
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:15,232
What makes them

951
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:16,000
Thread ready

952
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:16,768
As opposed to

953
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:17,536
Thread certified

954
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:20,096
Stacy

955
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:25,472
Average of being a sponsor of the friend group is super excited about friend technology

956
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:30,848
And we're Liam wants to get to the end game of the vision we've all been talking about the last time we're

957
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:35,968
Couple things to do to the nature of its products and getting to Market

958
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:36,992
In which

959
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:41,088
Induction of leave application layer they want to do

960
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:42,880
Stout but they're using thread

961
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:44,928
Real Marketplace problems

962
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,024
Become a signal to the market that they're going to get there in terms of kind of this full open

963
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:52,608
Designation is really a way of saying

964
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:56,448
Network perspective everything we do is completely compliant

965
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:57,728
And meats.

966
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:59,264
Application

967
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,032
Commissioning

968
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:00,800
OtterBox

969
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:03,872
Experian score for the time being doing things a little differently

970
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:05,408
And offering them or close to

971
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:11,808
And so the ideas apps it's sort of a signal to the market Marketplace problems today

972
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:13,856
And it's a signal for company to say

973
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:14,880
Will get there

974
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:16,672
And because celebrity of time-bound

975
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:22,304
Here's the time in which we will like to move our products along to kind of the full red certified

976
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,608
Okay let's talk about the timeout

977
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:25,376
What aspect of it

978
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:27,936
And how you would go about becoming

979
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:30,496
Shred ready so how does a company

980
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:33,312
Goes to the process to say add-on to be certified

981
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:34,080
I want to be ready

982
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:35,616
And how long do they have

983
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:36,640
How to get from ready

984
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:37,408
To certify

985
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,248
The first stop is approaching the choice

986
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:47,648
Any one of these six that we're just identified that are open available today and in conjunction with talking to the test house

987
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:54,560
Tom Shirley application saying here is the bread ready

988
00:37:57,376 --> 00:38:02,240
And the certification director of the certification committee and the board of directors or visa application

989
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:03,776
And figure out whether or not it

990
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:09,664
The spirit of thread ready which is a company that is really on its way to being fully thread to formal complaint

991
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,224
And whether or not the exception again

992
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:18,624
Minor thing or major thing

993
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:21,440
And in addition Delgado

994
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:25,280
Indication of how long they have to get their implementation

995
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:28,608
Okay so it's a case-by-case

996
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:29,376
Exactly

997
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:30,400
And the time window is

998
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:32,448
Anywhere from 12 to 18

999
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:38,080
Okay so within 12 to 18 months then we should expect Nest to be fully thread compliant

1000
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:40,128
Okay

1001
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,152
And

1002
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:44,224
What are some of the things that are okay

1003
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,784
To be so you could be thread ready but not

1004
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,064
Trade certified

1005
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,368
Commissioning apparently is not crucial enough

1006
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:51,136
That you would be

1007
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:53,440
Will let you be thread ready

1008
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:55,232
What else could I change to be

1009
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:56,000
Thread ready

1010
00:38:56,256 --> 00:39:00,864
I think mission is really the one that we've really thought long and hard about says that

1011
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,912
Probably be the acceptable extent

1012
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:05,984
Unique advance in changing some cool things about how they act

1013
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:07,008
Publix

1014
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:13,664
All of our years of experience with other alliances and other technologies that making changes and compromises there would be less than desirable

1015
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:19,040
And such really more around probably those things that affect the out-of-box experience that might be very

1016
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:20,064
Specific or unique

1017
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,856
Tamar of a closed ecosystem

1018
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:24,928
Alexander nevsky The Nest secure product is today

1019
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,232
So if I wanted to change

1020
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:29,280
I don't know the device management aspect

1021
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:31,328
Probably not going to Grant an exception

1022
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,144
Okay so from the perspective of a consumer

1023
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:38,240
If I going to see something are there going to be two labels like thread certified and

1024
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:39,008
Thread ready

1025
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:43,872
Tell me a really really with this program wanted to limit that kind of confusion in the marketplace

1026
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:46,176
Suspend ready participant

1027
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:51,296
Can't use any low going they may indicate it's ready and Prince but they certainly may not use

1028
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:55,904
But don't unfriend or thread certified did again

1029
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:56,928
For the artist

1030
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:06,144
Market excited about it and we're on our way to being fully Spencer Define interoperable

1031
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,680
It's really there

1032
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:09,728
Brand that is really the key Brannock

1033
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,032
Perspective

1034
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:14,848
If we look

1035
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:18,688
Products that are in their ecosystem like the

1036
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:19,968
They'll be Burlington

1037
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:22,272
Looking for the logo

1038
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:24,576
Estrada courts

1039
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:27,904
Opportunity guarantee I'm looking for

1040
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,184
And not necessarily Focus

1041
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,720
Omni broad open

1042
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:35,840
Okay so in 18 months

1043
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:40,192
It'll have works with nest and also presumably thread certified

1044
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:41,216
4

1045
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:43,264
These devices that

1046
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:45,312
Work with what actually Nest devices

1047
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:46,336
Now

1048
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:49,664
Or something like that Yale lock which presumably will also be

1049
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,432
Become thread

1050
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:51,712
Ready at some point in time

1051
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,296
They also have the choice to step up

1052
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:57,344
To this certification level

1053
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:58,880
Exactly

1054
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:01,696
All right this to me feels a little bit

1055
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:02,464
Like

1056
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,792
Zippy which Bratz I really was stuck

1057
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,072
Cuz

1058
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:09,632
Zippy was like oh we're standard but they had different

1059
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:10,400
Location lyrics

1060
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:11,680
And so you could

1061
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:13,984
Buy a zigbee certified product

1062
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:17,056
Really guarantee that it would work with another

1063
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:18,080
Certified

1064
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:20,384
So how is this

1065
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,152
Different

1066
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:23,200
Differentiators

1067
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:27,808
Programming in front of learning from history you have an IP layer

1068
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:30,624
Cancel that I can really carry and transport

1069
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,416
Multiple application layer

1070
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:39,072
In fact if you think back to the demonstration that you saw at CES 2017 and that wall that we had

1071
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:41,888
We actually have enough products

1072
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:44,448
What program is running a personal strength

1073
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:45,984
We're talking about here with friend ready

1074
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,568
I knows we're on the very same networks as...

1075
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:52,128
As well as the oci products that were on that wall

1076
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,687
It's a really even though the method of getting those

1077
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:55,455
Devices

1078
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:59,295
The thread network was being shared difference between

1079
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:06,975
At the end of the day once they were all on the network all three of those application-layer simultaneously work together harmoniously

1080
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:10,815
And that's really the beauty of Ip and thread and ability is

1081
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:17,215
Perspective

1082
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:19,775
It's really great because you can have a comic

1083
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:22,079
Today I want to be..

1084
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:23,615
Tomorrow Mayra

1085
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:24,895
The device has the resources

1086
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:28,479
I want to upgrade with the software update

1087
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:31,295
Justin Bieber I want to update

1088
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:42,303
Okay and so let's talk about thread within the context of other Wireless Pro to

1089
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:43,071
Call speakers

1090
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:45,887
My gosh is getting hot and heavy in the wireless

1091
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:49,215
So Bluetooth just

1092
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:50,751
Bluetooth just

1093
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:52,287
Came out with mesh

1094
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:55,103
For a while

1095
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:56,895
Capable

1096
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:58,943
Not everybody implemented on the chip

1097
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:02,527
So there is that but it is capable of doing it

1098
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:03,295
Same thing

1099
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:04,319
And

1100
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:05,343
They also

1101
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:06,367
Arlo power

1102
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:07,391
Kelley Blue

1103
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:08,159
Bluetooth low energy

1104
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:09,951
So to me that feels like

1105
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:10,719
The biggest

1106
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:11,487
Predator

1107
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:13,023
The red

1108
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:14,303
How do you guys

1109
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:15,327
View kind of

1110
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:16,351
Protocol

1111
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:17,375
Battles

1112
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:19,423
Actual question Stacy and I think

1113
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:23,519
Lykke Li I think we're kind of to some extent in our mind

1114
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:25,823
Past the particle battles I think there's a link

1115
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:28,895
For every application there's a network for every application

1116
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:32,479
And generally speaking it's red we kind of see if spread is

1117
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:35,295
Aswan + Wi-Fi

1118
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:40,927
DSL DOCSIS for your kind of coupling to the internet connectivity

1119
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:42,463
I need with Bluetooth

1120
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:45,279
If you can play the Pick 4 do you look at Bluetooth

1121
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:49,375
Remember partners that actually have ratted out of box

1122
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:50,655
Solutions

1123
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:52,447
But use Bluetooth today for that kind

1124
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:53,471
Repairing another box

1125
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:56,799
I think MacArthur perspective but we really love to see

1126
00:43:57,055 --> 00:44:00,383
Is working together with members of the Bluetooth community

1127
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:02,431
To really start to standardize

1128
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:04,223
How thread and be illegal together

1129
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:06,271
If you look at our silicon partners

1130
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:10,367
Define. Almost all of modern chips and components that are being offered

1131
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:11,391
Actually

1132
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:12,415
Dual stack

1133
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:13,439
Joel thread

1134
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:14,463
Ble radios

1135
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:19,327
Use cases in terms of how you could have point

1136
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:20,351
Interactions

1137
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:23,679
The periphery of the thread

1138
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:28,543
Really using thread is kind of that backbone steady-state Network

1139
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:29,567
Actually

1140
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:35,455
Business

1141
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:36,991
Alice fredenham

1142
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:37,759
Again

1143
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:41,087
Again I think that really is a complementary view of

1144
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:43,903
House red and Bluetooth can work together in the future

1145
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:47,487
Billy Mac's Asbury Nathan

1146
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:49,279
Billy IP is very nice and

1147
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:54,399
Solution of cheer in the market today available today and open rule problems

1148
00:44:55,167 --> 00:45:00,799
And I know your ship partners are obviously doing a lot of the work to Bluetooth and thread together

1149
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,383
Are you guys at the

1150
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:06,431
Actively talking to people at

1151
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:07,455
The Bluetooth Sig

1152
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:11,807
To try to make something happen much like you guys did with

1153
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:13,343
How many ducks

1154
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:19,999
But we do have many members in common between both the Bluetooth Sig and

1155
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:23,327
And those common shared numbers are

1156
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:29,727
Doing a lot of work in the background I try to bring those two worlds together and show the marketplace how easily can be complementary

1157
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:31,519
Augusta Technologies

1158
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:33,823
And final thought

1159
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,103
Thread is

1160
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:37,663
I know that Nest is obviously a big prick

1161
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:41,759
There's the Eero routers I've talked to LaGrande which makes

1162
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:43,039
Beautiful switches

1163
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:44,575
And those cool plugs

1164
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:45,343
Pop out of the wall

1165
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:48,159
Are there other players

1166
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:48,927
Using

1167
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:50,207
Threads that are worth

1168
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:57,887
We can mention by name we have confidential agreements with all of our members and partners that do go into the store

1169
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:05,311
Certainly do now that they are there they are actively engaged with her greatest test labs and tough houses and if we kind of

1170
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:10,943
What to add everything up that we see in the pipeline and I'm Horizon we think by end-of-year CS

1171
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:14,783
2018 time frame we should definitely see certified products

1172
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:17,343
Numbering in low

1173
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:19,135
Okay so CES

1174
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:20,159
2018

1175
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:21,183
The year

1176
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:25,535
Coming on the show

1177
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:28,863
I really appreciate the time-space it's been a pleasure as always.

1178
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:35,263
