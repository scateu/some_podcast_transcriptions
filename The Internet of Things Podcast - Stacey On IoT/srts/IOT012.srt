00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:11,520
Hey everyone you're listening to The Internet of Things show and I am your host

2
00:00:12,032 --> 00:00:14,080
Stacey Higginbotham

3
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:15,360
Kevin tofel

4
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:17,664
And I'm talking about

5
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:19,712
Teachers in the Smart Home

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,040
Industrial internet Consortium testbed

7
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:26,112
Bliss hub

8
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:30,720
And the Brit

9
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:32,512
So Kevin are we ready

10
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,120
We are ready as long as you don't talk about a hub github

11
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:38,400
You know the article

12
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:39,680
Who says

13
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:42,496
Alright so we're getting ahead of ourselves

14
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:43,264
Express

15
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:46,848
We want to start off with a story from wired that I actually thought was

16
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:47,616
Really

17
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:52,224
Encapsulated a lot of things

18
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:53,504
The story

19
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,272
Is basically

20
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:56,832
It's my David Pierce and it talks about how

21
00:00:57,088 --> 00:01:02,720
At WWDC Apple introduced a bunch of features that we've already seen before and how all the features on

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,024
Form separately coalesce

23
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,584
I think what got David thinking about this was

24
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,704
The the big one more thing Apple which was Apple music obvious that's not related

25
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,496
But it really hits the point that

26
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:16,544
Hey everybody else has a music service

27
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,104
To what why was this one more thing

28
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,128
As you said

29
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,944
Mobile platforms have matured so much

30
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:23,968
Pretty much

31
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:27,040
All the same in some sense may be different implementations

32
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:28,064
I think so I think about

33
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:30,624
But they're all the same so how does that apply to

34
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,392
Startups

35
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:33,440
It doesn't

36
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:35,232
Because nothing about any of my smart home stuff is

37
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,144
In thinking about kind of the news that we've had I think that there are a couple things that everyone's kind of gravity

38
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:43,936
And we're not there yet

39
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:45,984
Right now we're all at the end of Lake

40
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:48,288
One app to control multiple

41
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,056
Devices

42
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,616
So we see a lot of those being integrated where you can

43
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:52,384
Control

44
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:53,664
Your lights

45
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,432
From

46
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:55,200
Ihob

47
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:56,736
Like a SmartThings aura

48
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:58,528
Staples connect kind of

49
00:01:58,784 --> 00:01:59,296
App

50
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:04,160
Where everyone is pretty clear that we're going is all these devices will eventually

51
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,440
Talk to one another

52
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:07,488
I think the difference is our

53
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:08,256
How they're going to

54
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,304
So

55
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,608
One of the big things that I've seen is

56
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,888
We're going to be

57
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:14,912
Fighting over

58
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,216
Services in the cloud or services in the home

59
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:21,568
And that's actually something that we talked about many times before because

60
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,664
Turn off we stand on different sides of that but I know from an implementation standpoint

61
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,200
I prefer to have my stuff

62
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,224
Local

63
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,504
Which on a device

64
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,528
Rather than

65
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:31,552
In the cloud

66
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:32,320
Where

67
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:34,368
Making my sins are program in the cloud

68
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,648
Can I have no

69
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:41,024
Internet connectivity for some reason and my scenes don't happen because the cloud didn't say make the same time

70
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,048
Exactly

71
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:47,168
The actual implementation will take place in both locally and the cloud

72
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:49,728
Like a light switches that should be local

73
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,008
Because there's too much latency

74
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,544
Right

75
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,848
You should have some of your basic programming

76
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,384
Auto local hub

77
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,688
Because yes if your internet goes down Sudley Road

78
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,224
Oh crap

79
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:00,992
Nothing works

80
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,952
When the sun sets or 3 hours before the sun sets

81
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:12,256
Take my shades down a notch

82
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,536
That's the kind of stuff

83
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:16,608
But you're going to need Cloud access for because presumably

84
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,168
The time of day that the sunsets is going to live

85
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,032
Maybe because I actually have that exact

86
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,824
I'll call it a recipe or seen

87
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:29,920
Had it on my insteon server and the server used

88
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,272
Anybody dress each day how many minutes before sunrise sunset

89
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:36,832
So could be local but I suspect yes most

90
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:39,136
People would would need Cloud for that

91
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:44,256
What is an architectural decision you can make you can actually download

92
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:45,792
Like once a day

93
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:47,328
Your server checks in and

94
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,352
Posen weather

95
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,376
Time

96
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:54,240
Point of light switches and latency and so on and

97
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,776
I mean I don't want to have to

98
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:59,872
Have a signal goes thousands of miles and then come back just to turn on the light switch

99
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:01,152
Being silly

100
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,432
I think

101
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:04,480
We'll see what happens over there

102
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,320
I think you're right where you had said

103
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,368
Could be maybe a combination

104
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,976
And by that I mean maybe you have all of your local controls will your controls local

105
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,280
And your rules local but sync

106
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:20,095
We're stored in the cloud as midi a backup copy

107
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:22,655
And therefore you could have come like a hybrid Model A

108
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:25,727
Depending on which made the most sense to use the time it would just

109
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:29,823
Alright so we got the hybrid model and I was thinking more control

110
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,871
Are you going to talk to your house or you going to

111
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:33,151
Show interface

112
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,175
Yeah

113
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,711
Interface

114
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,039
Wise guy said

115
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:44,415
Back in 2011 when Siri first came out because really that was the big first of all say

116
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:47,487
Boise personal assistant type software that hit mainstream

117
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:52,351
Tammy voice was going to be at some point in future the invisible interface

118
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,375
Because it's

119
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:57,471
Comment if the most common interface I think there is as opposed to

120
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:00,543
Dealing with touch screens and keyboards and mice and

121
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,079
Switches and

122
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,127
Wall panels in Solon

123
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,175
Also present some of the biggest

124
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:06,943
Challenges

125
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:10,271
In terms of natural language processing

126
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:15,391
Then again going back up to the cloud and there's a lot of things lot of moving Parts there that have to work

127
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:16,415
So

128
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:18,463
I don't think it was going to be an overnight

129
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,487
Interface

130
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:22,047
But I do think in the Long Haul

131
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,071
I think it's going to be voice

132
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:23,839
In the home

133
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,119
Maybe not everywhere

134
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:27,935
When you're out and about

135
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,471
Sitting around on a

136
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:30,751
Subway or bus

137
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:33,311
You're not going to use voice for everything

138
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,591
Examples for interact

139
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:36,383
There's lots of people around you and

140
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,199
And someone is just not going to work as well in the home though I can see it

141
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:42,271
Are physical

142
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:44,319
Presence is going to be a huge

143
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,647
A way that we interface with device

144
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:50,207
Even if it's like a secondary layer that

145
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:54,559
Voice or touch screens or anything else I think

146
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:58,655
Our physical presence is going to be noted enough in the home that

147
00:05:59,167 --> 00:05:59,679
It will

148
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:04,287
Respond like oh is she's turning if she says turn on the lights and she's in this room

149
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:07,615
It's like a 98% probability she wants the lights

150
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,687
It gets axle that gets into the next

151
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:12,991
Peace that I wanted to talk about and it's contacts

152
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,783
Because contacts has a huge part of this

153
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:17,087
You got your sensors to gather the data

154
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,367
What is the context that

155
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:21,695
Case today that makes Intelligent Decisions based on the sensor data

156
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:23,231
But

157
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:27,583
And this gets back to the everybody's the same in some sense and in some ways they're not

158
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,375
Platforms and IRT

159
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:32,703
You got to give up information in order to provide

160
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,471
Contacts

161
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,775
And a lot of people are still not

162
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:36,799
Comfortable with that

163
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,591
Yes so there is

164
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,615
There's actually

165
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:42,175
A big kerfuffle today in the world because

166
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,991
We haven't used it yet that's a good one

167
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:47,039
Alright big kerfuffle right now in

168
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:50,111
Privacy kind of sphere because

169
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:52,415
With facial-recognition happening

170
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:54,975
More often in Facebook launching a platform

171
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:57,535
On this week called moments that uses

172
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,327
Facial recognition to Kinder

173
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,351
Auto tag

174
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:02,399
Your friends and help you share content among them

175
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:07,007
Which Google actually does to now with its new Google photos it does a lot of facial recognition stuff

176
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:07,775
Exactly

177
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:13,151
We anticipate the Dropcam actually Nest Dropcam uses facial

178
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:15,199
Recognition or has the ability to use facial

179
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:15,967
Recognition

180
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:17,503
And so does the

181
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,039
We're going to talk about later

182
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:21,087
In the Privacy Arena

183
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,879
What happened is the

184
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:23,903
Ntia

185
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,183
Which is a government

186
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:28,255
It's the national telecommunications and Information Administration

187
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:34,911
They were trying to work with industry and privacy groups to create this voluntary code of conduct around how people are going to use

188
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:35,935
Facial recognition data

189
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:38,239
And the privacy

190
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:40,287
Oriented groups basically left

191
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,103
Stealing like they weren't being heard and that the companies

192
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:43,871
We're not going to

193
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:44,895
Implement any standards

194
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,431
While

195
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:48,991
I can understand why the Privacy groups are

196
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:49,759
Concerned

197
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:54,111
But I almost think that you can't have it both ways you can't have

198
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,183
The intelligence that devices can provide

199
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:59,743
Without giving them more and more information

200
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:02,815
It should be out there not obviously I mean I don't think

201
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:03,839
People shouldn't just

202
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,631
Say I'm stuck with it.

203
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:06,911
You know you can not buy

204
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:10,495
In the end especially at the younger generation

205
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:14,591
Pretty much. He's convenience of a privacy as soon as I get older I don't think

206
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:17,919
I don't think it will be as big as a kerfuffle

207
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,711
In the future in the cities today

208
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:20,991
I hope you're right

209
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:27,391
I do think we should be having a good kind of in-depth discussion about this and I'm sure we're actually going to get someone on a podcast

210
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:30,463
In a couple weeks who's going to have this in-depth discussion

211
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:32,767
In the meantime

212
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,815
Context is one of kind of

213
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:38,399
The core things that we think are smart home platform will need

214
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:41,215
I think programmability like how we program it

215
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:42,495
Is going to have to change

216
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:45,567
And so I'm really interested I don't think we know how that's going to happen

217
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,615
If it's going to be kind of a

218
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,663
Data-driven model where like

219
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,199
When you plug in a device

220
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:55,551
Suggest like I see you have the following other devices would you like to hook us up and do this

221
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:58,111
Or if it's going to be more programmatic like

222
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:58,879
If this then that

223
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,927
So I think that's still up in the air

224
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:03,231
I think we're heading towards the former

225
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,535
Example though I do think that

226
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:09,631
The companies that really want to push IRT or trying to make the devices

227
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,679
Work with each other with

228
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,471
Far less interaction

229
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,031
I agree

230
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:21,919
The other question is how people get it are they going to buy it from a service provider or an alarm company or

231
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,479
Best Buy in Amazon

232
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,551
Actually really legit

233
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:32,415
We're all over the map their personal am I'm a DIY guy so I don't want

234
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,463
Companies that

235
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:36,255
Modern Fusion

236
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:39,839
And controlling and even access to that data potentially that

237
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,375
We don't want them to have some

238
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:43,679
Now it says convenience versus cost

239
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:51,103
Thinking about to get some input from you guys if you have any thoughts

240
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:53,919
At

241
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:54,943
Starcom

242
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:55,967
And

243
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:59,039
Next up is the industrial internet Consortium

244
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,343
Do you remember these guys

245
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:03,135
They are launched last year at

246
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:06,463
Was GE Cisco

247
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:09,791
The president the White House

248
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:11,583
Saying hey

249
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,143
We're doing this industrial internet Consortium

250
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:14,911
It'll be great

251
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:16,959
Nobody knew what it was

252
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:17,983
Including me

253
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:23,871
I first saw the news I tried to figure out what they were doing a conclusion that this was just a

254
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:24,895
The standards organization

255
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:25,663
Entrenched

256
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:28,991
How did you really feel about

257
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,039
That's true

258
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:33,855
Today

259
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:34,879
Are this week

260
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,671
Released their first

261
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:39,999
I guess we'll call a product it's actually a test bed that's been built by

262
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,791
EMC and Vodafone

263
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,839
And it's in Ireland

264
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,375
And what they're doing is there

265
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:47,423
Basically creating a virtual

266
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,215
33 data centers

267
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,239
And they're creating

268
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:55,359
The appearance of one data center basically so you could send data and it doesn't really matter where it goes

269
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,639
Switch Data Center

270
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,967
And idea

271
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:02,015
The first kind of use case is

272
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,551
Platform called Blue Light

273
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,855
And what it will do is

274
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,903
If someone is in an ambulance

275
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,207
It will take the data from

276
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:12,255
Ambulance and send it to the hospital

277
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:15,071
They're going to so you'll get the patient data

278
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,351
Water on

279
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,631
Route basically to the

280
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:18,911
Which is kind of a cool app

281
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:19,679
Location

282
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,727
Absolutely

283
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:24,287
Healthcare Providers on how to

284
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:27,871
Practically received information know what to expect and you can be better prepared

285
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:28,895
So exactly

286
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:29,919
And so

287
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:32,479
I think the end instead of just like

288
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,087
Like the patient's heart data and all their

289
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:39,391
Vital signs from the paramedics

290
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:42,463
This guy he was crushed by a car

291
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:44,511
So

292
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:45,535
I should be good

293
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,559
So that is that

294
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:50,143
Moving out of the industrial internet and back into the home

295
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,167
We have

296
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,191
Kevin years

297
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,471
Your thoughts on the

298
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,263
Homekit as the homeless hub

299
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,031
Publix sub

300
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,823
Homeless homeless

301
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,871
Nobody should be homeless

302
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:04,991
This was an interesting article over it that's not funny. Com

303
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,783
Apple's homekit and

304
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,831
Howard wheeler won't work with a hug

305
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:11,903
And Adam Bianca who wrote the article

306
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:14,719
Found something really interesting and he's been playing with

307
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:16,767
With some homekit devices the first

308
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:19,071
You have just launched in the past couple weeks

309
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:22,655
Co-create his Lutron caseta Hub and again I may be saying that

310
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:25,471
To the new homekit version

311
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,263
And then found out that

312
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:31,359
He can actually control it through the Elgato Eve app on his iPhone

313
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:38,015
So the EVAP which Eve we talked about in the past like those are the the sensors that you put in your house for a humidity temperature in such right

314
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:39,807
Yes

315
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:40,831
Right so

316
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,879
In the EVAP he could actually

317
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:43,903
Control

318
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,463
Through

319
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:52,095
So is interesting in that we talked about getaways Apple TV going to be a

320
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,375
Homekit hub

321
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:56,447
That all the devices work through we already know that

322
00:12:56,703 --> 00:13:02,591
Apple TV will even though Apple did not announce us at WWDC it's on their support page for for homekit

323
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,615
Apple TV

324
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:06,687
Gateway for remote access

325
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:09,503
But in a sense it almost sounds like you don't need a hub

326
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,295
For the homekit devices to

327
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:14,111
Work together that was a key question I had

328
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,903
About how dissolving a horse

329
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,439
In Tampa because

330
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:20,767
I like things to do things based on what's Happening so if

331
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,119
One sensor see something maybe another device from another manufacturer might

332
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:27,679
Do something else and they looks like

333
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:30,239
There may be wasted at least control thing

334
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:32,031
So I thought I was quite interesting

335
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:34,591
He summed it up I'm going to read what he said

336
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,871
Because I think this really drives

337
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,735
Homekit is the ability to standardize the language spoken by all of your smart home things

338
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:43,807
So that these things can all interact with each other and

339
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:46,367
Can be controlled by multiple iOS devices

340
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:48,671
Without needing to be a central control

341
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:51,999
And they said it's finally a hubless smart home hub

342
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:55,839
It sounds to me this is very much the vision of

343
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:56,607
Join

344
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,983
Talk to each other

345
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,263
And communicate

346
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,799
Between devices

347
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:07,615
And using a set of standard

348
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,663
I guess it's schema

349
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,199
A standard way of saying

350
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,223
I am dis

351
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:13,759
I have the capability to do

352
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:14,783
The following sing

353
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:17,599
That's exactly what I'll do

354
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:20,415
It sounds also a lot like what Google

355
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,231
And

356
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:26,559
It's also what Intel has been pushing with iotivity

357
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:27,583
It's a lot like this

358
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:31,167
And isn't that interesting we started the show with how all the

359
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:34,495
Things are becoming the same depending on you regardless of manufacturer

360
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:35,519
Mrs.

361
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:36,543
Again

362
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:40,639
The same concept apply to Coyote and hunting snorkels now

363
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:42,431
Yes but these are not interrupt

364
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:45,247
Yet so catch there

365
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:50,367
I guess it's time for us to go to our 5 minutes

366
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:54,207
This is going to be probably a lot

367
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:54,975
More than 5 minutes

368
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:57,535
5 ish

369
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,327
You can stop at five

370
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,911
So what I'm talking about is the welcome camera

371
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,447
It was launched this week

372
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:08,799
Is the company that also makes the rain gauge system

373
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,079
Camera itself

374
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,359
Is brand new

375
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:13,919
It retails for $199

376
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,967
And the coolest thing about it

377
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:16,991
Other than its design

378
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,575
It's a very tiny Pringles can

379
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,855
It is this

380
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,135
It's the science

381
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:23,903
About the

382
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,183
It's smaller than a

383
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:27,487
Like a 16 oz water bottle

384
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,791
And it's even a little skinnier and it's

385
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:30,815
It's beautiful

386
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,631
Aluminum recycle paper towel roll

387
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:35,423
No it's

388
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:39,007
Is shorter than a paper towel roll but it's about that

389
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:41,823
Okay

390
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,615
It's a camera

391
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:44,383
It's pretty

392
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:46,175
And the coolest thing about it

393
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:48,991
Is that it offers facial recognition

394
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,015
So

395
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:53,599
When people walk in after you train it a little bit

396
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:57,183
I got it for day and a half and I'm Midway through training in it

397
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,719
Faces

398
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,743
Who is this person

399
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,535
And you say oh it's Stacey

400
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:03,583
Or in your case you like I was Kevin

401
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:06,399
And whenever it sees that person

402
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:09,983
It sends a notification to you in the cool thing is

403
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,519
The notification

404
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:13,823
It's no longer like I've detected movement

405
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,615
Which doesn't tell you anything it now says

406
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:16,639
Kevin's home

407
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:18,431
Kevin Zoe's home I don't get out much

408
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:21,759
In the kitchen

409
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,807
Can you connect me depending on where your camera is

410
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:25,343
He brings presents

411
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,623
So it's a way to bring

412
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,391
Presents

413
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:29,183
Minutes away to bring presents

414
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,207
What's even for people

415
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:34,047
Like my daughter who doesn't have a cell phone or Bluetooth devices on

416
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:37,119
I knew you were going to go there cuz I was just going to say

417
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,655
My phone can do that

418
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,703
T4 presents but you're right

419
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,239
Not everybody has one end

420
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:45,567
Yes I know I know

421
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:49,663
This is this isn't interested like bring presents into the home

422
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,991
People are going to be really excited about is

423
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,039
The camera can take video

424
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,599
And

425
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:58,879
Record of life

426
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,415
Motion-sensing

427
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:02,207
And pictures related to that

428
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:04,767
Are all stored on an SD card on the device

429
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,559
Sono cloud in golf

430
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:08,351
So there is a cloud

431
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:14,751
What did such a cloud is basically the timeline of events

432
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:15,519
Like so

433
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:17,055
Kevin has

434
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:18,591
NFL

435
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,615
Face basically so

436
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,151
Kevin has

437
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,175
Is entered the kitchen

438
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,711
Gets stuck

439
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:29,599
You can send your face to the cloud

440
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,391
And the videos that

441
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,159
Can generate

442
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:34,463
If you asked me to generate videos

443
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:37,279
Let's not go there we've already had one kerfuffle on the show

444
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:46,239
But that's the sphere is connected cameras in my home

445
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:48,031
Suddenly my home is now

446
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,311
Open to

447
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,847
Basically anyone who's like

448
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,383
Has the capability to

449
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,407
Hack into a server

450
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:55,199
In Amazon stock end

451
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,735
So here's a question

452
00:17:57,247 --> 00:18:01,087
I'm not going to go not going to talk about the price 199 it is what it is

453
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:06,975
What can I do with that other than just being notified that I could I have certain things happen in the house

454
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:07,999
Trigger events

455
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,791
Because I walk in the door

456
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:10,559
With clothes on

457
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:14,143
Hopefully if you're coming in from outside you are wearing

458
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:17,983
Today

459
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:21,055
With all this other devices are supported

460
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,079
If this then that

461
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:25,919
This because it just launched his not but that is a priority

462
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:26,943
According to the CEO

463
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:28,991
Soon

464
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:31,295
You should be able to say when Stacy enters

465
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,343
Turn the Lights this way

466
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:38,463
And they will happen this way but when my husband enters a room where my daughter does

467
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,231
It would be

468
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:40,511
Turn the Lights this way

469
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:42,559
Kind of their first priority

470
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:43,839
We'll see how long it take

471
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:44,863
It shouldn't take too long

472
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:48,191
That will make it far more valuable to me

473
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:50,751
Yes yes I don't think I mean

474
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:53,311
It is always nice you can currently

475
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:55,871
Look into wherever the room is and see a live

476
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,407
It's delayed by a

477
00:18:59,455 --> 00:18:59,967
4 second

478
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:01,759
Just enough to put your clothes on

479
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,367
Terrible

480
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,135
Sorry

481
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,415
So so that

482
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:10,463
Security

483
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:12,511
That's worthwhile to them

484
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,535
They can look in

485
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:16,095
They can also set it so people who aren't recognized

486
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:19,423
Tetrachords a video so if like some burglar breaks in

487
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:24,031
If there's definitely a security aspect in addition to presents I like that

488
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:25,567
Security

489
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:26,335
Presents

490
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:32,479
I wonder if the facial recognition works with animals cuz I used a webcam 3 years ago to figure out which the cat

491
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:33,247
Square

492
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:35,295
Relieving themselves on my Christmas tree

493
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,647
Facial recognition

494
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:41,951
You have to train it on

495
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:42,975
A set of

496
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:47,071
Faces so if you wanted to recognize animals you have to train it on a set of animals

497
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,631
I don't think they've done that

498
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,239
Probably a low priority for the company I get it

499
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,031
So I think that's it

500
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:58,335
Please stay tuned because our guest

501
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:00,127

Interesting moments in this podcast I'm going to try to edit out

520
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:45,695
Be prepared

521
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:47,743
It's worth it he's totally worth it you guys

522
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,535
Alright so

523
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,863
Let's start out ala is a

524
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,143
It's a cloud provider

525
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:54,911
4

526
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,447
Companies who want to

527
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:57,727
Get products online

528
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:02,591
Yes that's correct we provide infrastructure

529
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:04,895
Manufacturers so that they don't have to

530
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:08,991
To try and do this on their own are our infrastructure includes a cloud platform

531
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:12,319
The manages the devices a device side software

532
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:16,159
That's running inside chips are gateways and application software

533
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:17,184
Awesome

534
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:23,840
And you are in China because you guys just announced that you are doing a deal where you're the kind of back in provider

535
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:24,608
Weather for

536
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:25,888
WeChat

537
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:27,168
And services their offer

538
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,240
We definitely work very closely with WeChat

539
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,264
A lot of us

540
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,592
May not know what WeChat is in the United States but it's massive

541
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:38,688
Pretty much everyone uses it here as a social network so the idea is

542
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:39,456
Of course

543
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:41,504
We're all looking for the super app and

544
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:44,832
A tailor we can't believe these Giants social networks

545
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:45,856
Sunshine in the US

546
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:46,624
Swill

547
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:47,904
Have the best

548
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,672
Chance

549
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:50,208
Provide that super app

550
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,304
Yes sir we are making it easy for all the manufacturer

551
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,632
Awesome services

552
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:58,400
Got it

553
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,168
So

554
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,960
Walk me through an example

555
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:02,752
Because I think if wechat kind of like

556
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,800
WhatsApp Meats Twitter

557
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:06,080
So

558
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:07,616
How would a customer use the

559
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:13,504
Well you know it's interesting that are really mundane

560
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,528
And they're not that

561
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:16,576
On their own

562
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:19,136
And yet when they can interact with

563
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:22,720
The Social Network where you spend all your time I guess it makes them

564
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:23,744
More interesting

565
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:24,768
But but

566
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:27,072
Maybe more importantly if you make lights

567
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,352
Switches or something

568
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:29,632
You can sell

569
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:31,168
Your own light switch app

570
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:31,936
But

571
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,496
Better perhaps if it uses the

572
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:35,520
WeChat apps

573
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:38,848
Maybe control the light switch cuz you might use the same WeChat app

574
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:42,432
Lots of other things in your home I think it's the integration

575
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:44,736
And getting closer to the super app

576
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:47,040
Is the most exciting part of this

577
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:48,576
All right

578
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:50,880
When you keeps you keep using that word

579
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:52,928
I don't know what you mean

580
00:22:54,464 --> 00:23:00,608
Well you know it's funny when you start a company like Ayla you you can look into the future little bit you say

581
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:07,264
Do I want a door lock thermostat light switch app a refrigerator in a garage door

582
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:10,080
And I think we know the answer to rhetorical question

583
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:10,848
And so

584
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,128
The super app

585
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,920
I guess for us is

586
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:15,712
Start of the my home app

587
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,552
And we think we chat in the social networks have the best opera

588
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:25,952
Community to provide the super app or the my home app my question for you is how I as a user

589
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:32,352
Turn on my lights using WeChat and then again how I as a user would do something like set of goodnight set

590
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:33,376
Using WeChat

591
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:34,656
Well

592
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:38,752
Technical answered that they enable the ability to have HTML5

593
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:39,776
Control apps

594
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:41,568
It's not just a noun

595
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:44,128
Speak into the app like a standard WeChat

596
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:46,688
So they've built out the infrastructure

597
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:52,320
So that you can actually control light bulb you can build a nap inside WeChat the controls light bulb

598
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:55,648
Okay what are the benefits of using a social network

599
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,928
As opposed to

600
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,000
Your own kind of home hub I can think of things like

601
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:01,024
When you travel

602
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:06,656
Swift like your hotel room or

603
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:09,216
It is that even possible or is that just crazy talk

604
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:13,568
You know it's a broad question

605
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:14,848
In the case of

606
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:16,896
Little Caesars Entertainment there's this

607
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:20,224
Vast social network that they might want to tap

608
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,016
More of these

609
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:25,856
Great Chinese consumers into their hotel rooms now

610
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:26,880
In your home

611
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:33,536
Again it just makes it easier than the Chinese internet companies do so much more than say create a chat app

612
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:34,816
They do payments you can

613
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:35,840
You can help tax

614
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:39,936
I have an Uber like capability inside China to so they

615
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:42,240
Built the infrastructure so again if you

616
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:43,776
Have your device

617
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:45,056
Connected to WeChat there

618
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:48,384
Services that does payment and end all sorts of different things

619
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,408
Got it so

620
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:53,248
They have all of this information I just tell it what I wanted to do

621
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:57,088
I'm working within the app so I don't have to open my new app

622
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,928
That's correct

623
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,464
Got it okay

624
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,488
That does sound sleeper

625
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:09,888
So let's let's talk a little bit about where China is with adopting the internet

626
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:10,912
Speakers

627
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:12,704
You guys have been there for

628
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,240
Years guess maybe

629
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:15,776
Movie years is too long

630
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:19,360
It is all sort of gradually growing invest

631
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:21,152
Smith that's not so gradual

632
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:25,248
Yes funny I had a big dinner with our team we had a

633
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,808
The official opening we've probably been at it

634
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:31,392
For two years here of our officer was last year about this time and so

635
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:34,208
We went last year when we open that office

636
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:36,512
There were fewer people globally at ala

637
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:38,304
Then there are now in

638
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,120
China so I think there's about 30 people in China

639
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:42,400
Enchanted

640
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:44,192
What's happening right now is

641
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:49,568
I think it's like the United States only touch behind his ally awesome Kickstarter company launching products

642
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,640
And there's the big companies are starting to

643
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:54,432
The build and design their products

644
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:57,504
You're not seeing a huge amount of these

645
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,784
Things on the shelves

646
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:02,368
We'll see a lot more 2016 really 2017

647
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,648
Toby

648
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:08,512
The same of the US only the us maybe you know we'll see holiday 2016 Dobby

649
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:10,048
A good amount just a lot of

650
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:11,328
Design activity happening

651
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:12,864
Okay

652
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,400
And do these devices like

653
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:18,240
Right now I feel like we're the stage of buying one off devices

654
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:24,640
And I'm looking forward to when we get to the stage where we kind of start just building connectivity into things

655
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:26,688
Because it's cheap because it makes sense

656
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:33,856
Yeah you know I think you're right though but so what's happening is there's a product manager at these companies whose lawn

657
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:35,904
Launching a product it's not yet certain

658
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,952
Corporate at the sea level

659
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:43,840
A bunch of ayla's customers an hour or big Appliance companies and they have a whole plan of launching

660
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:44,608
Sexy

661
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:46,144
Devices that they don't just

662
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,472
Do you know they might say kitchen appliances in MA

663
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:51,520
I'll let you know the clothing type stuff

664
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:53,568
But it is right it's one off

665
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:55,104
So you know what they're great products

666
00:26:55,616 --> 00:27:00,480
But everyone's starting with her toe in the water I think that's why like I said you're not going to have

667
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:01,760
Huge amount

668
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:03,552
Holiday 2015

669
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:07,904
You'll have a bunch more 2016 and you'll start to see the integration of all these things

670
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,928
2017

671
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:10,208
And a lot more volume

672
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:10,976
Now

673
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:14,816
Stacy the other big deal though it's funny when we started the company 2010

674
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:18,656
The cost to add the networking like the hardware part ala dozen

675
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,704
We don't do Hardware but

676
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,288
It was probably about 70% higher than it is today

677
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:25,824
And same with info

678
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,872
You know it's amazing so

679
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:28,896
Amazon services

680
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:32,224
Is we run globally on AWS inside China 2

681
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:32,992
Aldo's

682
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:34,528
Also drop by about 7

683
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:35,296
80%

684
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:38,368
This is you know your set your question is will when will I see and everything

685
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,392
You're about to

686
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:42,208
Do because everyone is singing at the prices are now they say

687
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:44,256
Should I can put this in in the cost

688
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:45,280
The added

689
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:47,328
To my thing almost whatever it is

690
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,144
Is outweigh even by the ability to Serta

691
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,704
Understand warranty and service and maintenance

692
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,264
Let alone turn the cool features for consumers

693
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:57,824
Awesome so how much does the hardware

694
00:27:59,104 --> 00:27:59,616
It is

695
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:02,176
Well below $5 now

696
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:04,480
You mentioned the cloud cost and I have to ask

697
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:05,248
Because

698
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:08,064
One of the things I'm really curious about is

699
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,368
How long you might want to support

700
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,416
The washing machine or something that's

701
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:14,976
It feels a little low value in terms of

702
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:16,768
Opportunity

703
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:19,584
And it's important that for like 15 years on a cloud

704
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,608
Does that make

705
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:21,632
Economic sense

706
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:23,168
You know it.

707
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,216
We don't necessarily do it if it

708
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:28,800
If it doesn't make sense and I don't think the manufacturer would either frankly now

709
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:31,616
You know what's interesting so today a lot of the product

710
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:33,152
That we work with

711
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:35,968
Are connected either by zigbee connect

712
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:37,248
One of the gateways

713
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,528
Or Wi-Fi

714
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:45,440
Now so you're at that that's a hardware thing that we just talked about but eventually because now you have

715
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:48,000
NFC that's going to be opened up an iPhone as well

716
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:53,120
You know you're at your washing machine might just have an NFC thing for you

717
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:55,424
You know you to be able to help troubleshoot

718
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,728
And hit a button and send it up

719
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:59,520
I understand what's going on with the product

720
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:04,640
But you know what's interesting is connected let's just use at a clothes washer

721
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:07,200
It doesn't have to talk to the service very often

722
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:10,272
It might talk to the service once a day

723
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:13,088
The ability for a thing like

724
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:15,904
The clothes washer to talk to a service once a day

725
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:16,672
It is

726
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:18,208
Incredibly efficient

727
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,512
To be able to do that doesn't cost a lot

728
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:21,792
Oh yeah

729
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:23,584
I agree now I would say

730
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:26,144
I think Bender should probably just stay

731
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,936
Wi-Fi or some kind of

732
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:29,728
Constant connectivity in there

733
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,288
Because I've never met someone

734
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,592
Who gets data from the internet

735
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:35,872
It says

736
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:36,640
Wow

737
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:37,664
This is great

738
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,200
And once a day is enough

739
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,992
I feel like what will happen

740
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,552
Is the people that every time I won

741
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:45,600
Run my washer is there going to be like

742
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:48,672
Hey actually we want to know every time she runs it

743
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,256
We want to know what's in there if possible and how it's running

744
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:53,536
And suddenly

745
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:55,328
What happens is

746
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:57,888
It's being connected more and more often

747
00:29:58,656 --> 00:29:59,424
That's kind of how they

748
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,704
Internet works right

749
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,240
You know I think there is

750
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:04,032
There's not one-size-fits-all

751
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:06,080
The cost reduction that's half

752
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:12,480
Really it's a trade-off right it's the user going up to the thing and touching it with a phone and getting the data

753
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:13,760
Versus

754
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:15,552
It's slightly if you know the Edition

755
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:17,600
Cost of adding Wi-Fi it's really that simple

756
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:21,696
I think the cost of that is going down to wear lots of manufacturers

757
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:23,232
Would like to have that concert

758
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,256
The connection is true

759
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:30,656
How are your customers thinking about building these products are they trying to build in basically connectivity for

760
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:31,680
Coolest sake

761
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:33,984
Are they really trying to create

762
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:35,520
A new service

763
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:41,408
We have what we would call 1.0 company so what and what we mean by that is

764
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:43,456
Some customers want to have at least

765
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:44,736
Feature parity

766
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:46,528
With maybe a new entrance

767
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:47,296
The market

768
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:50,112
And when I want to say one. Do it just means

769
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:52,928
I want to also be competitive I I want to give

770
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:56,000
Similar capabilities that

771
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:57,024
Someone else has

772
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:58,816
One of our early customers

773
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:00,864
Is Johnson Controls a build a great

774
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:01,888
Thermostat

775
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:07,520
Using Amos technology where the underlying platform for that and Nest was in the market now this allowed them to

776
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:10,336
Get something on the market Havasu without hiring a whole cloud

777
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,360
Semenax semen everything

778
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:16,736
But some companies are thinking about the data much earlier and probably faster than we thought

779
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:19,040
Some companies realize

780
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:20,320
State if they understand

781
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:21,600
What's going on with the products

782
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:22,624
They can earn

783
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:24,160
More services

784
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:24,928
Or they can

785
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:25,696
Provide

786
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:27,488
Actually service and maintenance

787
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:28,256
Mortician

788
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:30,304
God is a bit of a mix

789
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:31,584
No that makes sense

790
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:33,632
And let's take it back to China since

791
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:34,912
That's where you are

792
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:37,984
Pictures this week with WeChat

793
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:39,008
Was

794
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,544
Consumer-oriented

795
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:41,568
But

796
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,896
Are you working with Chinese manufacturers or how is it

797
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:46,432
How is kind of Batman

798
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:47,456
Evolving

799
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:49,760
Yeah it's kind of only for manufacturer

800
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:51,040
There's really a so

801
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:57,440
Century one of the companies we work with his ozner it's a makes perfect sense they provide

802
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:59,232
Water filtration

803
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,352
Filters and they kind of do kind of the o2o type thing

804
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:06,656
You're the online-offline where they

805
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:09,216
They get people to your building or your home

806
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:10,240
And replace

807
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,520
The filters

808
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:18,176
David Kennedy getting these things connected so that desire need for them bad connectivity no the WeChat

809
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:20,736
And consumers are major Target makes it just

810
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:22,784
More cool more approachable

811
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:24,576
No not like some

812
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:26,624
Weird thing you have in the background by

813
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:29,952
People in China spend a lot of time on WeChat and this

814
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:30,976
Just makes

815
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:33,280
Maybe something of mundane

816
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:34,560
Perhaps like a filter

817
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,096
Just a little cooler

818
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:38,400
I see I can't wait for a cooler filters

819
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:39,680
With

820
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:42,496
With the Chinese market as a US company

821
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:47,104
What was your process in getting over there and what are the advantages and

822
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:48,640
Let's talk a little bit about that

823
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:53,504
One of the processes for being here was have a co-founder

824
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:56,064
Who has amazing relationships

825
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:56,832
In China

826
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:58,368
And by the way without that

827
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,928
Your China is all about relationship

828
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:01,952
Entrust first

829
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:05,280
And then you have to have great technology and Emmett and a business

830
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,304
This model that works

831
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:09,632
But Philip who I've worked with Forever Phil Chang

832
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:11,168
We he and I worked

833
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:15,264
Together in China at our last company and someone we started this company

834
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,056
We said hey let's give to go

835
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:19,104
Let's see if we can leverage these relation

836
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:24,736
And and do something interesting when we started by the way we chat was almost nothing at that

837
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:26,016
Know if WeChat had

838
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:30,368
Any users we start in 2010 our first customer in China was Cena

839
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,184
WeChat was smaller than Sina weibo back

840
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:35,232
It's much different right now

841
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:36,768
That's true

842
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:39,328
Things move fast

843
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:41,120
They do they do

844
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:43,424
As it is a back in provider

845
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:44,448
Asbys

846
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,776
As he's kind of abs inflows and popularity of service

847
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:49,056
Services happen

848
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:50,848
Do you see adding

849
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:56,480
Adding connectivity to your home being something that will help retain users and keep

850
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:59,808
Keep them from moving or is that just kind of an offering that

851
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:03,392
Can skip from place to place cuz now it's basically in the cloud

852
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,184
So

853
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:09,536
Fickleness I suppose of the consumer is less of an issue for a lice

854
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:10,816
We're just

855
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:12,096
The underlying

856
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:15,168
Infrastructure that it is using

857
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:17,984
So that they can build a set of connected pricing

858
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:18,752
Connect to

859
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:22,592
B2c applications are maybe the most popular at the time

860
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:25,408
Right now I'm thinking about for your customer base

861
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,968
Okay for so4 the a Lacoste

862
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:29,248
Base meaning manufacturer

863
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,040
Manufacturers

864
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:32,576
WeChat guys

865
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,880
Yes how easy is it

866
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:37,696
The consumer tied in

867
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:38,464
Pinterest

868
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:40,000
Once you've built it

869
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:41,024
It service

870
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,096
I think I guess if you're using data you can follow

871
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:45,120
I mean without

872
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:51,520
The data then you're it's very difficult but the biggest with or without ala by the way the giant internet plan

873
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:57,920
They understand consumers they understand your eyeballs and what you do all the time Amazon is amazing

874
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:58,688
At this

875
00:34:58,944 --> 00:34:59,968
Your browser tells

876
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:01,248
Them everything about you

877
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:04,576
And so I think that's why these companies are

878
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:08,416
Beating against maybe the Old Guard they are great retailer because they understand the

879
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,184
Data

880
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,792
WeChat certainly understands how people use their services as well and now

881
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:15,840
Honestly we just see the internet is

882
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:16,608
Evolving

883
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,400
From PC to mobile two things

884
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:19,680
So you're getting a 1/2

885
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:23,520
You punch your customers are reducing their shirt and consumer users

886
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:25,824
Also getting access to this amazing

887
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,128
Set of data that they can then use to

888
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,176
Presumably improve their services

889
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:37,344
Yeah that that's right I need a WeChat these are giant, Adela is just to be clear not the only way

890
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,880
That they interact with internet

891
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:41,696
The things they have amazing Engineers we work with

892
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:44,512
They also connect directly to manufacturers

893
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:47,072
But we do provide also pasta

894
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:51,168
How to get a lot of Manufacturers onto their services very quickly and efficiently

895
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,960
And yes then

896
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:55,008
By doing that they

897
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:58,592
And I think where they will be much better than even a company like ala

898
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,432
Come is a WeChat can really understand what consumers want

899
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:03,712
They can aggregate

900
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:05,504
What consumers are doing with all these

901
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,784
Different devices

902
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:09,088
And provide a better and better experience

903
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,904
So you're manufacturing customers

904
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:12,672
Are they can

905
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:15,488
Concerned about that because they're going to get data from their what

906
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:16,256
Appliances

907
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:17,280
Where is

908
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:18,560
Someone like

909
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:19,840
WeChat

910
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:21,120
Can see the whole

911
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:22,400
What's the date at which

912
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:23,680
Presumably has more value

913
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:26,240
And what kind of dynamic does that set up

914
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:27,264
You know I

915
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:32,128
I think it's a good question that they manufacture at least in the case where a Le is there in

916
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:33,152
Infrastructure they get

917
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:34,176
Decide

918
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:35,968
Which data goes up to WeChat

919
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,272
So we have something called role-based access

920
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:39,808
Controlled the manufacturer

921
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:40,832
Who gets to decide

922
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:42,112
By the data point

923
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:44,928
I mean by all that you know that they can have a

924
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,792
An air conditioner gives 50 different date appointments and they can send 11 of them up

925
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:52,352
WeChat but they don't have the capability the realities

926
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:54,656
If you make air conditioners and that's what you do

927
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:55,936
Then you

928
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:57,472
Are not going to have data

929
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:58,240
From

930
00:36:58,496 --> 00:36:59,520
Kitchen appliances

931
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:00,800
Got it

932
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:01,568
Okay

933
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:03,104
Anything else about

934
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:03,872
China

935
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:04,896
The Internet of Things

936
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:08,736
Ala what we believe in what you see is obviously

937
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:10,528
The population here is massive

938
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:13,088
The amount of mobile

939
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:15,392
Users is also massive

940
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,464
China seems to be

941
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,792
We thank in north then say North America in terms of

942
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:25,376
Since it's such a highly mobile population here

943
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:27,424
Creating services

944
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:31,008
Tailored for mobile is

945
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:32,800
Be something they're very good at here

946
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:33,824
That is

947
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:37,920
One reason we spent a lot of time here the other reason is our services for me any facts

948
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:40,480
And you know a lot of manufacturers

949
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:41,248
Weather in China

950
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:44,064
Whether they ship inside China or globally

951
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:45,856

952
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:47,392
