00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:13,824
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham

2
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:16,384
This week I have my lovely co-host

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,152
Kevin tofel

4
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:18,688
He is back with us

5
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:19,712
Hello Kevin

6
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:26,368
Hello hello and I should doing the show with a different set up to them I'm on an iPad using Skype instead of a full

7
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:27,136
Computer

8
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:29,440
So guys make sure you complain

9
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,464
And if you don't like the way cabins

10
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:33,280
I will change anything but we do value your

11
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:35,328
So much that we don't show

12
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:38,656
All right

13
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:39,680
So with that

14
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:41,216
Now that you know how valuable your

15
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:42,496
Feedback is please

16
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:43,520
Keep sending us to Europe

17
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:45,568
Will move right into the show.

18
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:46,336
Because a lot

19
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:47,360
Has happened this

20
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:50,944
This week was just amazing both from the consumer and the

21
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,480
Lookout the developer side

22
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:54,272
Philips Hue launch day new home

23
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,320
Let's talk about that

24
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,088
Nest

25
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:57,856
The

26
00:00:58,112 --> 00:00:58,624
Alphabet

27
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,160
Country formerly known as

28
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:00,928
Google's nest

29
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:03,488
Adjust Nest launched it's weave

30
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:06,048
Platform which is not the same as Google's

31
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:07,072
Of course not

32
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:08,608
They just have the same name

33
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,912
And Amazon

34
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:13,984
Is set to launch its iot cloud

35
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,520
Did Microsoft actually launched

36
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:18,080
So where to stick with big names

37
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:19,360
On the show

38
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:21,408
And we'll see how far we get with all the

39
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,944
So let's start with

40
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,968
My favorite

41
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:25,248
My Bob's

42
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:27,808
The Hue Bridge

43
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,600
So Kevin why don't you tell us

44
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:30,624
Let's run down the Hue Bridge

45
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,160
Well sure there's

46
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:35,744
I went to a ton to tell here it's a brand new Hue Bridge

47
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,024
You have the old one

48
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:40,864
Yours is already updated congratulations still works obviously but

49
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,680
The new one actually is homekit certified

50
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:44,960
It will cost $60

51
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:47,264
If you do have the older

52
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,800
Kubrick's like I do

53
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:49,824
You can

54
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,384
Get the new one at a 33% disk

55
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:53,664
The $40

56
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,456
I believe that this is

57
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:57,248
Either now available or ready for

58
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,528
Order pre-order

59
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:02,624
And the deal on the $40 price tag for previous customers

60
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,208
That's actually a November 1 to December 31 deal so

61
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:08,256
I found that kind of odd I guess they want to get new

62
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:10,048
Customers first with the with unit

63
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:13,120
But the big deal here is yet home kit

64
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,656
Meaning you can say

65
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:15,680
I won't say it

66
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,728
I want to stop iPhones but you can ask

67
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:19,520
Siri to turn on lights

68
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:22,080
Adjust the brightness to colors

69
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:25,408
Turn on multiple lights to receives and so on so that's

70
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:26,944
That is the Q news

71
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:28,992
Stacy I'm kind of

72
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:31,040
Myths that some of these

73
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:31,808
Products

74
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,600
We're going to have homekit

75
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:36,416
And then we all have to re-buy them in a sentence

76
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:37,952
So

77
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,744
Let's hold that thought for a little bit

78
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,024
Because we're going to talk about

79
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,048
Cuz I'm I miss

80
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:45,376
But there's a couple more things we should know about

81
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,656
And that is

82
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:51,008
1 your old Hue bridge is still going to be updated and supported

83
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,032
What software

84
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,312
So if you're

85
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:57,408
Not planning on moving to homekit don't worry you can keep your existing Hue Bridge

86
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:58,432
And

87
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:00,224
That deal did Kevin mention

88
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,016
Jennifer existing Hue Bridge owners

89
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,040
To do one upgrade

90
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:05,088
Spanish while supplies last

91
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:06,368
So November 1st

92
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,904
They want to not wait till

93
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,440
If the middle of December.

94
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,208
Jump On It

95
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:11,232
Jump On It

96
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,512
The other thing is

97
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:13,280
The

98
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,048
Hue Bridge

99
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:15,840
If not only

100
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:20,192
Support homekit it's actually going to support Google's new Nest protocol

101
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:20,960
And

102
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:22,240
It's going to have

103
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,264
Computer inside

104
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:24,544
So

105
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,080
It's worth noting these things

106
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:26,848
Just because

107
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:28,128
This is doing two things

108
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,664
One is updating

109
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:32,224
Kind of for the homekit protocol

110
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,296
But it's also adding a lot more functionality such a

111
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,832
Just kind of that cloud backup

112
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,160
About so some of the commands that you have on your

113
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:43,744
Obviously won't get remote access but some of the scheduling and things like that Uke

114
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,768
Can actually now get

115
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,560
Without going out to the cloud

116
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,584
So Kevin

117
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,376
You might appreciate that

118
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:51,168
The other thing is that

119
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:53,472
You know it's going to support the nest weave protocol

120
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:55,520
We should probably talk about this a little bit

121
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:57,056
That's going to make a lot more sense

122
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,592
Come back and talk about upgrade

123
00:03:59,104 --> 00:03:59,616
Psycho

124
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,664
With that in mind

125
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:02,688
Let's talk about

126
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:04,224
So hear the details

127
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,248
What this is

128
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:09,344
This is not the same thing is Google's we've protocol that they talked about

129
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,112
Who's this summer

130
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:11,904
This is totally

131
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:13,696
Wipro

132
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:16,000
Which is a kind of like

133
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,536
Qualcomm's alljoyn

134
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,559
Device to device

135
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,327
Is protocol

136
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,863
Except it's not sourced

137
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,655
By the way y'all

138
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:26,495
Google is now officially Google and the rest of the company alphabet

139
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:28,287
That happened

140
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:30,079
This is a device device protocol

141
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:36,479
It's got a couple things that works on 64GB of ram so it's design for small sensors in Micro Control

142
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,783
Of all the way up to larger things

143
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,831
It has its own security baked

144
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:43,903
And it is designed for anything that works with nest

145
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,207
So you have to apply to nest

146
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:46,975
To work

147
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:48,767
With this protocol in to get access

148
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,327
Let's do it basically it is a mesh Network

149
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,095
So

150
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:54,143
And it controls like how a device

151
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,423
Can talk to another device

152
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,727
And how a device knows what it is

153
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:58,495
Intuit can talk

154
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,543
System of the security features

155
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,311
AR

156
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:03,615
That because it knows what a device is

157
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:04,639
It also says

158
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,407
What advice

159
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,431
Talk to

160
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,455
So washing machine

161
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:10,271
Example probably will never be able to talk to your door locks

162
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:12,319
Because Nest doesn't really see a great

163
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,087
Use case for the

164
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,367
So that's one of the

165
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,903
I think that's actually really a nice

166
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,975
I do to it at

167
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,767
I think that's a smart approach

168
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:22,047
Although this is

169
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:25,631
Sort of new for the rest of the World by understanding is correct

170
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:30,239
This is what nessa's been using for the past several years and it's just now that they're opening it up

171
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,007
Yes

172
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:33,567
NASA's use this in a thermostat

173
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,335
And it says

174
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,359
Nest protect

175
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,639
Smoke detector

176
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,943
Presumably

177
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:43,551
It also runs over the thread Wireless protocol that nest

178
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,319
Help develop

179
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:46,111
Samsung and smother chip companies

180
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:48,415
So that's kind of where this works

181
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,439
But here's

182
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,207
The Clincher

183
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,487
We've only works

184
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:52,255
In the nest

185
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,791
So what we got now

186
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:57,887
Device-to-device communication protocol and I'm not entirely clear because I have

187
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:00,703
Unseen it nor have I talked to any developers using it yet

188
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,239
How easy the system

189
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:07,103
So I'll join when I talk to developers about all Joe and they're like oh it's so easy diplomat

190
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,895
This couple lines of code you pop it on it

191
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,175
It's time to here

192
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:10,943
I don't really know

193
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,247
So high I be curious to hear about that from

194
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:18,623
People who don't know even though they share the same name as how this is going to work with Google weave

195
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,391
Yeah that's

196
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,415
Nobody knows

197
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:21,951
Message spoof app

198
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:24,255
I don't even know if Google's we even real actual

199
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,095
So that's what we know about that

200
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,631
Do you want to mention the

201
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:30,399
The first product

202
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:31,679
That's going to

203
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:37,567
I know it's not super exciting but yeah what is a partner

204
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:41,151
I guess you could call the works with Nest program now and

205
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:42,175
Don't be using

206
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,711
Nest weave with their

207
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:44,479
Linus

208
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,015
Connected lock which is

209
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,295
Giant

210
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,319
Keypad

211
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,367
It's like a oblong and

212
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,903
Inset different

213
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:55,231
Password combinations for people to get in get out

214
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:55,999
And

215
00:06:56,255 --> 00:07:00,607
LG monitors when the doors open and close see who use the door that's assuming everybody uses differ

216
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:01,375
Passcodes

217
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:07,519
Panda it's interesting but we see this before I just want to make sure cuz it is something that's going to work with Google's

218
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:09,311
I'm sorry with nest

219
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,591
With next week

220
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:11,871
But it won't be out until

221
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,967
And I think partly that's because

222
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:18,271
Going back to see what net said I think

223
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:20,319
You know they made the announcement now

224
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:23,391
They're actually not opening up next week until next year

225
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:25,183
Oh I thought it was just a

226
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,463
I

227
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,999
Do not think so

228
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,535
But I could be

229
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:35,679
Wrong song official Nest blog posters that says we've been using it meaning we've in Nest products for years

230
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:36,959
And next year

231
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:39,007
Will be opening up to everyone who wants to make a K'nex

232
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:40,287
Home Products

233
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,335
So they're kind of pre announcing this week I guess

234
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,615
More with the

235
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,383
The pre-announcement

236
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,151
So

237
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:45,919
What we have

238
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:46,943
Is we have

239
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,015
Weave protocol it's going to compete with things like I'll join

240
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:54,367
It will also compete with homekit because homekit is an application Level

241
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,391
Device to device

242
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,927
Ace Communications and security

243
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,975
And it will also probably

244
00:07:59,231 --> 00:07:59,743
Compete with

245
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,535
Whatever is coming from the ioc if

246
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,071
People are actually using ioc

247
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,351
So we got

248
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,631
A bunch of different ways now

249
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:06,655
Devices

250
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,471
So this is our worldview

251
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:14,079
Now and now we're actually sort of having products now that homekit has actual products

252
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:14,847
Coming out

253
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,895
And I guess next next you will have

254
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:17,919
Weave products

255
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:18,943
Coming out okay

256
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,735
Now we should talk about Philip

257
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,783
Because this is kind of

258
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:23,551
This bridge

259
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:24,319
Is kind of

260
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:26,367
I think the beginning of possibly

261
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,647
A lot of decision making

262
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,927
I think that we're going to have to go through

263
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:29,951
As early adopt

264
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:33,535
People who listen to the show are probably going to so

265
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,863
This weekend I started retrofitting my house for

266
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:37,887
Home Care

267
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,191
And next week we'll be talking about that

268
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:42,239
But I'm kind of looking at this

269
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,007
What I'm like God

270
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,055
Am I going to buy the Philips

271
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,335
Am I going to upgrade my

272
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,615
Guess I have to

273
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,151
It's kind of part of my job

274
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,455
So but I I look at this and I

275
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,735
Not really excited

276
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,271
Plaza

277
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:57,087
I feel like the discount is is good

278
00:08:57,343 --> 00:09:01,183
Right and I feel like telling promising customers that they're going to

279
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:03,487
Support you know the older version

280
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,279
Hopefully for as long as I can

281
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,047
Is good

282
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,071
But I don't

283
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,863
See an end yet

284
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:10,655
To the need to update

285
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,679
Your physical

286
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:12,447
Hardware

287
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,727
Because we haven't

288
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:14,751
Yet achieved

289
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:15,775
Some kind of status

290
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,591
I don't think we got

291
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:21,151
So unless you're willing to like

292
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:21,919
Purchase

293
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,711
And we haven't even achieved like

294
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:25,503
Unification on hubs

295
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,271
You know

296
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:33,439
So I'm worried that if I tell someone gosh you know update your Philips Hue Hub and then you'll be good to go

297
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,207
Really telling them

298
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:35,999
You know spent 40 bucks on

299
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:36,767
40 bucks

300
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:43,167
Sir 60 bucks on this device and you know maybe in two years you're going to have to do it again or maybe I'll just have to buy a router that does

301
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,703
So this hopefully next

302
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:49,311
That's the problem that would work we got His Radio spread out all over the place

303
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:53,663
Personally I don't even want the Hue Hub nothing against the product or the company

304
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,943
It's just I need this

305
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:57,503
Bridge for the specific brand of Lights

306
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:00,319
And yeah I know I control other lights are the two but

307
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:02,623
I can control other lights with other hubs

308
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,927
Get up for me to use my wink with the Q

309
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,463
I still have to have both

310
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:07,999
The wink Hub and

311
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:08,767
Hue Bridge

312
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:09,791
Where is

313
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,327
I can just use the wink Hub with

314
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,863
Pretty much any other line I want

315
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:13,887
It's all

316
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:14,655
Frustrating

317
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,703
I don't want to add more hubs and more

318
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,471
Bridges

319
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:20,031
More radios inside of

320
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,591
Of these things you know it's kind of crazy

321
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,127
So yeah so I'm sitting here thinking

322
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:26,431
Do I stop recommending the Hue Lights

323
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:31,295
Because now I feel like we're still too early in the game you know we've gotten

324
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:34,111
I can't in good conscience now tell you

325
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,927
You're never going to have to update + now you're still stuck

326
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:39,999
I can in good conscience tell someone to go out and buy a house

327
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:44,607
Cuz I feel like if you spend like I can I can in good conscience tell someone to go by $100

328
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:48,959
At least you can control a whole bunch of devices and if you have to go into an update

329
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,239
To another hundred dollar hub

330
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,799
Write because by that time you probably a few

331
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:58,175
If you filled up your home system you probably got you know maybe a dozen different devices that you're controlling with that hub

332
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,967
So you were lying on its own

333
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:00,735
You know so much

334
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:05,087
Just for your life I mean you could say while you're controlling up to 50 like

335
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,623
I'm also a little disappointed

336
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,415
Because the The Bridge update

337
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,951
Still only let you go

338
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:10,975
Control 50 lights

339
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:12,255
Which

340
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,791
That's not it I have more than two

341
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,327
What's in my history

342
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,095
So

343
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:17,119
I'm kind of like

344
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,655
You beat up your husband you

345
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:21,471
So and I'm not try it this has become dealer

346
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:27,615
Let's stop attacking you for a second and let's let's go to something like

347
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:32,735
The ecobee thermostat for example cuz they did did thermostat upgrade to homekit

348
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:37,855
You know what you would just bought a ecobee that wasn't homekit certified was their rationale for

349
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:38,623
Updating

350
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:42,207
And we're about to see a bunch of other homekit products at the market

351
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:47,839
Because they're chip inside there's two legitimate question like there's going to be a homekit enabled Chamberlain Mike

352
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:49,375
And I look at that and I'm like

353
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,143
Crikey

354
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,239
I'm going to have to replace my you know the door sensors going to be fine but there's a

355
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:58,079
The Hub so don't know how did it start 20-30 bucks or whatever it is

356
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:01,151
Yeah and so they're going to have to replace the admin have to replace

357
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:01,919
That

358
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,967
That's actually device I love and use Allah

359
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:04,991
So I'm like

360
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:06,783
Dang it yeah I mean

361
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:09,855
I'm taking the approach of

362
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:12,159
Trying to keep things simple and

363
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:15,999
Control the most or the broadest range of devices with a single

364
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,023
Hub system

365
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,839
I know it's not your favorite but for me right now that's the wink

366
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:22,399
I would consider switching over to SmartThings which

367
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:25,215
Probably will not get homekit support

368
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:26,751
They don't know why they're not

369
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,031
I mean Alex is said that

370
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:28,799
He doesn't like that

371
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:29,567
It's not opening

372
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:36,991
You know what the Mikey was going over to SmartThings eventually and I'm obviously I'm going to test the

373
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:37,759
Homekit

374
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,295
System because that's my job

375
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:40,831
I'm like

376
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:43,647
Yeah my husband has an iPhone I don't

377
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:46,975
I really see no need in my house currently I'm like

378
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:49,023
What's the best way to go cuz

379
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,559
I really don't want to update on my device

380
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,839
Say the other thing

381
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:54,399
Chairs that kind of comes to play at least for me is

382
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,703
Google can I can live without homekit and saying

383
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,519
Siri do this do that because I'm already telling

384
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:01,055
My Amazon Echo to do those things

385
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:03,103
Right but you can't tell the Amazon Echo Dot

386
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,663
Garage garage

387
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,431
He could now

388
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:08,479
I cannot tell the Amazon

389
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,503
Echo

390
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,527
So Chamberlain

391
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,295
MyQ

392
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,575
Is connected through the

393
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,111
But Amazon

394
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,135
Echo Dot

395
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:17,183
They don't support you okay so

396
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,719
Right so coraggio

397
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:25,119
I said I oh but garageio actually does now as of this week have Amazon Echo support so the more things that glom onto that please

398
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,911
Deco for for boys

399
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:27,679
I'm fine with that

400
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:28,703
Okay

401
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,519
We'll see so maybe we'll get some and I should note

402
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:33,311
Because they send me emails all the

403
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:34,335
Ivy

404
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,103
Which

405
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,639
I have not tested

406
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:39,455
But was an early voice activated

407
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,735
Many many moons ago

408
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:43,039
They've actually launched in 99 dollar

409
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,319
Competitor the echo

410
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:46,111
Poet ivivi

411
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,391
So it's a

412
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,671
Kickstarter Indiegogo

413
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,719
Eucerin Indiegogo

414
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:52,767
Ivy has launched an Indiegogo

415
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:53,535
And there

416
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,815
Trying to raise money

417
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:57,375
The pre-order it for $99 and it's

418
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:59,167
It's kind of like an Amazon

419
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:01,471
Echo type device for this with thing

420
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:07,871
I haven't tried it but it let you control your nest it does let you get Spotify which I'm kind of intrigued by

421
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:14,271
But I don't know if I purchase it only worth looking at if you're interested thing it works with Hewitt with Lowe's Iris it works with SmartThings

422
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,551
So that is

423
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:19,391
Yeah I remember when they first announced that it was probably two or three years ago

424
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:22,207
It's taking awhile to get things moving here but

425
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,231
Well this is a new one

426
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,023
So the other IV was a

427
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,303
Smart Alarm

428
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,119
So this this is a new

429
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,143
Version of ivy

430
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,167
Iv2

431
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:31,935
It's kind of

432
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,215
I don't know if

433
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,823
Yes baby too it looks

434
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,103
Kind of I don't know how to do

435
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:40,383
Looks like a microphone

436
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,151
Phone stand without

437
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:44,735
You're smaller than the echo I mean it definitely smaller

438
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:45,759
House speaker

439
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,855
Yeah I mean it's a

440
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:52,415
Lesser price Amazon Echo like device

441
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,207
I don't think it's going to happen

442
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:57,535
Broadest ecosystem available to its setting when compared to the echo

443
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,839
Probably not but you know

444
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,119
For now it's got

445
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,399
The same sort of

446
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:04,191
Send a lot of the big

447
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,215
Programs like nest

448
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:11,615
Austin smart things are actually and even that cold makes their ecosystem open so if you're a small developer you can just

449
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,895
Just throw your resources at the

450
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:15,455
Those those companies to make your stuff work with it

451
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:17,759
So that's it let's move on to

452
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:19,039
What kind of sunless

453
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:23,647
Tell me Focus stuff and more kind of developer oriented in big kind of brand

454
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:25,439
Cloud. Which is

455
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,975
At AWS

456
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:30,047
Reinvent the Amazon web services,

457
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,327
It announced

458
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,375
A iot service

459
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,911
Stuntin done

460
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:35,935
Is joining

461
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:38,495
Microsoft and IBM

462
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:39,775
And Salesforce and

463
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:40,799
Send a Lot ad

464
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:41,823
African fan

465
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,871
Julian other companies in launching

466
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:46,175
Basically an SDK

467
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,199
And kids

468
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:50,783
That will allow a developer directly to their cloud

469
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:51,551
And

470
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:55,903
The cloud platform that Amazon is offering is built on its acquisition of telemetry

471
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:01,023
From back in March which is the mobile kind of device management and monitoring side and

472
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,839
A data analytics platform that Amazon is building

473
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:04,607
Called Space Needle

474
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,887
So

475
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,167
This is a little bit

476
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:09,727
Pre-entry because we're recording this on Tuesday and

477
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:11,775
Amazon is expected to announce this on

478
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:12,799
Thursday

479
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:13,567
But

480
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:15,359
We've got it on pretty good authority

481
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:17,407
But all this is happening because we haven't

482
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,687
New season

483
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:25,087
Memos that Amazon sent out partner soups

484
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:28,415
So I'm curious to see what the impact is for them

485
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,951
Because more interesting

486
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:30,975
I think

487
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:32,511
So aw is had to do

488
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:35,327
Because you know everybody and their dog has

489
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:36,863
McLeod play for

490
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:37,631
Iot

491
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:43,007
But more interesting lie is so many of the connected services today already hosted on a

492
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:44,799
So

493
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:47,103
You know Alice Petsense yeah

494
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:49,407
So ala electric imp

495
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,175
And

496
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:51,711
Particle which used to be

497
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:54,271
Spark actually offer kind of development

498
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,039
Kits

499
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:58,111
And cloud services which is exactly what Amazon is

500
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:58,879
What kind of building in

501
00:16:59,135 --> 00:16:59,903
I'm putting together here

502
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:03,487
So these companies all offer that but they host their Cloud portion of that

503
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:04,767
On AWS

504
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,303
So in a way

505
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,863
You know Amazon's kind of cutting into their business

506
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,399
But most of them

507
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:14,239
Aren't credibly worried because they're like you know we're already acting as a system

508
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,519
Integrator for our customers

509
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:17,311
Some of the stuff we offer

510
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,079
Is

511
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:20,383
You know we offer some Amazon stuff we

512
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:24,223
Pulling some other stuff that Amazon doesn't offer for our clients so hopefully

513
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:27,039
I'll stick with us there they're pretty nonchalant about it

514
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:27,807
If your smoker

515
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:32,671
That'll be the dead horse but I think wink is an AWS customer

516
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:35,999
Swing hesitated because they went down

517
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:36,767
Yeah

518
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:39,327
Dropcam used to be a huge AWS

519
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:42,655
Customer I don't know if they've moved yet over to Google but

520
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:43,935
I would imagine movie

521
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:46,239
I don't know because the last time I checked into

522
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,007
This was about

523
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:48,031
6 months ago

524
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:48,799
They had

525
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:50,335
It's a pretty big operation

526
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:53,407
Because they react built for AWS

527
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,943
It's a pretty big operation

528
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:55,711
Pictures of all of your info

529
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:58,527
Moving a cloud it's not easy

530
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,367
Exactly they're not as vaporous and light as you might think

531
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,135
So

532
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,415
With that

533
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:07,999
That's kind of some of the big news happening in the cloud this week

534
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:10,815
You guys should stay tuned because we are talking

535
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,351
With Alexandra

536
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,119

Who is the creator of The Goodnight Lane

539
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:17,471
Camp and she and I are talking

540
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:18,495
About actually

541
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:19,519
Consumerism

542
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,799
And The Internet of Things

543
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:23,615
Said how this is leading us to buy more stuff

544
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:25,663
Maybe not a sustainable stuff

545
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,479
And what we can probably do about that for hubs

546
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:33,855
More hugs yes that is actually we we talked about Phillips so please stay tuned

547
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:44,863

00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:13,791
We have to live up to expectations otherwise people will be at confused and actually want to live here

559
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:15,071
And then they'll be more of us

560
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,911
No wonder you guys got the

561
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:23,007
What was it the umbrella that tells you when it's whatever lights up when it's about to rain

562
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:25,823
People that came out of a London design firm

563
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:28,639
You're right I think it was California actually

564
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:30,431
Nuts

565
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:33,247
Which is also why it makes so little sense

566
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,527
Because in California

567
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:36,063
In England and it would make no sense

568
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:40,415
Because you need it all the time where is in California it actually would make sense

569
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:43,743
Because it's you know something you need to really be reminded of

570
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:44,511
There you go

571
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:46,815
Just have a glowing umbrella

572
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,143
Okay so

573
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:52,191
I brush and the podcast here be

574
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:52,959
Because

575
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:55,007
Actually been on the podcast before

576
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:55,775
To talk about

577
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:58,079
A product that you've designed how the good night lamp

578
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,615
And you should probably

579
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:00,383
Briefly tell

580
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:01,919
People with a good night lamp is

581
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:03,967
Just established that you know what you're talking about

582
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:04,991
So

583
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,015
Why don't you

584
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:06,783
Do that now

585
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:10,879
So the goodnight lamp is a family of internet-connected lamps

586
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:12,415
Big lamp Little lamp

587
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,951
You give the little ants away

588
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:15,487
To anybody around the world

589
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:17,279
And when you turn the big lamp on the

590
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,303
Once turn on

591
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,351
And the idea is very simple is

592
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:24,447
It's a very simple way of saying I'm around right now and I'm available

593
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:27,519
So when you have family members in different time zones

594
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:32,383
You're dating someone in another country or your grandmother lives on her own

595
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:34,431
It's just a simple way of knowing

596
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,199
The people are around

597
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,991
And I

598
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,271
I have been working on this

599
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:39,295
For 10 years now

600
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,063
And

601
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,343
Now on sale

602
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,111
In the UK

603
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,135
Are you going

604
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:48,255
I know it's been a long journey I've always liked this concept because it's kind of like an ion status message

605
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:52,863
Search in the real world for people who maybe aren't great at I am status

606
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,911
Yeah and I think

607
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:57,727
People also would probably people 10 years

608
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:59,263
Younger than both of us

609
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:02,591
Struggled even know what an ion status message is but

610
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:03,359
I think

611
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:08,223
The way mature people can't explain it is also kind of us a bat signal or

612
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:09,759
Facebook

613
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:11,807
Online or offline status

614
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:14,367
Made made RioLearn

615
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:18,464
Major physical and I like that I like that people can always

616
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,048
Pics of technology that they associated with this idea of them

617
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:24,096
The most closely and it means that

618
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,376
Even after 10 years

619
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:27,424
Do something people get rich

620
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,728
So we're not here to talk

621
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:30,752
Which is

622
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:31,520
Kind of a shame

623
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:32,288
Because I really love

624
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:35,360
We're actually here because you went on

625
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:37,408
You were quoted in a website

626
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:38,944
I think

627
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:44,832
You called it like a real estate blog which I'm kind of like oh okay is part of their maker Monday serious

628
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:45,856
Talking about

629
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:47,136
The Internet of Things

630
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:50,208
And you talked about how we're going to be buying the internet

631
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,768
And this is something I've been thinking about a lot

632
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:53,536
So

633
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:55,328
I wanted to talk to you about

634
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,864
How are we going to be

635
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,632
Buying

636
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:05,312
I wasn't in a particularly I think you know feisty mood the day they interviewed me

637
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,336
I guess

638
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:09,408
The Sting I'm really wondering about

639
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:16,320
10 years into a career talking about the internet of things and seeing other people do the same

640
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:19,392
And Building Things and making things is

641
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:22,464
I worry a little bit about

642
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:26,816
With which we can now make things into the world

643
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:28,864
In a way

644
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,912
How little people care about things

645
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:35,008
Now I think that's our appetite for physical

646
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:35,776
Products

647
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,056
Has increased

648
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:39,616
Tenfold and we certainly

649
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:45,760
Don't care about them as much as we used to I think there's maybe a very small number products that we

650
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:49,344
We could consider pulling from the fire if our house was on fire

651
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:51,648
And I think that number of

652
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,184
Products is probably

653
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,464
Very slim now

654
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:57,792
If you'd asked people what they might buy for

655
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:58,816
Christmas Bell have a

656
00:22:59,072 --> 00:22:59,584
Particular

657
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,864
Idea and

658
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,888
We're trying to

659
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:05,216
Cater to that I think I'm making connected things and work

660
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:06,240
Trying to connect

661
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:07,264
To a world

662
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:09,824
It really likes to buy things

663
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:16,736
And I'm not sure that's a reason enough to actually build things but I think that's the reason that people are using in order to be

664
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:23,136
Building in this interview you said that the iot will be a mechanism for people to take electronics into a space that's new

665
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:29,792
In order to keep up with the hype of consumerism that we've been experiencing since the end of the second World War

666
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:32,864
I think of it as kind of this mentality of

667
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:34,656
You know put a chip in it

668
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:36,192
And will charge you know

669
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:38,240
10x the price or maybe it's

670
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:39,520
Only three or four

671
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,288
Surprise

672
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:43,104
And I look it even what I've done in the last

673
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:43,872
Couple of years

674
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:44,640
Switches

675
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:45,408
You know I've

676
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:48,224
I spent $500 replacing to thermos

677
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:50,272
And I've gotten a lot of value

678
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:51,552
That's what I'm not

679
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:52,320
The first to do

680
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:53,344
But

681
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:54,624
When I

682
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,952
I did that a couple years ago and now the next generation of those

683
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:02,048
Suddenly I'm faced with the fact that I have put Hardware

684
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,120
Connected Hardware on my wall that's going to be supported

685
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,656
But it's also

686
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:09,472
Dunes kind of an obsolescence cycle

687
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:11,264
I'm kind of like

688
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,032
Man

689
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:16,640
I really just do that because I don't know if in five or six years I'm going to really

690
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:18,688
Want to replace my thermostats again

691
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,248
Especially at 250 bucks a pop

692
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,320
Yeah it worse is they used to be Things That No One

693
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,344
Really replace

694
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,184
You know you you wouldn't even install your own thermostat

695
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:32,000
It's actually illegal in the UK to do that

696
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:37,120
Did these desert infrastructural products that we're just that they were infrastructure

697
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:38,656
Where is now they've become

698
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:39,424
Consumer

699
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:43,008
And they become part of the consumer landscape

700
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,544
Desire

701
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,360
And sales and Edom

702
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:49,920
It is that planned off the obsolescence of

703
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:50,688
People have

704
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:54,272
Worked out in the car industry and worked out in

705
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,552
Turn the fashion in

706
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:59,392
And now we're working that out for everyday products

707
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,928
Which is the

708
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:01,696
Problematic

709
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:03,232
Do you think it's

710
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:06,304
Is nefariousness planned obsolescence or do you think

711
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,840
It's really value I mean

712
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:09,888
Do you think we're getting value-add

713
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:11,424
I mean I would argue that

714
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,240
A nest thermostat on an ecobee thermostat does

715
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:15,264
Offer

716
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,056
You know significant power saving

717
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:19,872
Yes and no in Chinese

718
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:23,712
You know it could be interesting to kind of look at whether

719
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:24,992
You will have

720
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:27,040
Received 250

721
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,832
Dollars worth of savings

722
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:32,416
In how long in between replacing it again

723
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:34,208
And then having the Next Generation

724
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:35,744
Timeout I think the

725
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,536
Every two to five years

726
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:39,328
Kind of okay I suppose

727
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:44,192
But I kind of apple style upgrade of every 6 months is a new thing

728
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:44,960
I think it's

729
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:48,032
Just really really aggressive consumerism

730
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:48,800
And

731
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:51,104
If you have made a product

732
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,128
Well enough

733
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,152
2

734
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:54,432
Provide value

735
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:55,200
For your quest

736
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:58,016
I think your first customers should always be the ones

737
00:25:58,272 --> 00:25:58,784
State you

738
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,320
Really cherish the most

739
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:02,624
Supposed to make them feel like they're

740
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,648
Lefton

741
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:06,720
Stranded because they happen to have the older version

742
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:07,744
I don't

743
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,048
Thanks that we necessarily know how to

744
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:11,584
Buildings in that way

745
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,608
I'm really

746
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:13,632
Generally kind of

747
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:14,400
Pretty

748
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,168
Intrigued

749
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:16,192
Spy

750
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:17,216
2 Cycles

751
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:19,264
Switch very well-funded

752
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,544
Iot company

753
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:23,872
So I'm calling startups when they have millions and BC

754
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:25,920
Iot companies are

755
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:27,456
Expecting to grow

756
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:30,272
Because I think that the pressure is on them

757
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,040
Really

758
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:32,064
Show

759
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,856
Aggressive sale increases

760
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:39,744
And the only real way to do that is to imitate the Apple model even when not a relationship

761
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,536
Ever develop with a

762
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:42,816
A thermostat but

763
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:43,584
You know

764
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,608
Let's go let's

765
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:45,376
Triad

766
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:46,912
Let's try to make it feel like

767
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:53,312
Consumer product just like any other consumer product that we have just like our phones have contracts and our laptop

768
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,336
Dogs get old and

769
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:56,896
Let's just do all that stuff away and replace

770
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:57,920
Well there's a

771
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:59,456
Whole bunch therapist

772
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,480
What kind of impact

773
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:02,528
First of all I think 2 to 5 years

774
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:03,552
For thermostat is

775
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:06,880
Well I I would prefer it to be tender

776
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:07,904
15 but

777
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:13,024
I think that if you told a company that is has told their shareholders

778
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,840
That they are going to have a hockey stick graph and

779
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:16,864
Terms of sales

780
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:19,424
And they will realize how

781
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,704
Smaller Market is

782
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,984
And then

783
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,312
Just aggressively sound to that same Market over and over again

784
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,360
Okay I see like

785
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:29,152
If you think about it thermostat

786
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:31,968
So if you look at nest with popular example right

787
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:33,760
Set Nest Thermostat

788
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:35,296
Looking at maybe

789
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:36,320
15 year

790
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:38,624
Replacement cycle on a thermostat seems

791
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,904
Kind of reasonable

792
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:44,768
Maybe with the protect smoke detectors have like a mandated life on them

793
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,328
Permasense our perspective so it's about

794
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:48,352
I think seven years

795
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:51,680
You're so five to seven years on that and then you got cameras

796
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:54,496
There you've got an opportunity

797
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:57,056
I feel like cameras you probably don't replace

798
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,640
Is that a 5-year thing I'm curious what the numbers were

799
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:01,920
Could be on a replacement site

800
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,224
And then you could always come

801
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:04,992
Gets people to add

802
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:07,808
So maybe your strategy for hockey

803
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:09,088
Growth is a

804
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:12,416
Maybe you're not a one device company maybe you become

805
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:13,184
Multi-Device

806
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:14,464
Company with different

807
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:16,512
Cycle so that's one strata

808
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:17,792
Product for

809
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,376
But then there's this idea of the electronics themselves

810
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:22,400
Because

811
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:24,960
Most of these companies will have a Services Drive

812
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:28,032
And those services are going to increase in

813
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,568
Computing or

814
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,152
Maybe different radios all kinds of different things over time is

815
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:34,432
The environment changes

816
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:36,480
Infermon Electronics perspective

817
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:38,784
You know I think every two years

818
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:42,112
It's kind of not crazy to think you're going to want to update the hardware

819
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:43,904
Where and I don't know is a hardware person

820
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:46,464
Dealt with that even in your own product

821
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,768
What are your thoughts about kind of

822
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,304
How to handle some

823
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:57,216
Well I think what brought me to this conclusion to begin with is work to

824
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:58,752
This line of thinking too

825
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:00,544
What is the realization

826
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,592
10 years ago there were things that

827
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:04,640
Wyndham tee product design

828
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:06,176
Sphere people were discussing

829
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:08,480
Got completely dropped

830
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:10,784
Partly I suppose

831
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,880
Juju iPhone coming in and things like that but

832
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:17,184
People used to talk about design for disa

833
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:17,952
Assembly

834
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:20,000
Cradle to cradle

835
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:21,536
And things like that and

836
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:22,304
Concept

837
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,072
Spell applied

838
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:27,424
Two looking at the products that you were making in a way that made it

839
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,728
Easy to disassemble take apart

840
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:31,520
Replace the right piece except

841
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:33,824
When you're talking about a product

842
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:35,616
Where the casing

843
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,712
Could be at the electronics could be replaced and upgraded

844
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:41,760
The tendency for Mom

845
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:44,576
The product company now is not to say

846
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:48,160
Will you can send us back the old one will replace the guts

847
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:50,464
For the new with the new tag

848
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:51,488
And we'll

849
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:53,024
Just give you back at one

850
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,048
It's not even an option

851
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:55,584
So

852
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:58,144
Your you know whatever upgrades

853
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,960
You might need to do from a hardware perspective

854
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:01,984
I think

855
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:07,616
If you're doing a good job you should be planning for your Hardware at that last

856
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:09,152
Longer than

857
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:15,552
The software upgrades that you need to do which you know will need to happen firmware updates things like that you've talked about

858
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:21,952
This concept of owning the customer relationship and who has the responsibility for owning that relay

859
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:22,720
Relationship

860
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:26,560
Can you talk a little bit more about what that will mean for

861
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:28,352
Connective life cycle of a

862
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:29,120
Prada

863
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:30,912
And how you think about designing

864
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:32,192
And also

865
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:33,216
Does that mean that

866
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:39,104
Models like Tesla's where they actually own the customer relationship start to make

867
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:39,872
More sense

868
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:41,664
Yeah I think I have

869
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,480
Having a relationship with customers directly when you

870
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:45,248
Spelling

871
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,272
Very high-end

872
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,040
Cars made

873
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:48,064
Text a huge amount

874
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:51,904
You're building a relationship with someone you're really cares about what you're doing

875
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:55,232
And the luxury Market really knows how to do that

876
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:57,536
If you want to buy from

877
00:30:57,792 --> 00:31:01,632
Chicken luxury Brands you can only really buy from them they don't really do stalkers

878
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:04,192
They Don't Really deal with anybody else

879
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:06,752
And certainly for a long time even Apple

880
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:08,544
Don't have that they were you know there was

881
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,336
A very small presence

882
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,104
Reseller

883
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:12,384
Stool is really

884
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,688
Stores in their own brand

885
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:16,736
It's more easy to find apus

886
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:17,504
Products now

887
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,528
Elsewhere

888
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:22,112
The ownership of that relationship is one that I think

889
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:23,136
2

890
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:24,672
Little attention is your tooth

891
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:26,464
Put on when you're talking about

892
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,512
Consumerism because really

893
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:31,328
Brands of most

894
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:34,912
Products hoping you never call them back when you

895
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:36,192
I need to dispose of

896
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:36,960
Something

897
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:41,824
They put that responsibility onto the recycling services that cities

898
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:42,848
Will have

899
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:43,872
Certifier

900
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:47,200
And the responsibilities always someone else's responsibility

901
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:48,224
Ability but

902
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,248
I think

903
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:53,088
And this is sort of what kicked off this whole line of thinking which led

904
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:54,880
How to talk I gave

905
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:56,928
Two stalks I gave and then this article

906
00:31:57,184 --> 00:32:01,280
It's going to be I think as of this year it's illegal in New York to

907
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:03,328
Throwaway electronic gadgets

908
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,888
Until we're kind of entering a world where

909
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:11,008
End-of-life and every single little thing that might have been free once is

910
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,568
Actually not free because it has huge

911
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:14,592
Impacted

912
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,432
And I think that we are aware of how much impact

913
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,456
We can have when we work

914
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:21,760
Technology how much the web has changed

915
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:22,528
The way

916
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:24,832
People interact with the things that they love

917
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:28,160
And I think that we should have that same

918
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:30,464
Sense of responsibility and ethics

919
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,232
In

920
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:32,000
Product

921
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:33,536
And Design

922
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:34,560
Products assertive

923
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:36,096
Traditional industrial design

924
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:38,144
Sort of has been baked in

925
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:39,168
But

926
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:40,192
A lot of iot

927
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:41,216
Startups or not

928
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:43,008
Traditional industrial designer

929
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,032
So

930
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:46,848
It's a whole new population

931
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:48,896
People that needs to be told about

932
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:50,688
Basic environmental print

933
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:53,504
Okay and so outside of the

934
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:58,368
Let's get back into this kind of idea of how people might buy

935
00:32:58,624 --> 00:32:59,392
Kind of connected

936
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:01,952
Gadgets over time because

937
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:03,232
I have kind of

938
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:05,280
I don't know if it's a frustration or its

939
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:07,072
It's kind of all just using example

940
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,400
Philips just let earlier this week actually

941
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:12,704
Talked about how it just announced

942
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,240
An upgraded hub

943
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:17,312
For homekit and kind of the new Nest weave

944
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:18,080
Protocol

945
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:20,128
Sell Philips Hue Lights have a

946
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:22,176
Do they have a bridge

947
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:22,944
So

948
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:23,712
All of your

949
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:24,736
Philips Hue Lights

950
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:30,624
Continue to work with your existing bridge if you have it but if you want it to work with homekit you're going to have to upgrade to

951
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,392
To this

952
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:32,928
Newbridge and

953
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:38,048
It's a $60 the new bridge is $60 or it comes down to about 40 bucks if

954
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:39,584
If you are an existing

955
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:41,376
Philips Hue owner

956
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:42,144
So

957
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,960
And I'm kind of curious because I'm an existing Phillips

958
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:45,728
What's yuan

959
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:46,496
And

960
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:48,032
I'm very glad that they're go

961
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:49,824
Continue supporting my old bridge

962
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:53,152
But I'm also kind of like and appreciate the discount

963
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:53,920
Upgrade

964
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:56,480
And I understand that there's a hardware

965
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:58,272
Upgrade required to get to

966
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:01,600
What is an early adopter I'm also

967
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:03,904
Gosh dang it y'all

968
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:06,976
Now I got to go out and spend 40 bucks on a brand new bridge

969
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:13,120
When there's a new standard coming out of my got going to have to get a 2 years from now spend another $40 when does this

970
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:13,888
Send

971
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:15,168
What kind of products

972
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:16,960
Make sense to do this for

973
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:19,264
Do I have to upgrade everything in my house cuz you know

974
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:24,640
Earlier this summer I was going to have to if I wanted a home kit in my ecobee thermostat has to have to buy a brain

975
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,408
Thermostat

976
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:27,456
So

977
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:30,016
I don't know I am kind of feeling a little

978
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:32,320
I don't know early adopters commonly face

979
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:36,160
What's with the Internet of Things it feels like it's still so unfinished

980
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:37,696
I don't even know what to tell people

981
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:40,256
Yeah yeah I think

982
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:43,072
We're going to suffer from kind of Bridge Creek

983
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:44,352
Really really

984
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:47,168
Especially for things that really

985
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:49,472
Are perfectly fine on their own

986
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:51,520
Really when you think about it because

987
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:53,312
Having a bridge for your light bulbs

988
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:54,848
Raise

989
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:57,664
Having a bridge for like a very important piece of

990
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,968
Computer only having a router for

991
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:01,504
Your computer makes sense

992
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:04,320
But yeah kind of mini bridges for everybody

993
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:05,856
Interoperability needs

994
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:06,880
Is

995
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:10,208
Probably you know something that will eventually decide

996
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:13,024
Disappear when they just start making better

997
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,328
Amor multitek

998
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:16,096
Routers

999
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:17,888
But before we get there in

1000
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:21,472
Before Cisco decides to build such things at an affordable price

1001
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,008
To wait and have

1002
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,032
Languages

1003
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:26,592
I do think that early adopters

1004
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:30,176
We're in the phase and we're going to do the face in the face of

1005
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:34,528
Early adoption for a long time with iot I don't think that we

1006
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:35,808
Are going to

1007
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:36,576
See

1008
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:37,600
Mask

1009
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:40,672
Consumer appeal and in these ideas

1010
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:43,744
Until they really feel very excessive

1011
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:45,536
I think people are starting to

1012
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:48,864
How to build a vocabulary around them and just in the way that

1013
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,144
10 years ago when I was

1014
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,960
I was presenting the good night lamp people used to tell me

1015
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:55,008
Is that the time it was a wifiber

1016
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:57,312
People used to tell me oh Wi-Fi

1017
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:58,848
Doesn't that fry your brain

1018
00:35:59,360 --> 00:35:59,872
And

1019
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:00,896
That's just

1020
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:03,200
Change in society and

1021
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:03,968
Constant

1022
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:04,736
Inconstant

1023
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:07,552
Education on the part of the text

1024
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:08,576
With respect

1025
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:10,368
To the benefits rather than the pitfall

1026
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,648
And

1027
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:14,720
I have no idea whether Wi-Fi fries my brain but I've stopped caring about

1028
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:16,000
Answer to

1029
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:17,024
The job was done

1030
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:17,792
Adequately

1031
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:18,816
And I think that

1032
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:22,144
With iot we're going at we're talking about so many different

1033
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:23,168
Competing

1034
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:23,936
Technologies

1035
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:25,984
That people will

1036
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,312
By the end-user application that they find is interested

1037
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,104
And then realized

1038
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:31,872
Stats

1039
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:34,176
Something that they will have to

1040
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:34,944
To suffer for

1041
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:36,992
Because they got into

1042
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:37,760
Just did a little

1043
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:38,528
Kitsune

1044
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:41,600
I don't think I can

1045
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,416
Traditional product design work

1046
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:45,184
Flatware

1047
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,720
If you bought something

1048
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:48,256
40 years ago cancer

1049
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:49,024
This were

1050
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,560
Dad yes they might be in

1051
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:55,424
And you were more interesting version made out of a better plastic later on

1052
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:59,008
But you didn't feel cheated by the first version if anything

1053
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:03,104
Dad gained a bit more Authority because it was the first version

1054
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:04,640
And I don't think that we've

1055
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:05,920
Managed

1056
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:06,688
Tudo Certo

1057
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:08,480
Vintage iot

1058
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:14,368
Simply because things are really just stopped working entirely I mean I have an Avast text somewhere in a box

1059
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:18,720
Exposed it in my office for a little too long to

1060
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:21,280
Sons of the Plastics really turned

1061
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:22,048
Colors

1062
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:23,584
And you know I should have sent

1063
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,400
It hasn't even aged

1064
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:27,680
Well as a product

1065
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:28,704
Never mind as a

1066
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,472
Connected

1067
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:31,008
So

1068
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:32,032
Yeah I think we'll

1069
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:33,568
Will definitely still suffer

1070
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:35,616
A little while

1071
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:37,152
Will BVM canaries in

1072
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:39,712
Buy what you like

1073
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:40,480
But you will suffer

1074
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:44,832
A wonderfully Grim way to end the conversation

1075
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:45,856
And this podcast

1076
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:47,648
