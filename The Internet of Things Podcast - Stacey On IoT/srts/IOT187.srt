Let

39

Dot IO

40
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,824
Hey Kevin

41
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,848
I'm sick

42
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:51,616
Today so

43
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:53,664
What's going to happen on this show

44
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,432
Feels like

45
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:55,712
Anything Could Happen

46
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:56,736
But

47
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:57,760
Shake It Off

48
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:59,040
With North

49
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:00,576
This was surprising this

50
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:02,624
Happened super fast we talked

51
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,648
I believe last week

52
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:04,672
Weak about the maker

53
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:08,512
The myo armband which was a gesture-based armband

54
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:09,536
Deciding to

55
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:10,304
To kill that

56
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:11,328
And

57
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,144
Start something new but we had no idea what the new thing is

58
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:15,680
And now we do

59
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,216
The company that made the Maya

60
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:18,496
Armband

61
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:21,312
What has changed its name it is now known as

62
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:22,080
North

63
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,360
Which kind of makes sense

64
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:26,432
Canada and it now has launched a new Prada

65
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:27,712
Cold vocals

66
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:28,736
And Kevin

67
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:29,760
What are Focus

68
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:36,160
Coco's are glasses coming from North and this is good because now they have three more pivot Points if they want to change the

69
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,208
Secondary name is east south or west

70
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,488
If this doesn't work out

71
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:40,256
Vocals

72
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,536
Air smart glasses

73
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:46,400
They're not cheap at $999 you will be able to get them in

74
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,168
A North

75
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:50,240
Store they're building one in Brooklyn New York

76
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:52,800
Right now

77
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,592
Of course they are

78
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:59,456
So soon you'll be able to go to Brooklyn and get measured up because you do have to get

79
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:02,016
Connect scan your head has to be scanned for proper

80
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:05,600
What's different about these glasses say then

81
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:07,136
Google Glass for example

82
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:10,976
But I still have don't use them there's no camera here or anything like that

83
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,256
These look like

84
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:15,328
What they look like the glasses that I wear today just kind of

85
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:19,168
Hipster looking glasses and to the right side

86
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:21,216
Of glasses hidden from anybody

87
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:23,776
Who's looking at you is a small projector

88
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:27,104
And what the projector does is it bounces information

89
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,128
Off of

90
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:31,968
A spot on the lens right onto your retina

91
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,040
Like fun and that's this is not the first product

92
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:41,184
To do that I forget who maybe it's Intel has a similar technology until does they started a smart classes

93
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,464
Unit called vaunt

94
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,000
And then promptly shut it down

95
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:48,096
Oh I was going to say perhaps North is using the until technology but

96
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,144
Qualcomm Tech

97
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:55,776
Really interesting all right so what can you do with these things for a thousand bucks

98
00:03:56,032 --> 00:04:01,664
Honestly you can't do much but you can get some information which I think is actually a good thing

99
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:07,552
I'm all about context give me the right information in the right place at the right time and making it so that it's not

100
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:08,320
Disruptive

101
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:12,928
So if I'm having a conversation I don't want to be like look at my phone every five seconds from new information

102
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,976
You don't have to do with vocals

103
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,768
300 by 300 pixels

104
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:20,863
Viewing area is 15 degree viewing area

105
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:21,887
And

106
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:23,935
You can view messages you

107
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:29,311
Can send automated responses to messages you can call an Uber you can also get Turnpike

108
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:35,711
Turn directions to your calendar check the weather and I presume more functionality will come to these but the point is

109
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:36,479
These are not

110
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,271
Highly intensive things

111
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:40,575
That is giving you or letting you do

112
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:42,367
What I thought was really cool

113
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:43,903
Because I'm crazy

114
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:50,303
Is you can actually see information like a text or get your turn by turn directions but you can also then talk to

115
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,351
And say

116
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,887
Respond to Charlie

117
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:54,655
You know and

118
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:55,935
Charlie I'm running late

119
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,727
So I actually thought that was

120
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,519
Not only are you getting basically at

121
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,055
Tiny personalized screen

122
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,847
You can also interact

123
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:05,919
Yes I was actually surprised to see

124
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:08,735
The matinee integration quite honestly and I think

125
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:14,367
It's really smart rather than North creating their whole own special interface or

126
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:16,671
Assistant or anything like that it just makes sense

127
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:19,231
To integrate with something that's good and already exist

128
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:22,303
I thought you were going to say that you were really intrigued by the little

129
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:25,119
Accessory that comes with it did you see the loop

130
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,399
I did not know I did

131
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,679
Machida Loop yes that is

132
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:33,567
Yes Loop is I got plastic ring with a joystick button looks like a regular smart ring they might

133
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,335
Benefind

134
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,359
It may be from

135
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:37,663
Motive or somebody like that yes motive

136
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:44,063
We just added an NFC authentication chip to theirs but that's only the story you can use the little joystick on the rink s wipes

137
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:48,927
Through the interface on your classes so it's not like you have to again with Google Glass sound like you have to

138
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,719
Touch the glasses to do anything

139
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:57,119
You know I had to cancel a swipe the side of my head and I think I put a dent in my hairline there by doing that so much so

140
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:01,215
This is really really cool matinee integration also makes sense for another reason

141
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:06,335
Amazon actually was a lead investor in the series B funding for North

142
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,359
Yes

143
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:16,319
These look pretty interesting to me I don't have $1,000 to get this I don't think I

144
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:22,719
1% and its current state because I wear Smartwatch and not generally does the same stuff plus more but I'll

145
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:26,303
Lakers are going and I would do it if they had so here's

146
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,607
A lot of people are like oh got $1,000

147
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:29,631
That's crazy for glasses

148
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:32,447
I'm going to out myself right now I don't buy a lot of

149
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:35,007
Jewelry but I do spend a crazy amount of

150
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:36,799
Glasses

151
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:39,359
Because I love like really unique and

152
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:41,151
Frames and sometimes those are

153
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:41,919
More expensive

154
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:42,687
So

155
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,735
Well I have spent $1,000 on a

156
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,015
Pair of frames

157
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,807
Are my glasses they look awesome

158
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:48,831
They have actually

159
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,111
Are big sunglasses that have

160
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:52,159
Swarovski crystals in them it's

161
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,183
But

162
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:56,767
These are not those glasses these do not look as cool as I would want them

163
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,071
$1,000 so that's just me

164
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:02,655
And I think that's because they want to appeal to a wide audience

165
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:06,751
You know these are pretty generic looking hipster doofus glasses like eyewear

166
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:08,543
I like that there hipster doofus glass

167
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:09,823
I like that

168
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,591
All right

169
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:14,687
Is another reason real quick just that I could not get these even if I wanted to

170
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:16,223
Did you obviously work with

171
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,759
Prescription lenses if you want

172
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:18,783
But

173
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,111
They don't work with bifocals which I have progressive lenses so that

174
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,903
That might work okay with these

175
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:24,671
However

176
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:28,511
They can only handle prescriptions between + 2 and -4 diopters

177
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:31,327
And I'm well beyond that both eyes unfortunately so

178
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,607
It's not even an option for me

179
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,399
So it's not for old or blind

180
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,447
Got it did you just call me old

181
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,239
Weird lines and line

182
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:42,847
Are you being right

183
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:45,407
I'm like hey I might have bifocal soon to

184
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,455
Or actually I'm getting progressive lenses for

185
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,479
For the first time

186
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:52,063
Good luck getting used to that the first days

187
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,087
Might make you nauseous

188
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:54,879
Okay

189
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:55,647
So

190
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,671
Related

191
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:59,999
But not exactly so we mentioned the Qualcomm chips are in these glass

192
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:05,119
These are not the chips that are in there but Qualcomm has launched a brand-new reference design

193
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,143
And for smart audio

194
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,447
And this is worth noting

195
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:13,311
Cuz I really think we're getting to this point where we're going to have that interface from her

196
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:14,847
Write the movie her where you

197
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:19,967
You're like you got your phone in your pocket and it's super smart but you also have a relatively smart headset

198
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:21,759
TED talks to you when you interact with

199
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:22,527
Actually

200
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,831
I feel like I just saw an ad for this for some

201
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:25,855
Other madam

202
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:26,623
A powered headset

203
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,927
So what county is created

204
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:34,559
Reference design for its qcc5100

205
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,607
Series Bluetooth audio chip

206
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,143
Yay

207
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,191
Is for Android phones obviously

208
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,471
You put the

209
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:44,287
Anime app on the phone and you pair to these earbuds

210
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,847
And you toggle mantle made with a simple push of the bike

211
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:50,175
And they actually have decent quality

212
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:54,527
Features for music listening as well so they're going to active noise-cancellation they use the

213
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,807
Qualcomm app

214
00:08:56,063 --> 00:09:02,207
X codec for high definition audio and qualcomm's true wireless stereo I'm not saying that thing better than

215
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:05,023
What those are so many rappers use but

216
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,047
Now these are not just

217
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,863
An assistant in your ear not just a hero

218
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,423
They don't actually have the hair bow

219
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,191
Functions

220
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,239
But maybe we'll get

221
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:15,775
It's so much computing

222
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:21,151
It's funny you mention that her movie cuz I've seen it probably 20 times I love it

223
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:24,991
Do you know that I cannot get my wife and daughter to watch it cuz I think it's

224
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,015
Creepy

225
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,551
They will not watch that movie

226
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:28,575
Huh

227
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,879
If I will not watch The Haunting of Hill House

228
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:35,999
But who neither would I but that's creepy on purpose this is their interpretation of her is creepy

229
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:38,815
They probably see the p

230
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:41,631
I bought those pants

231
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:42,911
MLB him for Halloween

232
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,959
No I'm kidding about that but

233
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:47,775
I'm worried because we're going to this he Robles

234
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,311
Future and

235
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,847
You have to accept it

236
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,407
It better get on board

237
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,175
Hassan Whiteside

238
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,711
We're going to talk about something

239
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,247
Along those lines out of

240
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,039
Remember creepy

241
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,319
But now

242
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,599
Glucagon

243
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:02,879
Well maybe not I don't

244
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:05,183
The Google home hub reviews are out

245
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,207
And

246
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:07,487
People think

247
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,791
Yeah and

248
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,327
I read all reviews

249
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,911
They're obviously the devices cheaper so that's a plus

250
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:21,311
But you get a better experience on the larger smart display as in general yes they cost more so you're paying for the

251
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:27,711
The sound quality on the Google home hub is not up to par with those as well and you know I

252
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,479
Still

253
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:34,879
I don't know I just can't get over the size of it. You know what listen it's not for me and that's fine there plenty of other people who are fine with

254
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,439
With a little home interface and a photo frame

255
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:43,839
That 7 inch screen no problem I just like the additional feature of a bigger screen for my YouTube TV and videos and

256
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,631
They're totally fair

257
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:46,911
But a photo frame

258
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:49,983
Right now is about 79 to a hundred bucks so

259
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:55,103
You could send people like your Kik pictures and get this for like a family member if you thought

260
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:57,151
It doesn't have a camera so it's

261
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:57,919
It's kind of creepy

262
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:03,039
What it does actually take Duo calls that I just found this out the other day

263
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:09,183
I thought you couldn't use Google Duo on this because it did not have a camera Google says it supports Duo calls

264
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,207
Better voice only

265
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:10,975
Oh

266
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:13,535
Yeah so this actually might be great for like

267
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,303
A grandparent

268
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:16,863
Yeah it is

269
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:19,935
People won't be able to see you on the other end of the call but that's okay

270
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:20,959
That might be a bonus

271
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:25,567
It depends my for my friends yes they're probably very happy about

272
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:29,407
All right and Google home hub features have started rolling out to smart.

273
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:31,711
Displays I have not tested it on mine

274
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,503
It started yesterday I believe

275
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:36,319
And Kevin has not tested on his

276
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:42,975
Well I tried to force the firmware update by resetting the Hub and it didn't do anything so we're talking about it

277
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:44,511
All of the features that Google

278
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:47,839
Demoed on the Google home hub this month at the made by Google event

279
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:53,727
Are trickling down to the other smart displays which makes sense so the Lenovo that you and I have Stacy this marks

280
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,775
Display is getting at the JBL is getting it

281
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,567
And this will add the

282
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,871
Slide down for Europe

283
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:02,175
Whole-home interface feature

284
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:07,807
To allow you to control things by touch little bit easier which I love that future but and this is another reason why

285
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:13,183
I probably wouldn't get a whole lot because if you're just getting for that feature you're going to get it on the on the better Hardware anyway

286
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,719
Alright well hopefully

287
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:18,815
We will get that soon I will say that I did enable Matt Amaze new whisper mode

288
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:19,583
And

289
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,607
It was super easy

290
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:22,655
I just started whispering to her and she said

291
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,191
I think you're whispering to me

292
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,471
Would you like me to Whisper back

293
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,519
Or something along those lines and I said yes

294
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:28,799
And then poof

295
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:29,823
It happened

296
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,639
This is notable one because he was promoted

297
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:34,175
Pretty useful Batu

298
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:36,479
I had this whole voice interaction with

299
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:37,759
Metal Mayhem

300
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,295
That's historically somebody

301
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,575
Probably would have done in the app

302
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:41,855
So

303
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:46,463
It's subtle it's great that you can actually enable this by voice it's that's

304
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,487
Smart use of the

305
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,767
Microphones

306
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:49,791
Yay

307
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:54,143
If you're listening and you're on the matinee team someone did actually ask us

308
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,703
They're like hey I'm hard of hearing is there a way for

309
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:57,983
Recognize my voice

310
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:00,287
Which yes there is and when it hears me it

311
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,055
It just speaks up

312
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:01,823
A little louder

313
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:04,639
And I cry just for that person

314
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:06,431
I was like that is a brilliant idea

315
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:08,223
So Madden 18 Folk

316
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:09,759
Or the Google team phone

317
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,039
I'm actually not fussy

318
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,063
Go for that

319
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,343
Can you still use case

320
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:16,159
Unless they're whispering and then don't shout really

321
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,439
All right

322
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,719
Let's talk more about Amazon

323
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,535
Amazon is pitching immigrations customs

324
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:22,559
Horseman

325
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:26,143
On using its recognition face recognition cloud service

326
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:26,911
2 track

327
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:27,935
Immigration

328
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:28,959
This is

329
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:31,775
Unsettling it's related to the use of the

330
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,311
Face recognition service

331
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,103
By police officers and now they're just

332
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,127
Ice

333
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,663
Which currently

334
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:40,223
It's a super controversial agency

335
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:40,991
4

336
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,271
A lot of reasons

337
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:44,319
We don't get into politics much but

338
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:45,855
I can say that

339
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:48,415
Isis one of the agencies behind separating

340
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,207
Families from their children at

341
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:54,303
At the border and a lot of people think that's a problem so Microsoft Salesforce and other

342
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:55,839
Called in

343
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:56,607
2 question

344
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:57,375
4

345
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:00,191
Allowing their technology to be used by this agency in

346
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,727
Many people feel is

347
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:05,311
I just can say it's the pursuit of people you shouldn't separate families

348
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:11,967
And just to be clear this is not a done deal yet

349
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:15,807
Yes this has been a pitch and I guess demos

350
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,367
Still under consideration so it may not happen

351
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:20,927
Without again getting too deep into the politics

352
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:22,463
I think what we need are

353
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,231
The right

354
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,023
Policies in place first

355
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,583
And then look at whatever tools are necessary to help

356
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,119
Support those policies

357
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,679
So I'm not saying I'm all for this painting means

358
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:34,751
But a piano to me this is putting the cart before the horse

359
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,103
Basically this is allowing for things like Mass surveillance and when you run

360
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,383
The images through it

361
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,407
It will recognize

362
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:44,223
We don't have any rules

363
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:44,991
About this

364
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,807
The and it's not it's also not foolproof

365
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,087
No no it is

366
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:54,207
And you might be recognized as a escaped convict when obviously you are not

367
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,743
And it's worth saying that

368
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,535
We are more concerned about

369
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,559
Dark people

370
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:04,447
People who are brown people who are black coming in and those are actually the people who these facial recognition algorithms

371
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,727
Tabby biggest problem

372
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,007
So

373
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:10,335
Lot of things to think about here most of them

374
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:11,615
Kind of dystopia

375
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,919
Send a lock that note

376
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:16,479
Let's talk about privacy in the Internet of Things

377
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:18,015
Because we

378
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:21,343
We talked about this a lot we think that in the US were about to get some

379
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,879
Privacy regulations

380
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:23,647
I think that is

381
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,415
Good

382
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:29,791
As we are leading up to drafting some kind of legislation getting something implemented we're seeing a lot of

383
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:31,327
Companies come out talking about it

384
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,631
None more so

385
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:34,655
Then Apple

386
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,447
Which has constantly said that

387
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,727
Did they keep State a private

388
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:38,495
And

389
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:42,335
You might argue that that actually hurts it and its ability to create

390
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:47,967
Great day I based experiences but it's also something that it is definitely

391
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:48,991
Trying to pay

392
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:51,039
Pitches a differentiator between Amazon

393
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:52,831
So Tim Cook

394
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:54,879
The CEO of Apple

395
00:15:55,135 --> 00:16:01,279
Give a speech recently in Europe where he basically said that when companies are misusing quote deeply personal data

396
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:02,559
He called it

397
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:05,375
Weaponized against us with military

398
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,143
Efficiency

399
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,423
Comet surveillance

400
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:09,983
And the entire speech was

401
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,263
Those are strong words

402
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,287
From a CEO

403
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,127
Yeah he's all in favor and In Praise of

404
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:18,943
What's the new gdpr regulations in

405
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,015
You obviously I see a point in

406
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:25,087
We talked about privacy in the past and we're all for it

407
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:27,647
I also wondering you kind of alluded to it you know

408
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,695
Is this perhaps why

409
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:30,975
The

410
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:32,511
AI in

411
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:34,303
The iOS world is not

412
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,327
Up to Snuff

413
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:38,911
With Google and Amazon in terms of personal

414
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,447
Information

415
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:43,775
Helpfulness I guess it's probably best word as well as

416
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:48,383
Homekit not having the launch velocity that the other platforms

417
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,479
It's almost like apple is back itself into a corner in these areas

418
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:54,527
Try and improve them

419
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:56,575
Without sacrificing privacy which is up

420
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:57,599
Great goal

421
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:00,671
But it comes at the cost of products that are less useful

422
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:07,327
And it's really unclear so there's a lot of reasons that Apple may be perceived as being more behind it

423
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:08,607
1 is

424
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:14,495
For a long time it didn't let researchers talk about what they were doing a lot of the data science Community is very open

425
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:16,287
And they want to publish research

426
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,311
An apple does not work

427
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:21,919
To happen so part of it may just be it's not attracting people who

428
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,455
Want to share what they're doing with the word

429
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:25,759
The other aspect is definitely really

430
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,575
There are those things too

431
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,343
To think about

432
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,879
With this and

433
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:33,951
I think we might be veering too far into the

434
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:36,255
Innovation is awesome Innovation at all

435
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,023
Cost is

436
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:40,095
Awesome in this particular realm because

437
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,375
Average height

438
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,911
There's kind of conflicting things

439
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:43,935
There's the idea that

440
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:44,959
Customization

441
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:45,983
AI can lead to

442
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,519
Awesome customization

443
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,287
And a better user

444
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,311
But

445
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:51,871
Up until now the web has been built on

446
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:53,151
Using an AI

447
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,175
For better Market

448
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:56,735
And those are two very contrary

449
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:59,807
You're either going to sell the user or you're going to sell the user

450
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:00,575
On something

451
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,111
Historically weave

452
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,135
So the user

453
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:03,903
And

454
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:06,975
It's unclear actually even if the user wants these

455
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:10,047
And that's kind of where we are at

456
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:12,863
At this moment and I'll give you an example of something

457
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:13,887
Kind of

458
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:14,911
Ties into this

459
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:15,679
Last month

460
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:17,215
James director of global

461
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,519
Additional information gave a presentation

462
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:21,823
To the association of national advertisers

463
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:24,895
In it he described the company Gathering data from

464
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:28,479
90000 GM owners in LA in Chicago for

465
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:29,503
Three months last year

466
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,807
These people were not aware

467
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:32,831
Of this happen

468
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:37,951
Basically it was sent into what people were listening to radio station satellite

469
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:38,719
Etcetera

470
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:39,487
And

471
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,511
It took that

472
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:42,047
Title to vehicle

473
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:45,887
Data and location data in basically was packaging this

474
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:46,911
For Advertiser

475
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:55,615
There is so much fear right now like whenever I talk to somebody who doesn't have an echo or a Google device in their home there you

476
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:57,151
Usually concerned about it listening in

477
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,431
Can we have this

478
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,199
Actually happen

479
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:01,759
And with the scariest part of

480
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,551
The presentation I think

481
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:04,831
Place to me

482
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:07,647
Was that the GM executive said that since of a quote

483
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:08,671
We sampled

484
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:10,463
The behavior every minute

485
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,999
Just because we could

486
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,559
Yeah that's not good

487
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:17,887
Interested tie these two things together and elaborate something else

488
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:19,167
Some more on what you said

489
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,983
You're right Innovation for the sake of innovation is

490
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,519
It's not the answer and

491
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:28,383
People sometimes fail to understand that when you innovate and building Technologies

492
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:31,455
That allows you to increase your Innovation and

493
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:35,039
Bill Nur Technologies so the rate of change and innovation

494
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,575
Is increasing

495
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:40,927
What's not increasing is the level of privacy

496
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,463
Security that we have

497
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:45,791
Yeah but you need to be in lockstep for this Market

498
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:49,119
Otherwise you're going to have while you're going to have what we have today you're going to have

499
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:53,727
Devices and device makers that are doing things like this because

500
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:54,495
They can

501
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,799
Injustice 2

502
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,335
Drive this home

503
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,103
Because

504
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,383
By gosh we're going to

505
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:04,735
Call the spit dystopian episode sidewalk Labs which is alphabets

506
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:07,295
Company building a smarter City on Toronto's

507
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,063
Waterfront

508
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:10,111
Area one of the advisors

509
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:10,879
An

510
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:11,647
Cavoukian

511
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:13,183
Who is a privacy expert

512
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,719
She actually resigned

513
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:15,743
Last week

514
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,535
Is an advisor to sidewalk

515
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,583
Because she didn't like

516
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:23,423
That Sidewalk labs when it released its privacy and digital governance

517
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,239
Proposals and we actually feature those in the newsletter last week

518
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:27,775
They decided

519
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:28,799
That the

520
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:29,567
Could not make

521
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:31,103
All personal data

522
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,127
D identified

523
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:35,967
At the source and what that means is all of your city public data that

524
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:38,271
It's coming from you as you walk around the city

525
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:40,063
Will still be associated

526
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,087
With you

527
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:45,695
Did you talk about how people could use that data and when people use that data they need to make it

528
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:47,487
Clear what they're doing with it and then

529
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,791
Talk about creating a civil Trust

530
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,071
To monitor that data

531
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,119
But they did not say

532
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,143
Is that it had to be

533
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:55,423
Take it away from you

534
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:58,751
And part of the problem here is when you create these type of smart

535
00:20:59,007 --> 00:20:59,519
Platforms

536
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:02,847
You obviously open them up to third parties

537
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,639
And one of the issues

538
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:05,663
Is

539
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,455
At least with sidewalk labs

540
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:08,991
The alphabet company saying is

541
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:11,295
You were committed to D identifying data but

542
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:13,343
We can control with their parties do

543
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,879
You can see how this

544
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:16,416
Could play out negatively for

545
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:18,976
Also take for example the recent

546
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,512
Selling of

547
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:26,912
People's wireless data by the carriers to third-party data brokers who then turned around and sold that data to

548
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:28,448
Two law enforcement agent

549
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:29,984
So then

550
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,776
They actually had access to Lake

551
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:32,544
Individuals movie

552
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:34,080
Which is kind of creepy

553
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,872
Because you know we have lost

554
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:36,640
Protect

555
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:38,176
How police can get that info

556
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:39,968
Information they just kind of sidestepped

557
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:40,736
Frightened rabbit

558
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:41,504
Just by going to

559
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,832
Now the carrier said they stop doing

560
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,112
But

561
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:46,880
You know these are

562
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,720
You have to rely on someone to figure this out and then

563
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,792
Shame the company and then they're like oh okay I will stop

564
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:55,584
It's always after the fact

565
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:58,912
So all of those stories taken together

566
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,960
I'm going to say they make me feel dirty

567
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:05,568
They make me feel really uncertain about the world that we're trying to build

568
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,360
And the conversations were

569
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,384
Having a bout

570
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,408
Are connected products

571
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,944
How use the data from those

572
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:13,760
And our monetization play

573
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:15,040
So

574
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:18,624
I'm going to be like if I had to claim a big Story 4

575
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,392
The coming here

576
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:21,440
Which we don't really do those kind of things

577
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,976
That's going to be

578
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:24,512
A huge story next year

579
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:25,280
And

580
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:29,888
A couple episodes ago we talked about how we're getting the smart home ready for normal people

581
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:31,936
And I believe that is truly happening

582
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:33,984
We need to have those conversations

583
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,776
What's before everyone starts putting

584
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:36,800
Olaf is crazy

585
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:37,568
Stuff

586
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:40,384
So this is me calling out

587
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,152
To everyone

588
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:42,176
To think about this

589
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:43,200
To talk about this

590
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:43,968
Start

591
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:44,736
Figuring out

592
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:45,504
How we want

593
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,272
How to handle this

594
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:48,064
And maybe it is maybe it's like

595
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,344
OK I don't need this in my

596
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:51,136
It's not providing me enough value

597
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,160
I don't know

598
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:53,952
That's enough on that

599
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:55,232
About something

600
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:58,048
I don't know is it more creepy is it less creepy

601
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:58,816
Everything

602
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:00,608
What's creepy this is the walabot

603
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:01,888
This is a

604
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:04,448
Sensor you can put on a wall they

605
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,728
I think it's good for your bathroom

606
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:08,288
And what it is is it detects Falls

607
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,824
It's a $249 divided

608
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,616
And you

609
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:13,664
It doesn't use a camera it uses

610
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,480
Radio waves so it's tracking basically

611
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:17,248
It's not like it's

612
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:19,040
It's kind of like radar or sonar

613
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,904
It's basically creating not images but information about

614
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,440
Waterfall looks like

615
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:28,256
Through and it will work through a shower curtain of a war

616
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,536
Works for all of this sort of

617
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:30,816
Thin layers of

618
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:31,584
Materials

619
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,120
And basically it'll say hey

620
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:36,448
This data pattern looks like what it looks like when someone falls in the shower

621
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,496
When someone Falls stepping out of the tub

622
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:40,800
And it will call an emergency personnel

623
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:42,336
How late is wifi-only nuts

624
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:44,128
It doesn't have a subscription fee

625
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:46,176
Probably because it's wifi-only

626
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:47,968
And if you're concerned about

627
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:49,248
This is a problem

628
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,272
It might be something you're

629
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:51,552
Interested in looking at

630
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:57,696
Yeah honey that's another way to help the Aging population or anybody trips in their bathroom whatever

631
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:00,768
It doesn't seem too invasive to me because it's not like you can

632
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:01,536
The camera

633
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:07,936
Because it's using Wi-Fi it's obviously voice over IP which Emergency Services aren't going to your local

634
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:13,312
Patient through that however I would assume that you set your home location in an app and it just

635
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:14,080
Provides that

636
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:14,848
Information

637
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:21,248
To the emergency services so that way you don't have to tell them where you are now you're going to carry this thing around and you're always moving so that

638
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:24,064
That's good you know for the Right audience I think it's

639
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,344
Probably a good product

640
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,112
Yes

641
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:27,392
I'm kind of interested in someone

642
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:30,208
I coming to you this week with a broken toe

643
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,512
That's okay

644
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:33,280
Baidu fall

645
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:36,352
Anyway so let's move on to our final Story 4

646
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:37,376
Witches

647
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:38,912
A couple weeks back

648
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:40,704
Probably months ago actually

649
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,008
The New York Times did an awesome story

650
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:46,336
Talking about how smart home devices can be used against people

651
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:47,104
Who are victims of

652
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,384
Vuse solo

653
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:50,432
How people could be controlled

654
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:52,224
By the connected devices in the

655
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:57,344
They're home so maybe their husband installs connected locks and locks them outside the house

656
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,672
Or maybe a wife uses a camera to monitor the husband

657
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:01,952
Don't know about it

658
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:03,232
All of these things

659
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,256
Super creepy

660
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:05,536
And

661
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:08,608
There wasn't a lot that we could do we talked about

662
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:09,376
A couple things that you

663
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:10,912
You could do but really it's

664
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:17,568
It's a tough problem to solve Kevin talked about how he always checks with his wife and daughter before installing things in the home

665
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,360
I talked about giving my husband Adnan

666
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:20,640
Access so they have

667
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:22,944
Access to this but

668
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,504
The Wirecutter did a story talking about

669
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,528
Other things

670
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:29,088
They're good suggestions in that they

671
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:30,624
They help they don't help

672
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,392
The issues

673
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:35,744
Like if you're not prepared to leave the situation or you still live with your abuser

674
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:36,768
These are not

675
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:37,792
Really helps

676
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:39,072
Tremendously

677
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:39,840
But

678
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:43,424
It's a start so they give instructions on how to log into your router

679
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,728
And see what other devices are on the network

680
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,544
They talked about how to reset devices and

681
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,824
Call the manufacturer

682
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:56,736
The two-factor authentication suggestion is awesome I'm very big into two Factor authentication for all of my online

683
00:25:56,992 --> 00:26:02,112
Accounts as well as my devices nobody can login pretty simple to my Chromebook if they don't have the special

684
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:03,648
USB key for example

685
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:05,696
So I'd like to see more

686
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:10,048
Smart home companies during the setup process offer two-factor Authentication

687
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:14,912
Because that could completely lock somebody out from changing settings on you

688
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:16,192
Without your knowledge

689
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,216
Corset could be

690
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,776
Agreed

691
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:22,848
And another idea was to disable remote access

692
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,176
You can avoid applications that track and store location history

693
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:28,224
Turn off geofencing on

694
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:28,992
Devices

695
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,552
You know so again this kind of put you in

696
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:34,624
Back but we are talking about surveillance

697
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,928
In a lot of these devices and

698
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,976
You know it can be used against you

699
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,072
I'll put a link to that for everyone who is interested in checking the

700
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,352
And

701
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:51,264
I'm surprised wait a second I'm surprised that you skipped over one of the most interesting exciting chips.

702
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,032
Rays of the week

703
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,824
Oh my God I didn't talk about it

704
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,896
Now you know that's my point you guys I'm terrible

705
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:57,920
This is what happens

706
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:04,064
Okay she was so excited before the show about this okay there's a new

707
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,368
Chip company out there called at mosack

708
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,648
It launched this week

709
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:08,416
And

710
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:09,184
Here's what

711
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:10,976
Any new Chips

712
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:11,744
Japanese automatic

713
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:15,840
Cuz I'm a big nerd

714
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:18,144
But this is a chip designed to solve

715
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,424
The battery problems with

716
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,496
Connected sensors in low-power devices

717
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:23,520
Out there in the iot

718
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:29,920
Because my dad if we're going to put a trillion sensors anywhere or even fifty billion sensors we can't be changing the battery

719
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:35,296
So at mosaic what they've done is they've created a tiny bluetooth module

720
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:36,064
And

721
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,112
This Bluetooth chip is notable be

722
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,648
Because it's designed to

723
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:42,464
Do some really Advanced things on the sleep and wake mode

724
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,744
So that's good right

725
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,536
The way it listens for

726
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:46,816
Data packets is slightly

727
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:48,864
And more power-efficient

728
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,656
50 most exciting aspect

729
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:51,424
About it

730
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,192
Is

731
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,728
It Harvest

732
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:54,752
RF energy

733
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:55,776
Show

734
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:58,592
Basically this doesn't need to be powered by a battery

735
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:01,152
Sorry it can be powered by harvesting

736
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:02,176
Wireless

737
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:03,200
Else and

738
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:06,272
You have to be kind of close to things for this to work

739
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:07,552
But this is not inductive

740
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,624
It gathers energy from the RS

741
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,672
Signals so basically

742
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:15,232
Any radio waves out there in this is actually

743
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:16,000
Radio

744
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:17,024
Powers

745
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,352
Other things so Wireless power like we talked about with a Qi standard

746
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:21,632
That is actually

747
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:22,656
RF power is

748
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:26,496
As well but it's sitting directly on top of something and so

749
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:28,032
It can power things that

750
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:29,568
Require more power

751
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,848
Like a cell phone

752
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:35,968
Cuz if you send too much energy through these RF waves to power stuff

753
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:36,736
You end up basic

754
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:37,760
Microwaving someone

755
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:41,600
So you cannot send massive quantities of power wirelessly

756
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:43,648
But you can't send tiny amount

757
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:46,976
And that's basically what the sensor. Is it's basically trickle charging

758
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:47,744
All the time

759
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:49,792
So I love this

760
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:51,072
I love the design

761
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:54,144
I'm very excited to see this come out into the world

762
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,424
It will not be out into the

763
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:57,984
Volume until 2019

764
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:03,360
And then we probably won't see devices at the earliest until the holidays of 2019

765
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,896
Probably more likely we'll see it

766
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:05,920
In 2020

767
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:07,200
But

768
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:09,248
Yeah this is interesting

769
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:11,040
For so many reasons and

770
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:17,696
The application of this obviously you think sensors right away because they generally have low power requirements to begin with

771
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:18,464
But

772
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:24,864
They're saying there are multiple applications here that we could be using his for such as wearables asset tracker

773
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,144
Beacons remotes

774
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:26,912
Keyboards

775
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:27,680
Mice

776
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:30,752
So there's there's a lot of potential here in terms of

777
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:32,288
What we could see this in

778
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,336
Yes now what you will need

779
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:35,360
For this kind of network

780
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,128
Work you're going to need

781
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,480
If a mesh situation because you cannot be too far away and still gain

782
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:41,504
The power

783
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,272
So

784
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:43,552
You're going to have it like

785
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:46,880
Your phone cannot trickle charge this by talking to it

786
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:47,904
Phone is downstairs

787
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:48,928
Check the sensors

788
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:49,696
Upstairs

789
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:52,000
Yeah I wonder though

790
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:54,304
What the range is like I'm walking around

791
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,584
With a wearable and I'm not

792
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:00,704
My phone with me would it be able to harvest energy couldn't possibly get some from the cellular network

793
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,824
What's that are around I don't know all the frequencies that they're using to get that yellow electromagnetic

794
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:06,848
Energy

795
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,640
Will Kevin I can answer some of the

796
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:10,432
So it is

797
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:11,456
About 10 feet

798
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:14,272
That's kind of the optimal range that you should be

799
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:15,296
So

800
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,088
I mean that's not terrible

801
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:21,696
It's also know so my phone would always be within 10 feet of something I'm wearing

802
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:27,072
I'm carrying my phone as well but obviously I'm almost always more than 10 feet away from a cell tower

803
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:29,376
NFL stand under that just to recharge

804
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:32,448
Things are still very interesting what they could do it.

805
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,240
Yes thanks for reminding

806
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,544
I was so eager

807
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,568

This week's voicemail is from

836
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:26,720
Isaac

837
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:27,744
And he

838
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,280
The question actually

839
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:30,816
About his Schlage sense lock

840
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:33,376
Hi Kevin and Stacy my name is Isaac

841
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:35,680
I'm from Colorado Michael is actually about the

842
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:36,448
Schlage sense

843
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:38,496
Lock you probably seen in the web.

844
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:40,288
Ever since I was 12 was released

845
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:42,592
We can no longer control the

846
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:43,360
Sexton

847
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:44,640
Locks remotely

848
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:47,456
Sections were actually my favorite locks have been using them

849
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:48,224
Years

850
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,760
And I have to my house

851
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:52,320
The other day I almost said to gets locked out of my house

852
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:55,136
Connect keyless remote case I was traveling back home

853
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:56,160
Cisco

854
00:31:56,672 --> 00:32:00,000
So I was hoping to ask if you guys know more from the rectum

855
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:01,536
Is there an app to type

856
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:02,560
60 shoe

857
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:03,840
And it's not

858
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:04,864
What are the laws

859
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:05,632
Star hump

860
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:06,400
Compatible

861
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:07,424
Would you recommend

862
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,192
To replace the

863
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,008
That's probably not going to be selected

864
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:12,288
It to be on the air because

865
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:15,616
Complaining about Schlage sense a little bit but

866
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:17,664
I was hoping you might be able to

867
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,688
Thank you

868
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,224
Oh Isaac

869
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,248
We do not

870
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:22,528
Let our sponsors

871
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:23,808
Interfere with our editorial

872
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,088
We would never do that

873
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:27,392
Because all of our sponsors actually

874
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:29,184
Really want the iot to work out

875
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,464
And so they really want to solve

876
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,232
These issues

877
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:32,512
In this case

878
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:33,536
You Are Not Alone

879
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:34,560
Schlage

880
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:35,584
Has acknowledged

881
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,352
This is an issue

882
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:42,240
Dealing with it's also an issue that August locks and even some light bulbs that are Bluetooth

883
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:43,008
Baste her face

884
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:45,824
Schlage has given us an official statement

885
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,384
They acknowledge that this is an issue

886
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:50,432
People are experiencing remote

887
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,712
Connectivity trouble with

888
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,320
And they are currently working with apple to identify and resolve the issue

889
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:57,344
In a timely fashion

890
00:32:57,856 --> 00:33:00,672
They do want to stress that customers can use their

891
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:02,208
Access codes to unlock the

892
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:05,792
And you can manage the lock using the Schlage Sense app

893
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:09,120
Or the Apple home app if it is in Bluetooth

894
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:10,656
You just can't do it

895
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:11,424
Remotely

896
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:15,264
Now this is probably still super inconvenient

897
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,032
People hate this

898
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:17,312
They hate having this problem

899
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:18,336
LED light bulbs

900
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:20,640
Problem with other

901
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:22,944
The issue is the update

902
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:23,712
IOS 12

903
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:24,992
It appears that

904
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:26,528
Something about that update

905
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:28,064
Broke something

906
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,600
In the homekit Bluetooth

907
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:30,624
Implementation

908
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:31,904
The

909
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,720
Challenge that a lot of these companies are dealing

910
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:35,744
Here is

911
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,792
They don't always have

912
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:39,072
Full access

913
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:39,840
2

914
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:41,376
Beta versions

915
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:42,144
That might be

916
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:45,216
Locks and so they are working with Apple

917
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:49,056
Kind of

918
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:51,104
The challenge here

919
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,640
For apple is there

920
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:55,456
Completely changing the OS versions of major

921
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:57,760
Release of iOS iOS 12

922
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:59,296
And sure you know

923
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:00,064
DeKalb

924
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,624
Unit testing regression testing Etc

925
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,208
He got beta testers I beta test iOS 12 I did for a while

926
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:10,560
Before it came out live but they're just so many moving parts and you

927
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:11,840
Fix earned Edition

928
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:16,960
May go back and break something in this case perhaps it's something in the Bluetooth stack or who does what

929
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,520
You never going to catch at all unfortunately

930
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:25,920
Guess I don't understand you give Apple a pass but I mean I used to manage a QA software testing team just that one Corporation

931
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:30,528
It's a challenge I know anytime that you have coaching to such as especially when they're massive

932
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:32,576
So I hope that it gets fixed

933
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:37,184
It'll for all of that manufacturers that are affected because it's obviously not Ashley

934
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:37,952
And

935
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:42,816
Favorite kind of sucking Windows you know early adopters and IRT people until it happens so

936
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:43,840
Hopefully

937
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:49,216
You know Apple certainly knows about the issue so my guess is we'll see it fix much under the rather than later and we're just

938
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:50,496
Going to be inconvenience

939
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:51,520
That's what happens

940
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:52,800
And the plus side is

941
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:54,336
This sort of thing

942
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:58,176
Will probably prompt everyone to look at how they're evaluating

943
00:34:58,688 --> 00:34:59,200
Software update

944
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:00,224
SRO SF

945
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:03,296
So this voice mail came in actually

946
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:04,832
I was 2 weeks ago

947
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:05,856
But

948
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:07,136
It's still not solved

949
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:09,696
The most recent update as of Wednesday morning

950
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:14,560
When we recorded this from Schlage is quote Apple continues to work on finding the root

951
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:16,864
They're working daily with r and

952
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:17,888
And other companies

953
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:21,216
You can tell that that's an official statement

954
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:21,984
Because I use the word app

955
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:26,080
And that's the first thing in finding

956
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:28,896
The solution is to replicate the problem

957
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:30,688
So Apple needs to do that first

958
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:37,344
Then that should help them determine what the issue is then Fix-It test the fixes make sure the fixes don't break anything else

959
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:41,184
Anywhere in iOS 12 and then push it out to everybody at that point

960
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:41,952
So that

961
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:44,256
All these locks now work the way they used to

962
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:48,608
It's going to take time it's just going to take time and the good thing is as you said I mean

963
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:51,936
They should now have a test case going forward

964
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:53,472
To retest

965
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:54,496
All baby lock

966
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:57,824
Functionality going forward with each new iOS update so

967
00:35:58,336 --> 00:35:59,872
Hopefully this does not happen again

968
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:02,176
Something else might happen

969
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:02,944
Because hey

970
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,480

971
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:05,504

Hugo finds the CEO of Electra

981
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:23,680
He's going to be talking about how a device

982
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:25,216
Made by a bankrupt company

983
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:27,264
Is still working for us today

984
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,032
And

985
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:29,056
You'll hear from our sponsor

986
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:31,616
How does it stay tuned

987
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:38,016
Everyone we are taking a break from The Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor this week sponsor is

988
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:41,088
Cognizant and I have Frank entities

989
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:42,624
Conscious its Global leader

990
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,648
Of the iot

991
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:47,488
Frank we have covered a lot of ground in our previous

992
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:51,840
We talked about how it's not easy for companies to build iot Solutions

993
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:53,376
But how you guys helped

994
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:56,704
A bunch of your customers in retail in manufacturing

995
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:03,104
Now tell us today how cognizant is taking it a step further by using a human Centric approach to

996
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:04,896
Solutions

997
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:07,712
Moschino iot applications are changing

998
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:13,600
Atticus of this customers demand more than the Enterprise Windows lock the speed

999
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:17,952
Scale of the coming transformation is massive and cognizant is helping building

1000
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:21,024
But it's also a challenge that comes with graphic Technology Innovation

1001
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,864
Some companies try to solve the problem but using a technology

1002
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:27,424
Design new technologies without

1003
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,728
Clear understanding what problem different song

1004
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:31,520
What we as humans

1005
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:33,568
S customers Factory workers

1006
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:34,592
Service technician

1007
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:38,944
110v that is widely believed in a human supposed to propose to solve this problem

1008
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:40,480
Followed by the technology

1009
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:42,272
That is a big challenge

1010
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:44,064
What do you recommend to your class

1011
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:47,904
What we recommend to our customers is that before

1012
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:48,672
Legal

1013
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:52,512
Solve the problem with the technology first approach to look at what people really

1014
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:53,792
It's example

1015
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:54,560
Apartments

1016
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:56,864
Date we can get all kind of data

1017
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,144
Some cars we can have

1018
00:37:58,656 --> 00:37:59,680
Show me the different features

1019
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:01,216
At the disposal of the grave

1020
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:02,496
Depression videos

1021
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:05,056
Just need so many features

1022
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:06,592
Arconic features

1023
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:09,920
Well crafted features

1024
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:14,016
Swappa thinks that we work with our customers interest example if still

1025
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:16,320
Understand what people really need

1026
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:17,600
Like I'm having to use

1027
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:23,744
Dimensions can make that experience or driver most

1028
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:26,048
And how does composite do that

1029
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,584
The way we look at

1030
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,120
Least problem says to

1031
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:31,424
Play on key principles of ethnographic

1032
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:33,216
Rochester

1033
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:34,496
People say they want

1034
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:35,776
Example in this case

1035
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:37,824
The way a driver

1036
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,896
Answer the question on a survey about what they want in a thug

1037
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,200
It's very different from what they actually want

1038
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:46,528
Doctors established by observing and that is why

1039
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:48,064
The principles of

1040
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,344
Ethnographic research help

1041
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:51,648
Companies legatus

1042
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:52,672
Qualitative understand

1043
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:54,720
On what customers really want

1044
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:56,256
On top of potatoes

1045
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:58,304
Improved outcomes and iron auction rate

1046
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:02,656
The iot to vote for people we need to keep human eats at the 4th

1047
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:04,960
Your team sounds like they're doing a lot of grapes

1048
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:06,496
What is the Outlook

1049
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:07,264
For iot

1050
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:11,104
What's possible with iot is already been experienced in a personal life

1051
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,384
With Alexa

1052
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:14,944
These new digital experiences

1053
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:16,480
Continue to grow

1054
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:18,272
I just installed a diminution work

00:39:58,464 --> 00:39:58,976
Fantastic

1071
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:01,536
And I am excited because we are going to talk this week

1072
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:03,328
About one of my favorite products

1073
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:05,632
For the iot of all time

1074
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:06,656
The quirky

1075
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,240
But before we get to that

1076
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:12,800
Let me give you a chance to tell everybody what Electra

1077
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:15,360
So Electric

1078
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:23,552
Provide security on dimensionality devices in the field by customers to build

1079
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:26,624
Aqi easily integrated long lasting

1080
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,392
Devices

1081
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:30,976
4080 to deliver the daytime control wherever you stay

1082
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:32,512
Which brings us back

1083
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:33,792
To my favorite product

1084
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:34,816
The quirky egg mine

1085
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:39,424
We spend a lot of time on the show talking about business models and about security

1086
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:42,752
We floated ideas like hey we should have in

1087
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:43,520
Expiration date

1088
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:44,544
For connected ID

1089
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,312
Adams because

1090
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:46,336
By golly

1091
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:47,872
After certain period of time

1092
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:54,272
You may not want to support it if you're a manufacturer but does a consumer you need to know that your device is not going to be supported and get ready

1093
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,832
The updates so you can possibly

1094
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:57,856
Take it offline

1095
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:59,392
End

1096
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:00,928
You've been thinking about this

1097
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:01,952
Probably from the beginning

1098
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:03,744
Talk to me about

1099
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,280
When you are developing Electric

1100
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:07,328
Kind of how you were thinking about security

1101
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:09,120
Devices

1102
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:10,144
Xiaomi

1103
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,168
Going way back

1104
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:12,192
Coming back to the

1105
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:13,472

1106
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:14,240
Specking

1107
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:16,800
Play 90s MP3 player

1108
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:28,576
But I'll tell you we got a quiet by Rio and they love consumer MP3 player making cosima devices

1109
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:33,952
What's something I did feel like sawdust ideas and I sent to you MP3 players with almost the ultimate this place welcome

1110
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:39,072
Every year that was much better delete some bands haircut better

1111
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:41,120
Intellicast

1112
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:42,656
Fusion so

1113
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:44,192
Either you develop

1114
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:45,984
Continue to work on a product

1115
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,008
Really

1116
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:48,032
You never did Summer

1117
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:50,592
Takes off her that will the bugs were out generally

1118
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:54,687
Product development team would move this is kind of

1119
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:56,479
Chi products

1120
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:59,039
Adult by Thrice some of the development team so similar

1121
00:41:59,295 --> 00:41:59,807
Construction

1122
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:05,951
The company is either bring its new product still finish it with software on it and I'll get it working though ship it

1123
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:09,279
And the chances of Danny's xidan capable

1124
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:13,375
Could you sing a software update for this make in five years time a very low

1125
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:16,959
Just simply it's not that serious Nowell it's everything to budget

1126
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:17,983
Scheduling

1127
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:21,055
That's the engine is made absolutely desperate won't attach

1128
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:27,455
Tatiana stock if she were Hubley typing ability but unless they actually had given QA results

1129
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,247
Retirement money

1130
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:30,015
Do this

1131
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:32,831
And that's really a structural

1132
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:34,367
Consumer product companies

1133
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:37,951
Maintenance

1134
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:45,375
Cancel 20 years in advance whatever at least and so that was very much my mind with

1135
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:46,399
HIIT

1136
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:52,031
How do you make some other work how can you make

1137
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:55,615
Devices remain secure even if the manufacturer is not involved

1138
00:42:58,431 --> 00:43:00,735
And the way we do separation operating system

1139
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:03,551
Add the application unit tiny device White

1140
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:04,319
Yakima

1141
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:05,855
Okay and that brings us

1142
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:07,903
Reminder

1143
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:09,439
So talk to me

1144
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:11,231
About that in the

1145
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:12,767
Main steps that you take

1146
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:14,815
Keep this operational

1147
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:15,839
Even though

1148
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:17,375
The company behind the Crooked eight

1149
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:18,911
Is now defunct

1150
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:21,215
Interesting things

1151
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:22,495
Cookie OC Henson

1152
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:23,775
Kwikee products

1153
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:25,567
Innovation

1154
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:29,151
Some people decided that I next trade

1155
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:35,039
It'll tell you how many eggs you do if you don't have in your fridge from anywhere in the world by the powers on your teeth

1156
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:36,063
The promotional

1157
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:37,343
Suprax possibly

1158
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:40,671
And by golly

1159
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:44,511
I do have any eggs and I actually thought it

1160
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:45,535
I didn't think it was like

1161
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:46,559
Eminently useful

1162
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:47,327
But when they

1163
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:50,399
The salad is an idea they said it cost like $15 or

1164
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:52,447
And at that price I was like that isn't

1165
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:53,727
Excellent gift

1166
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:54,495
Like

1167
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:56,031
Quirky kitchen gadgets

1168
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:57,823
For Christmas or holiday

1169
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:01,407
Right so I was like yeah but then when it came out it was $50

1170
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:05,503
Which probably gets

1171
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:08,575
KissAnime expensive iot when

1172
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:09,855
Like whatever

1173
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:11,391
Moving

1174
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:14,719
Now that is defended by

1175
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:15,487
Quirky

1176
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:17,279
If I still had it

1177
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:18,047
It today

1178
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:19,071
Message to my son

1179
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:20,607
You would actually stay

1180
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:26,239
Yeah it should do I believe since you bought a new one you confirmation and now they turn off the pilot

1181
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:30,847
Pretty much still around

1182
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:35,199
Play Store devices online at least still working yes

1183
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:36,479
The one thing series

1184
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:37,503
Essentially

1185
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:39,039
When they decided

1186
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:40,063
Patience of Wilton

1187
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:40,831

And since that point to him is pretty they don't test

Chicken place on the Southwest Center in 2013 to 5 years ago

1191
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:52,607
To advise

1192
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:54,143
However the device has had

1193
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:55,423
Pretty night time

1194
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:57,215
7 the right OS updates

1195
00:44:57,471 --> 00:45:01,055
It's been patched.

1196
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:02,079
2 in

1197
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:03,359
Secrecy

1198
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:04,383
It now has

1199
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:06,431
Very sweet to trust improvements

1200
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:08,479
Pieces good stuff

1201
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:09,759
And no one

1202
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:10,527
Quickie head

1203
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:18,463
Essentially

1204
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:21,023
The gold standard one of the oldest

1205
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:23,327
Security in its radio

1206
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:25,119
Should be using

1207
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:26,911
Unity Chan sotl Essex

1208
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:29,727
Security

1209
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:30,751
So now

1210
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:31,775
We're familiar with that

1211
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:32,543
So

1212
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:33,567
You guys

1213
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:34,847
Basically Courtney Stefani

1214
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:36,127
And there's

1215
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:37,407
These existing products

1216
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:40,223
TLS updates and all kinds of other up

1217
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:41,759
And so

1218
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:45,087
Listen to it works cuz I rock

1219
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:48,159
Oswalt radio operating system underneath

1220
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:51,743
Most people

1221
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,023
Don't have an iOS update on that

1222
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:55,071
Phone or laptop whatever

1223
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:55,839
Windows

1224
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:07,103
Retest all your applications as well as testing done by the operating system Benda

1225
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:14,271
. concept has never really been cold all the way down to IRT you know my jio TV

1226
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:21,695
But that's what our system has done we have the separation between application and then operating system

1227
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:23,231
Essentially that allows

1228
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:24,767
Testing

1229
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:26,303
To be able to update Yelp rating

1230
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:27,839
Christian without the involvement

1231
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:30,143
Vice Ganda

1232
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:30,911
And so

1233
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:31,935
This is one way of

1234
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:33,471
Thinking about securing iot

1235
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:37,311
Devices and then keeping them operational for a long long long long long

1236
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:39,103
Time from an economic

1237
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:39,871
Perspective

1238
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:42,175
You guys have to update the OSB

1239
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:42,943
Because

1240
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:44,479
You're providing a service to

1241
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:47,295
Customer so everyone gets

1242
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:49,599
Joanna meaning

1243
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:51,135
Kind of works Lacoste aswell

1244
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:56,767
The huge cost of building and testing and maintaining your braking system

1245
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:59,071
And every customer runs the same OS

1246
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:05,215
So did you try to work that goes into that to make sure that it's stable and bug-free and we do a whole lot of other stuff

1247
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:05,983
What about you

1248
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:07,263
Remote Diagnostics

1249
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:15,199
Something is going weird or whatever

1250
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:20,063
We can dig into problems are deeply and find a recording pics

1251
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:21,599
Yeah we kind of ducks

1252
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:27,231
I'm sure they can stay online and stay secure

1253
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:31,071
So let's try this to some big advances that have happened

1254
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:32,095
I should say big

1255
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:34,143
Some advances

1256
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:36,191
Security

1257
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:37,471
Microsoft has a product

1258
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:38,751
Azure sphere

1259
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:40,031
Which is a

1260
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:43,103
Connection between the hardware and the OS layer

1261
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:45,151
And it's actually also tied back in

1262
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:46,175
Cloud

1263
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:46,943
You guys have a cloud

1264
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:48,991
But I'm trying to chill

1265
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:50,527
This is a little bit of a

1266
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:56,415
It's actually pretty interesting to see we've been doing this sweeping shipping store devices

1267
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:57,951
2012 on

1268
00:47:58,207 --> 00:48:02,559
Existing commodity Hardware in the best features of the existing checks

1269
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:05,887
Microsoft

1270
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:08,959
Is city market sell steak

1271
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:10,239
They have

1272
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:11,775
Custom Hardware

1273
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:20,991
Deployment

1274
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:23,039
Security update

1275
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:24,063
Application

1276
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:25,855
Recycled things so it's good

1277
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:27,135
Good things to have

1278
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:30,975
However if you look at the comparison between the two this composite

1279
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:32,255
Application

1280
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:35,071
It's not sold in trouble tonight

1281
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:37,887
Mystic Lake so security

1282
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:39,423
Show the deployment

1283
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:42,751
Mutations Grace

1284
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:44,287
So

1285
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:46,335
Busiest day stuff really does nothing

1286
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:47,615
Integration

1287
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:51,711
Traditional IRT in Diamond have to run in for my certificates on my device

1288
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:53,759
I'm going to have to run my standard

1289
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:56,831
TTT or MCPE rhcp stuff

1290
00:48:57,087 --> 00:48:59,391
On the device like usual

1291
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:00,671
And like that.

The actual standard system you ship so it's scales

1310
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:54,687
Chick one product

1311
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:56,991
Okay

1312
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:58,783
So that's a lot about

1313
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:01,343
And now let's move over to

1314
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:03,391
How we get these things to talk to

1315
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:04,159
The internet

1316
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:06,975
Because in the last few years

1317
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:08,511
I know that you guys lunch with

1318
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:09,791
The Wi-Fi board

1319
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:11,071
Some other

1320
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:12,095
Lots of other board

1321
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:13,887
Filtered out

1322
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:14,911
Overtime

1323
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:17,215
It was mostly Wi-Fi maybe Bluetooth

1324
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:19,775
And now we're starting to see a lot of cellular

1325
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:20,543
Modules

1326
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:22,079
And I think that's

1327
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:23,615
It's indicative of something

1328
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:30,015
Talk to you since you guys recently launched

1329
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:33,087

Even when they products are pricing in office environments reference weatherall Wi-Fi

1340
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:00,735

To talk into an IT support person you need to actually successfully deployed one of these device

1342

Which design

1382
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:13,855
Realize the applications you never going to see these on the phone

1383
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:16,159
But that smooth

1384
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:17,439
Flower power

1385
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:18,719
Simpler and cheaper

1386
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:25,119
Antenna key has better range and penetration due to the motivation teams that the one they use but it's ready this this is opened up now

1387
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:27,935

00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:32,543
Her friends about it now

1389
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:35,871

00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:47,135
1

1393
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:49,183
Would you ever do a Lora board

1394
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:50,975
It's probably not a 6

1395
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:53,535
Stress petechiae

1396
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:57,375
Me accidents on IP networks and now

1397
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:00,959
They're essentially

1398
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:03,263
Message based Networks

1399
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:05,567
That's fine they're definition

1400
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:12,479
I don't see a thing that I wear

1401
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:14,527
Advice for customers

1402
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:20,415
Very simple things you know we have customers who have

1403
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:22,719
So they can monitor the TV networks remotely

1404
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:24,767
What about me

1405
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:27,327
Cast this is been something that I've been following

1406
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:30,143
For a couple years now but even in b i o t

1407
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:34,239
Still pretty expensive they're not at $5 which is where I think

1408
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:35,519
They really want them to be

1409
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:37,055
I would like them to be even cheaper

1410
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:38,847
$5

1411
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:43,199
Which is easier one of the problems there is he still coming on ready to sell it can I miss

1412
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:44,991
Point

1413
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:49,087
Just nb-iot silicon radius of people making the sandwiches

1414
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:51,391
So is God

1415
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:54,975
Bad stuff is coming

1416
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:56,511
It will take a little while but I think

1417
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:57,279
Bear in mind

1418
00:54:57,535 --> 00:54:59,839
Network early right now

1419
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:01,119
Several

1420
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:03,167
6 months ago

1421
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:09,055
Pizza

1422
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:15,455
100 devices

1423
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:16,479
The carriers realize

1424
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:20,831
The actual product development

1425
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:22,367
Volume

1426
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:29,535
He's coming down

1427
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:30,559
So right now

1428
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:38,495
Gigi fullbacks

1429
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:48,223
Really really

1430
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:49,759
Volume

1431
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:53,855
Flexibility

1432
00:55:54,111 --> 00:55:54,623
I need

1433
00:55:54,879 --> 00:55:55,391
Okay and

1434
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:57,439
In line with cost what about the

1435
00:55:57,695 --> 00:55:58,975
Costs associated

1436
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:00,255
With delivering service

1437
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:02,047
I feel like we've seen it

1438
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:02,815
Couple

1439
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:06,143
Couple Innovations here like AT&T launched in LA

1440
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:08,447
TV button that instead of charging you

1441
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:10,239
Pecan consumption you just had a

1442
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:11,775
Max number of button presses

1443
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:13,823
And it feels like for iot

1444
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:15,359
Subscription models

1445
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:17,151
Mini Prada

1446
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:19,711
For those products they need some sort of

1447
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:20,991
I guess built-in model kind

1448
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:22,527
With the original Kindle

1449
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:24,575
So you seen carriers

1450
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:25,855
Get to that point

1451
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:26,879
How are your customers

1452
00:56:27,903 --> 00:56:28,415
Problem

1453
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:30,463
Asylum applications

1454
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:35,327
People voicing this has several parts

1455
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:39,935
The suffix run the application in the connectivity and a carry relationship

1456
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:44,799
A list of neck dinner with moving pieces there what we trying to actually get rid of all of that

1457
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:47,103
Can you give it power

1458
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:47,871
Come online

1459
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:48,895
The building is right

1460
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:51,711
And to do that with hearts

1461
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:55,295
Between the carrier and the customers just provide the

1462
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:56,831
It's really really simple

1463
00:56:57,087 --> 00:56:58,623
Demi model deployment model

1464
00:56:58,879 --> 00:56:59,903
So people can actually get

1465
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:01,695
Continue

1466
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:03,231
Okay so

1467
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:05,279
I feel like we talked a lot about

1468
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:06,559
2 billion Ford

1469
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:07,583
Tennis shoes 1

1470
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:10,911
Security and making sure that devices stay secure

1471
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:11,935
Even if

1472
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:15,775
Your company goes away or maybe you don't want to deal with patching it anymore

1473
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:17,823
And then also the issue of

1474
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:19,871
Cellular connectivity and how

1475
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:21,663
We're trying to figure out the best way to pay

1476
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:22,431
Pay for that

1477
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:23,711
These are big things

1478
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:25,503
From the consumer side

1479
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:27,295
It may not make a whole lot of

1480
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:30,623
But from the manufacturer societies us a lot of

1481
00:57:31,647 --> 00:57:32,415

Not a commercial device

1488
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:44,191
We have various things in our office

She meant whatever but we have money to get down

1501

True unconventional memes
