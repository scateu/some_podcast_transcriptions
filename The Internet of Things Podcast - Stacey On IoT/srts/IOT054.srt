00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:14,336
My co-host

4
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:17,152
Kevin tofel

5
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:18,688
We're going to talk about the brand new

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,528
Free to talk about for the best switch for the

7
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:25,856
Sabbatical Miracles thanks to the Internet of Things

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,160
Trouble at SmartThings

9
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:30,464
And our guest today is

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,488
Matt Manley

11
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:33,792
A fiord who's going to be talking to us about

12
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:37,120
Wearables and specifically designing smart jewelry

13
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:37,888
Which

14
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:39,680
You like what you like I was going to say

15
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:42,752
You still wear that by the way

16
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:50,688
The ring way that's what I meant to mention this like two weeks ago in the show but they now have a bracelet

17
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:52,480
Call the Aries bracelet that

18
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:53,248
Is

19
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,272
Very attractive

20
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:00,416
It's a thin gold band with a jewel in it and the Jewel is just like the Ringley tools so it's got the Bluetooth

21
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:05,280
The LEDs and it connects to your smartphone notifications

22
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:07,328
Be at the very attractive bracelet on your wrist

23
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,120
And

24
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:10,656
I was really excited about it

25
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:14,496
I believe you can order it for $195 during the

26
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:15,264
A priori

27
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:17,568
And yes early supporters

28
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,592
20% off

29
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:21,664
When you said the price 195 I cringed a little bit

30
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,944
But but but

31
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,480
This technically is

32
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:27,040
Jewelry that's not just a notification light.

33
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:28,576
Is designed to be

34
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,368
Jewelry yes and it

35
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:31,904
It's something that

36
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,744
I tend to wear so the actual and I should tell you the list price is actually

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,768
279

38
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:39,584
If you really think about this you should

39
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:42,144
With the ring

40
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,704
I don't wear it everyday but I do wear it

41
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:46,240
But I want to look nice

42
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:49,056
The nice thing about the Aries bracelets

43
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,080
Probably have mint

44
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:52,384
Is it is also acts as a fitness tracker

45
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:54,688
That makes a big difference

46
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,712
So yes

47
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:56,736
Sorry my bad

48
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:58,528
What is a step tracker

49
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,576
Plus provides all these notify

50
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:01,856
Vacations and

51
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:03,648
Movies in October

52
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:06,720
So later on this year you're going to actually be able to make payments

53
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:08,000
With it because they have this

54
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,280
Tie up with MasterCard

55
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:17,472
This is like a feature-packed device for people like me who don't like to carry their smartphone maybe in their paw

56
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:22,080
Pockets around with them all the time or who don't want to wear something that looks like technology

57
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:22,848
Right

58
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:23,872
This is pretty

59
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,176
It's it's very attractive

60
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:26,944
If I would wear it

61
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,576
What notifications are you getting right now on your ring wake that you probably would get also with us

62
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:35,904
Just like your diesel for emails if it were certain

63
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:38,464
Because the Ringley is so much more personal

64
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,280
I use it more for it so any time I get a text

65
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,304
A phone call

66
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,120
I also use it for Uber notice

67
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:48,448
Applications so if especially because if you're I'm waiting around like

68
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:53,312
And it's dark and weird outside I want to be like distracted by my smartphone

69
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:55,616
So when they River arrives my

70
00:02:56,896 --> 00:03:01,504
And I tend to get Ubers like leaving very loud places like a bar or place like that n

71
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,784
You can't hear

72
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:04,320
The phone buzzing like

73
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:10,208
You can actually see that that's not nice

74
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:11,232
Feedback it vibrates

75
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:15,840
You can also see it because it glows I think my

76
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:16,608
Turn the LED

77
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:21,472
But you program it yourself so you can do Facebook notifications UK

78
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,752
Twitter

79
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:23,776
Email

80
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,568
It's not like

81
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:30,432
Massive amount of Airstream of notifications you're selecting which specific ones

82
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,200
You want them

83
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:33,504
Is it limited to certain numbers a certain like

84
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:39,904
Can you only do three different types of medications for samples and you have four

85
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,464
Different levels of haptic feedback it's like

86
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,488
1 vibration

87
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:44,256
2 vibrations

88
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:45,280
Before

89
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,400
You can make as many as you want I think after a while you might be

90
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:53,728
Hangouts

91
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:56,544
The other final thing I'll say about this

92
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,312
This is

93
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:59,872
They have a setting called Your Inner Circle

94
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:00,896
Armada Center

95
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:06,016
You can actually turn off notifications except for certain

96
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,296
People from your contacts

97
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,064
Craigslist

98
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,368
So then if your liking a super Inn

99
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,392
Meeting

100
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:14,464
Only distraction you're going to get from that thing is like

101
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,791
If your husband calls or if your daughter School calls would be my exam

102
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:23,423
I love it I think it's really applicable I don't wear it everyday it is expensive

103
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,215
It's probably one of those

104
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,495
It's a it's an add-on

105
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,287
I like the way it looks like actual

106
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:29,567
End

107
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:34,175
I do think the future of wearables is probably really cheap electronics stuck into every

108
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:37,247
Yeah yeah and we'll talk about that actually

109
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,111
So

110
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,903
And you know you could do in cufflinks to

111
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:44,671
Guys

112
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:45,439
Stay tuned

113
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:46,719
Okay

114
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,255
After that day

115
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,303
Fruitful day crash

116
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,119
Let's talk about routers

117
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:53,887
Woohoo

118
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,935
Routers we have to talk about routers

119
00:04:56,191 --> 00:05:01,567
For two reasons one is because I'm sending back one that you loaned to me that you use in the past

120
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:04,895
But more importantly because another router company just got some

121
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,687
Funding dollars

122
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,735
I from Amazon

123
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,807
Which is

124
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:12,575
Honey

125
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:15,135
Saginil how many sides are there I don't know they're not sir

126
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:15,903
Six sides

127
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:16,927
Hexagon

128
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:20,511
Hexagons in your choice of colors white gray

129
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,303
Beige brown and orange

130
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:24,863
Aluminum

131
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,727
Make sense make sense

132
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:30,495
Lisa Rinna

133
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:36,383
Previously they're still available for pre-order they're very similar to the Eero devices which

134
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,199
We talked about before we'll talk about them with more 3 minutes

135
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:46,111
There's a lot less expensive at least get the pre-order level I know we talked about the prices before but just real quick they're 149

136
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:48,415
My First Single device 299 for 3 pack

137
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:53,023
As the police the pre-order price is cuz they're not quite available yet you can go on Amazon get them

138
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:55,071
I'll get on the list and pay for them I guess

139
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,375
But the years are 199 and

140
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,143
499

141
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,167
Side for a single in

142
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,191
3 pack soap

143
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,727
Big price difference at least

144
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:02,751
Initially put

145
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:06,079
How much did they take out I think it was

146
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:12,223
I was thinking how much did they raise

147
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:14,527
2.5 million.

148
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,903
Kneeling with a bunch of factors including though

149
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:20,671
Amazon

150
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,463
Excel

151
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,487
Amazon

152
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:30,143
Yeah former AT&T CEO

153
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:31,935
Results are back

154
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:38,079
And its founder Paul Judge one of the founders

155
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:38,847
Is

156
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,663
Big security guy he actually found a pin drop

157
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,431
Security

158
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,455
And

159
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:44,735
You know he's

160
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:47,039
The firm is based in in I believe Atlanta

161
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:50,367
And the idea with Luma is that

162
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:53,951
It improves your coverage using a mesh Network much like Eero does

163
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,487
But the big selling

164
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,511
When is going to be

165
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,279
Cheap rental car

166
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,863
Yes they have a really nice UI for

167
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,911
I I think it actually is done by

168
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,215
RPG and Chee

169
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:06,239
So you can

170
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:08,543
10 of Define the levels of

171
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,847
Access your kids can have

172
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:13,151
The Eros

173
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,175
Today

174
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:14,943
Hopefully that will change

175
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,991
They actually have kind of

176
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:22,367
Did they have much more granular permissions like you can turn off devices after certain times and that's

177
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:28,511
And in addition to the financing at they just to have sale serving out to

178
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:32,607
Major hires Matt Duffy who was with Sonos and apple one time

179
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:36,703
How do you spell head of supply chain out for Luna and they have a new VP of engineering

180
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:40,287
Who comes from AirWatch and VMware in his path

181
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,055
So happy

182
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:44,639
Yeah I think is in

183
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:48,223
Emm Enterprise Mobility management system company

184
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:51,039
Yeah but but you got VMware as well

185
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:55,903
Zachary so I'm so you're right 60,000 I didn't realize that I'm looking at the numbers right now

186
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:59,743
30000 through customer pre-orders and another 30,000 through retail

187
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:00,767
Channel so

188
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,583
He plans to intervene in June so

189
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,375
If you wait until Junior

190
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,911
You're probably going to pay a lot more because

191
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:07,935
Is the pricing

192
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:13,311
We'll go up to what looks like 199 and 499 for the one device or three devices

193
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:16,639
Which is exactly the same as that you're also if you want to get in

194
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,175
Tulum azerli

195
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,223
Now's the Time to do it to save yourself a bunch of money

196
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,503
So I got to ask

197
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:22,527
What did you think

198
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:26,367
Hero

199
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:28,927
Yes

200
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:35,839
So this weekend I ripped out the Eros because you loan in the meeting I don't know two or three weeks ago I replaced the Google

201
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:36,607
P******

202
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,631
With the Eros

203
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,167
And guess what

204
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:43,775
I got a fever and the only prescription is more mesh Network

205
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,847
Oh man it was great it was

206
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:50,431
Great I mean I have my onhub back now and I already do

207
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,199
Miss

208
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:54,527
Average wind speed in some areas of my house that I had

209
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,831
With a 3-pack of Eros that you

210
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,623
Got for me to borrow and

211
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,391
Review

212
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,951
I almost want to send them back but I have to

213
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,535
By those by those Lumas now

214
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:08,607
Well that's a thing I mainly because if I went and bought the Eros now

215
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:11,935
It's 199 for what I reviewed

216
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,471
Yeah they were fantastic

217
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:18,079
Everything Titus 1:15 actually know about pre-ordering the lumos because I can get

218
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,359
Hopefully the same experience

219
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:22,175
At a much lower price but we will see

220
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:28,575
They were fantastic I couldn't say enough I did see some people complaining about them either reviewers or peep

221
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,599
Bottom

222
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,391
You know they're like I don't see a difference

223
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:36,255
You know it's so tricky with networking because there's so many variables every configurations differ

224
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,047
Every house or business

225
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:40,607
Is different architecture early materials are different

226
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:44,191
I don't know it my house all I can tell you is they worked

227
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:44,959
Great

228
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:45,983
I

229
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:49,055
Well second that I did notice though and they fixed it

230
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:51,103
But I did notice that when my

231
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:53,407
Internet access when offline

232
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,687
It took them

233
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:56,991
A little extra longer to come back up

234
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:00,063
Cuz sometimes during the day my internet get

235
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,599
Would get kind of spotty

236
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:03,135
Fix now but

237
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:09,279
When I was happening I would be offline and it would take them another five or 10 minutes to all boot back up again that was a

238
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:15,679
Yeah that's certainly frustrating I I did not have any I have FiOS here at the house 150 megabits up

239
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:16,959
Up and down never

240
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:20,543
How many outages while I was testing me so I can't I can't speak to it

241
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,311
I don't know

242
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:23,615
Oh yeah

243
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,151
So let's talk about

244
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:28,735
Best switch out on the market today

245
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,527
Because The Wirecutter

246
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,551
Actually put out

247
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,319
The guide

248
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:38,207
To the best smart home Outlets when they were they called everybody and calls it a switch but you and I know it is a

249
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:38,975
Outlet

250
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:40,255
Right now these are

251
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,535
Technically switches are

252
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,559
Trellis Spa

253
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,143
That's okay

254
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:51,007
Yes they reviewed I don't know 7 or 8

255
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:56,639
For people who are not familiar with The Wirecutter that's what they do they they pick a device type

256
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,919
And they going yet

257
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,455
All the different competitors

258
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,735
Anime

259
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,783
Spend hours and hours and hours testing

260
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:06,111
And tell you what they think is the best in its class

261
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:06,879
So

262
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:08,159
I don't agree with

263
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,183
There

264
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,463
Zyrtec actually

265
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:13,791
I do too actually cuz I have one

266
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:16,863
This is a controversial I will say

267
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:21,215
Yeah they picked up Belkin WeMo Insight switch

268
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:22,751
We've talked about it before

269
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:26,591
You send me one I think makes my birthday to work all day was Christmas

270
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,359
Cuz I like

271
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:34,015
Thank you. Do you still have one or multiple cities or not

272
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,039
Amazon sale for Lake

273
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:37,087
40 bucks on Amazon

274
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:39,391
Actually goes on sale

275
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:41,695
Regularly

276
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,463
Keep an eye out

277
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:45,791
You know we used it actually 2

278
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:48,095
Find out how much energy are fish tank consume

279
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,119
Because I felt like

280
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,167
Consuming a lot of

281
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:54,239
I realized it

282
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:57,567
I can actually plug it into the fish tank light and only the 50

283
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:00,639
And now I'm going to turn off when I tell

284
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,943
Play Echo to turn off downstairs at night

285
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:03,967
Is an awesome

286
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:11,135
This does integrate with Echo obviously am with if this then that

287
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,671
It's great because it's

288
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:15,999
Cross-platform so whether use iOS or Android you can use the app

289
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:20,607
The app will is Stacy just said show you the amount of electricity consumed

290
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:22,655
Buy anything plug into the switch

291
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,191
It's 80 Wifi switch

292
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,751
Just hope the folks know that you don't need a

293
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:29,823
Don't need a hub or anything it's it works directly with an app

294
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,615
But it does Heather's integration

295
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:33,663
If it was a downside I would say

296
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:34,687
Tumi

297
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,223
It's just a single outlet

298
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:41,343
You know it would be nice if I had I can connect two things to this was just a single 3 prong outlet

299
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,903
It is although it's much smaller than the original

300
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:46,975
It doesn't take up your entire Outlet

301
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:50,303
It's also very sensitive the switch on top

302
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,839
Find myself

303
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:55,167
Oh this is something to note because I plugged it into a fish tank

304
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:57,983
When WeMo did its firmware updates

305
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:00,031
It would actually turn the fish tank off

306
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:03,103
And one day that happened in none of us noticed

307
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:05,407
Everybody to bed in

308
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:06,943
Thermometer

309
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:07,967
This is not a

310
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:09,247
The heater

311
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,807
That one off to in frozen fish

312
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,343
Yes we came to

313
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:15,391
Very sluggish fish than exmoor

314
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,159
Morning so

315
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,463
Get into something.

316
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:20,767
Fishdom

317
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:23,071
That would not be good

318
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:26,399
Some of the other ones they tested should we just at least mention us

319
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:27,935
Idevices

320
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,543
That was a runner-up by the way

321
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:34,591
And it's $40

322
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,895
Set a little cheaper and if your home kit family

323
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:41,759
Go for it cuz it also has a night light that has a little LED strip that changes colors

324
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:46,111
Some of the other ones in the competition that they

325
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:49,951
Tested but they didn't add to their best Paycor runner-up was the

326
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:52,511
Connectsense smart outlet

327
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:56,351
Not her that when I say it's the most expensive switch they test it so I don't know how much

328
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,375
It cost

329
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:00,191
So connectsense is a Internet of Things

330
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,727
Division of a larger

331
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:05,567
Actually interviewed Adam Justice they're smart home.

332
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,127
Related to some apple stuff on the show before

333
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,943
People who care about Wi-Fi

334
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:14,783
Should know about them because they make a lot of wifi-connected sensors

335
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,063
Like water

336
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:19,135
Water sensors that some other things and

337
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:22,975
It's nice because they're Wi-Fi they're not like zigbee or Z-Wave so you don't need a hug

338
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,511
Pecan to them

339
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,535
Is they are super

340
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:29,119
You know if you want to go out

341
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:29,887
Do the guys you should look

342
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:33,471
Gotcha yeah I'm looking these are $80

343
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,007
Switch on Amazon right now

344
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,799
What is a 82 Outlet

345
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,079
Bible say that

346
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,871
And does have him connect to

347
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,407
Certification

348
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:46,527
So who else had a look at the iHome isp5

349
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,319
They say was the only

350
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:52,415
Homekit compatible device they tested that has an Android app so

351
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:55,487
Obviously you can't use the homekit bit but at least

352
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:58,815
If you have an Android device have Android you can still use the switch

353
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,607
So that's good but

354
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,911
Play problems with it in homekit

355
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:03,935
So that's

356
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:06,239
Why didn't didn't make the cut

357
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,799
Feeling we all know

358
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,847
But they have a DSP w215

359
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,639
It just rolls off the tongue

360
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:14,943
Bluetooth

361
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:17,503
What is a Bluetooth plugin

362
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,271
Witches

363
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:20,063
So they're using Avion

364
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:26,463
Which is a back-end for actually some of I believe it's ge's light switches to Bluetooth powered light switches

365
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,535
It's a Bluetooth mesh

366
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:35,423
I haven't been thrilled with the performance of any of the Bluetooth mesh devices that I've tried so far

367
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:39,263
So it becomes a challenge if you a don't have enough of them in your home

368
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,567
Create an actual mass in b

369
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:44,127
If you get too far away from it from your phone

370
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,663
You can actually control it

371
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,943
So depending on

372
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:48,479
Besides your house or

373
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,759
What you want to control it

374
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:50,527
Becomes kind of like

375
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,319
Forsook

376
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,879
Knock knock

377
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:57,439
Hidden rounding out the list with the Enemy

378
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:59,743
SP 2101w

379
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,535
Comes up with these names

380
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,119
I suppose yes

381
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:11,007
They said it'd be knocked down to the bottom of the list cuz it was the only one they tested that doesn't offer any sort of smart home integration

382
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:15,359
What I don't see though is

383
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:17,407
Like there are antech

384
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,175
Make something

385
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:18,943
Switches

386
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,479
Did actually

387
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:23,807
Tie into the SmartThings platform so they didn't try any of those

388
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:28,159
And maybe it's because they only work with SmartThings although there's a b switches sound like

389
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:28,927
Not really

390
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:30,719
Lowe's actually has some smart

391
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:31,743
Consider

392
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:34,047
Oh I probably know why cuz they're not wife

393
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,071
Bluetooth

394
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:35,839
These were all hub

395
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:39,167
Consider make sense

396
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,447
Zulily

397
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,215
And

398
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:44,799
I don't know if you remember but I'm super keen on Zulily and they are

399
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:47,615
Bee smart Outlets that have the presence monitor

400
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,151
And it is I like

401
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:49,919
Yeah

402
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:50,943
I thought they were fun

403
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:54,783
They've actually since we last talked about them integrated with Philips Hue

404
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,319
So now like

405
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:58,623
Your Hue bulbs can come on when you enter the room

406
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:02,463
Which is kind of nice it's not just anything plugged into the outlet

407
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:05,023
So that feels like something they should probably

408
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,071
Very different

409
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:12,191
I'm betting you could reach out to them and make that happen

410
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:13,471
Yeah

411
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:14,239
So

412
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,263
Okay

413
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,031
And

414
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,055
That's kind of the

415
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:18,847
The Smart Switch you should buy

416
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:21,919
Moving right along we've got news from

417
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:23,967
I know the medical world

418
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,247
So

419
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,783
This is kind of a wacky story

420
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,599
It sounds I think cooler than it really was

421
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:31,391
But basically the story is

422
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:33,183
Intuit

423
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:33,951
A seizure

424
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:36,511
And doctors actually used his

425
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,279
Fitbit

426
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,303
2

427
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,351
See if they were able to give him

428
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:43,423
Some medicine to help bring down his heart rate

429
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,191
So

430
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:49,055
Just saved his life

431
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:52,127
That may be overstating it

432
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:54,175
Little Foot

433
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:58,783
So what happened is he came in after having a seizure

434
00:17:59,295 --> 00:17:59,807
And

435
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:02,111
I noticed that he had a drill

436
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,135
Fibrillation

437
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:05,183
I'm so super fast heart rate

438
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,207
Heartbeat that

439
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,487
Is a regular

440
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:08,255
And

441
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:10,303
They have medicine they can give you

442
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,583
To treat that if

443
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:13,119
It's not a chronic issue

444
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:16,959
So what they did is say with the skies permission cuz he was up in conscious

445
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:20,543
Does Fitbit data to see if his heartbeat was always that wacky

446
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,335
Him and I found out today

447
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:25,407
It wasn't and it was because of the onset of the seizure

448
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,687
That his heartbeat at all

449
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:27,455
Call crazy

450
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,735
They were like

451
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:29,759
We could probably give you this medal

452
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:33,087
And that is the story

453
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:37,951
Actually I think I'm looking at the story now and I heard I seen the headlines

454
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:42,815
I'm just going to call that the doctors decided to reset his heart rate with electrical cardioversion

455
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,607
So

456
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:46,655
The Gamers app or something now

457
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:47,935
You're right

458
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:50,495
Yeah I was reading about this

459
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,895
This is this is why we don't talk medicine too much

460
00:18:57,151 --> 00:19:00,735
The drive specified

461
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,271
Yeah yeah

462
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,295
Yeah so

463
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:08,159
I mean they're taking that just what the device is showing at that I'm looking at the guy but

464
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:10,207
As you said they're looking at his

465
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,231
The day that

466
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:12,255
It had collected

467
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:15,071
And that gave them the PetSmarts in the data

468
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:16,351
Decide what to do next

469
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:22,495
So it brings up some interesting questions the first one

470
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:23,775
Which for me is

471
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:26,591
These things are notoriously inaccurate so

472
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,895
I don't know how I feel about that

473
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:32,479
You can learn a lot from the trends

474
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:37,855
So let's let's say in certain situations you don't need 100% accuracy and when we say these things are not accurate

475
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,135
A lot of them

476
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:45,023
Have some glitches here and there or they're like 95% as accurate as a better actual

477
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,303
Heart rate monitor

478
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:52,447
That's good enough to get Trends and I think give them like in this case give the doctor's information they need to make a smart decision

479
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:54,239
So

480
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,775
Also speaking of Medicine

481
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:58,079
Because I thought this was really cool last

482
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,103
Was

483
00:19:59,359 --> 00:19:59,871
Pfizer

484
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:00,639
You may have heard of

485
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:01,919
Lots of drugs

486
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,711
Teamed up with IBM

487
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:07,551
To basically build a Parkinson's monitoring

488
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,855
I'm going to call it a service because

489
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,391
It's not out yet

490
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:13,951
It's this isn't a theoretical we're talking about its age

491
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:15,743
And it's not one thing

492
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:19,327
So basically what they want to do is they want to wait

493
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:22,655
Monitor Parkinson's patients 24/7

494
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:24,447
Various different aspects of

495
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:26,239
You know how a patient's feeling

496
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:29,567
So they can start creating personalized treatment regimen

497
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:32,383
Which I think is really interesting

498
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:36,991
Also think it's really hard so I reached out to Pfizer to ask him a little bit more about this

499
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:43,647
Cuz they they want to build a clinical model by 2018 and start testing it and then have something they could prescribe to patients bite

500
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:44,415
20/20

501
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:46,207
So I was like wow that's

502
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,487
Big order

503
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:49,791
So they said what they're looking for

504
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:51,583
Is off-the-shelf sensors

505
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:52,863
So this could be anybody

506
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:56,447
And that they're looking for things that measure

507
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:58,495
Motion acceleration

508
00:20:58,751 --> 00:20:59,263
Position

509
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:02,335
Interactions of a person with objects in their environment

510
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:04,127
Muscle activity brain Act

511
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:07,967
Breathing patterns in language production in organization

512
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:12,319
So some of those things actually can be done today with the smartphone they're actually apps

513
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,087
Detect

514
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:13,855
Parkinson's

515
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:16,928
Symptoms

516
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:17,952
They're not

517
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:19,744
You would then go to the doctor

518
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:26,144
So they're also looking for things that typically elderly and people who are struggling with motor disabilities can use which

519
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,472
That is a tall order because

520
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:31,520
A lot of the current Tech is really

521
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,312
Complicated to kind of implement

522
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:39,456
So you guys are trying to work with IBM to basically pull in all this off-the-shelf stuff and create

523
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:42,272
I really easy to use system and I'm not sure if they can do it in three

524
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,552
Tears

525
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:45,344
It's at I think it's a big ask

526
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,880
In in 3 years

527
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:48,416
I'm sorry two years

528
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:54,816
It's even bigger ass now to me whether they do it or not is that they putting out

529
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:01,984
An opportunity here because they've got this vision and they're specifying here's what we're going to be looking for from sensors and so on

530
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,776
We're going to work with IBM

531
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:06,336
To sift through the data and make these modern systems

532
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:09,920
I mean you might see a couple of businesses pop up as a result of these kind of

533
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:12,224
Announcements and that's very interesting to me

534
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,040
Is awesome it speaks to the fact

535
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:16,576
That Hardware is going to be kind of a

536
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:17,344
Commodity here

537
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:21,952
Looking for is to create the data and Analytics

538
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:25,792
Around how to measure Parkinson's and that's going to be super

539
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:27,072
Best hard part

540
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:31,680
Yes and if you think about how then you might prescribe treatment to some

541
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:36,032
You're no longer just getting like a handful of drugs you're going to be prescribed like a

542
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,568
A monitoring system

543
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:38,848
Before you make it your

544
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,688
There's things like Holter monitors which measure your heartbeat

545
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,968
Like all the time

546
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:45,760
You get those if they're trying to figure out life

547
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:47,552
Mycase why you keep thinking

548
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,648
People that got yours already

549
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,440
Prescribed medical devices but they are

550
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:55,744
Horrible clunky terrible things

551
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:58,560
So it'll be really interesting to see how this goes

552
00:22:59,328 --> 00:22:59,840
I look

553
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,888
Exciting

554
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:03,424
I can't wait to hear more

555
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:06,240
And speaking of smarts

556
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:10,080
Sore not-so-smart depending on the situation

557
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:10,848
Exactly

558
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:15,456
Set home hub in Platte

559
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:17,504
Was purchased by Samsung

560
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,528
For the last

561
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:19,552
August month

562
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:20,320
Yeah

563
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:24,416
SmartThings users have been experiencing some trouble and I'm really sorry about that

564
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:29,280
What did you do stay safe

565
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:30,560
Mess with their databases

566
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:33,376
Apparently they had database weeks ago

567
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:36,448
Still having trouble

568
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:39,264
It's caused a lot of the rules to stop working

569
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:50,016
Yes there are 1207 replies currently with an estimated read time of 184 minutes so we're going to save you three

570
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:50,784
3 hours

571
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,064
And tell you what's what's what

572
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:54,112
A lot of upset people

573
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:55,392
A lot of upset

574
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:57,184
People talking about how

575
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:59,232
They need to fix the underlying

576
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,000
Infrastructure

577
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:01,536
SmartThings is

578
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:03,072
They said on the thread

579
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:06,400
Situation they tell me that they are working on it

580
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,496
They don't have a time frame for that fix that they're willing to share

581
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:13,312
So I can't tell you anything more than

582
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:19,968
If you have SmartThings and if you noticed your rules not working or things going some people have reported there alarms going off in Hawaii

583
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:22,528
If that's happening to you

584
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:23,552
You're not alone

585
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:24,832
And

586
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:25,600
Effects of Cipro

587
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:29,952
It's interesting to me because just last week we did talk about

588
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:31,232
Revolve

589
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:34,816
The backend service is getting shut down so basically anybody who owns a revolve

590
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:36,864
They have nothing going to come May

591
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,144
Was the 15th or 16th

592
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:39,936
And I know I had mentioned

593
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:41,216
As I have in the past

594
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:47,104
Maybe you know a local bass system setup a server-side system cloud-based is the way to go

595
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,432
And sure enough I mean you can almost have the same thing again here because

596
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:57,088
What Samsung is saying is the issue the degradation of the system is because it on the database and messaging

597
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:58,368
So

598
00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,136
You know

599
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:01,440
You're lying on the backend services and it's

600
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:05,024
Interesting that it's a high load on the infrastructure because

601
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:10,400
They know how many products are selling their for they know how many people there supporting with this and what the

602
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:12,448
Infrastructure needs to be able to do

603
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:13,728
But

604
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:14,496
It's not doing

605
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:15,520
Please not right now

606
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:16,544
And I'm trying to

607
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:17,568
Remember I don't

608
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:22,688
So that's another good question

609
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:23,712
A lot of companies

610
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:24,736
Is are using

611
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:25,504
Amazon

612
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:26,528
Uibe

613
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:29,600
Is there using a will say a well-known

614
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:31,136
High-profile

615
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:31,904
Cloud

616
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,696
Service for everything which is

617
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:34,976
I presume that they are

618
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:37,280
All of those are highly scalable

619
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:41,632
That's a good question

620
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:42,656
Yeso

621
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:43,680
What we don't know

622
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:44,960
We can only speculate

623
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:49,056
For next week

624
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:51,104
Well maybe it will be fixed by next

625
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:53,408
That would be the best solution ever

626
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,432
So what

627
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:56,992
So just so you know

628
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:57,760
Oh

629
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:58,784
Oh what

630
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,088
I think they might be hosted right now on

631
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,624
Samsung Sammy

632
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:06,208
For the internet Sammy cloud

633
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,280
Yes I'm looking at a blog post from

634
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:11,072
2015

635
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:17,472
State of Butte SmartThings open Cloud of suffering data aggregation service powered by Sammy which is Samsung Cloud for

636
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:18,240
Coyote

637
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:20,032
I'm biting my tongue

638
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:21,312
I'm biting my tongue

639
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:23,616
Maybe that's

640
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:26,944
What's happening cuz Sammy is actually still in beta it's supposed to

641
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,552
Okay I'm not going to

642
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:39,488
If there is dating Samsung Smart Home a smart things are hosting this on a beta cloud services

643
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:40,256
They have

644
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:42,816
Why would you run a production service

645
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:44,096
On a beta cloud service

646
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,888
That is a big No-No to me

647
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:46,656
Yeah

648
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:47,680
We'll have to ask some

649
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:51,520
This blog post is not making me feel like

650
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:53,824
That's not giving you a warm Sammy

651
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,104
It's not given

652
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:58,176
Alright so that's it

653
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:00,224
Stay tuned for our guest

Great great thanks for having me

667
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:56,800
Oh I'm so glad because I am a sucker

668
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:58,848
For wearables and smart

669
00:27:59,104 --> 00:27:59,616
Jewelry

670
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:02,176
Which is the topic for today so

671
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:06,272
I'm very curious because you and I had this conversation before the show

672
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:07,296
About

673
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:09,088
Your thoughts on where this is going to go

674
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:10,112
And so

675
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,648
Let's talk about

676
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:13,696
The future of smart jewelry

677
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:14,976
Are we can have lots of it

678
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:16,256
None of it

679
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:17,024
What do you think

680
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:19,840
That's kind of interesting

681
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:24,704
The way I would look at it as we probably will have lots of it but we won't know it

682
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:28,544
I think that's kind of the underlying can a premise is all of the

683
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:32,384
That Notions of snow jewelry Society is kind of ambient intelligence so

684
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:37,248
At some point I think maybe the way it will kind of Eliza's you'll get used to just assuming that

685
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,808
Any particular kind of trinket or pieces

686
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:41,344
Baby wearing

687
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,648
Might actually kind of Hardware that little

688
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:46,208
Inside intelligence there other kind of smart

689
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:49,536
So what do we need to get there cuz right now

690
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:52,608
I've Loved smart jewelry because I hate looking at my phone

691
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:56,704
And my phone is off in my bag so I need something on my person that's like

692
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,008
This is ringing this is happening but right now it's

693
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:00,544
It's really hideous

694
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,312
I mean

695
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:04,384
Icy necklaces that look like little Kindles on

696
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:06,432
On ropes in its

697
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:08,480
I'm not wearing that

698
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:12,832
Yeah totally and I think we've we've kind of hit that point where people say you know

699
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:16,672
And one of the things that we we kind of joke about young in the studio is

700
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:20,000
Really you think about the first piece of smart jewelry or kind of connector

701
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:22,304
Text Amy this a house arrest bracelet

702
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:25,376
You know that's the thing that people kind of wearing their ankle

703
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:29,216
This is kind of announces hey this is a smart piece of jewelry

704
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:31,776
And we've kind of moves through that

705
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:35,616
Little segments as well where you look at these big kind of cocky

706
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:39,200
If screen that are sitting on somebody's wrist and it absolutely announces

707
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:43,040
This is basically a slave to my phone that's trapped in my body

708
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:49,952
People are kind of cleaning out of the market today in

709
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:53,536
And I love looking at the overall kind of kick-started universe

710
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,304
Just thinking

711
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,352
Keeping it like real-time ideas as how

712
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:57,376
People are checking these

713
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:58,144
Forms

714
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,960
Ideas

715
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,240
Let's just kind of

716
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:03,776
Create an object

717
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:05,056
That is really good

718
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:07,360
At signifying change or some kind of

719
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:08,384
Change in status

720
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:10,688
And how elegant we can we just

721
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:12,224
Acknowledge that that happen

722
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,528
This increasingly not becoming a screen.

723
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,600
Okay so I am

724
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:22,464
With you on that I have compared my two devices that I wear most often

725
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,280
When is an old school Pebble which has a screen

726
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:27,584
And the other is a Ringling

727
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:28,864
Which

728
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,192
And really is a beautiful piece of jewelry to me

729
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:34,752
I am kind of curious because it seems like

730
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:40,896
There's an issue of like the information we want at any one time for these devices and maybe something about

731
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:42,944
How we're handling notifications

732
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,224
Looks like maybe we need to

733
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:46,784
Accommodate ourselves to fewer

734
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:49,600
Notifications are only the most important ones

735
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:55,744
You're the only the most important I think is Witcher is what you're really kind of getting it and again something that we see everybody

736
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:01,888
You is kind of the right level engagement for them

737
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:06,240
This really get the initial kind of idea of what we would call Cam technology

738
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:10,336
Abacus Xerox Parc

739
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:12,384
Over 20 years ago now

740
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,152
At this point

741
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:15,712
Call David notion of Cam Technologies

742
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:20,320
It's some kind of change in status or gold kind of change in the Ambien

743
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:22,112
The world around us it happens

744
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:28,768
You may not need to know exactly what that changes at that moment or depending on how you set up your notifications

745
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:30,048
And you may know exactly

746
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,840
The type of changes happen

747
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:33,888
Really need to know that one woman is a

748
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:37,984
But when you talk about in a few minutes ago you some since you want to read a text

749
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:42,080
Since you want to get a little long form with and kind of know exactly what details

750
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:43,872
That's a completely different mode of thinking

751
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:48,736
And maybe you're not in the meeting maybe hopefully you know you're not driving you're not doing any of those kinds of things here

752
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:49,760
You're the moment of rest

753
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:51,296
You kind of get into that

754
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:54,112
Let's that frankly is probably a different device

755
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:55,904
And that's something that gets away

756
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,184
Anyway

757
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:02,560
I think overall smart jewelry is going to so if we if we accept that jewelry is going to be

758
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:04,352
Place for contact

759
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:06,144
How many

760
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,704
Variations of notifications do you think

761
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:09,728
Creatinine

762
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:14,592
There are things

763
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:16,640
I want to know very specific

764
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:18,944
So like

765
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,480
Is my daughter's school called

766
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:28,672
And that's a different from the haptic feedback I get for if an Uber has arrived which is another great place for

767
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:29,440
Totally

768
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:32,256
I mean that's kind of a great question when you think about me

769
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:35,840
How many in and what's the changing texture here that we have

770
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:40,704
Frankly that's a rolling question that is something that we always have to just kind of watching and it gets

771
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,984
And no pun intended there

772
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:45,312
But it gets into your basically personal app

773
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:46,848
I mean for some people

774
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:53,248
The notion of saying okay 1 buzz on my wrist needs an Uber is here and two buses mean 5th and all might my ring lit up

775
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,016
Color

776
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:56,064
Things like that that's actually the complexity

777
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:56,832
Some people

778
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:58,880
But I don't know if there's ever

779
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:01,440
Going to be one kind of canonical

780
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:04,256
If this is it

781
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:05,280
Space to play in

782
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:07,584
Is getting people kind of the freedom

783
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,888
And see what we've got all these different devices

784
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,472
With all these different applications that offer certain survey

785
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:18,080
The way we look at it is this notion of everything that we do is a little

786
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:19,360
Service

787
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,664
Give people the opportunity

788
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,968
To make their own orchestration

789
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:24,992
But what about

790
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:29,600
The particular devices because that's another way I could have my ring be my

791
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:31,904
Child

792
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,696
But I'm totally

793
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:40,352
You know a watch that gives me something else or I'm thinking that there's a bracelet I think it's called the June bracelet that tracks your

794
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:41,120
UV exposure

795
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:42,656
Actually

796
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:43,680
I think it doesn't

797
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:44,448
The color

798
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:50,848
I'm going to be stuck with not one device that's getting us everything like a smartphone and we're just having

799
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:52,128
First threat of her body

800
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:54,432
I think again

801
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:59,552
People wanted to do it that way I wanted articulated they absolutely could you the way that something is

802
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:00,832
You put it on now that's

803
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:02,624
Qi devices right there there on the market

804
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:04,672
And there's many others or you could

805
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:08,256
Kind of divide and conquer if you will types of information

806
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:10,304
Fur type of device stipend

807
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:15,424
It might be kind of a mental look like for people to kind of know if this happens it's this classification is

808
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,192
Information

809
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,984
I think it's entirely possible

810
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:20,800
I think one other thing that you can see that again is

811
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:23,104
Bring it down to one device

812
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:26,176
Could basically use things like light haptic feedback

813
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:32,832
My other screen color changing with the light as it is a very interesting thing every kind of looking at 2 but it just really kind of gets into

814
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:35,648
Articulation how complex you wanted

815
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:37,952
I'm some of these devices

816
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:39,232
Once you get past qunar

817
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:40,000
Light

818
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:41,280
And vibration

819
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:43,072
As a general color changes

820
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,120
You can do a lot with your sister

821
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:47,168
Two simple things so I don't know if we need

822
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:48,704
Necessarily more and more

823
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,008
Plx devices I think it comes down to

824
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:53,056
A personal choice

825
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:54,080
Individual

826
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:59,712
I think I could actually use one of these for like dessert or eating too many calories I could use like a little

827
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:05,856
A joke about that to all the time just kind of been negative feedback

828
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:06,880
Sky devices

829
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:10,976
It's funny when we do our user research all the time you see

830
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:13,024
You see people kind of phone that's really the one

831
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:14,304
Cancel

832
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,072
Campaign

833
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:19,168
All about it can't wait to have a can't wait to think about the power that they could

834
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:21,984
Kind of harness for this to make your day that much more fluid

835
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:24,544
And then there's the other Camp it automatically goes into

836
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,080
Dog leash territory

837
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:28,640
I'm kind of a slave to be

838
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:32,992
And so we kind of jokingly in a get into geofencing and things like that

839
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:40,416
If in your case with dessert If You Walk This Way

840
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:41,696
Or whatever

841
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,488
Yeah we just kind of

842
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,024
You gently remind you your

843
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,096
You're flying too close to the Sun here you're kind of going a little bit

844
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:49,632
You're too far over there but

845
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:55,776
Rest assured that if I break my dessert diet I am not doing for carrot cake

846
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:59,104
To get these things as ubiquitous as I feel like you're

847
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,128
You're saying they might be

848
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:02,688
I feel like they have to be a lot cheaper

849
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:04,736
Are we going to war

850
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:09,088
I don't see a reason why it wouldn't follow the the basic premises tomorrow slots

851
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:11,904
Increase power cheaper price

852
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:16,256
As you see the proliferation of these things happen and then frankly is the market kind of

853
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:19,328
Find new ways to use this Intelligencer

854
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:22,656
New situations that could be benefited from this intelligence

855
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:25,984
I don't see why there wouldn't be a driver to help keep in

856
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,520
Several causes of

857
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:28,800
NBA games into device

858
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:32,896
No sew when I'm using these devices

859
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:35,456
And as they become more ubiquitous

860
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:37,760
There's a challenge associated with

861
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:38,784
Programming them

862
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:42,112
So designers could go one of two ways

863
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:44,928
They could make it basically a soft programmable

864
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:46,208
Kind of devices

865
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:48,512
Myron Lee in many ways is that

866
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:49,536
Because I've got

867
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:51,328
So many options with the app

868
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:54,912
I assigned you this ice I knew that we could just go with a 1

869
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:56,448
Function device

870
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,264
Set selected UV monitor

871
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:01,824
Maybe a health bracelet

872
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:07,712
Looking for a wearable that has an accelerometer on it and just

873
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:09,504
Tells people when I fall down

874
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:12,064
That's all I wanted to do on cuz I faint a lot

875
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:13,088
I wanted to

876
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,904
Say oh my God Stacy

877
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,208
Call frigates the new phone and I can't get up

878
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:21,024
Mantra

879
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:24,608
Exactly

880
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,656
So I guess the question there is

881
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:31,520
How do we think about do I develop a soft programmable button or do I develop

882
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:33,056
Dedicated function

883
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:35,104
Is there really any bifurcation there I don't

884
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:36,896
Sure

885
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:38,176
So I think again

886
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:44,064
I tend to kind of go more towards a programmable just because if a if I look at this from the marketability standpoint

887
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:47,648
And there's a couple of days a couple days to cut this frankly but

888
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:49,184
If I look at it from a programmatic

889
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:50,208
And points

890
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,256
And again we were talking you before

891
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:54,304
Ford about if this then that

892
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:57,632
The nature of being able to kind of give a lot of people

893
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,704
Very easy ways to string together events

894
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,728
The daily program

895
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:07,104
Having a kind of agnostic kind of language to again chain things together in an easy way

896
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:10,944
My mind anyway would only increase the ability for a device to be except

897
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:13,760
Because it's either something that I can with

898
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:15,808
Little to no programming knowledge but

899
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:18,624
Am I pretty easy to grasp mental model

900
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:21,952
You can put these things together to make this device work for me

901
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:23,232
I got it

902
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:27,840
On the flip side though another way to cut it nothing at the kind of concert

903
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:35,520
Something that you can bring out this it's kind of like the Google search bar and an idea to do one thing or do one

904
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:41,664
What we talked about the Studio's is kind of the Polaroid camera are the gumball machine affected only does one thing

905
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:44,992
Put a nickel in it I get a gumball I push the button I get a picture

906
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:46,016
SimpliSafe

907
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,064
The sing about that

908
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:50,624
Is when it's a single-minded object

909
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,672
Those markets are they there now

910
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:59,328
I'm so depending on how good quote-unquote the idea is kind of depends and kind of dictates on the marketability of the Opera

911
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:03,424
I tend to lean more towards programmatic so people have choice

912
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,216
Make the device shape-shift

913
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:06,752
I'm a little bit more for that purse

914
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:13,664
Okay well in those devices would probably be more expensive because they have more sensors or more outputs

915
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:16,224
Where is a single function device might be

916
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:20,064
I assume one day we'll get to the point where we have like

917
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,112
I can be bracelet that's

918
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:25,440
It's just everywhere and maybe it's really cheap so

919
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:29,280
Sure

920
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:35,680
I think it's totally fair especially in the near-term and I think again that that follows the same general kind of premises

921
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:40,032
You know right now that multi-sensor device may be more expensive

922
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,152
36 months from now so I don't know if I could be a part of the conversation

923
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,432
Gosh I hope

924
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:47,200
Not cuz I

925
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:51,296
My theory is that wearable technology will be

926
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:52,576
Pretty much

927
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:53,600
Ubiquitous

928
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:55,136
And hopefully

929
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:57,696
In as many things as possible much like yourself

930
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:00,512
In the big questions I have about it are

931
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:02,560
How are we going to program them

932
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:03,840
And

933
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:07,168
And I also have questions about the environmental aspects of that

934
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:09,472
And

935
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:13,056
How do we assign functions to them cuz I can think of

936
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:15,872
Well I can think of so many things I mean

937
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:18,176
Like that the golf club is a great example

938
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:21,760
I don't know if I would have thought payments with a glove but

939
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:27,136
It makes a lot of sense if you think about winter you know going through Subway turnstile and having mittens with

940
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:31,488
So

941
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:32,256
Totally

942
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:36,864
Yeah it's a it's kind of a short hop from you know here were talking about the spirit objects with

943
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,912
Necklace or ring what have you

944
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:45,056
Pretty short hop is leasing to get more and more Ambien going to give me work talk about outer outer edges of things but not

945
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:46,080
Terribly far away

946
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:47,872
Conductive

947
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:49,408
Thinking about

948
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:52,224
How to weave these things into

949
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,040
More more can an interesting objects it's a

950
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:56,320
It's not far off

951
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:58,112
Ethereality,

952
00:40:58,624 --> 00:40:59,648
Google has projects

953
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:02,720
Jacquard they're working with Levi's

954
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:10,656
I actually at South by Southwest side backpack that was made by a company that does costumes for Rihanna and Lady Gaga

955
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:15,264
When you're listening to music the back of the backpack has like

956
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,032
This little light show

957
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:22,176
Everybody behind you loves you and you

958
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,296
Exactly exactly

959
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:28,320
It was very pretty

960
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:32,160
So I enjoyed it but I was like man that's going to cost a lot

961
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:34,976
Can't really see a lot of utility there

962
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:36,512
So yeah

963
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:43,168
What's interesting about your payment

964
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:43,936
Going to go

965
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:46,240
I don't know if you seen you've probably seen the Top Shop

966
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:47,520
The Barclays Topshop

967
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:53,151
Penetrate gets a little payment object that they've done a little jewelry that's all payment

968
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:55,455
Air bases in the UK but

969
00:41:56,223 --> 00:42:02,367
Super super interesting kind of fun form-factor obviously they're their kind of geared towards the Top Shop

970
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:05,439
It's a huge Market kind of thing but

971
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:11,839
Just really interesting Begley kind of J-pop kind of form factors and things like that there's a barclaycard integrated with it

972
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:16,447
As well so can you starting to see

973
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:18,495
Is this kind of interesting intersection

974
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:22,335
Greensky payment logic in all these different kinds of objects

975
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:24,383
Pushed into all different kinds of

976
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:26,175
Mia bracelets Rebel just

977
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:28,479
Interesting statement pieces that don't

978
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:30,015
Explicitly look like

979
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:31,295
Your computer

980
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:32,063
On my wrist

981
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:33,343
Things like that so

982
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:36,415
Obviously the Disney Magic Band and all that kind of stuff

983
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:39,999
Gone over that ground well as well as coffee ground for them to

984
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:42,303
Well and I feel like we've gotten

985
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:44,095
So used to

986
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:44,863
Before

987
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:47,423
We've gotten so used to bands with like the jaw bone

988
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:50,495
Fitness trackers in them

989
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:53,823
I'm trying to remember when that started but

990
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:57,919
Aldi Livestrong bracelets those those

991
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:01,759
Big fat yellow bracelet

992
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:05,855
I feel like we've been training ourselves to add to becoming

993
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:06,879
Used to this kind of

994
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:09,695
Conky plastic ugliness underarms

995
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:11,743
I totally think at one point

996
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:15,071
What's really interesting is in you look at with Tory Burch did with Fitbit

997
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:21,471
Yes it is the classic men's black plastic form factor going to just kind of Screams and technological object

998
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:24,799
Yeah it's up here at the end they get together with toy birds

999
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:28,127
You look at their site you look at their kind of merchandising

1000
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:33,247
It's the Tory Burch X Fitbit kind of thing in there and their jewelry sleeves their their sleeves

1001
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:35,551
Just like the Fitbit with indicted

1002
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:39,647
These are upwards of $200

1003
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:46,815
Interesting thing of logic and fashion and you can look at it and go it's

1004
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:49,887
Basically a container to hide the Fitbit Within

1005
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:53,983
People don't advertise you that big chunky piece of plastic

1006
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:58,847
I kind of look at that again is another read from the culture that

1007
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:02,687
Some people might want to display the fact that it's a smart object with have you but

1008
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:05,503
Once the kind of moment if this is

1009
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:10,111
Kind of disappears or maybe there's other statuses that are more important

1010
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:10,879
What you mean

1011
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:13,183
Then showing that I've got a technological apps

1012
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:17,023
Then you see these other companies coming out of it snow

1013
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:20,607
Be very kind of consciousness

1014
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:24,703
Other brands going to move into that space that's obviously signal sensitive

1015
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:27,007
Osher and

1016
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:30,591
That's one of the things I'm curious about because if you think about building 2

1017
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:32,383
Containers for these devices

1018
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:34,687
It limits where you can put them

1019
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:36,735
It limits the style of jewelry

1020
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:38,271
And also

1021
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:42,111
Because these devices change their form factor overtime

1022
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:46,207
I don't know how long the Toria at like if I spend $200 on a bracelet

1023
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:49,279
Promoted bit I'm really hoping that Fitbit doesn't

1024
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:53,375
Make a form factor that's bigger than my bracelet or

1025
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:54,399
Venusaur

1026
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:56,447
Yeah

1027
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:59,007
Totally and I think that's always going to be

1028
00:44:59,263 --> 00:44:59,775
Kakashi

1029
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:02,335
Elizabeth fairy Liquid Marketing General in fashion

1030
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:08,223
Generals of is a pretty liquid market so I think you're right the kind of had some kind of caution about changing forms and

1031
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:11,551
You can work now we're kind of getting into the idea of him

1032
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:12,319
Tekken

1033
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:13,343
Standards oh that's

1034
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:14,879
You know that's never a problem

1035
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:16,415
Internet

1036
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:19,743
Yeah they mean so that's it I think you're very right to going to bring that up

1037
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:27,679
Things like that so they don't

1038
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:33,055
Didn't necessarily hide the fact that there might be some form factors from the Fitbit line that aren't

1039
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:34,591
I'm going to work with you

1040
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:35,871
What do sleeves but

1041
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:40,735
I think that's something to kind of be caught and who knows maybe the bracelet

1042
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:42,015
I'm attractive enough

1043
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:43,807
Just work on its own even if it doesn't have any

1044
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:44,831
Macon haidian weekend

1045
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:47,135
Do I have to ask

1046
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:48,159
Before we go

1047
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:49,695
What is your thought

1048
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:50,975
On SmartWatches

1049
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:51,999
Or watches

1050
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:53,535
How do you

1051
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:57,375
I think they're great I mean honestly there is about a year-and-a-half ago

1052
00:45:57,887 --> 00:46:02,751
I was kind of the doubting Thomas other than said you know we're going to look and see what we were working on a wearable

1053
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:06,847
Point of view that a little bit over a year ago and we can't really

1054
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:10,943
You talk about it and if we kind of live with it and kind of bring it in and kind of

1055
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:14,783
I'll be able to speak from experience as opposed to just secondhand heard of it and

1056
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:16,575
I was pretty surprised

1057
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:17,599
Intransigent

1058
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:21,439
Personal relationship to the watch me there were times I felt like it this is Jeff

1059
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:26,559
You just a thing that's kind of telling you what I already knew was going to happen and I'm maybe a little bit slave to it

1060
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:28,351
But there are certain situations

1061
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:30,655
Particularly with driving and driving directions

1062
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:32,447
I was really kind of helps me but

1063
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:36,031
But in general don't look at the watch and you see again

1064
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:38,591
The nature of the four factors of watches

1065
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:39,359
Is kind of

1066
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:41,919
Disappearing away from those ideas

1067
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:44,479
Object and getting back tomorrow rethinking this

1068
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:46,015
The classic golden quotes

1069
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:50,111
Your representation of a lot so if you look at something like that I call here and they're connected Lots

1070
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:53,695
I'm a look at their faces and some of these luxury watches that are coming out

1071
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:56,511
Are they still kind of

1072
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:58,559
Hide their smartness a little bit

1073
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:02,143
I think it's a piece of jewelry as a way to kind of

1074
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:06,751
Convenient relationship status I think it said it's a Greek in the middle of the line piece

1075
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:09,311
Be simple as he watches for notification

1076
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:10,591
Amore

1077
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:13,663
Just some point can give you a little bit more information

1078
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:16,223
The first notifications and things like that

1079
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:17,247
If you need to

1080
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:21,343
I think it's xbaby just another way of looking at a piece of

1081
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:23,391
Piece of jewelry or another object that

1082
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:25,439
Can be assumed to be smart

1083
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:27,231
It's totally fine

1084
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:30,559
Okay and I would like to see all of this stuff

1085
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:32,607
All of the data move into

1086
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:33,631
A kind of

1087
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:36,447
Unified place like a healthcare or jewelry kit

1088
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:37,983
Maybe it's a way to think of it

1089
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:41,055
Because I really would like to be able to like

1090
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:43,103
Linked my jewelry of the day

1091
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:44,383
To my phone

1092
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:47,199
All of the information that I'm trying to

1093
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:47,967
Today

1094
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:50,271
Worried all of the things that I've decided work with

1095
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:51,295
Each piece of jewelry

1096
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:55,135
Sent to it each day so it like authenticate each day

1097
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:56,415
As opposed to

1098
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:59,743
Having a device that have to individually program

1099
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:01,535
Or the missing

1100
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:02,815
Does that make sense

1101
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:14,079
I think the closest way to get it that is through some sort of third-party aggregator

1102
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:18,431
Again where you can kind of raita recipe or something like that so you're not

1103
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:20,991
And stuck with all of these individual

1104
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:24,831
And I have to choreograph everything on the device by device levels opposed

1105
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:31,231
Maybe these things can all just kind of integrate with one particular Harbor one centralized area and get all of it since

1106
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:36,863
I'm that way that's when it's almost like a style sheet for all the devices and kind of cascade from there

1107
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:39,167
Got it so it's been 10 minutes on it

1108
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:40,447
As opposed to spending

1109
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:44,543
Every morning opening up different

1110
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:45,567
Applications

1111
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:46,591
Totally

1112
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:49,151
I mean it just seems to be kind of a drag

1113
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:52,735
If your home nature and whole kind of idea underneath all of this

1114
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:55,039
Yo sensibly is CID has Ambien and teller

1115
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:56,063
Okay great

1116
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:59,391
If I have to spend the first part of my day

1117
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:03,999
And it's raining these things I'm telling you what to do and everything on the Nikes Wikispaces

1118
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:07,071
There's not much that's ambien or intelligent

1119
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:11,679
Hopefully the ideas of these things can also learn a little bit

1120
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:13,471
If you want more anticipatory once

1121
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:14,239
You set the basic

1122
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:18,079
Awesome but I eagerly await my earrings that

1123
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:19,359
Can you give me directions

1124
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:21,919
There you go

1125
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:23,967
Actually done a couple

1126
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:27,551
Exactly like that but snooze haptic based navigation

1127
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:29,343
I'm using different devices

1128
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:33,183
Just like hearing some things like that's a really interesting kind of projects we can put it together

1129
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:36,511
It's that whole notion it's very silent

1130
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:38,559
Very kind of just-in-time intelligence to help

1131
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:39,327
Eagle owl

1132
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:40,863
And that's not going to the day

1133
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:43,679
Get you away from glancing at screens all day and helps you

1134
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:45,727
How to be more heads up in and presents

1135
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:49,055
I can do realize that supposed to kind of falling down from digital hole 15

1136
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:56,223
Awesome alright with Matt thanks so much for coming on the show this week thanks for having me it's been a pleasure talking to you
