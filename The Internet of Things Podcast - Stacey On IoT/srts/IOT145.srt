And now

24
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:57,088
Let's go to a message

25
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:58,112
From another one of our spa

26
00:00:58,368 --> 00:00:58,880
Spencer's

27
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:01,440
This week sponsor is CBT Nuggets

28
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:07,840
So how does the IOD change the way you do business for many organizations it means a proliferation

29
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:09,120
One of devices and tools

30
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:10,912
Which all require support

31
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:12,960
What is a mountain of requests for the it

32
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:16,288
Or Pilot devices that aren't being used to their full

33
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:17,056
Potential

34
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:19,872
But if everyone on your team knows how to use their tools

35
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:24,480
You're going to have fewer support request for it and get the most out of your material and vest

36
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:30,880
CBT Nuggets has been a top training choice for it Professionals for decades and now they're making the same

To the iot

43
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:53,152
Okay

44
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,456
Let's kick it off with someone

45
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:56,992
Consumer-facing dues

46
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:59,808
Some of which there's two related stories one

47
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,344
In both actually happened last year

48
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:02,880
When is

49
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:05,696
Auto the $700 Smart Lock

50
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:06,720
We've talked about

51
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:08,000
They shut down

52
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:11,328
And then to was Amazon buying blink witch hat

53
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:12,608
Right before

54
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:13,376
Christmas

55
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:15,936
And I think these two stories are related

56
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:18,496
Is Nas played Wiseau Autos issue

57
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:20,800
Is that this company has started

58
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,080
Years before

59
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:23,872
Launch so it launched this

60
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,200
Last year in 2017

61
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:28,736
With this

62
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,784
Planned $700 lock

63
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,320
It was a very beautiful

64
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:38,976
Its claim to fame was it actually wasn't as bulky as all the other iot locks it all fit into the original

65
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,816
Is it the deadbolt hole

66
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:45,632
And was going to

67
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,936
The product launch TuneIn

68
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:48,960
Early this year

69
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:51,264
What happened was they said

70
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,104
We were in the middle of trying to raise money and then we got an A

71
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:55,872
Acquisition

72
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,920
Any acquisition offer

73
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:58,688
Was going to

74
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:00,224
The clothes in early December

75
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:05,344
Basically didn't allow Auto to continue raising money

76
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:09,184
And so when the acquisition fell through

77
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,720
The company was left with

78
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:17,376
Apparently the acquisition fell through on the final day of when the deal was supposed to actually happen

79
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,144
And that

80
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,216
Left the auto folks scrambling and

81
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,240
Yes they have

82
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:24,032
Shut down operations

83
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,872
I mean I can see where you're going to go with us being related

84
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:30,176
But I do want to talk about the lock itself

85
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:33,760
Because as I read the a medium post

86
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:35,296
By the CEO

87
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:36,832
About to die yeah

88
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:40,672
Sam's post explain you know how all this went down as you just

89
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,208
Mentioned

90
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,768
But some of it in there just made me

91
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,816
Scratch my head and he had mentioned that the

92
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:52,448
Turn beta testing the $699 price point you know challenge melted away

93
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,728
I don't think so

94
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,008
I'd be shocked if that was

95
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:56,288
Is traffic bad because

96
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,824
It seems to me like autobutts

97
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,872
They spend a lot of time working with

98
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:02,432
Somebody who actually was in the Swiss watch

99
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:04,736
Making industry and I mean very

100
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:05,760
Small precise

101
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:06,784
Components for this thing

102
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,648
And that's great I'm sure it's a work of art just like any say mechanical watch might be but

103
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:17,024
A mechanical watch high-end is not the same as a lock you know what you wear the watch it's with you all day the lock

104
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,303
How to use a couple times a day

105
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:21,375
It seemed like these folks going to be for lack of a better word

106
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,655
The apple of

107
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:25,471
Smart locks I think they actually wanted to be

108
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:26,751
It's an even higher

109
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:29,055
Well

110
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,359
I mean it's the Philip II

111
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:34,943
Rolex

112
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:41,343
I'm smart locks and I see this because most locks have Precision Engineering even August has they

113
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,111
Went through it there

114
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:44,927
And this lovely story about Japanese

115
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:46,719
Hi precision

116
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,255
Something something

117
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,023
Gears blah

118
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,071
Because

119
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,399
I kind of threw away

120
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,679
His

121
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:56,447
Swiss Swatch

122
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,287
I appreciate it but I'm like

123
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:03,359
Alex have very intricate little Parts because they're free

124
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,127
Picking locks

125
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:06,687
And if you're going to run a motor through it you're going to need

126
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:07,711
Bits and pieces

127
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,527
The two things I thought of

128
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,551
This is one

129
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:17,951
I'm very curious who the acquirer was because this actually happened not too long ago to Zana

130
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,487
Which also

131
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,279
Had an acquisition fault

132
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:24,351
Do and then Heather abruptly shut operations

133
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:25,631
And then led to

134
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:28,447
Hiring everybody had now the lawsuit again

135
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,215
It's raining

136
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:30,751
But

137
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:32,543
This seems to be a common

138
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,311
Maybe another time

139
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,591
This seems to be a thread

140
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:35,359
Did this happen

141
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,919
There's a lot of kind of cannibalization have

142
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:41,759
I would also say that August which was acquired also

143
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:42,783
Late last year

144
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,063
Was not acquired

145
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:44,831
In like

146
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:47,391
A very fantastic deal this was a deal that

147
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:48,671
The shareholders barely

148
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,207
So

149
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:50,975
I'm going to say

150
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,767
Locks not a great place to

151
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,047
Now

152
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:56,095
Trying to do this

153
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:58,143
Is Amazon buying blink

154
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:02,495
Blank is a camera company it's a low power wireless camera come

155
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:05,823
It's actually pretty cool it was started by a semiconductor

156
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:09,407
Company that had this great ship that was selling for like five bucks

157
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,175
Zapata Lake

158
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:12,223
Companies was it in Media

159
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:12,991
Amelia

160
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:14,527
They were like

161
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:19,903
Hey what's a better way for us to show off are really awesome what they had was low power

162
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,183
Video processing

163
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:25,023
Analogy

164
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:25,791
Tiger Mart

165
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,607
So they built this camera system

166
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,887
And it

167
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:30,655
What's a good camera

168
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:31,935
And

169
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,983
Very cheap 99 bucks for

170
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,263
A wireless HD

171
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,287
Cameron ice

172
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,055
And

173
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,103
They've been on the market for

174
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,431
I saw I first heard they were on the market

175
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,455
The middle of last year

176
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:45,503
So again this was

177
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,575
Last year was definitely a time of m&a and trying to

178
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:50,111
It's going to start cleaning up some of the

179
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:52,415
Success in the smart home space

180
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,951
So I don't coming along

181
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:54,719
That time

182
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,999
I'm with a really high price

183
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,023
Product was just

184
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,583
Late for that

185
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,351
And

186
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:06,751
I think in 2018 what we're about to see is the beginning of incredible commodification and

187
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:10,591
Addition and that's what I said with Amazon buying blink I think this is

188
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,919
Not Just Like Glue Amazon has security goals sure everybody does

189
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:16,479
But it's also a sense and

190
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,759
A validation that

191
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,039
Holy cow

192
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,831
Price and getting a price down India

193
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:21,855
Just going to be sued

194
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:25,183
I think you're spot on I mean there's going to be a

195
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:30,815
Tan of price pressure now on newer products and even some of the older products are coming down in price

196
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:34,655
Quite a bit and we'll talk about my canary in a bit but I mean I got it for a song

197
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,191
No pun intended

198
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,983
No no I did not mean that I did not mean that

199
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,007
Does that make them sick

200
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,031
Marion

201
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:45,919
Could be yeah yeah they could be but I completely agree with you

202
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:46,687
I think

203
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:50,527
And that's good for consumers for the business side that's a whole different aspect

204
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,087
The profit margins in sustainability but

205
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,879
If you're a consumer on the lookout

206
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:57,951
You can expect I think to pay a lot less in 2018 than you did

207
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,487
In one or two years ago

208
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:00,767
Alright so

209
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,071
Best debate consumer device story

210
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,351
Let's talk about something that

211
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,375
1

212
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:06,911
Amazon has sold a lot of

213
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,519
We still don't know how many

214
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:12,799
Exact number of

215
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:18,431
Man-made devices that have been sold but Amazon did say in a press release right after Christmas

216
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,223
Tens of millions of

217
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,015
Echo devices with

218
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,039
You know who

219
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,063
We're sold worldwide

220
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,415
The echo Dot and Fire TV stick with the voice remote work not just

221
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:34,815
Top selling devices on Amazon in the holidays but they were the best line products from any manufacturer in any category

222
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:38,655
Maria cross Alabama's on so that's a pretty good indication of how many a lot

223
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,703
In another interesting aspect

224
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:43,519
Because it brings more people using the devices

225
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:46,591
They say that Tamela Mann on Fire TV

226
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:51,967
The usage in the US is up 889% over the same time. Last year it so

227
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:56,831
We talked about this the Fire TV in the voice before it's nice to see the cards in the TV

228
00:08:57,087 --> 00:09:01,183
I don't get into it that much but apparently a lot of people do so and that's all good for

229
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:01,951
For Amazon

230
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:02,975
Yes it is

231
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05,023
And they seem to be

232
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:10,911
Add a story

233
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:11,935
This week

234
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:16,287
About Amazon they talked to some people at Big brands

235
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:18,335
Clorox and it sounds like

236
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,127
Amazon is talking to them

237
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,407
About bringing advertising

238
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,175
Sing to the A

239
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:23,455
Now

240
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:24,735
This is

241
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:29,087
This is basically it's talking to them about letting them promote their products on there

242
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:32,159
Early discussion centered on

243
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:36,511
Whether companies would pay for higher placement if a user searches for a product

244
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:37,535
Such a shame

245
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,303
Poo

246
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,583
Kind of like how Google

247
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,399
I would say

248
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:43,935
That's a dumb way to monitor

249
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,871
Another possibility could be with promotional bits on skills and such

250
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:52,639
So

251
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:53,663
That might make

252
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,711
More sense to me than just

253
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:58,527
Inner product placement and search ads and such as

254
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:02,879
Approach I'd rather see it on the skills cuz I have a choice to install the skill or not

255
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:06,975
Yes and I think skills could become like the Campbell's cookbook

256
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:11,583
Marketing bright so instead of saying

257
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:17,215
Let me put your search higher why don't you give me some functionality that relates to your product and so if you guys don't know what

258
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:22,591
The Campbell's cookbook is Campbell's basically put out books that taught you how to make things using their

259
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,359
Air Products

260
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,663
Is it terribly innovative

261
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:26,687
No better

262
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,783
Clorox stain remover

263
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:34,623
How do I get it out

264
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,439
I would do that

265
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:41,279
You can suggest how to do it and then optionally

266
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:43,839
Say do you need any Clorox

267
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:44,607
Sylveon

268
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,375
Place the order

269
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,911
I think the opportunity here

270
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,191
Where is Les

271
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:50,751
Direct like a search engine based at

272
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:51,775
Which is like

273
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:55,871
Shirley based on the intent and War around brand building and marketing like a magazine

274
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:57,151
Voice is not

275
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,943
I don't think voice is going to be

276
00:10:59,199 --> 00:10:59,711
Good

277
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,735
4

278
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,015
This intent-based Mar

279
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,295
Because it's

280
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,831
It's a medium that Demands a

281
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:07,135
A quick information Exchange

282
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:07,903
So

283
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:13,023
Build trust with Brands you don't want to Brand taking of your valuable time telling you about

284
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,327
Disinfecting wipes while you ask

285
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,351
How long

286
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:17,887
7 elephants 2

287
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:18,655
Counter

288
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,447
So that's

289
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,727
My two cents

290
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,799
I'm sure that people will get it wrong before they get it right

291
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:30,431
I do think that Google's approach here might be a little smarter because they're looking at grabbing this data and trying to make

292
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,711
Products from it

293
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:33,503
And it'll be interesting to see

294
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:34,527
Anna Powell

295
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,063
Amazon figures this out

296
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:42,975
Yeah I think it's going to be a let's try a couple of different things and see what sticks and what people complain about versus what people are okay with

297
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:47,071
Plus how many more products to resell as a result of these

298
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,375
I would be super irritated

299
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:53,983
It already Amazon is pushing search results when I asked for like

300
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,287
Order more this

301
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:00,895
In

302
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:04,479
I know what I'm looking for so if one of the things I want is in a bundle

303
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:05,247
3 I'm not

304
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,087
I can see that

305
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:13,183
Yeah this is going to be interesting to see how this progresses and

306
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:16,511
Who does what in the space between Amazon Google I need a Microsoft

307
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,303
Okay let's

308
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,327
Talk about

309
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:21,631
Xiaomi

310
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:23,935
We shall we shall know

311
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:29,823
There's a report out from Navigant research that was talking about who is the

312
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:30,847
It's like a

313
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:34,175
Graph of who are the leading iot platform providers are

314
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,991
Gartner quadrant magic quadrant

315
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:39,807
McGrath and I noticed in the leader section IC

316
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:40,831
IBM

317
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:43,647
Okay that makes sense Microsoft okay that makes sense

318
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,439
AWS also makes sense

319
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:47,231
But then I saw no mention of alphabet

320
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:49,279
Google anime that doesn't make sense

321
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,303
Or does it

322
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:55,167
Maybe it does because where is and what is Google's iot platform

323
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,447
Oh my goodness

324
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:00,287
When Kevin brought this up

325
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,311
Ahead of the show

326
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,335
I would like

327
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:08,735
Will they have their serverless Computing option they have

328
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,527
Google Cloud functions

329
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,575
In beta

330
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,599
Witness

331
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,391
And

332
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,415
Then I was like

333
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:24,607
Cloud iot Core

334
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:25,631
Right

335
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,679
Do they have a job

336
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,215
That's that's where

337
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:31,519
Edge

338
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:34,847
Because you know if you got a w s has green grass

339
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,895
Microsoft actually has

340
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,175
Azure iot

341
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,991
Google doesn't really have an

342
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:44,319
I hate to say the word end-to-end option but they really do

343
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,111
Twerking

344
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:48,671
Yeah it's not mentioned

345
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,463
Very well on the Google Cloud

346
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:53,279
Site exora pee smell is not bundled

347
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,559
In my opinion

348
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:57,887
Can I talk to developers have used Android things

349
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:00,191
And they think it's actually really interesting

350
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:03,519
But I don't know anyone who's

351
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,055
Building Products

352
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,335
Exact

353
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,639
Yeah so this

354
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,407
Really does make

355
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,175
The question

356
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:11,711
Where

357
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:17,087
Like where's Waldo for what are you doing

358
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,927
Just to give some insight on because I did work

359
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:24,255
Google Pryor and I think I can say this without breaking any nda's

360
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,535
Google

361
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,815
Rightly things

362
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,863
Highly of itself and I seen that

363
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:29,631
Because

364
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,423
It's got some leading

365
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:35,007
Products and services with your billions of users

366
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:35,775
But

367
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:40,639
That is often the rationale behind we put a product out and people use it because

368
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:41,407
Google

369
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:47,039
And that's not a great strategy especially in this space which is heating up very fast

370
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:50,623
Hey Google does have a lot of the right pieces here that I would seek or

371
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:52,159
The guy Cloud Annex

372
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:54,463
Language in Cloud machine learning engine

373
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:56,511
And mention Cloud functions

374
00:14:57,023 --> 00:15:00,607
People are just going to use it because well it's Google where they got all the best stuff

375
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,655
There's got to be a cohesive

376
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,423
Bundled

377
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,191
Story

378
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:08,543
End-to-end and I don't see it between all of those Android things and so on

379
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,591
And what's crazy is they have

380
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,359
Nest

381
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,383
Interrupt

382
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,687
Right so they have

383
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:15,711
Millions

384
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:16,735
Switch is very very

385
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:18,783
Millions of connected devices

386
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:19,807
They're so they're sick

387
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:25,695
Does Google home and Google assistant on most Android devices over Android 5.0 I think

388
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:30,303
So Kathy understand Edge devices they understand Integrations

389
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,607
So

390
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:33,631
Hey

391
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:34,399
Google

392
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,167
What's up

393
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:35,935
Talk to us

394
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,983
We would love to explain

395
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:38,751
What you're doing

396
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:39,775
We would love to know

397
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,055
And I bet we're not alone

398
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:43,871
Moving on from our plea for infer

399
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,663
What does talk about

400
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:46,687
Quick news

401
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,735
Arrow

402
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:51,551
Which is a massive Electronics distributor

403
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:55,391
Is buying e info chips this is part of their iot strategy

404
00:15:55,903 --> 00:16:02,047
Which this one gets them from a distributor into more of a systems integrator there are thousands of iot based engineer

405
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:02,815
Beers from

406
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:03,583
This Indian

407
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,375
And

408
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:11,007
This makes a ton of sense we're seeing this both on Arrow as a distributor and also Avnet

409
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:15,615
Which is kind of a distributor they're all moving into systems integration for the iot

410
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,151
So we're seeing a bunch of

411
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,175
Consolidation

412
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,199
Up skills in

413
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:19,967
And the channel it's

414
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,247
Not exciting

415
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,271
I know but

416
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:23,295
Big and important

417
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,831
Nexa Roku

418
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:25,855
Wants to be your next

419
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,391
Voice assistant

420
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:34,815
Yeah I got a little surprised by this in one sense not surprised that they want to bring voice Computing to Roku

421
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:38,655
Power devices which are TVs they will be smart speakers as well

422
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:40,703
Is a part of this new licensing deal that

423
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,287
Roku Justin Bell this week but they're building the

424
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:50,687
Software themselves are not tying themselves to say Amazon voice Services Google or somebody else like that

425
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:57,087
They're going it alone and that may be okay because the initial push here is for controlling Home Entertainment

426
00:16:57,343 --> 00:17:00,927
Such as your wireless speakers your TV sound bars and so on

427
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:06,815
But it kind of leads me to think longer-term like if you're going to do that why not go all the way in

428
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:11,935
Control Smart Home devices with voice and if they're going to do that on their own I don't know that they have

429
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:15,007
I don't say don't know they have the chops to do cuz they make a great product

430
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,031
But did I

431
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,055
Apple chopstick

432
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:18,079
Out voice

433
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:20,895
The others in this market I'm not too sure about that but

434
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:27,295
Regardless will get the chance to see this next week at TCL which is one of their biggest OEM Partners will be debuting a Roku

435
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:30,111
Connect power device at CES so we'll take a look

436
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,135
Nowhere Roku

437
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:33,183
Here is where

438
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,207
Okay

439
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:36,511
There's a huge opportunity in voice

440
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:37,791
To say things

441
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:39,839
Hey Shelby the yada yada

442
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:42,655
And

443
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:43,423
Gracenote

444
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:44,959
4

445
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:52,383
I don't I don't disagree with you and I don't know cuz I haven't used it but I thought that Xfinity's

446
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:56,479
Software remote may do something similar it may not be as robust as that

447
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:58,527
And I also be curious to see if

448
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,319
YouTube TV which is

449
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:04,927
Obviously built from Google and Google search I mean Google has I think the best search results

450
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:09,023
I wouldn't be surprised if you could even do that there but I have not tested it

451
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,815
Yes so that's

452
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:15,423
Intel CPU flaw

453
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:19,519
So quit State of the Union

454
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:20,799
Because there's not

455
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:24,127
Whole ton of details this is something that is likely

456
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:25,151
What will affect clouds

457
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:27,967
Rebuilder colonel

458
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:28,735
Is that

459
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:34,367
Yeah it's there's no way to fix this from a hardware perspective it is going to be software patches across

460
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,391
PCS

461
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:38,207
Devices servers Etc yes

462
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:43,071
And we were wondering if it was going to affect iot devices it could affect gateway's Inn

463
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:46,143
Industrial gateways basically that are running Intel based chips

464
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:49,727
But for most smart home devices are running arm

465
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,775
Chips and usually not even rm60

466
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,055
Afford it now

467
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,335
We did find out

468
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,895
According to the register that they're also

469
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:59,967
Adding updates to the arm 64-bit

470
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:01,759
That

471
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:05,599
But we're not sure

472
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:12,767
Newer iot devices like brand-spanking-new may use 64-bit arm chips don't know I mean we have to research

473
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:17,375
What is a little concerning in at the very high level that's law which goes back I believe about

474
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,911
10 years worth of chips now

475
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:21,471
As I'm going to do with allowing users

476
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:24,799
Access to Kernel protected memory and that's a no no

477
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:27,359
I'm insecure

478
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:34,527
Cortana still can't talk to me

479
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:35,295
Even though

480
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,159
They were clock watcher

481
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:48,863
But the thing is I still don't know how it's supposed to work that hasn't been explained yet so I guess we're just going to undertale here it is

482
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,143
Is an here's how it works

483
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:51,679
Demonstration

484
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:53,215
I think so

485
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:53,983
We'll see that

486
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,103
You recently purchased a car

487
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:02,943
Canary which is the all-in-one security device that I actually recently recommended as a

488
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,247
Do you agree with me

489
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:11,903
I would agree with you I would I not just cuz I do the show with you I bought a canary and I know you tested a canary

490
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:15,743
I added a canary Flex as well I don't know if you tested that

491
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:20,351
I did but it was when I tested it was brand-spanking-new and it had a real issues

492
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:21,375
Mywifi net

493
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,911
Work is it was running dual band

494
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:24,447
Because that Euros showed

495
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,215
Unified band

496
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:32,127
And Google Wi-Fi with your values also do a single band of 2.4 + 5

497
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,663
Gigahertz together but I

498
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,223
Didn't have any problems setting either of these

499
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:40,831
Yeah so that's that was very good cuz I do have a problem with my ring doorbell book schreiber's off

500
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:42,367
Similar issue with the Bands

501
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:45,695
Regardless yes I think Canary sells the home unit

502
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:48,255
For 349 and the flex is additional

503
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,791
I don't know 1:50 or some like that

504
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:53,631
So is it done once it's either

505
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:54,911
When he first came out

506
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:57,215
Yes a long time ago

507
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:01,567
This is the price pressure I was living

508
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:06,687
Regardless I got the canary and the canary Flex for 149 together

509
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:07,455
Wow

510
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:10,783
Yes Costco was very good to me at Christmas time this year so

511
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:15,903
Yeah so that Canary unit is a cylinder with a HD video camera

512
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,440
Speaker microphone

513
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:20,000
Has a little light underneath that let you know when it's 4

514
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:22,048
Recording or video or you

515
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:24,864
Somebody's looking through their app to see video which is

516
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:31,264
It's nice to see it also has some sensors in it to measure your air quality temperature humidity and so on so forth with your handy

517
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,544
I don't really need that but it's

518
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,568
Candy again

519
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:34,592
Italian

520
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:37,920
I think someone just took a shower

521
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:39,712
Humidity level rises

522
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:43,808
It's funny you say that cuz I looked at the graph of the air quality humidity apparently

523
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:48,416
We breathe out a lot of CO2 because every morning we going upstairs air quality tanks

524
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:52,000
I don't get it

525
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:53,536
To know you should get some plan

526
00:21:54,304 --> 00:22:00,448
Yes we do need plants Virginia plants that's the gist of the canary unit and the canary Flex are they small

527
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,728
Little

528
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,008
5 in

529
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,056
Big Tylenol pill

530
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:07,360
With a camera and a microphone

531
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:11,712
It comes to the magnetic base so you can angle the video camera anywhere you want

532
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:15,040
It's an indoor outdoor camera I'm using it indoors only

533
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:18,368
And again no problems connecting it so answer for

534
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:20,928
What I like about the canary itself

535
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:22,976
The software I find is

536
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:23,744
Excellent

537
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:24,768
I love it

538
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:29,120
I like how you invite people to be part of the family and the reason you do that

539
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:30,656
Is because this

540
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:33,984
Auto arms and disarms based on geolocation if you want it

541
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,312
This is one of the Hang-Ups I had with the wink security system that I tested

542
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:39,104
There's no easy way to arm knit without

543
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:39,872
Going to the app

544
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:44,992
May I hear it just works automatically and even in the timeline in the app it says

545
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:51,392
Kevin just left home City just came home as soon as I work all of us are gone the system is armed if anybody is home

546
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:55,232
It will not be armed unless you want it to be armed like at night time and so on

547
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:57,792
I absolutely love that it's a little bit

548
00:22:58,048 --> 00:23:01,120
Zealous when it comes to the notifications and I mean

549
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:05,728
It's sending me notifications for like when a car passes by in the lights are seen and so on and so forth

550
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:12,128
Even when normally dog runs around which I would expect there's some masking features that I haven't used yet but I also bump down the sense of

551
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:14,176
Nativity what you can do on a per device level

552
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:20,832
And that has helped out quite a bit so there's a siren I have not even tried that yet cuz I want to freak the dog out but overall

553
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,904
Yeah I saw the decibel level that's why I didn't try it

554
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:29,024
But overall I really like it ticks all the boxes for me in terms of the right notifications

555
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:31,840
Automatic arming and disarming is fantastic

556
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:33,376
Wasn't very expensive

557
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:34,400
It was easy to set up

558
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:35,680
And the software itself

559
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:37,216
Really found to be

560
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:38,496
Very well-made my PIN

561
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:40,800
It may have been different when you used it I don't know

562
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:42,848
I did like it there were a couple things but again

563
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:43,616
It was very early

564
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:46,688
So does it work with Madam or Google home

565
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:49,504
It does not work with home cats

566
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,064
And it does work with my wink

567
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,416
And I thought maybe therefore would work with the echo button

568
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:57,696
Did a search for

569
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:00,000
AT&T app and it does not find it

570
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:04,864
I'm not sure what I'd use it for maybe arming at night or putting in night mode by voice or something

571
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,448
You know we're doing the camera on a show or something which I don't have so

572
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:09,472
I'm not too

573
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:10,496
Upset about that

574
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:12,288
Incompatibility at this point

575
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:14,080
One thing I would like to do and this is

576
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:15,872
Probably insane you tell me

577
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:20,224
When somebody comes home or somebody leaves I'd actually love for the echo to announce

578
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,248
Who laughed

579
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:25,856
Who came cuz I said you could do that because you can actually do it

580
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:28,928
And if tablet that's what I was hoping

581
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,488
So Wink 2 asked to

582
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:35,840
Wink and Sonos

583
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:37,376
Cassano's Network Sunwing

584
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,144
You should be able

585
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:39,680
Can't create a robot

586
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:40,960
There's my homework

587
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:42,496
Kevin has homework

588
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:43,520
It's a good show

589
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:47,616
To a voicemail from

590
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:53,248
The IRT podcast listener hotline is brought to you by Schlage maker of electronic lock

592
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:02,464

00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:06,048
To see what's possible visit schlage.com to learn more

594
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,888
I was just wondering

595
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:12,704
We were looking at getting my grandparents either

596
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,752
An echo dot or Google home Mini

597
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:15,776
For Christmas

598
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:18,336
They do not have a tablet or a smartphone

599
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:20,640
But they do have a Windows 10 laptop

600
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:23,712
What should I be aware of and do you guys have a recommendation

601
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:26,272
Either way appreciate the show thanks a lot by

602
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:28,064
Oh Adam

603
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,600
We have good news for you

604
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:30,624
Definitive

605
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,416
Your recommendation

606
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,976
What's an Amazon Echo

607
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:37,024
Explain why

608
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:43,168
There's a very good reason to go with an echo in this particular circumstance and that is you can actually

609
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:45,728
Configure and use an echo

610
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:46,752
To a web-based

611
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:47,520
App

612
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:48,800
On Amazon site

613
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:55,200
If you point your browser at Alexa. Amazon.com you'll have basically a Weatherford version of the

614
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:58,016
App that's used on smartphones to manage the echo devices

615
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:04,416
In fact I kind of think that the app is really built on web Technologies and they put a wrap around it but that's a guess.

616
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:07,744
Regardless you can do everything you need to do

617
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:10,816
Setting up the account and the devices right from there

618
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:11,840
Configure everything

619
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:15,424
You can type reminders you can do all sorts of stuff which is fantastic

620
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,704
Sex with no smartphone needed

621
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:19,008
You have to have a smartphone

622
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:23,360
To use the Google home or the Google mini that's the downside there's no

623
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,896
Computer-based way to

624
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:26,432
Work with us so

625
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:28,736
This site is a fine it's a gold mine I say

626
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:29,760
I think what do you think stays

627
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:33,088
I actually I was so excited because now knowing that

628
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:37,952
Type in reminders to go to my Echo Show which is downstairs in my kitchen knowing that I can do that

629
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:38,720
From far away

630
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:42,048
Or just to like if I'm not in town and I can just send

631
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:43,328
Reminder basically to Mike

632
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:44,096
Kitchen two people

633
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,120
I think that's awesome

634
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:47,680
Cuz I don't forget

635
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:49,216
Karate bag

636
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:51,520
I'm really excited about it

637
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,056
Why does her bag take karate

638
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:57,152
On that note

639
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,712
Sounds like a good time to go

640
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:02,272
To a word from our sponsor and then

641
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:04,320
T up our guest this week

642
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:05,600
Who is Chris Matthews

643
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:07,392
Of a new company

644
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:08,672
Quick compute Inc

645
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:09,696
Computes

646
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:10,720
Is basically

647
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:13,024
Gosh if you like combined

648
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,560
Iblocklist watching

649
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:15,584
For iot

650
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,608
With seti

651
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,400
I think that's where you're going to

652
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:19,680
That's the closest I can get

653
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:21,216
Aliens

654
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:21,984
Aliens

655
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:26,080
Explain all of that and more in a moment

656
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:34,016
Everyone we are taking a break from this week's podcast for a message from our sponsor this week sponsor is Lux

657
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:37,088
Products and we have robbed muninn CEO of Lex products

658
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:38,624
Rob can you

659
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,160
Quickly refresher audience with

660
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:41,696
30-second overview of the

661
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:43,488
I'll do it in 20

662
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:44,256
We are a

663
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:45,792
A proud philadelphia-based

664
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:47,072
Innovator of HVAC

665
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:51,936
Trolls and our newest product to the market is the Lux Kono smart thermostat

666
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:53,472
449 bucks

667
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:54,752
She got a thermostat with

668
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,032
It's a great look at has

669
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:59,360
The coarse knob covers connects all the major Voice assistance

670
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:01,408
And has smart features like GFS

671
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:03,200
Alright so now

672
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:04,480
We are well aware that

673
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:06,528
Dakota smart is your newest thermostat

674
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:10,112
One of the things that makes it different is that it's easy to use

675
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:14,976
So what type of approach did you take when designing this product that's different from other thermostat

676
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:18,560
But what we did was we tried to come up with something

677
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:19,328
Thing that would be

678
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:20,096
Obvious

679
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:21,120
Unintuitive

680
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,912
We know that from our research

681
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:23,936
The other smartphone

682
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:25,472
That they may look easy

683
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:27,520
You know you can turn the device but sometimes

684
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:28,800
The user interface

685
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:31,360
Can become confusing that's what I research shows

686
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:33,664
And some touchscreen models are inherently

687
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,688
Not intuitive

688
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:36,480
Very menu-driven and Liars

689
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:39,040
Two layers so when we looked at the Kona we wanted

690
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:40,064
Did you something that

691
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,088
Lyft office

692
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,112
And it wasn't

693
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:43,136
So with the

694
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:43,904
Control knob

695
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,696
If you are hot you

696
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:47,232
Turn it down to the left

697
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:48,768
And if you are cold you turn it up

698
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:49,536
To the right

699
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:52,352
We literally have 100% of

700
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,888
Consumers that we've talked to

701
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:54,656
Have said

702
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:55,424
I get it

703
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,960
I know how to operate that thermos

704
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:59,008
So turning the knob is awesome

705
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:02,592
But most smart thermostats have other features so let's talk about

706
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:03,616
How to get to those

707
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:04,640
We wanted

708
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:06,688
You keep it really simple on the wall

709
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:08,992
So you can make it warmer and cooler and sofa

710
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,040
Forethought means taking a lot of the other

711
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:13,344
Features and put them into the app

712
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,392
Where it's a much more natural place

713
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:18,464
To do things so we have our scheduling on the apus

714
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,304
Which is so easy to use we have a variety of energy saving profile

715
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,096
House to help set up the schedule quickly

716
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:26,144
And more importantly easily

717
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:27,936
In addition to controlling the

718
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,472
The app also has

719
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:31,008
The future we call Smart

720
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:32,032
That will help him

721
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:33,056
Realize that

722
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:35,104
Direct impact that their action

723
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,384
Tap on their wallet

724
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:41,504
So if they are changing temperature and they making more energy saving

725
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,272
Choice

726
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:43,808
Will push out a notification

727
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:45,856
And say good job you're going to save

728
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:46,624
This much

729
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,416
Percent of your bill would you like to make that app

730
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,440
Permanent setting

731
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:50,464
For your schedule

732
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:51,744
Have a choice Obby

733
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,512
Crystal yes or no

734
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:55,584
Will also offer tippit have to do with energy saving

735
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,352
Friends

736
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:57,632
Sensing the change of season

737
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:59,424
It's always a good reminder to know she

738
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:04,544
Should you look at the caulking on your window and the weather stripping that you have going into the cold

739
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:08,896
And if you had to pick out one feature in the corner that's your favor

740
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:09,920
What would it be

741
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:12,224
I think what I would say is it's got to be tonight

742
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:12,992
It's just

743
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:15,552
Put it on the wall and

744
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:16,832
Even if you have Grandma

745
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:17,600
Come over who

746
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:20,928
Might not like connected products struggles with the smartphone

747
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:22,208
When she's cool

748
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:26,048
She'll know how to change the thermostat to make it warmer in the guarantee

749
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:28,864
Excellent and Rob where can we go to find out more

750
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:29,888
Well you can

751
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:31,936
Could stop by your local Home Depot stores

752
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:36,288
You could go online to Luxe products.com and you can shop all over the intern

753
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:49,600
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your house Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest is

754
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:50,880
Chris Matthews

755
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:52,416
Hi Chris how are you doing

756
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:57,280
Hey Stacey great and you I am super well so you guys may remember

757
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:58,560
Hardcore listeners

758
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:00,608
Should remember that Chris came on

759
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:04,192
Couple years ago to talk about different protocols for Io

760
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,288
Now he's back with his own startup called computer

761
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:10,336
Ink and we are going to get into

762
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,616
Are you ready for it y'all

763
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:12,640
Basically

764
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:15,200
Blacklist blockchain for the internet

765
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:19,040
That's exactly a decentralized distributed

766
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:20,064
Supercomputing

767
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,112
Music

768
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:25,440
So before everyone freaks out his like

769
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:26,208
Quick

770
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:28,768
I need to get my brain in gear

771
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:30,560
We're going to talk first about your vision

772
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:32,864
Because I think it's important to start with

773
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,400
Why decentralisation

774
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:35,424
It's going to be so

775
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:36,448
Essential

776
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:39,520
Indeed I mean

777
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:45,920
Look at the numbers we keep hearing about 75 billion connected devices like by 2023

778
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:49,760
The cloud wasn't made to handle all of that

779
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:53,088
Machine data uploads and processing and

780
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,672
Go back down to things like driverless vehicles and all the

781
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:57,696
All the cool

782
00:31:57,952 --> 00:32:00,768
Fantastic iot devices coming our way soon

783
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,048
Sure in

784
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,584
There's actually president

785
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,120
It is so in the data center

786
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:07,168
Way back in the day there was like

787
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:08,960
Like back and forth up and down

788
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:10,240
Traffic to the data center

789
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:14,848
But then as things like Facebook and Amazon

790
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,896
Things had to start pulling data for

791
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:17,920
From server to server

792
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:18,944
In the dataset

793
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,736
To like deliver the right

794
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,272
About

795
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:24,064
Became that was called East West traffic

796
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:25,088
And

797
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:27,392
The companies that were building big

798
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:29,696
Cloud computing and had big data centers

799
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:33,024
They actually had to invent a whole new ways of networking in

800
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:33,792
Software

801
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:35,840
To handle with a call East-West track

802
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:36,608
Taking the Datacenter

803
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:38,400
And what we're seeing now

804
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:42,752
Is a need to build that same sort of infrastructure

805
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:46,336
At the edge to handle all these devices sharing data

806
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:50,176
Between themselves in among themselves without going back to the cloud

807
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:52,480
That's because of latency it's

808
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:53,248
Cost

809
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,272
It is

810
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:56,064
Security even so

811
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:57,088
There is a

812
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:57,856
A big

813
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:00,160
You saw this need Chris

814
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:01,440
And then what did you say to

815
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,256
I should do something about the

816
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:05,024
How did we get here

817
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:11,936
What evil yes like you you look at all of these devices around us I mean they're idle like just like your laptop typic

818
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:15,008
Glee 80% of the time you're the fast room fast

819
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:17,568
Processors in them even GPU some of them

820
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:23,712
And they're idle 80% of time they chirp you know maybe every minute with their temperature status or what-have-you but

821
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:24,480
What is

822
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:26,784
All of these devices could just

823
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,344
Tear with each other even despair devices

824
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,648
Different manufacturers different machines

825
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:32,672
What if they could just

826
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:34,464
Pier with one another

827
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:36,512
And either requests work

828
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:38,048
Or perform work

829
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,120
For each other kind of in the secure mesh Network

830
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:43,424
It kind of got me thinking that we've got

831
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:47,264
A dramatic increase of more devices coming to the market

832
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:51,616
And at the same time a dramatic increase sperm or more computing power

833
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:53,920
For machine learning for AI

834
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:55,456
The cool automation

835
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:57,760
Things we want to do with these devices

836
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:00,320
Why not intersect the 2in

837
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:01,600
Make them Act

838
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:03,648
Stink like they're one

839
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:06,208
Interconnected peer-to-peer

840
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:07,232
Secure super

841
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:08,768
Okay

842
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,328
We're going to question such as

843
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:12,608
Battery life

844
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,632
Button

845
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:14,912
Beforehand

846
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,704
Your solution

847
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,472
Into this

848
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:18,496
Is decentralized

849
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,032
And

850
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:21,312
To take I feel like

851
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:22,848
Before we get into

852
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:24,384
What you guys are actually build

853
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,688
We should probably go into the history

854
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:27,712
Watching

855
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:28,736
Because

856
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:31,296
For people who are not familiar with it it's important to understand

857
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:32,320
And how that works with

858
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:33,856
Before we get into The Blacklist

859
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,952
Dip that's a great point of mean everyone seemed excited about

860
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:44,352
Bitcoin right like you can't turn on the radio or look at an article without someone mentioning something about the spray

861
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:46,144
Crazy price in Bitcoin wallet

862
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:47,424
That was

863
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:51,008
Built on blockchain technology going back

864
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:52,032
10 years now

865
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,128
So while it's a very cool idea you know it's allowing us to

866
00:34:56,384 --> 00:35:01,504
Create decentralized distributed applications are currencies cryptocurrencies

867
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,040
That technology

868
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:04,832
It's kind of heavy and slow

869
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:07,136
All of this Computing that has to happen

870
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:08,160
Mike proof-of-work

871
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:11,232
Every node on the blockchain has to have the

872
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,000
Entire

873
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:14,304
Blockchain itself like

874
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,864
Copy of it in storage and

875
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,680
They're constantly updating an entire database if you

876
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:20,448
She will

877
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:24,032
Across each other all the time and doing this proof of work

878
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,312
Computations

879
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:28,384
To keep this blockchain Ledger in sink so

880
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:30,176
You can look at it as

881
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:32,224
Bitcoin or another crypto

882
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,064
Two currencies run on the blockchain in a blockchain is really no more than

883
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:37,088
Egg

884
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:38,624
Decentralized

885
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,928
Database like a database where every

886
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:41,696
Pier

887
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:43,744
On a network has a copy of it

888
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:45,536
Now proof of work

889
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:47,328
Which is essential for

890
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,120
Establishing authenticity

891
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:50,400
Correct

892
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:52,448
Want to make sure 4

893
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:58,592
And that's kind of the point of

894
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:00,640
What chain is it the distributor

895
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:01,664
2

896
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:02,688
Trust

897
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:03,456
Things

898
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:04,992
Which is really exciting

899
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:06,016
Coyote

900
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:07,040
And I always

901
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:08,576
It was like and it's scales

902
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:11,648
So what you're telling me here is that it doesn't scale

903
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:13,440
Or at least it doesn't scale

904
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:16,256
Very fast speeds and it takes a lot of power

905
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:18,816
Entire database

906
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:23,168
Yeah you know I think the Bitcoin blockchain last I looked at

907
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:24,960
The three-point numbers with something around 3

908
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:29,056
Three transactions a second theory emits biggest kind of blockchain

909
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,848
Competitor platform is

910
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:32,128
Somewhere around

911
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:34,688
A dozen transactions per second so

912
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:36,224
You can see that y'all

913
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:40,320
For the world moving all of these it devices to that type of

914
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:41,088
Technology

915
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:46,208
What's really cool is decentralized it stressful than a trustless environment

916
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:51,072
It is having some difficulty scaling to meet the demand of all of the nodes coming online

917
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,096
For reference

918
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:52,864
It's just so you

919
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:53,888
Case you guys want to know

920
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:55,936
Lisa says it handles more than 24

921
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:56,704
4000

922
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:00,800
That's a big disparity

923
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:02,848
So when we're talking about

924
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:04,896
Visa is the largest

925
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:07,456
Payment processor in the world

926
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:08,992
Kind of what we're hoping for right

927
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,064
Let's talk about the evolution

928
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:13,600
Because

929
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:16,672
There's been a couple there's one that's huge in the internet.

930
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:17,696
Things called the iota

931
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:19,232
And these are so-called

932
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:20,768
Blocklist watching

933
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:22,048
Explain what

934
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:29,216
Yeah and computer is doing something very similar to what I owed is doing and I do truly believe this is kind of neck

935
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:29,984
Next gen

936
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:31,520
Blockchain like

937
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:32,800
Technology so

938
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:37,920
The idea is to throw a few acronyms at you and will maybe try to break them down but

939
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:40,736
There's this technology called a dag

940
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:44,320
A d a g and it's a directed acylic graph

941
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:50,976
It's not new developers that have been writing code using git and GitHub have been using gags whether they know it

942
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:53,280
For a decade now

943
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:58,400
The idea is that it's a bunch of like branches off of a tree where every

944
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:02,496
Commit or every update has a hash

945
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:04,032
A crypto hash

946
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:06,848
Is colic a 36 character Looking hash

947
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,896
That it relates back

948
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:10,432
To what its parents were

949
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:12,224
So you can kind of take one

950
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:14,016
Update in the system

951
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:17,856
And trace it all the way back through all the branches

952
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:19,648
Is the trees the parents to create

953
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:21,184
Basically a ledger

954
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,488
Of all of the transactions of happen

955
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:24,256
Intimidate

956
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:25,536
Without having

957
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:27,840
To do things like proof of work

958
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:31,168
Where you're actually having to track blocks and crate

959
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:34,240
Ashes of blocks to connect in the Dag

960
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:35,776
Automatically

961
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:40,384
Associate transactions with one another that allow you to trace it all the way back

962
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:42,176
Without proof of work

963
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:43,456
The other ideas at

964
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:44,992
It's very fast

965
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:45,760
Like

966
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:49,856
I'm kind of seeing the some of the earlier designs of computers being

967
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:51,136
Faster

968
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:52,928
5 more nodes you add

969
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:59,328
To the system that's counterintuitive how blockchain Works in one more other really important thing I think as it applies iot

970
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:01,376
Is that with the Dag

971
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:05,984
You don't have to maintain that entire database of transactions

972
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,776
On the iot device

973
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:09,056
They all just become

974
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:12,384
Computers that can read and write to kind of a

975
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,432
Mesh network of a dag so

976
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:16,224
Devices like

977
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,528
I don't know like maybe a hue lighting or

978
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:22,880
The Nest thermostats where they don't have enough storage to maintain like a

979
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:23,904
Blockchain

980
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:25,952
They could then participate

981
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:28,256
On networks like

982
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:31,072
What Iota is building and what computers building

983
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:32,352
And so you got

984
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:33,632
Very fast transaction

985
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:36,448
Very low storage if any

986
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,800
Basically an infrastructure less blockchain like technology

987
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,104
Let's break some things down

988
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,128
So what I'm thinking of

989
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:46,688
Is 36 character hash

990
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:48,224
I'm thinking

991
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,064
Would a good analogy be something like in Latin America for example

992
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,088
But you have people

993
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:55,136
You take your mother's maiden name

994
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:56,672
You take your father's name and you

995
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:57,440
Become to know

996
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:58,976
Crispy out Ramirez

997
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:00,768
And then your kid be

998
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:03,072
You always bring your mother's

999
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:06,656
So it's that

1000
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:07,680
Now

1001
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:08,448
How many

1002
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:09,728
Characters like

1003
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:11,264
How does this hash happen

1004
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:12,800
And how does it

1005
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:14,848
I mean there's only so many numbers and letters in

1006
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,128
How is it unique

1007
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:17,152
Can how do you follow that

1008
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:18,944
Yes sir

1009
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,224
You can also go back

1010
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,784
From a security perspective decades

1011
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:28,672
Thinking of how the Shah system works like sha-256 or Rochelle one what have you

1012
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:32,768
Have you eaten

1013
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:33,536
Talk to me

1014
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:37,376
So there's this concept in cryptography where you can take

1015
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:39,424
Any content it could be

1016
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:44,032
A text new string or it could be like an address or could be like a

1017
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:45,312
Encyclopedia

1018
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,080
She will

1019
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:48,128
And you can run

1020
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:49,152
A crypto

1021
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:55,552
Algorithm against it then there's a few there's like md5 and charges some examples of what I'm talking about

1022
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:58,368
And what they do is they give you back at unique

1023
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,392
Hash

1024
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:01,440
A string of like alphanumeric

1025
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:03,232
Text with some dashes in it

1026
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:05,024
That always

1027
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,816
Equate to what you just

1028
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:08,864
Okay set a reverse so if

1029
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:09,888
If you have

1030
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:12,192
The algorithm that was used to create this

1031
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:14,496
In Rio de Oro

1032
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:16,800
Then you can read it

1033
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:19,360
Then you can run your hash algorithm

1034
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:20,384
And get all the info

1035
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,152
Formation you need

1036
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:27,040
Well kind of so it's not decrypt Apple so it's a one-way it's like a one-way hash but what's

1037
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:30,112
Interesting though is that if you add one

1038
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:34,208
Space near to that document and you rehash it the hashes are

1039
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:38,304
So it is a way of always saying okay if I'm looking for

1040
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,608
This file that says hello world

1041
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:44,448
It will always have that same hash no matter if I right

1042
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:45,472
The file or you right

1043
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:46,240
Pedophile

1044
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:47,520
It's a way of

1045
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:49,568
I guess uniquely identifying

1046
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:52,640
A resource on this kind of peer-to-peer

1047
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:53,919
Infrastructure

1048
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:54,943
By saying

1049
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:56,479
We're all going to Hash it the same

1050
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:57,247
Same way

1051
00:41:57,759 --> 00:42:01,343
And even a. Or space is going to give us a different hash it's a

1052
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:02,111
Profile

1053
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:03,391
Okay

1054
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:04,671
So this is the day

1055
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:07,231
We've got a sense of what the dag is

1056
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:08,767
What else do we need

1057
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:10,047
So

1058
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:10,815
Like with

1059
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:12,607
Computes anyway the Dag

1060
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:17,727
Is cool everything that's a way of kind of creating like you explain kind of names are parents

1061
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:18,495
In history

1062
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:22,591
But there needs to be a way kind of like the blockchain works where

1063
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:25,151
You need to have something that knows how to

1064
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:25,919
Handle

1065
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:27,711
Choose if you will like

1066
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:29,503
With computes you can say

1067
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:32,319
Like say the nest Princeton's could say

1068
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:35,135
This is just totally hypothetical but the nest could say

1069
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:38,719
Hey I need to do some machine learning on whether or not

1070
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:41,791
This person that owns me is home or not can anyone help me

1071
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:47,935
Maybe cuz maybe I don't have enough processing power do it all by myself and I don't want to send it all to the Google Cloud

1072
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:50,495
Maybe I could have my Hue Lights and

1073
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:54,591
My owners Mac and maybe some raspberry Pi's are sitting around

1074
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:56,127
Like all

1075
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:57,663
Join in when needed

1076
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:01,503
And could do some computations to help me figure out

1077
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:05,087
If someone's home or not based on these machine-learning algorithms

1078
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:06,879
That type of

1079
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:10,207
Process requires some type of orchestrator

1080
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:15,327
Decentralized q-type technology that knows how to say here are all the

1081
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:18,911
Yeah hundreds or thousands of computations that need work

1082
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:22,751
Who's available know who has extra resources

1083
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:25,823
Who can run JavaScript who can run python

1084
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:27,103
Yo what have you

1085
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:30,687
And distribute that work in such a way where there's really

1086
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:33,759
No servers persay in this environment

1087
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:36,063
It's just all of these piers

1088
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:39,135
Know how to communicate with one another and

1089
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:40,671
Help each other out

1090
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:41,695
Tachevah

1091
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:44,767
Yo computations and whatnot locally

1092
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:48,095
Amongst themselves in a secure fashion without going to the

1093
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:48,863
The cloud sofa

1094
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:52,447
That's kind of another layer to this tag ideas that you need

1095
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:56,031
Some other way of writing decentralized apps

1096
00:43:56,287 --> 00:44:00,383
That know how to run in this type of environment so you need a brain for

1097
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:02,687
Decentralized app so everything has to have

1098
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:03,711
A brain

1099
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:05,503
Betabrand

1100
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:08,575
Pretty pretty resource-intensive or memory-intensive

1101
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:10,111
I would think so

1102
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:11,647
How do you handle that

1103
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:18,303
But yeah that's kind of the cool thing I remember and I can't remember if it was Cisco or who used to sneak this claim like

1104
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:22,911
Ocwen switches were getting really popular they would say that the network is the computer

1105
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:25,471
Hello is fascinated by that idea but I think

1106
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:30,079
What we're building now truly is that the network itself

1107
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:31,103
Is the brain

1108
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:37,759
Like all of the nodes there's no servers they just know how to organically self-organized selfie

1109
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:39,039
Real self

1110
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:41,087
Collaborate with one another

1111
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:44,927
To do various machine learning or AI related

1112
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:45,951
Jobs

1113
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:46,975
Okay

1114
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:48,255
But what do

1115
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:50,303
The individual devices need

1116
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:51,839
In order to be able to

1117
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:53,375
Participate in this

1118
00:44:54,399 --> 00:45:00,543
Dip perfect question so with computes they would need a very small little five megabyte size

1119
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:01,567
Is very small

1120
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:05,151
What we call a nano core or computes manticore

1121
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:06,687
That gives them

1122
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:07,455
The

1123
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:12,575
Operations to automatically match with one another and

1124
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:14,111
Join that Dag

1125
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:17,183
And participate in that queuing

1126
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:18,207
Brain

1127
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:19,231
Technology

1128
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:20,767
I feel like we're saying brains on

1129
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:24,351
Okay

1130
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:26,655
You know I have a fascination

1131
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:29,727
For Skynet I'm always trying to build Skynet weather

1132
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:31,775
Do octopus do or what have you been

1133
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:33,567
You could almost kind of

1134
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:34,335
Look at like

1135
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:36,895
Relationship that it was

1136
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:37,919
Global

1137
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:39,711
Decentralized

1138
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:40,991
Neural-net supercab

1139
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:42,783
Right

1140
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:46,623
I know you love Skynet but

1141
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:51,231
What was the we're going to build a nice version of Skynet

1142
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:55,583
So I can put this on the device is something that

1143
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:59,423
You don't manufacturers will need to do is this stuff that like I has a

1144
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:02,495
The crazy individual in my house want to do like how does that work

1145
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:11,711
I like great example I think it's all of the above so we were talking with computer vision company the other day

1146
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:18,367
And they were telling me that they're using cameras basically a sensors new iot devices as sensors but not for video stream

1147
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:25,023
And they were saying that to do the machine learning they needed to Dubai on each camera that they needed like an octave

1148
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:28,607
Core processor that was doing all of this machine learning

1149
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:30,655
In real time on the camera

1150
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:31,679
NetSpend

1151
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:33,727
Yeah right right right

1152
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:38,847
So what they were asking is you if there's a hundred cameras around a facility in office

1153
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:40,127
Complex or camp

1154
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:42,175
Could they distribute

1155
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:45,759
The work two cameras that have no change in video

1156
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:49,087
So that you could argana Klee kind of crate this message

1157
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:52,671
Share the processing workload across the entire network

1158
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:56,511
So that maybe you could get away with like a Raspberry Pi level

1159
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:57,791
Processor needs

1160
00:46:58,047 --> 00:46:58,559
Cameron

1161
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:02,655
So in that instance they would be interested in Gnomeo emminger

1162
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:06,239
Deploying computes just basically inside of their cameras

1163
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:07,775
But to your other point

1164
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:10,847
I think we're near the whole Bitcoin movement

1165
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:13,407
It's kind of got a lot of people thinking about

1166
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:14,687
Uber

1167
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:16,479
Supercomputing idea like

1168
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:17,503
What if

1169
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:18,527
You have

1170
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:19,807
Idle City

1171
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:21,343
Use on your Mac

1172
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:25,439
And you want to earn some extra money by letting

1173
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:28,511
Computer run on those the only secure fashion

1174
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:30,047
That allows other

1175
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:36,447
Companies to use your idle CPUs and gpus for computations but pay you for it so kind of like

1176
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:38,239
Uber when you say

1177
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:39,519
I want to drive for an hour

1178
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:41,055
Well you can say I want to

1179
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:43,871
Share my CPUs for an hour maybe you'll make

1180
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:46,431
Now $5 an hour or whatever

1181
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:48,991
Ambition the size of your processing power

1182
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:51,295
Yeah you could earn you accordingly

1183
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:53,087
How to say that micropayments

1184
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:53,855
They're not quite sure

1185
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:55,903
And I have lots

1186
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:59,487
Talk to so many companies over the years who have tried to do that

1187
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:01,023
Various iterations

1188
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:02,303
And

1189
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:03,327
Almost all of them

1190
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:04,095
Have pivoted

1191
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:05,119
So

1192
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:06,399
I'm a little worried about that ass

1193
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:07,679
But I like it

1194
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:17,919
Yeah I think it's a good point I think we're focusing burst is really B2B so we're looking at companies you know that have

1195
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:22,271
Was already thousands of servers thousands of workstations

1196
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:27,647
Yo they see the demand for more more machine-learning computations coming at them and

1197
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:28,671
Rather than

1198
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:31,743
Buying more servers or more cloud services

1199
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:33,279
Yo what if they could just

1200
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:35,071
We could harness all of that

1201
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:35,839
Wasted

1202
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:36,863
Compute

1203
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:42,239
In their existing hardware and give them basically access to the very own supercomputer

1204
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:48,639
Without nail buying any additional Hardware so that's the first goal but I think to your second Point are your point about the

1205
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:49,407
Micropayments

1206
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:50,431
I think with the

1207
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:56,575
Blockchain it's too expensive to do those proof of work and computations wear something like that

1208
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:58,623
Which really efficient really fast

1209
00:48:58,879 --> 00:49:02,719
That might be the right technology to finally make micropayments work

1210
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:05,791
When we get around to doing BTC type activity

1211
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:07,327
Okay let's see

1212
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:08,607
I feel like we've

1213
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:09,887
We covered a lot of things

1214
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:11,679
Is there something else you wanted

1215
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:12,703
Well

1216
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:18,079
I agree with you I think this is fascinating to me I've been thinking about this for a couple of years now

1217
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:19,615
And this idea that

1218
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:23,199
Any device regardless of operating system

1219
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:26,015
Even using clouds themselves uidaho

1220
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:27,295
Computing clouds

1221
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:29,087
All connected together

1222
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:35,999
Could be something very interesting especially as you know a lot of vendor iot platform companies are trying to figure out how to

1223
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:36,767
Shift

1224
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:39,071
From Cloud to the edge

1225
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:45,471
A lot of them are taking approaches where your they're deploying new appliances on the edge I think this concept

1226
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:46,751
Is a lot of Merit wear

1227
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:47,775
Each

1228
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:49,311
Device or each

1229
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:51,359
Computing resource basically

1230
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:55,455
Is an auteur is a core on this mesh Network

1231
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:56,479
We

1232
00:49:56,735 --> 00:49:59,551
May reach a point where you don't need an appliance

1233
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:02,879
Anymore just basically everything computes

1234
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:05,183
And ultimately it's infinite

1235
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:06,463
Computing I think

1236
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:07,743
In this new world of

1237
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:08,511
CEO of

1238
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:11,327
Hockey stick number of devices coming to Market in

1239
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:14,911
They're getting more more powerful I think this is just fascinating

1240
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:17,727
You can be in and it's not easy I mean there's a lot of

1241
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:19,263
Google problems we're having to solve

1242
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:21,055
Computer science related problems

1243
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:23,103
But I think that's what makes it

1244
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:25,151
Even more fun and even more fascinating

1245
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:28,479
Okay so we're not going to see you guys doing an initial coin off

1246
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:29,759
I'm crazy like that

1247
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:32,575
Stay tuned maybe I don't know

1248
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:33,599
We'll see

1249
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:36,415
Chris thanks so much for coming on the show

1250
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:38,207
Thank you Stacey loved it

1251
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:45,119
That's it for this week thanks so much for listening and remember if you'd like more iot news

1252
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:51,519
Sign up for my newsletter at Stacey on iot. Cam will see you next week
