Camera company

24
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,840
But I wonder if it's maybe

25
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:08,608
Trend

26
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,912

It's time

M4

57
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:34,624
Water meters and water monitoring

58
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:40,000
So thin is a company that we have talked about a whole bunch I've even had people from the

59
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,792
Company on the show as a guest

60
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:42,816
And

61
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:43,840
This is an

62
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:45,120
Spit out from Belkin

63
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,192
And uponor which is a

64
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,216
Professional Plumbing

65
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,520
A couple years ago

66
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,288
Created

67
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,056
A

68
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:56,384
Was about $800 sensor in since gun down to 619

69
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:58,688
But this was a sensor that

70
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:00,736
Plumber installed on your water meter

71
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,296
And it monitored

72
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,320
Your home for

73
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:06,624
Ford leaks slow leaks past leagues all time

74
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:08,416
And

75
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,184
I loved it

76
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,208
I thought it was cool

77
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,000
I thought it was way too much money

78
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,024
So

79
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,608
What they've done now is created a $299

80
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,376
Product

81
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,912
It's under your sink

82
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,496
It goes under the kitchen sink so what you need to do

83
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:25,312
Anyone can install it you don't have to have a plumber

84
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,080
You sick

85
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,360
You unthread your

86
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,896
Curse you turn off your water

87
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,176
That's the first part sorry

88
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:32,224
Then you unthread

89
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,320
You enter at the hot water line to cold water line you stick a sensor up on each side

90
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:38,112
And then you plug this thing in

91
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,672
Which means you do need to have power under your

92
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,208
And

93
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,232
Guala

94
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:46,304
You now have something it will monitor water flow

95
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:48,352
It cannot turn off the wall

96
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,632
Water if a leak is data

97
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,936
So what you'll get is a series about

98
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:52,704
Alerts

99
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:57,056
And that's very different from those 699 version which does turn off your water

100
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,336
Yes but

101
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,616
I think people really didn't

102
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,384
Want to pay

103
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,456
I'm curious how with

104
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:09,088
Ashley Manor is the entire hot and cold water flow of the house just from that

105
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,136
One set of pipes in the kitchen

106
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:11,904
Algorithm

107
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:15,488
Algorithms are best friends

108
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:19,583
This is my favorite answer I'd like to know if your secret magic algorithm

109
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,935
But what they've done is they taken I mean and they do have a lot of research on how water

110
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:24,703
Close to the house

111
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:28,287
They're basically using that research and

112
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,079
The accompanying sensors

113
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:32,383
To understand water pressure

114
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,407
Carflo

115
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:34,687
And

116
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:38,527
What's cool on this particular one because they have both the hot and the cold

117
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:39,295
Water

118
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,855
And there I guess inside the house

119
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:46,719
They can tell you a little bit more great early what device is being used so

120
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:47,999
On the

121
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,535
External expensive model

122
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,095
They can say hey a shower is

123
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:52,863
Running

124
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,911
But here they can actually tell you

125
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,447
It's a shower in the master bedroom

126
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,239
Or it's your teenager shower

127
00:04:59,007 --> 00:04:59,775
Holy cow

128
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:01,055
Using all the hot water

129
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:03,871
So I thought that was kind of interesting in this won't come out

130
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:04,895
Until September

131
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:07,455
But it's something I really want

132
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,223
To try

133
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:09,503
Because

134
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,271
This

135
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,807
It sounds like it'll do

136
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:13,599
Most of what I wanted to do

137
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,647
And worst case scenario I can call my neighbor

138
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:18,207
Turn off the water it's leaking

139
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,487
Yeah it's

140
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:25,375
Obviously much more cost-effective and I wonder if this has something to do with it because

141
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:29,471
On the prowl page it says if you have a leak or abnormal you said you didn't alert

142
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:34,847
The Smart Water assistant gives you the option to contact a plumber in app

143
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,895
Partnership with HomeAdvisor

144
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,431
Oh yeah they do have it

145
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:40,223
I don't think that's

146
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:40,991
Nefarious

147
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:50,719
I just wonder if that's another Revenue stream that partnership in that can help keep the cost lower than it would have been without it

148
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:54,047
I think the thing that keeps the cost as low as possible

149
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:56,863
Is the fact that you don't have a motor that store

150
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:03,519
Which is a shut-off that's a very expensive thing to do and you have to over engineer it because you're

151
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:04,799
Essentially dealing

152
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:05,567
With the water in

153
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,103
And people sound so you don't answer that

154
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:09,663
So yeah I'm excited

155
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:15,295
I am one of those weird people who don't have power under my sink so I'm going to have to have an electrician come in in

156
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,831
And install an outlet

157
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,367
Most people will

158
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:20,671
Because they've got a garbage disposal

159
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:25,023
This is something I talked about actually when I installed the Madam a power

160
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,047
Faucet

161
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,839
Thank the Delta faucet

162
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,119
And

163
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:31,167
Not everybody has power

164
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:34,239
Ran under my sink I do score

165
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,519
But in my new house I don't

166
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:36,799
Soho

167
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:39,359
I'm a little sad but I do have a junction box

168
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,895
For my dishwasher

169
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:46,015
You're in a place that doesn't have a dishwasher or a garbage disposal I'm going to bet you don't

170
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,039
Empower under your sink

171
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:48,575
And

172
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:51,391
You may we should just you should just move

173
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,159
Basically

174
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:54,463
Just leave same if you don't have neutral wire

175
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,999
It's just go

176
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,303
Oh it is terrible

177
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:02,399
But yeah and if you're building a new house in this sort of thing sounds interesting to you

178
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,935
Maybe you'll make sure there's power

179
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:04,959
Under your sink

180
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:08,031
Would also recommend power somehow behind your shower

181
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:10,079
If you are interested in smart showers

182
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,359
@stacy

183
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:14,175
Plumbing and electricity to go together tip

184
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,199
For today

185
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,527
This is a cool product I'm excited

186
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:19,551
2

187
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,367
Try it out and I'm sure once I do

188
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,391
I will

189
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:26,207
Be able to tell you more it's going to work by the way with

190
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,999
Madame a Google Assistant

191
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,279
And with if

192
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:33,375
Okay moving over from under the sink technology

193
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,399
Let's talk about

194
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:36,447
Lights

195
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:38,495
Blinds

196
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,311
No action

197
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:43,103
This is a terrible Segway

198
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,383
But we're sticking with

199
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,407
Ikea

200
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,967
My favorite furniture store has launched

201
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:49,247
It's

202
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,783
HomeSmart business

203
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,063
As a separate business

204
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:55,903
And it will be headed by your block who's been on the show twice

205
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:58,207
Congratulations Bjorn

206
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,279
All right that feels about a seller

207
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,559
Victoria's Swedish

208
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:05,887
I don't know

209
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:06,655
I don't know

210
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:12,031
I actually did not realize it the Ikea smart home effort started back in 2012

211
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:14,079
Yes they've been doing this a while

212
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:16,383
While and what's interesting about the

213
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,663
HomeSmart

214
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,687
Business

215
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,735
Or what apparently was not its own business

216
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:21,759
Was that

217
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:25,599
The whole goal was not actually create things that were

218
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:28,671
Connected to the internet it was to integrate technology into things

219
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:33,023
Furniture so things like remember they have that table that does wireless charging

220
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:35,839
So

221
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,703
I did not say that

222
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:42,239
I did not have enough

223
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,519
Ivan maisel

224
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:44,799
But the

225
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:45,823
If since

226
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:49,663
Really focused on and they have a very different idea it's not just adding connect

227
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,431
Nativity it's like

228
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:52,479
Hey how can we make products in the hole

229
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:53,759
Man Furniture in Chennai

230
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,039
Easier to

231
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,575
And that is their core

232
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,111
Which is

233
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,903
Why they made some of the decisions

234
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,439
Around

235
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,207
Things like

236
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:05,023
Connectivity Technologies the fact that

237
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,351
Tri-City lights are their own system and

238
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,911
All of that work together it doesn't

239
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:13,215
Integrated out with other stuff although it does

240
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,751
Work with Madam a

241
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:15,775
Homekit

242
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:16,799
These others

243
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:22,687
And I think they're one of the few problems or tan companies because it's the say now they smart unit

244
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,991
This makes sense is the most obvious

245
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:26,783
What's design

246
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:27,551
Into

247
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:29,855
These products in a different way because

248
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:33,439
Products typically a that look like Ikea products and be

249
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,719
They don't look

250
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:35,487
Like smart

251
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:37,023
Products

252
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,559
Fit naturally in the home

253
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,095
Yes and

254
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:43,679
I thought this was really nice when I went to Ikea and talk to them about

255
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:46,495
They also have a sustainability

256
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:47,519
Focus

257
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:48,543
Most comfy

258
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:49,567
Probably don't have

259
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:50,847
So

260
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:53,407
They're not going to make connected things that just get through

261
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,943
They have a certain liking

262
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:58,783
Locations for anything that's connected it has to have a certain shelf life and

263
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,063
You know this won't go outside

264
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,111
A year so

265
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,647
That's kind of nice

266
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,183
And probably

267
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:09,535
But for all of us are waiting for those Ikea smart blinds

268
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,071
She theater

269
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:15,935
Anime eyes

270
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,983
I'll leave that to you to mess up Stacy

271
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:20,031
They will not be home care

272
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,055
Compatible

273
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,079
At launch

274
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,103
And this is going to display

275
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:28,735
This actually happened with the truck pretty smart plug

276
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:32,063
Because that was going to support homekit lawn sprayer

277
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:35,903
It was like a six-month delay before got that support so

278
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:37,183
Kind of importunate

279
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,975
This is becoming a trend

280
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:44,351
Regardless it is with the promise of homekit I'm sure it will happen

281
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:47,679
It's just not going to happen when the blinds actually wants

282
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,471
Which is fine because the blind

283
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,239
Already a little

284
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:51,775
We were expecting

285
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:52,543
Women April

286
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,335
In the fall

287
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:56,639
Hopefully they will stick to that fall dead

288
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,455
But I'm excited

289
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,735
Liking.

290
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:03,551
Ikea smart things I actually like my tradfri lights

291
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:05,855
Put them back in after they fix their Google in

292
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:06,623
Immigration

293
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:07,903
And that's something

294
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,951
That we probably don't say enough

295
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,999
But we probably should say more often on the show

296
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:15,071
With connected Home Products if you don't like it

297
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:18,143
Wait 6 months and a software updates going to come along

298
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,935
And probably make it a lot better

299
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:22,239
You'll just love it wait 6 months

300
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,263
I'm not saying that

301
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:32,223
These are not static products which is nice in most cases

302
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:37,087
Belews functionalities in most cases because

303
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:41,951
Let us talk about improvements losing functionality and software updates

304
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:42,719
Chadwick

305
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,583
Yeah

306
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,655
To those who do not know you can now

307
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,935
Migrate you are

308
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:54,495
Nest account to a Google account

309
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,263
This was

310
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,359
Announced back in May that would be happening at the Google IO

311
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:02,175
Event where they rebranded

312
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:04,991
Some of the Google Home Products become

313
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:08,063
Nest products specifically bee nest Hub and the nest

314
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,343
Max

315
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:11,391
They're killing the works with

316
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,159
What's nest Pro

317
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,951
Is probably so

318
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,231
That's what they said

319
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,791
Originally there were like we're going to kill the whole thing just Deadpool

320
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,071
As of August

321
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,607
31st people freaked out

322
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:21,887
Because

323
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,423
Legitimately pets

324
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,959
What's the big news to take in

325
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:27,519
So now what they're doing is they're offering you a choice

326
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:30,079
You can migrate your stuff over

327
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,639
Nest stuff into York

328
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:33,663
Google Assistant

329
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,711
Google home stuff you migrate all that over to

330
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,479
To your Google account

331
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:37,503
Or

332
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:41,855
You can maintain your nest account but after August 31st it's going to be static

333
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,903
And nothing will change

334
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,183
Machines it won't get better

335
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,463
Add a circuit

336
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,255
Correct

337
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:54,655
Correct and if you don't want to do that so you don't want to migrate Your Nest account into your Google account this way this way

338
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,447
If you do it after August 31st

339
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:58,751
If you like read it you can't go back

340
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,543
So it if you migrate

341
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:04,383
You can't go back

342
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:06,687
I don't think I don't think I can go back

343
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:10,015
Cuz I did this I ran through the process and

344
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,551
I'm flabbergasted

345
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,319
Frankly

346
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,599
Because

347
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:18,207
Nest has been a part of either Google or alphabet or Google again

348
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,487
For five years

349
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,023
Clearly

350
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,303
Google has

351
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,119
Smart home information that we

352
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:28,447
Put into our Google accounts with Google home

353
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,519
And Nest has the information for all the nest products

354
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,055
And yet

355
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,079
The process

356
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:34,847
2

357
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:35,615
Migraine

358
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:38,175
M&S account-to-account

359
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:45,343
It's a little daunting it's actually very easy but it's like 9 steps and there's all kinds of little guachos and things that I'm concerned

360
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:50,463
Not everybody will be the same concern products but for example

361
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:52,767
I have the nest by Yale lock

362
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,303
And

363
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:56,863
As soon as I migrated my account

364
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:59,167
I had to invite

365
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:02,751
My family to be part of the new Google account for the home

366
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:06,335
And until they accept that they can't get in the front door

367
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,871
Because they're

368
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:11,199
Passcode is no longer good

369
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,735
Once they migrate

370
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:17,599
My family is not too quick on the uptake for these things so

371
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:20,671
I haven't even invited them to the new home yet I'm just going to

372
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:25,023
Let them ring the doorbell other issue that I see

373
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,071
Is that Google says that

374
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,631
Call members

375
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:33,983
Have the same level of access control as you meaning me

376
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:36,031
Who used to be the homeowner

377
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,055
Ennis

378
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:37,823
System

379
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:42,687
Now anybody can delete me in my home or invite other people to our home and

380
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,271
I don't think that's a very good idea but that's just me

381
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,295
So

382
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:50,623
You seem like so many steps were taken here that

383
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:55,743
Shortcut it because the information is already available in nest and Google and

384
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,023
I'm just shocked

385
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:58,815
Adjust flapper

386
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,863
So I would say I wouldn't

387
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:04,191
I've wondered when hearing about your experience

388
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,239
With everyone having admin

389
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,007
Enright's

390
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:09,311
I wonder if this was a response to some of the

391
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,847
Domestic abuse

392
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,127
Complaints or

393
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,431
People using the Smart Home

394
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,223
Houses

395
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,015
And this puts control right back

396
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,551
If they're going to invite them in

397
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,831
You really want to come

398
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,111
Control your spouse I guess you just leave

399
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,391
People blocked out at all times

400
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:25,439
So maybe you just never invite

401
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,975
But that's one thought is

402
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:31,839
You just give them a guest passcode for the door lock tell them that they were part of the home even when they're not

403
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:32,607
I mean

404
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:34,399
Yeah there's ways around that I think

405
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,423
Partially right

406
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:39,775
I don't know if there are other legal reasons or Iona

407
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:42,847
And we should say that the reason we suspect Google

408
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,383
Who is doing this is because

409
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,663
It was very comp

410
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,967
Placated to manage all these integration

411
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:49,503
Are two different

412
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:56,927
So now what's going to happen is instead of having a nest brain and a Google home brain you're going to have one Google home brain

413
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:58,975
The entire experience

414
00:15:59,231 --> 00:15:59,743
Which

415
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:02,303
Make sense it doesn't make sense it's going to make

416
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,095
Google's life easier it's going to make

417
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,655
Controlling who has access to certain

418
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,935
Apis way easier

419
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:08,703
And that sort of thing

420
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:11,775
But it is going to frustrate users who

421
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,847
Baby relied on Nest having

422
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,127
Its own brain tool

423
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:16,895
Like Thai and

424
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:19,199
Other products and systems like it

425
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:19,967
For example

426
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:23,039
Right and there's no solution yet for

427
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,855
This new I guess works with Google

428
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,391
Thrift for example

429
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:29,439
Right everything's going to be now control

430
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:31,487
Home account so things like

431
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:34,815
Are Nest temperature triggers and things like that

432
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:37,375
Will stop working if you migrate

433
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:39,679
Over and you rely on if

434
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,447
For those things

435
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,727
Sofibella

436
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:44,543
Sensor that says hey when my Nest thermostat is

437
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:47,359
It's like 60 degrees turn on my space heater

438
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:50,175
Those things are going to break and it's not

439
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:50,943
Clear

440
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,503
If Google's going to allow the same tree

441
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,271
Triggers is

442
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:58,367
Right now if you don't do this migration it will still work

443
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,927
Eventually they're going to

444
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:05,535
You can manually do this now right in your nest app

445
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,815
Which isn't going away

446
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:10,143
Your point about having all the apis and everything in one place make sense

447
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:12,191
But yet we still up to app switch

448
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:15,263
I don't really get but that's all motorists entirely

449
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:21,919
You can manually upgrade or I'm sorry migrate to your account now or you can wait for your quote-unquote invitation email

450
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:23,711
Which is probably going to be

451
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:26,271
You have to do this at some point now

452
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,087
Yeah and I think August 31st is

453
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:29,855
The changeover

454
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,391
I'm glad you did this

455
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:38,303
Ivan died I've seriously been Kevin and I should talk about who's going to my grave

456
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,375
Maybe I shouldn't migrate and then I'll see how deprecated I

457
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,143
My life gets

458
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,679
That's one way to do it

459
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:50,079
The challenge I have is I no longer have some of my Nest gear cuz I had a nest hello doorbell I had a nest thermostat

460
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:50,847
Stat

461
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:51,871
In a rental house I

462
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:53,151
I have none of these things

463
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:55,967
Write it made sense for me to do it because

464
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:58,527
We're pretty much all in on the Google

465
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,295
Home

466
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,575
Ecosystem here

467
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:03,903
And I do have the nest hello doorbell as well as the nest by Yale lock

468
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:05,439
So what you just made sense

469
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:08,511
That's where I was going.

470
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:09,535
Yeah

471
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,839
This would be you because you're

472
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,631
More on the echo side of things

473
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,423
And this was a big pool

474
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,959
Google announced this back in

475
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:17,727
Mets

476
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:18,495
Basically

477
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:22,079
Matinee Integrations with stopped working skills and such

478
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:27,967
However they took that feedback too hard and a longer than everything migration they announced that there is a new

479
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:29,247
Madame a skill

480
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:31,551
I have not installed it yet but that should

481
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:32,831
Allow you to

482
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:35,647
Use my tab a with your Google Nest products

483
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,695
All right well we'll look forward to next week

484
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,463
Carrying your

485
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,255
Haha

486
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:43,583
Amazon

487
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:45,375
Once met a man every

488
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:47,167
Car according to Bloomberg

489
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:49,215
This is not surprising

490
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:50,751
Amazon is in talks with

491
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,287
Automakers to

492
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:55,871
Play Padme in cars I don't know how else to say that

493
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:56,895
And

494
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:58,431
They have already signed up

495
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:01,759
BMW and Audi

496
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,039
BMW and Audi

497
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,063
Wanted to say something

498
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,087
Also thank you

499
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:07,135
So they've already signed a BMW and Audi

500
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:07,903
He said this

501
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:09,695
It's basically like you know you have

502
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:10,463
Carplay

503
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,231
And

504
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:11,999
Android

505
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:13,023
I always forget what

506
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,047
Trites Carthage

507
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:16,095
Android auto

508
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:17,631
You would also have

509
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,423
What I

510
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:24,287
Really found fun about the story is they talk to a guy who had the Amazon Echo Auto

511
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,055
Which I have had

512
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:26,847
It just did not work

513
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:27,871
For me and

514
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:29,407
I felt a little bad about that

515
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,687
Cuz like I really hate when

516
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:31,711
I have

517
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:32,735
It has no

518
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,015
Fishers

519
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:37,087
That's how this article actually starts because the person who tested it

520
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:42,975
Talk about all the bugs and issues and basically said my part of a beta program I don't understand why the project is not work

521
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:43,999
Because

522
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:50,399
It's connected to your phone where the matinee at is team anime app is driving all the smarts and everything else

523
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:56,543
It's just a speaker microphone with Bluetooth connection to your phone is so dodgy

524
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:01,663
Doesn't seem to work as well I think having the app on all the time causes problems

525
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:03,455
There's a lot of issues

526
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:06,271
And I think the car environment is a difficult

527
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,039
TV Guide

528
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:10,623
Road noise if that's car speaker noise you got all of that so

529
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:12,415
Really I'm going to say

530
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:15,487
90% of the problems we had with our

531
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:19,839
Echo Auto in my husband's car and in mine were related to

532
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:25,215
And there's a lot of variables there's so many different types of cars are so many did

533
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:26,495
Different types of phones

534
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:28,287
Close permutations together and

535
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:29,311
It's a lot

536
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:31,359
But there's not a good experience

537
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:33,663
I was sort of part of the beta program

538
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:34,687
Because

539
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:36,991
I will say I did get a survey the other day

540
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:39,295
It was from Amazon

541
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:41,855
Tell us about your experience with this

542
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:43,135
As we seek to make it better

543
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:44,415
So

544
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:45,951
Having it integrated

545
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:46,975
The car should

546
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:48,255
Solve some of the

547
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,023
Those

548
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:55,167
I definitely should because most people who use these in-car entertainment systems whether it's a

549
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:57,215
Built-in from the manufacturer or its

550
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:59,263
Android auto or carplay

551
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:01,567
Pretty darn well so

552
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:03,871
Are you people are like why do you need your

553
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:04,639
Echo in the car

554
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,663
Are in the answer

555
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:06,687
Is

556
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:12,063
The answer is probably you don't I like it because

557
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,343
At least once during

558
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:15,135
Every car trip we have a question that we

559
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:16,672
Oh how many is this

560
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:18,208
And then we just don't know

561
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:22,048
And yes we could squeeze our foe or I could squeeze my phone and ask Google and sometimes I do

562
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:24,096
But sometimes it's just nice to not have to

563
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:26,400
To pick up a phone while you're driving and just to say

564
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:27,680
Hey

565
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:30,496
Do that sort and yes I know I could also talk

566
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:32,800
It's usually in my

567
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:34,080
Curse it's usually not

568
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:34,848
Listening

569
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:37,408
Yeah I just I connect my

570
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,432
I don't understand

571
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:46,368
No no no I mean what was for this week Bobby so yes you could talk to your phone we could have done that before all these Integrations came into play

572
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:51,744
The speakers and microphones in these in car systems are

573
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:54,048
Probably better suited for

574
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:56,352
That kind of use hands-free number one

575
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,448
So I I just plug my pixel 3XL into

576
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:04,544
My car and just use the in-car stuff that integrates through Android auto

577
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,336
Flawlessly

578
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:09,152
Yeah and that's really what I want

579
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:13,248
But like I said maybe in six months it's going to be amazing

580
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:14,272
Or maybe a

581
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:16,064
Amazon will do these deals and it

582
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:16,832
Google totally deaf

583
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:18,112
Look at the product and nothing will change

584
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:21,952
Baby I spent $25 just to be

585
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:25,280
All right

586
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:27,072
Let's talk about SimpliSafe

587
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:31,424
Which is a home security company I'm sure lots of you guys have

588
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,192
It's very

589
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,008
Easy to install and now they have

590
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,800
A brand new door lock

591
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:41,408
Yes it's $99 it will be available next

592
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:46,016
Restaurants directly from SimpliSafe later it'll come to Best Buy thing in October

593
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:48,832
Keypad on the outside and in very

594
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:50,112
August lock

595
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:52,416
Right look inside to me

596
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:53,440
Is it route

597
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:57,024
It's definitely not round design features yes

598
00:22:57,536 --> 00:23:00,352
Without a doubt it just reminds me of the August lock but

599
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,168
Deadbolt lock or is it like does it have a

600
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:05,984
Is it an actual lock that you install or is it just a deadbolt

601
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:07,776
Does the August lock of the day

602
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,312
As opposed to

603
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:13,664
This looks to me like a

604
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,688
Integrated

605
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:15,456
Dentals

606
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:16,736
Cuz it's

607
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:20,064
Does not look like it fits over an existing one

608
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,600
But the interesting thing is

609
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:23,648
It will automatically lock

610
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:26,976
And when you set your SimpliSafe home alarm just

611
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,792
The one downside

612
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:31,584
If you want to use an app

613
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,120
To unlock your door

614
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:35,424
Then you're going to have to be

615
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:40,800
Part of the company's monthly service

616
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:42,592
Yeah she's not

617
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:45,408
It's true that's true

618
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,736
No no no

619
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:50,784
What are people who don't use them on ring

620
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:54,112
Are you going to choose to pay for the monitoring to

621
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:58,208
Unlock my app just not going to use that picture at all because it's not free

622
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:03,072
Alright well

623
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:08,448
We also have a brand new breakthrough in energy harvesting

624
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,752
Which is really important

625
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:11,520
Because

626
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:14,336
If we're going to have a kajillion sensors everywhere

627
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:17,408
We cannot spend the time changing batteries I don't care

628
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,712
What people tell you about battery life

629
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:23,296
Even if it's every ten years you're either going to toss that sensor

630
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,576
Because it's cheap enough in

631
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:25,856
Environmentally friendly

632
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:26,880
Or

633
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:28,416
You're going to need something this energy

634
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,440
Harvesting because

635
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:30,208
We're just knocking

636
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:35,072
MIT has created an underwater sensor

637
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:35,840
That does not need

638
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:38,656
It is exciting

639
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:41,984
Its energy harvesting method it's using

640
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:43,776
Which is

641
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:44,544
Physical

642
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,312
Connecticut

643
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:47,360
When something moves

644
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:48,896
That's my

645
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:51,200
Non scientific version of that for everyone

646
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,784
But they're using

647
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,552
That

648
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,320
And

649
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:57,600
Backscatter

650
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:59,136
This is basically

651
00:24:59,392 --> 00:24:59,904
When

652
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,928
RFC

653
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:05,536
Radio waves or in this case acoustical waves are sent through the water

654
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:06,816
They generate energy

655
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:08,352
In the piezoelectric

656
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:09,376
Center

657
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:11,680
Converts that energy to a zero

658
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,496
And once were in zeros and ones

659
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:15,264
Or digital

660
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:16,544
And voila

661
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:17,568
We can do things

662
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:19,360
This is actually

663
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:21,920
Old school both Technologies are

664
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:23,968
Well-researched

665
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:26,016
Piezoelectric sensors have been

666
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:26,784
Around forever

667
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,832
I actually have one in my Hue tap and I love

668
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,392
Every time I tap it it generates enough energy to

669
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,160
Keep that thing power

670
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:35,488
And Backscatter is something that's been around for

671
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:36,512
It's been around as long as

672
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:43,936
Talking about harvesting it for energy for the last decade or so in

673
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:44,960
We're getting better

674
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:45,728
Better at it

675
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:47,264
The cool part of this

676
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:48,288
Is

677
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:51,872
We could use this both on Earth underwater in places

678
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:53,152
But we can also use it

679
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:56,736
For space exploration and putting sensors

680
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:57,760
In place

681
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:00,064
They can generate their own energy so

682
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,344
You know for kids

683
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,368
Crazy

684
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,392
We can talk about

685
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:04,928
The article talks about

686
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:05,696
Putting it on

687
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:06,976
Titan

688
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,512
Which is Saturn's largest moon

689
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,048
Jersey Giant sub surface

690
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:12,864
Is ocean and we know nothing about it we could drop one of these in there

691
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:13,888
Invokana

692
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:20,032
Information

693
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:22,080
I saw that this was three

694
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:23,104
Pillow Pets

695
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:23,872
Per second

696
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:26,176
Across up to 10

697
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:26,944
Yes

698
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,968
Well ghetto

699
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,248
Bees acoustical waves

700
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:30,784
Don't have that much power

701
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:33,600
Like blowing on some

702
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:34,880
Supposed to happen

703
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:38,976
It's something

704
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,256
I should have saved

705
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:46,656
Because I'm so obsessed with energy harvesting I know there are also other efforts for underwater sensors that use temperature

706
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:47,936
Gradient differences

707
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,472
Basically there's some

708
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:50,496
Authentic column

709
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:53,056
Where are you got cold water the bottom and

710
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:54,336
Where what are the top in it

711
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:56,128
Moves that rotates

712
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:58,944
So those kind of things are also being used

713
00:26:59,200 --> 00:26:59,712
Power

714
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:00,992
Underwater sensors

715
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:02,272
Those temperature changes

716
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:05,088
So there's actually a lot of really cool work Happening Here

717
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:06,624
And I mean again

718
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,672
Not going to send a lot of data but

719
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:09,952
Maybe we shouldn't be so

720
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:11,488
Data hockey anyway

721
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,512
All right

722
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:17,632
I think this might be our final story I got some news that. Way which is a Chinese

723
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:20,704
IP camera manufacturer these cameras are

724
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,472
Everywhere

725
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,008
They

726
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:25,824
Just signed a deal with a company here in the US

727
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,848
Pepper iot

728
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,896
Pepper is

729
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:32,992
Iot platform company that provides the cloud computing and

730
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:33,760
Underlying

731
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:35,808
Ties management and all that fun stuff

732
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:41,184
What's notable here is this is a Chinese company that is specifically moving to use

733
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:43,488
A u.s. based platform that is

734
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:45,280
Optimized for security

735
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:47,584
Pepper's actually done a deal with a

736
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,120
Iot security company that

737
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:51,424
Has certified it keeps

738
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,472
Pentesting monitoring their platform

739
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,264
As a way to ensure

740
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:56,800
The devices on the spot

741
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:00,384
So I thought this was notable

742
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:01,408
Because

743
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,712
Most Chinese companies they might do

744
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:04,992
Do it themselves to make you something

745
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:05,760
I like to you

746
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:11,648
This seems like a real security play insensitive IP camera company I thought it was worth noting since I

747
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:12,416
Leica cameras are so

748
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:13,184
The worst

749
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:15,488
So I don't know

750
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,024
Maybe this is a trend

751
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,328
Maybe it's not but now I feel

752
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:20,352
Maybe a little better

753
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:21,120
About buying

754
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:22,656
Cameras

755
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:24,192
When you can buy

756
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:25,984
And they're much cheaper

757
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:33,408
I think it's about time for our voice mail what do you think

758
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:35,200
That sounds good

759
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:38,016
Okay for the section of the iot podcast

760
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:39,040
Hotline

761
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:42,112
I should let everyone know that if you call us asthma

762
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:44,160

00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,696
An ecobee

Smart light switch with

767
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:00,800

768
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:01,824
6 to 3

769
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,592
E74

770
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:03,360
R24

771
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:07,200
And I should let you know the iot podcast hotline is sponsored by

772
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:07,968
Pharaoh

773
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:11,040
With the fifth largest iot patent portfolio the world

774
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:14,880
Afero provides a proven iot platform that doesn't risk your brand

775
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:19,232
Affero customers have experienced as much as a 80% reduction in time to bark

776
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:21,536
Antennax higher activation rate

777
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:23,584
You can learn more at a pharaoh

Dot IO

779
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:28,448
This week's question comes from Joshua

780
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:30,496
Who is shopping

781
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:33,824
Hairstyles Joshua

782
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,360
I'm coming about 8

783
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,128
Spartan lights

784
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:36,896
Switch

785
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:38,176
At Walmart

786
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,016
Some company called Merkury Innovations

787
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,576
Genie

788
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:45,856
I really don't know which is which

789
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:49,184
That's a lot of information about them online and I'm just trying to

790
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:49,952
Ceased

791
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:53,280
If you guys have heard anything or you can try them out

792
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:55,840
Barry singing to take a price but

793
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:58,656
I'm not sure if it's worth money cheat in try

794
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:00,448
You can let me know I'd appreciate it

795
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:03,008
Oh Joshua I'd lied

796
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:09,408
You ask this because I noticed probably a year ago or so that Walmart had this whole Brandon I did a little bit of research into it

797
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:13,248
This is a company that

798
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,784
The products I actually bought a

799
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,552
Connected

800
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:18,624
Outlet has like a light switch no not

801
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:19,904
I'd Outlet

802
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:21,440
Place where you plug in things

803
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:22,208
And

804
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,256
Download the app the app is all right

805
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,792
It's not awesome there's nothing

806
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:26,816
It's not terrible

807
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:27,584
But it's not great

808
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:32,448
The app is the genie part that Joshua asked about because he was unsure of the name is

809
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:34,496
Merkury Innovations that Genie

810
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:35,776
Puccini is the app

811
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:37,824
And

812
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:38,848
It's a fine Prada

813
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:43,712
I will say that the company underlying Merkury Innovations with

814
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:44,480
Platform

815
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:45,760
Is a company called to you

816
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:47,552
Which is a Chinese company

817
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:48,576
They also

818
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:50,624
Do tons of business there

819
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,440
I think Charlie the second most popular maybe now the most pop

820
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:54,464
Popular iot

821
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,512
And

822
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:57,792
Those guys

823
00:30:58,304 --> 00:31:03,424
They are based in China so you're going to see traffic from your Merkury Innovations products going to China

824
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,448
Because of

825
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:05,472
Patrulla connection

826
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:07,776
It is up to you to decide how

827
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:10,336
I

828
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:12,896
Didn't see anything horribly problematic

829
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:14,432
But I'm also not a secure

830
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:15,200
Dirty researcher

831
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:18,016
I think for the light switch I probably be okay with

832
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:21,088
I know they make other products such as cameras and such

833
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:23,904
Be a little more concerned

834
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:24,672
But

835
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:26,464
Light switch in this case

836
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,488
Ibuprofen

837
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:29,792
There's two issues right there's the issue of them can

838
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:31,072
Controlling are seeing the date

839
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:33,120
Camera light switch the other issue is

840
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:35,424
That could create a hole in your network

841
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,704
To which they could go to you

842
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:38,752
To see other things

843
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:40,032
That's bad

844
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:41,568
I'm not saying that they can

845
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:42,592
I'm saying that would be

846
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,152
The point here is

847
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:47,456
Is Deezer cheaper devices

848
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:50,528
Chuuya has been responsive to security

849
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:51,296
Abilities

850
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:54,112
So and I hate to be like a Chinese fear monger

851
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,136
Radii

852
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:58,208
I feel questionable about that but at the same time I'm also

853
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:00,256
It's not

854
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:02,304
Completely outlandish to be

855
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:03,584
Aware of that

856
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,352
I guess so

857
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,632
Be aware of that

858
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:07,424
The experience is

859
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,192
Okay

860
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:08,960
If there's nothing

861
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:10,752
Terribly fabulous

862
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:11,776
Terrible about it

863
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:14,080
I have that same feeling actually when I

864
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:16,384
I work with tp-link Kasa line of stuff

865
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:18,944
Honest and so

866
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,224
It's on par with that maybe

867
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:22,016
Less smooth

868
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:23,552
A little less fancy

869
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:24,832
Colossia

870
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:30,208
But you're you're just paying for utility Hermina says $18.88 for a Wi-Fi switch

871
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:31,488
You don't need a hug

872
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:36,352
He works with Madam a Google assistant and even Cortana issues Cortana

873
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:38,912
When does the

874
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:41,216
Phasing Cortana out of the homes

875
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:41,984
That's not

876
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:43,008
Batter for two

877
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:45,568
I can't wait to find out more about that

878
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:49,408
Because I'm sure you saw this but Microsoft hired bill

879
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,432
Stacy

880
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,200
Stasi

881
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:53,504
Who's the guy in charge of Siri

882
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,528
And so

883
00:32:55,040 --> 00:33:00,416
I was really excited about this I'm like oh man is he going to be doing something cool with

884
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:01,184
Cortana

885
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:02,208
Maybe

886
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:05,280
Did he do anything cool with Siri I don't know

887
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:08,608
I just say that because I I find it to be the worst of the

888
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:10,400
The Big Three

889
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:13,728
All right

890
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,008
You'll find out

891
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:17,312
He's going to be heading up in AI

892
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:18,336
4

893
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:19,104
Microsoft

894
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:20,384
Who knows

895
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:22,176
But it does say

896
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:23,456
He'll quote

897
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:26,528
Where to help Align Technology strategies across the

898
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:27,296
Company

899
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:33,952
So maybe Cortana will get integrated into more Microsoft and products and maybe we'll finally see some of the cool stuff they keep

900
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:35,744
Keep showing us around Boise and enter

901
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,512
Surprise

902
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:37,792
All right

903
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,352
That feels like a bunch of dudes that

904
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:42,656
Was fun to talk about but it's time

905
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:44,448
For us to move on

906
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:47,264
To our guests this week's guest is Tim Ferriss

907
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:50,336
TMF Associates were going to be talking about

908
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:54,944
The likelihood of all of these iot satellite companies even the small set companies

909
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,992
How likely is it that they will succeed

910
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:58,016
So

911
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:04,416
Stay tuned for that after a message from our sponsor

912
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:05,952

913
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:11,072
Message from our sponsor sponsor is nutanix and I have such him

Sasha

917
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:20,032
Iot is projected to be more than a trillion dollar market by 2025

918
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:23,104
What are the obstacles in the way of that actually happened

919
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:28,992
I see there's two kinds of obstacles Technical and non-technical

920
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:31,552
It is a combination of many different

921
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:32,832
Technology challenges

922
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:34,880
Challenges around containerizing

923
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:35,648
Application

924
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:40,000
Using Advanced data processing Concepts

925
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:42,560
It's a large application and device security

926
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:45,120
Literally Planet scale and so on and so forth

927
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,656
These technical challenges

928
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:47,424
Translate

929
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:53,824
Two non technical challenges for an organization as well they feel stretched in terms of the type of talent

Are you in special Starmount of time and resources connect to dedicate to them

937
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:14,048
Got it I have heard this a problem

938
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:17,120
So what is nutanix working on to get rid of these Ops 2

939
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:21,472
We have too many different things but just to give you some concrete examples

940
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:22,752
In one instance

941
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:24,800
Re-creators Nai service

942
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:32,224
Complexity of end-users having to deal with many different kinds of

943
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:36,832
Can focus more on the business logic

944
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:38,368
I'm on the machine models

945
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:43,744
Unless on how does models make of operationalize

946
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,512
Introduction

947
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:48,608
In another and sensory Walker Street partners

948
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,912
Highest rated systems integrators

949
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:57,312
To create an application Library which provides end-to-end working out the application

950
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:00,896
Is that they can get started

951
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:04,736
Reasonably complex Highway projects

952
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:06,784
And in a different incense

953
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,344
Rick and Morty trial

954
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,136
Cloud computing infrastructure

955
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:12,416
All hosted in the cloud

956
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:13,952
Electrical

957
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:16,512
Start creating Enterprise ID application

958
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:19,840
On the edge without having to deploy a single device

959
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:20,864
Nice

960
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:22,400
It's very comprehensive

961
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:25,728
So where can I buy lister's go to find out more

962
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:26,752
About nutanix

963
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:41,344
Hey everyone welcome back to the

964
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:45,696
The Internet of Things podcast

965
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:46,464
Is

966
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,744
Tim Ferriss

967
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,560
Who is president of TMF associate

968
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:53,632
He has done Consulting in the satellite industry for

969
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:55,424
Over 25 years

970
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,448
And I have

971
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:57,216
Talk to him

972
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:58,496
For probably the last

973
00:36:58,752 --> 00:36:59,264
20 years

974
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:01,312
Various satellite issues

975
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:03,104
Tim thanks for joining me

976
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:04,640
Text Stacy

977
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:07,200
I am super excited to have you we're going to be talking

978
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:09,504
About iot and satellites

979
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,528
As promised

980
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:11,296
So let's

981
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:13,600
Kick it off with an understanding of

982
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:16,416
Where does satellite fit into the iot

983
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:17,440
I always think of

984
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:19,488
Hey maybe I could be good for

985
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:23,072
Obviously remote areas with no connectivity but also things like

986
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,864
Pallets across the ocean

987
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:25,632
What do you think

988
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:27,936
But I think the idea that

989
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:32,544
Extending connectivity everywhere it's a really important thing to

990
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,824
Consider the many

991
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:38,432
Customers but the question about whether they want to pay for it is a particularly relevant issue

992
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:44,832
And if you go back 25 years at home then was talking about satellite phones and say all we want time open

993
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:46,624
Call 712 Cafe why we going to

994
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,976
How to stop light component in that will go mom to that whenever we go outside temperature

995
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:54,304
And what happened in the end well if people didn't really want to pay for

996
00:37:54,560 --> 00:38:00,704
But they were trying to buy the idea of a phone that works anywhere but when it came to it and more expensive phone with a big on

997
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,472
Antenna

998
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:07,360
Having to pee alot for the moving time and then he went outside coverage of a small percentage

999
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:10,176
Did the time in the end the market turned out to

1000
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:11,968
Not very exciting people didn't

1001
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:13,504
Black mom to stop slicing

1002
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,576
People use that to stay within a disaster or they win

1003
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:17,344
In a war

1004
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,368
Or other

1005
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:19,904
Yo situations what did I say

1006
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,464
In the middle of the ocean but they didn't use it as a

1007
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,488
Aphrodite

1008
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:25,280
Feature that moves outside

1009
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,304
Iot

1010
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:28,096
Satellite connectivity

1011
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:35,008
10 years ago people say okay well people use satellites as a backup to terrestrial lobomon to that week

1012
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:35,776
Incorporate

1013
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:39,872
Listen to all these iot devices and what's happened is it

1014
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:41,664
Terrestrial is FM's by leaps

1015
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,480
Sometimes the cost of satellite equipment

1016
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:48,832
Cost of satellite ad time is still a great deal higher than it is on

1017
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:52,928
Terrestrial side and it remains to be seen whether that's enough

1018
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:53,952
Need

1019
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:56,768
Satellite to justify adding in that

1020
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:57,792
Satellite capability

1021
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:04,960
Transporting nuclear fuel around the country. You probably want to know where it is every minute of the day but if you're transported in Utah

1022
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:09,568
What's the food around the countries that maybe it's not quite so important to not so much with thankful

1023
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:13,920
Exactly I'd like to buy container of $5 t-shirts

1024
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:14,944
It fell into the ocean

1025
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:19,552
That's alright okay so before we go much deeper I feel like it's probably important

1026
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:20,320
To talk about

1027
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:21,856
The costs associated

1028
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:22,624
With satellites

1029
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,928
This'll give us a good context for when we

1030
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:25,696
We switch from

1031
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:27,744
Like a traditional to some of the small SAS

1032
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:29,792
Recall that down

1033
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:35,936
Tranquilizer designed specifically for iot with a classic

1034
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:37,216
Old-time system

1035
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:40,544
Let's be told called where they have relatively small satellite they spend

1036
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,360
Something like two hundred million dollars on building I like you

1037
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:46,432
System and its really only good for small amounts of data

1038
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:50,272
In contrast you have satellites Adamo generally adoptable

1039
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:52,576
Iridium being a classic example wedding

1040
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:55,392
Just spent about asleep billion dollars upgrading next

1041
00:39:55,904 --> 00:40:02,048
Jumpits iot is only a small part of that total offering and they have most of that business phone

1042
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:04,352
Mobile phones and a growing proportion

1043
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:05,376
Humble Bundle

1044
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:08,192
In both of those cases they are looking

1045
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:09,472
To drive iotv

1046
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:10,752
Space Wolf

1047
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:15,360
The cost of that systems and the amount of capacity on those satellites

1048
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:17,664
Well yeah that a long way away

1049
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,968
The beams are pretty big they might have two stacks

1050
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:20,992
Very limited

1051
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:27,392
And soak this about a small amount of capacity compared to what you might have honestly jio4g

1052
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:33,792
5G Network on the ground and when we talkin about the cost of the end-user you also need a relatively high up

1053
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:40,192
Teletubby know if you have complex Electronics because you go to deal with a non sanded and unsanded interface

1054
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:41,216
All those things

1055
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:43,520
Me and that you were talking about terminal cost

1056
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:44,544
Twitch started

1057
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,384
Show me like $100 for the transceiver but once you put it into a terminal lights

1058
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,664
Hundreds of dollars

1059
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:56,064
And you talk about a time call switch today at generally in the range of thousands of dollars per megabyte

1060
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:01,440
So many of the services because you're paying by the message in the message of a few bites might cost

1061
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:05,024
Sample sentence with even the hot 10 or $0.20

1062
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:05,792
Message

1063
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:07,328
And that's been the big

1064
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:08,096
Acmarket

1065
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:15,264
The satellite providers which is expensive if you want to use this for like LTE data services but if you got like a

1066
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,080
Single message that goes out once or twice a day

1067
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:19,360
It's just a few bites

1068
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:20,640
It's relatively

1069
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:21,664
Inexpensive

1070
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:25,248
What I'm hearing though is on the receiving side of the radio sign in

1071
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:26,016
Device that

1072
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:26,784
Still probably

1073
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:31,648
Add a lot of cost of the device it depends what you need if you are application

1074
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:38,048
Is being designed to take advantage of Lte and you're looking at transmitting two hats SFO megabytes ammo

1075
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:40,096
Then you really have to do something

1076
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:43,936
Pretty different Matt uses satellite when you're paying your by the message

1077
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:45,472
Can you paint multiple sensor

1078
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:47,776
Ten cents the message then you really need

1079
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:48,800
To be just

1080
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:49,824
Setting the most

1081
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:51,872
So one of the challenges

1082
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:52,640
This is Ben.

1083
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:53,407
Yeah maybe

1084
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:56,735
10 to 15 years ago satellite and terrestrial

1085
00:41:56,991 --> 00:42:02,879
You know what we had to G on the ground GPRS sounds like wasn't so far behind and you can maybe implement the same after

1086
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:03,647
Applications

1087
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:08,255
Co satellites Inuit Westfield Lincoln things would be simpler now you have to implement

1088
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:11,583
It's quite different to satellite in many cases and

1089
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:17,983
That means that there's an extra virgin on the end user to really decide whether they want to go to that trouble bussin

1090
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:19,007
Southwest side

1091
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:22,591
On the hardware side in adding the cost of a satellite transceiver

1092
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:23,615
All right

1093
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:28,991
We have talked to the past about some of the bigger classic satellite providers who

1094
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:32,319
Giant birds in constellations way up there in Spanish

1095
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:34,111
What we're seeing now

1096
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:35,903
Is a launch

1097
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:37,183
Spa Sasse

1098
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:43,583
In every time I talk to somebody who's talking about lunch a bunch of small sets for the iot and ideas

1099
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:46,911
Is beside a satellite you could just toss them out there cheaper

1100
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:48,447
They fly closer to

1101
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:49,983
To the ground and

1102
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:51,775
They're going to just change the world

1103
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:53,055
Talk to me about

1104
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:53,823
How should be

1105
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:55,615
Because some of them actually

1106
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:56,383
He seemed really

1107
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:57,919
Track lights

1108
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:01,503
I've got more efficient but it's important to know the old car

1109
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:08,159
What's the original small satellite its original satellite launched back in the mid-to-late 1990s anyway

1110
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:08,927
Wait a few tens

1111
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:11,743
Kilograms in choosing format to Eva

1112
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:15,839
Smaller today but the old

1113
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:19,935
The capabilities are they still have to have access to

1114
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:21,727
The Spectrum which is a big.

1115
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:26,591
I don't comes fighting with some people who trying to get shared access to its own Bond

1116
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:30,175
Other people have talked about accessing other satellite band

1117
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:31,199
Switch fa.

1118
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:36,575
Does Sally have playoffs device to access they may have looked at things like unlicensed

1119
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:39,903
Spectrum laugh it's not really clear that the rules committee

1120
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,439
Use of some of those on lights

1121
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:43,743
Suspense by satellite to access dispatch

1122
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:47,583
Big barrier-to-entry the technology has definitely improved

1123
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:50,655
But things are not as different as you might have see it

1124
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:53,727
Maybe in the group and weld it is different

1125
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:57,311
That in most of the existing satellites on GO station

1126
00:43:57,567 --> 00:44:01,407
Turn red when talking about multi-ton satellites and we're going down to a few

1127
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:03,455
Kilograms. In the world

1128
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:06,783
You know we've had a video and old, vans for

1129
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:09,087
20 + years they've got dispatch

1130
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:09,855
Kitchen lights on

1131
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:12,159
Improving ability to operate that got

1132
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:15,231
Sales channels and infrastructure in different

1133
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:16,767
Peace around the world end

1134
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:18,047
These new satellites

1135
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:19,327
Will light be sufficient

1136
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:20,351
Different well

1137
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:22,143
I don't even know if

1138
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:26,751
Oldham will get the rights to operate in terms of access to

1139
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:27,519
The Spectrum

1140
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:29,567
You know that's a big area

1141
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:30,591
Pressure on

1142
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:32,127
Access to satellites bad

1143
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:35,455
This is not is not available to Dedicated satellite purpose

1144
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:38,783
It might have been in the past so a lot of this comes back to

1145
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:42,623
Spectrum evening fuel Technologies Advance you have the right to operate

1146
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:43,647
Can you get access

1147
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:47,999
Can you deliver a compelling service building the infrastructure building the disc

1148
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:51,583
Distribution getting people to adopt this is all challenging as well

1149
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:56,191
Alright Spectrum I will keep that in mind is like the big scary thing to look at

1150
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:59,775
I will say I feel like on a distribution side and getting

1151
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:01,311
Cost Eleanor

1152
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:07,967
It is just a marketing channel but when I look at deals like Amazon working with iridium on that 3 billion dollar upgrade

1153
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:08,991
Example of

1154
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:10,271
For iot

1155
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:16,671
That feels like perhaps a really significant sales Channel and curious how you look at some of these Partnerships

1156
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:19,743
Is that going to help change the name of the game

1157
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:24,351
But I think it really depends on how customers decide to use satellite capability

1158
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:29,471
It's not the light stays is that last resort solution just like a satellite phone is and it's

1159
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:30,495
Something you

1160
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:34,847
Leaving the cupboards and you take out when you going out to the middle of the ocean oil

1161
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:41,247
Transporting nuclear fuel Calgary around the country or whatever then.

1162
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:46,879
Something where it's a more widely accepted part of your everyday infrastructure

1163
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:47,647
Can you come by month

1164
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:54,303
It's not clear that the economics of change

1165
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:55,327
Distribution

1166
00:45:55,583 --> 00:46:01,727
Can the special wine has all the economics going to work to include this in people's everyday use of iot

1167
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:03,263
I don't know I don't think I don't

1168
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:04,287
You seen that yet

1169
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:07,103
In general I would say to rescue Lisa found

1170
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:11,455
So fast but it's very very difficult for satellite to keep up

1171
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:12,223
Satellites

1172
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:16,319
The most serious is full and feather behind to Asheville expectations

1173
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:18,879
In the last 20 years Boston getting

1174
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:20,671
Closer to meeting to ask Alexa

1175
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:25,279
They might meet something that someone wants because they made special expectations

1176
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:27,839
From 10 or 15 or 20 years ago

1177
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:32,703
But it doesn't keep Pace with what the latest is on the celestial side and X

1178
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:33,471
Detectability

1179
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:38,079
Okay it in terms of those capabilities are you talking about things like Gatorade

1180
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:39,103
Lights or

1181
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:42,431
Again the biggest argument that people make that satellite can

1182
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:44,735
Can actually win with iot is because there

1183
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:48,319
Relatively few and relatively small messages

1184
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:51,647
I guess you're saying that the economics just still don't

1185
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:52,415
Make sense

1186
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:55,999
Because they're relatively few in relatively soon

1187
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:56,767
Small messages

1188
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:59,071
Text messages are expensive

1189
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:03,423
AstroWorld iot really shift

1190
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:05,471
To a study intermittent

1191
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:06,751
Transmission

1192
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:08,031
All very small amount

1193
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:08,799
What's the date

1194
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:11,615
We could meet that but the

1195
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:13,663
Idea of Shifting to that

1196
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:20,063
Small amounts of intermittent data is that the cost goes to a very very low

1197
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:21,599
Boats to the hardware Evans

1198
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:23,391
I'm so

1199
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:25,695
You know when we're talkin about satellites look

1200
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:29,279
How to get all twos in the multiple dollars per month

1201
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:30,303
Andrew Luck

1202
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:33,119
Looking at Hardware costs which are in the hundreds

1203
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:34,143
DiBella's engine

1204
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:34,911
Then

1205
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:38,239
It's very difficult to to converge events

1206
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:39,775
If you can deliver

1207
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:40,799
That smoke

1208
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:41,823
Statues of people

1209
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:43,615
Alesso SF

1210
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:45,407
Pacific visa application

1211
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:51,295
I think there will be a market for that but I don't understand how

1212
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:52,319
Fraud that will be

1213
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:53,087
And you're right

1214
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:55,391
They're already workarounds for things like

1215
00:47:55,647 --> 00:48:01,791
Containers at Sea and tracking those a lot of the times they're like yeah we'll just put something like a lorawan

1216
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:03,583
Situation at a port

1217
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,375
And as the ships

1218
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:06,911
Come hear it enough

1219
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:08,959
They're still there

1220
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:11,263
So I share your Sceptre

1221
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:14,847
That's not to say that there is

1222
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:18,943
Significant growth that we have several million terminals out that operating

1223
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:19,967
Talk like that

1224
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:20,735
But

1225
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:23,551
If you look at for example some of the application

1226
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:24,831
Play music in the past

1227
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:29,183
That idea of tracking cargo at sea

1228
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:32,511
Attack while on top of one another and if you was at like 7

1229
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:34,815
We need to see the satellites going over head in the

1230
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:41,215
The sky is on the bottom of the stack of Thea for containers send division to ability to make a line of sight to the

1231
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:43,007
And so

1232
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:46,591
The ideas that everything will be direct bicycle lights

1233
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:48,383
Has transmuted into

1234
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:50,175
For example using

1235
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:52,991
Children's Wireless on board the ship transmitting

1236
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:58,879
Get to a terminal on the shed which is a single B-side terminal sending it back to a regular cycle

1237
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:05,279
It's going by satellite that's not what most people are thinking about when they thinking about sex

1238
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:06,047
Flight iot

1239
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:07,071
You're right

1240
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:08,095
That is not worth it

1241
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:10,399
But that as a Gateway kind of

1242
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:15,007
What is a bridge technology makes a lot of sense plus ships already have satellite links on them

1243
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:16,287
Because hey

1244
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:17,055
Their ships

1245
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:18,079
Out of the middle of the ocean

1246
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:24,479
Alright Tim I know this is a little out of your purview possibly but I am curious for everyone who listens and every time

1247
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:25,247
Write about satellite

1248
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:27,039
Space trash

1249
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:32,671
What about it all these small satellites there going to be a problem do you have a taker possibilities of dealing with it

1250
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:34,463
Well I think that

1251
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:41,119
There is a move towards deploying smaller and smaller satellites because of the Haya capabilities

1252
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:42,143
Is available for

1253
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:47,519
Miniature isoelectronic operators who might be fairly unsophisticated in tons

1254
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:50,847
Satellite because they come at this from the iot world that

1255
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:54,431
Coming from the south y well they said okay well then we can build a

1256
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:55,967
Flight Hardware

1257
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:56,735
In space

1258
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:57,503
Maybe someone

1259
00:49:58,015 --> 00:50:00,319
Laughlin chica launch state in the future

1260
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:04,159
That will enable people to do things if they're not careful

1261
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:05,695
Which could cause problems

1262
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:06,719
The future

1263
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:09,791
Steven Stasi secret pretty irate with a

1264
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:11,071
Company that launched

1265
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:13,887
Small satellites without necessarily getting

1266
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:17,215
Who commissioned the SEC is resolved its disagreement

1267
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:21,567
Things that I've moved forward but there is a level of response

1268
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:23,103
Disability that is needed

1269
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:24,895
On the pulse of people who want

1270
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:26,687
How to do things in space

1271
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:29,247
It's not a good idea to move faster

1272
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:30,015
Drake sings

1273
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:30,783
In space

1274
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:32,063
If you do that to you

1275
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:33,343
I still hang up a lot of problem

1276
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:35,647
Into the future because I lost these satellites world

1277
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:36,927
Hangman phrases

1278
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:39,231
Ronaldo people says well space has a big

1279
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:42,047
Places not like that much of a likelihood of collision

1280
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:48,447
You know we had a collision of an iridium satellite with a defensive action satellite about 10 years ago which came as in

1281
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:49,727
Message to everyone

1282
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:52,287
Since then people started to wake up but

1283
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:54,079
Ask new people coming to the end

1284
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:57,919
Without necessarily the history thinking that they can do

1285
00:50:58,175 --> 00:50:59,199
You clever thing

1286
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:03,039
Songs with miniature satellite they do have to be careful and

1287

Story problems for everyone else

1289
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:08,927
Wise words I wish we had followed them here on the ground

1290
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:09,695
Actually for a while

1291
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:16,351
Alright what is the big news for this coming year what are the things that you are looking at in the satellite and just

1292
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:19,423
Tree that you actually think her interesting or worth monitoring

1293
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:23,775
What we going to love focus on these assets by potential new end

1294
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:24,799
We've got

1295
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:26,079
A lot of interesting

1296
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:27,615
Pay to Elon Musk

1297
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:29,151
SpaceX launch

1298
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:30,431
Consolation

1299
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:32,735
Installing a lawn six

1300
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:33,503
Osaka lights

1301
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:39,903
A few months ago that plan to have a couple more launches before the end of the year and then more launches next year that's really good

1302
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:41,695
Xcelerate broadband

1303
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:45,279
And those efforts are progressing

1304
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:49,119
Fast people look up Gold Bond has a multibillion-dollar market

1305
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:55,263
What's getting less attention all that the many of the smaller satellites where people are looking at

1306
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:56,287
Predominantly iota

1307
00:51:56,543 --> 00:52:02,687
Key Focus to the pin some struggle sky and space Global is Walnut made a big splash in a year or so ago

1308
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:06,015
With the motor that says they talking like they talked about

1309
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:08,063
Capabilities and iot

1310
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:09,343
They could also in

1311
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:15,487
Nigeria and other places and they have run into Financial challenges in terms of getting

1312
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:18,047
The money that they need to complete that constellation

1313
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:21,375
And I think if you go back to the set of stalling situation

1314
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:22,399
Diamond device

1315
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:23,935
With one lap hoop in the ground

1316
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:25,471
A few more years

1317
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:26,495
Who also now

1318
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:27,263
Plank flooring

1319
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:29,567
Dozens of satellites over the next few months

1320
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:32,895
100 over the next couple of years.

1321
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:36,223
Tumulty's multibillion-dollar bulbine consolation

1322
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:42,623
In some ways is sucking the oxygen out of the market for some of these smaller sounds like

1323
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:49,023
License those people may only need to raise tensor a couple of hundred million dollars

1324
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:54,655
Paying attention to the big glass and everyone's worried about to face a condor Amazon might do next

1325
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:56,959
Without iron plant open consolation

1326
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:59,263
They worry that these small price will get

1327
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:02,079
Crushed under the circle to deploy

1328
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:04,895
Because it's a very new set of application

1329
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:06,943
Shenzhen iot no one quite knows

1330
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:07,967
How big fat mouth

1331
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:09,247
It is going to be

1332
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:12,319
Whether that new distribution Partnerships will

1333
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:18,719
Materialize it in in terms of Revenue generation and it's easy to look at Bull bandhan sale KY

1334
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:25,119
Well that's a multibillion-dollar market already know we've got a couple of million people in North America already paying for satellite

1335
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:27,935
Hope and maybe they'll be lots more of those overtime

1336
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:34,335
I'd say okay that's why we're so concerned about 8 I would like to buy some people like you I must ingest that sauce and maybe wear

1337
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:36,895
Not going to give money to these more

1338
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:39,455
Lower-profile Boulevard

1339
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:46,879
The case then people are going to run into the sand over the next year 18 months I think we're on the point at which we met

1340
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:48,671
I see some failures

1341
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:50,719
All these small players

1342
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:52,255
Over the next 12 months

1343
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:53,023
I'm so sorry

1344
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:57,119
Which would be a bad sign if we see something bigger than that

1345
00:53:57,375 --> 00:54:00,191
We see a major multibillion-dollar Soco system

1346
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:06,591
So then that would be even worse but I think we're at the point where I some of these small players are need to push up or shut

1347
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:07,615
Andres

1348
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:14,015
Multiple times in millions of dollars in the diary near-term some signs of the red circles going on at the moment

1349
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:16,831
And what happens when a satellite company

1350
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:17,855
Does that a business

1351
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:22,719
What happens to their constellation I know a lot of these only have either done some

1352
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:23,999
Demo launches

1353
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:25,279
But they still have stuff up

1354
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:32,191
Yes that's right and to some degree that they do have a level of responsibilities for deorbiting face craft

1355
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:33,727
If they have lost things

1356
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:41,919
As we talked about before things like lights glad and Tara start writing medetai spectravite

1357
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:42,687
Unconverted

1358
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:49,087
Did the terrestrial Spectrum the maybe some assets that go on here so people who have satellites faction lights won't

1359
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:52,927
Mother ties it to Estrellita if they caught make a business after satellites

1360
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:54,463
Whistle to say

1361
00:54:54,719 --> 00:55:00,351
How that comes about other how that develops but if these people got to a point where they they don't believe they can

1362
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:05,215
Consult that sounds like business they made much with other people who might be able to take Advanced L license

1363
00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:07,007
Was it say they may try

1364
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:08,287
Something like

1365
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:10,335
Converting the satellite license

1366
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:11,615
To address your license

1367
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:13,407
Princess Anne country 6 * 5

1368
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:17,503
Got it thanks so much for coming on the show this

1369
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:20,831
This week I really have learned a lot and I appreciate you taking the time

1370
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:23,135
Price AC to stingrays

1371
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:29,535
That's it for this week thanks so much for listening and remember if you'd like more iot

1372
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:35,935
Snooze sign up for my newsletter at Stacey on iot. Cam will see you next week
