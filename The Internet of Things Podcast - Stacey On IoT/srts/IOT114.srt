Secret launch

6
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:21,760

7
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:23,808
Kevin has some big news for everyone

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,344
We got some chips news

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,184
We're going to talk about the WeMo dimmer switch and a few other

10
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,208
Plus

11
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:33,536
We have this week sponsor which is Eros and

12
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:36,608
Our guests who is Brett Greenstein

13
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:38,144
From IBM

14
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:43,264
And some other cool things about

15
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,312
So

16
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:47,616
Let's get this party started with

17
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:54,784
Quit message from one of our sponsors this week sponsor is Affiliated monitoring if you are hunting for a subscription

18
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:01,184
Revenue model for your iot business you need to hear about Affiliated monitoring in response to a trigger from any connected

19
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:07,584
Is a vice Affiliated the professionally trained live agents can follow-up protocol and reach out to your customers their loved one

20
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,960
Guns and local emergency services Affiliated works with hundreds of Smart Home Security

21
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:19,360
Health and other iot businesses visit Affiliated. Com iot to read a case

22
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:25,760
A study on how they've helped connected car startup turn an idea into a thriving business with a hundred million dollar

23
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:28,320
Surrexit that's Affiliated. Com

24
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:30,368
/ iot

25
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:33,440
That's actually a really good idea

26
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:36,256
There's a lot of businesses that

27
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:38,048
Benefit from having a trigger

28
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,352
Actually do more than just send you a notification

29
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,144
All right

30
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:43,680
Unto the show

31
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:44,960
Let's go

32
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:46,496
Start with Andy Rubin

33
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:49,312
And the essential

34
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:53,408
We can't we have to talk about the essential phone and the essential home

35
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:54,688
One punch

36
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,480
Is only here the essential phone

37
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:57,248
So

38
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,784
Kevin do you think this is essential

39
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:04,416
Well they would like it to be like for those who don't know Andy Rubin is the

40
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:05,952
Creator of Android

41
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:09,024
And has left Google a couple years back and forget when

42
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,560
But this is his first

43
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:12,352
Venture outside of

44
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:14,656
Life after Google it isn't Android

45
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:16,192
Powered phone and it's

46
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:17,728
Iron specifications

47
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:19,008
And dealt with

48
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:22,080
Printed materials such as titanium and ceramic

49
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:25,152
Pretty much an edge-to-edge display even more so than the

50
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,176
Galaxy S

51
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:31,808
8 but Samsung makes I don't know if they see if you've seen the because it's edge to edge

52
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:33,344
Here's why this phone is not

53
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,624
Essential for me

54
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,464
I do not like the front facing camera cutout

55
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,744
On the display

56
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:41,792
Did you see that

57
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,072
I did

58
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:51,520
That separate that separate the top of the phone just like you would have

59
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,616
But since the screen goes all the way to the top Edge

60
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:59,712
It's almost like there's a hole there in the screen as you're looking at content

61
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:00,480
Oh I do see it

62
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:04,576
Looks like a keyhole or something like what is bad

63
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:09,952
Took to not essential for me personally I sent you would be to not see that

64
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:13,280
But regardless regardless of that it is all high-end

65
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,840
Specs on a Snapdragon 835 and

66
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:19,424
4 gig of RAM and all the typical high-end features

67
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,240
You were leading to the backside of the phone

68
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,264
Has these

69
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,800
To Pogo pins

70
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:29,920
Where you place a 360-degree camera you would it attaches to the phone

71
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,968
And then I believe it actually

72
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:37,600
Since the data from that 360 camera over a 60 gigahertz Wi-Fi gig

73
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,136
Holy cow

74
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,720
A new devices

75
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,512
Found it

76
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,048
Possibly

77
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,352
Maybe bring this technology

78
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:49,888
Like 2002

79
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:53,216
Ultra wideband

80
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:56,032
Ultra wideband that it was something else

81
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:59,360
So many chip companies went into this and fail

82
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,384
And

83
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:07,040
The standard is always been there basically Superfast High data rates you can send over 60 gigahertz but you can only do it when it's

84
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,576
It's really close proximity

85
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:15,232
Yep I totally totally it's a perfect season I knew because I knew you would cover the since way back

86
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,536
I knew you would love that little aspect of it

87
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:21,375
As we said it runs Android it's $699

88
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:30,591
360 camera

89
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:35,199
I would imagine not a lot of bloatware I'm suspecting US Stock Android or slightly tweet

90
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,527
Yoga wear

91
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,063
Very no logos

92
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:43,135
Yeah yeah minutes it's a nice-looking device

93
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:44,927
Now

94
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:52,351
Competes against a lot of other night so I can give Isis and this is a relatively unknown company because it's

95
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:54,143
Essentialism

96
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:55,935
Ribbon startup

97
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:56,703
So

98
00:04:57,215 --> 00:05:02,335
We'll have to see it does it doesn't work well with security updates and so on and you know there's a lot of question

99
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:03,359
To be asked

100
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,407
We are not it

101
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,967
I thought you were going to leave the fact that we are not iPhone

102
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:09,759
We are

103
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,039
Iot

104
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,599
An iot compono

105
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:17,951
And it's very vague and fluffy so we're going to go with what we know

106
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:18,975
Which is

107
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:25,887
This summer

108
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:29,983
This is they call it home it runs something called ambient OS

109
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:33,823
And this is my idea is this will work

110
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:34,847
With everything

111
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:38,943
The product itself is a tiny round

112
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:42,271
Device looks kind of hockey puck Asia Terrace light

113
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:47,135
It reminds me of

114
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,671
An echo Dot

115
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:54,303
More wedge-shaped because the top is slanted is you had said and it has a touch screen display

116
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:57,631
Emma's wish that's what the. Was from Harbor perspective

117
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:00,191
Touch lamp

118
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,495
True true

119
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:06,591
And we don't know how much this is going to cost is coming out summer times

120
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,359
What's the time

121
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:14,527
So how does it work with everything that it works with homekit

122
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:15,807
Products that are very handy

123
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:22,975
It's apparently doing so that reverse engineering public apis which

124
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:24,767
Not ideal

125
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:28,351
I mean it's nice for like

126
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:31,679
But what happens if those public apis can change in

127
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:33,215
What will happen is it a break

128
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,263
Your product before

129
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,799
Fake necessarily fix it

130
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:37,823
Right

131
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,103
Sony demonstration

132
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,127
It's always better from

133
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:40,895
The end-user

134
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:44,735
It's Andy Rubin I can't imagine that these guys can't get

135
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,783
You know when the time comes

136
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:47,551
Cam specs

137
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,623
Since everyone else isn't that competes with like

138
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:53,183
Google maybe they won't do a nest integration

139
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:54,975
Play hard to say

140
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:59,583
One of the other aspects which is very important for our listeners is that

141
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:01,119
There's a privacy

142
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:07,775
Function I guess you could say or design in that it tries to handle as much data as possible locally on the device

143
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:10,079
I'm not sure how that's going to work

144
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:12,127
Because if it's tying into all these other

145
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:13,919
Platforms

146
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:16,735
It's going to be sending and receiving data in

147
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:20,319
I possibly giving giving data to those platforms so

148
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,599
I'm not sure

149
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,135
Not sure how that's going to work

150
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:25,183
It sounds good on paper but let's see

151
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:26,975
And

152
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,511
Just for funsies

153
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:30,559
I'm interested in this because

154
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,375
Playground pictures

155
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:35,423
Which is also backing this

156
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:39,775
They funded something called lighthouse

157
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:42,335
And lighthouses

158
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:45,919
A smart home assistant that has an image

159
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:50,015
Comment so computer vision components so it can actually see things so you can Chester to it

160
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,575
It sounds really cool this is also not a

161
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,391
Cool products

162
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,439
Bill's pretty competitive

163
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,207
With

164
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:58,975
What is this

165
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:02,815
I don't see a camera or mention of a camera on the

166
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,351
This device so

167
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:06,911
Anticipating no Machine Vision

168
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:09,215
Aspect to it which eventually help

169
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:10,239
Its first integration

170
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:13,823
But that'll help keep the cost down number one

171
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:16,383
And to it kind of leads back to the hole

172
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:18,687
New Amazon products which

173
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,735
I'm still scratching my head over I know you ordered

174
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:23,807
The show

175
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,623
And I seen the discount packs

176
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,391
Before

177
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:30,207
I had ordered my first one I would have

178
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:36,863
Cuz we need it cuz we need another way to talk

179
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,471
That's essential will find out more

180
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,751
We'll stay on this

181
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,543
Cuz by dali

182
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:47,615
You know I love Andy Rubin he's a big

183
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:48,383
Open

184
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:51,199
Kind of open web Guy Fieri consumeristic

185
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:54,783
I feel like his attention to the phone with some things of kind of

186
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:57,855
Tragedy fetishistic which I don't think is going to work

187
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,647
Actually in the smart home space

188
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:00,671
Because

189
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:05,279
Most normal people do not care if their stuff is made of titanium

190
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,583
And that's that's for the phone

191
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,375
I do have some concerns there

192
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:13,215
Also the fact that it's going to be doing everything local means it's got to be

193
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,495
Pretty robust

194
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,519
Processor on it

195
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,567
When should you add to the cost

196
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,103
10 tube

197
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:19,871
Be cheap

198
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:21,919
Again

199
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:22,687
We'll see

200
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:23,967
I would love for there to be more

201
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:24,991
Competition in the space

202
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:25,759
Jason actually

203
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:28,319
This was something I was thinking about talking about

204
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,599
Before this came out

205
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:33,439
I actually feel that my smart home works really well right

206
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:36,255
Weird

207
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:42,399
Because I spent so much time complaining about standards but when's the last time you guys heard me complain about like zigbee or Z-Wave

208
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,167
If I happen

209
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:48,031
Right or something or something that doesn't work with something because of some other particle maybe not

210
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,567
Messerli radio but

211
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:52,383
Maybe apis sdks

212
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,663
We're getting there

213
00:09:53,919 --> 00:10:00,063
Yeah cuz with the Google will actually with the Amazon Echo and now with Google's latest Integrations I feel

214
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:02,367
Basically I just say what I want

215
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:06,975
And then there's also those super powerful tools like stringify and if now that it's

216
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:07,743
Scott the maker

217
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,303
I actually can do a lot

218
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,863
So this brings us to

219
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:23,615
Such a subtle Segway but oh so timely yes okay so

220
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:24,895
After

221
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:25,663
Almost there

222
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:32,063
Here I guess I guess Google announced the Google home be at last IO 2016

223
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:32,831
It wasn't available

224
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:37,439
That's true so I get a pass at least until October so

225
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:39,999
Longtime listeners will know I

226
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:43,583
Cast on the Google home because I have for Echo devices in my house

227
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:47,423
Mainly for the reasons that you just said because things worked

228
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:51,263
Write everything I needed to do eisworth well with the echo

229
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,543
However

230
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,079
I finally caved

231
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:56,383
I ordered a Google home for two reasons

232
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:02,015
It actually has not arrived at its comes tomorrow so I can't speak to how else working for me

233
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:05,599
But one of the reasons was all of the new Integrations

234
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:08,415
With the Smart Home Products the ones that I particularly use already

235
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:11,231
So it will essentially replace

236
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:12,255
An echo

237
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:14,303
Turn my smart home purposes

238
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:19,423
Additionally I do feel having use Google Assistant that when I want information

239
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:24,287
I get a broader range in more detail information more specific information from

240
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,311
Google

241
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:30,943
Knowledge Graph as opposed to the echo I think Amazon's made improvements but they have a ways to go there

242
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:31,967
So

243
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,759
The second reason I got it

244
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,551
3 reasons

245
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:37,087
The second reason I got it is

246
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:37,855
Because

247
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,391
I got rid of my pixel

248
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:42,975
A few months ago about a Galaxy S8 which has as we know Bixby

249
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:46,047
I have the assistant on there however I cannot

250
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,327
Use the hot word

251
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:51,167
To trigger the assistant unless the screen is on or the device is plugged in

252
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:53,471
Where's the pixel I guess I could just use it

253
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:55,775
Getting frustrated by that

254
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:56,799
Finally

255
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:59,103
There was and I think there still is

256
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:01,407
A $30 discount on Google home if

257
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,687
You

258
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:05,503
Purchase it through Google Express switch

259
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,039
I've never used before

260
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:09,343
It's for new Google Express customers

261
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:14,719
There's a coupon code which may we can put in the show notes we put the link to where I got this information

262
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:17,279
Said hopefully it still available for people making use it

263
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,047
So

264
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:24,447
I sign up for Google Express probably won't use express anymore. Cancel that service but I got $30 off the homestead 99 box so

265
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,495
For all those reasons I caved

266
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:27,263
Got to Google

267
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,287
Okay

268
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:30,847
After you've had it I want to hear your experience with

269
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:31,615
Music

270
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:34,175
Because I find the Spotify

271
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,991
Integrations if I ask Google to play a song

272
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,015
Can I ask

273
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,295
The echo to play a song

274
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:41,599
Metal Place the correct song

275
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,879
Cool seems to play like

276
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:45,183
The top voted karaoke version of the song

277
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:48,767
Well I don't want that

278
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:51,327
I may not be the best person to ask however

279
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:54,143
Because I don't use Spotify

280
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:57,983
None of the services I use are actually on Google

281
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,007
App for music

282
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,543
Are you Sirius XM

283
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:07,199
And unfortunately because my family all has iPhones we have an apple music family plan so neither of those work with it

284
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:11,039
Best I'm going to be able to do is use the free version of Google Play Music

285
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,903
But at the fact

286
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,183
Your music library

287
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:20,767
We have gone

288
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:21,791
So far

289
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:26,655
It doesn't work across many devices I kind of feel along with smart watches

290
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:28,447
Music is actually a lock-in

291
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,215
4

292
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,263
Assistance as well as smart watches

293
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:33,567
I agree

294
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,383
I do not Apple

295
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,407
Apple though

296
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,199
Is getting even more

297
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:40,479
Locked in

298
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,015
Vertically integrated

299
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,807
There is a report out

300
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:48,159
Last week the apple is designing its own a iPhone chip

301
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:54,815
This is pretty exciting news totally fits with the Apple ecosystem where Apple was be

302
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:59,167
The first phone manufacturer to release

303
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:02,495
Decided to sign its own arm-based chips for the

304
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,263
The phone

305
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,799
Those are the

306
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,591
Slash number processors

307
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,919
5272 that's area

308
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:15,551
Oh okay I said where to the A9 Axor

309
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,391
So

310
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,415
Apple does that

311
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:22,719
They also design their own chips

312
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,743
For their Wireless

313
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:24,511
Headphones

314
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,279
Actually

315
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,559
WW1

316
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:27,839
Yes and

317
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:30,655
They were one of the first to create a

318
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:33,215
A sensor unit sensor processing

319
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:33,983
So that

320
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,519
It's their m

321
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,199
This is not crazy that Apple would say you know what

322
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:50,111
This whole day I think this this basically execution this inference of artificial intelligence algorithms

323
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,135
We got a separate that

324
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,671
We got to put that someplace else in

325
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,719
Design something special

326
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:55,743
For that

327
00:14:56,511 --> 00:15:02,655
The reason they can do this is because they sell so many darn iPhones and because it's going to be a huge savings

328
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:05,471
Maybe not huge it will be a savings on battery life

329
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,263
It's really important

330
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:10,591
Cuz running these algorithms can take

331
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:14,687
A lot of processing power and also it needs to happen really fast and

332
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,991
You don't want that competing with you know

333
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:19,039
Trying to load your website

334
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,319
Your browser

335
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,415
Magically happy

336
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,487
You know what really sing

337
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:30,815
I'm going to say this and you can correct me if I'm wrong

338
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:32,351
Is maybe I do have this around the world

339
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:34,143
In my finger really seeing

340
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:39,519
I must March toward Asics application-specific integrated circuits for

341
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:42,079
Just about everything now every used to be that the

342
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:45,151
The phone processor would just do everything but now we've got

343
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,455
And we had digital signal processor

344
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:48,991
An hour

345
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,783
Building chips for AI

346
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:53,599
And building chips for this and billing chips for that

347
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,647
So we can optimize

348
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:59,999
As you said the processing power for the right task in the battery life for the right path so we can

349
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:03,071
Get a good mix of a battery life in a Daiso

350
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,423
I think you're going to see a lot more this especially with a i and assistance

351
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:10,495
Apple certainly not the only one working on this in my opinion

352
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:11,519
And

353
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:13,055
I'll be curious to see what

354
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,591
Advantages they Tout

355
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,383
If and when this comes out

356
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:20,223
Yes and we talked about the sun previous shows but this is

357
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:23,807
What we talk about is the end of general purpose computing

358
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:26,623
We've come to a point where battery life is so significant

359
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,903
The volume sprayer

360
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:32,511
Not just phone makers but even some of the big wet companies means that they can

361
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,815
Build specialized not just equipment

362
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:35,839
What's silicon

363
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:39,423
This is a huge existential

364
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,447
Threat to Intel

365
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:42,239
So I'll just bring that up

366
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,287
Yep it's pretty big one

367
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:46,079
Kevin we actually forgot

368
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,103
Something we forgot your

369
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:47,871
Closure sew

370
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:51,711
Retroactive oh yes I will yes so I do work

371
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:55,295
Google I do not work on anything iot related

372
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,831
Then all opinions are my own

373
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,279
We do not question

374
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,303
Kevin is

375
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,399
Speaking of chips

376
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:15,007
They finally announced what they're going to do with it dynamic

377
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:19,103
Architecture that they announced probably 3 or 4 months ago

378
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:23,711
How much so they have a new cortex a75

379
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:26,527
55in a brand new Molly chip

380
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:28,575
Only the cortex chips use the dynamic

381
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:31,135
Which is basically a new way of

382
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,415
Parallel processing multi

383
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:34,719
Keith reading it's it's better for AI

384
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,511
There's that word again

385
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,559
So all of those

386
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:40,351
They're at the more energy efficient

387
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,631
Really Nifty

388
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:43,423
And then the Maui chip is just

389
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,727
It's it's my better graphics chip

390
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,007
It's more power efficient

391
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:47,775
It's

392
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,311
More powerful

393
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:54,687
So we talked about the dynamic

394
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:58,015
CPUs I kind of pillow is a little bit of marketing fluff back in March

395
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,039
I

396
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:02,111
Kill a little less so in that

397
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:05,183
Instead of comparing big and little chips in terms of

398
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:07,487
High compute and high battery life with

399
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:09,279
Less computer lower battery life

400
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:12,095
You can mix and match a little bit so you can go up to

401
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:14,143
Eight-course believe

402
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:20,287
But you can say six or seven of them are low-power and only one is high-power you can

403
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:24,383
Do whatever you need to do for whatever device you're designing so

404
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,175
I'm a little bit

405
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:32,319
You're impressed by that so maybe you can have a record medicated just to machine learning for example

406
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:33,855
And again this is that much

407
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:38,207
This is chi you guys

408
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,487
The theme of the week

409
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,511
Bachelor

410
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:42,815
Moving on from chips

411
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:44,863
Verizon

412
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:47,423
Hub

413
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:48,703
Sorta

414
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:49,983
Yeah this is my

415
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,311
Okay well this is marketing

416
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:56,127
Can I just say that right in French

417
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,151
Okay

418
00:18:57,663 --> 00:19:00,479
So Verizon put out a press release last week

419
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:04,063
Turn your house into a Verizon 4G LTE home with

420
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,087
Smart Hub

421
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,879
That's the name of the product smart

422
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:08,671
Capital S capital h

423
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:14,047
I fail to see the Smart Hub capabilities of it it seems to me like it's basically

424
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:15,839
A way to bring Wireless

425
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,375
Broadband to your house which

426
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:19,167
There's Merit for that

427
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:21,727
People out in rural areas at maybe

428
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:22,751
They don't have

429
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:28,895
Cable choices FiOS isn't there and so on maybe the other using phones with Hotspots for their primary connectivity

430
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,175
I get it

431
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:32,479
At this place makes sense it's a $200

432
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,527
4G router essentially

433
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,367
But Verizon made a big to-do about how it's going to work well with all of your

434
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:42,975
Smart devices including more than 200 Wi-Fi products and so on and so forth

435
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:46,303
So I'm thinking before even though it's like a router with

436
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,351
You know it's that acts as a Smart Hub

437
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:53,727
But it doesn't seem to be that doesn't seem to have those kind of smart that just seems to be a way to have

438
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:57,823
Connectivity for your devices like maybe like a Gateway at best

439
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,871
Am I misunderstanding it

440
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:01,663
Well it looks a little smarter

441
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,479
I mean this is still not something I would buy because

442
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:10,111
So basically it's $200 it's got the backup to the 4G network

443
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:16,767
Works on Wi-Fi it connects to over 200 Wi-Fi devices it's got a tiny little OLED screen at the top

444
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:20,095
Tells you how many devices are on your network and some other things

445
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:22,911
And in the app it does let you control

446
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:24,447
In schedule

447
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,239
Like routines and that's worth

448
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:27,775
So

449
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:29,823
You can tell anything to

450
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:31,103
It reminds me of the

451
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:33,151
Routers

452
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:35,711
Become red in in just imaginating 4G

453
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:38,271
The idea for cheese basically

454
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:42,111
It also has a backup battery so when your power goes out

455
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:43,647
You still have

456
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:45,439
Cellular connectivity to

457
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:47,231
Two things that run on batteries

458
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:51,327
Right now it's only has cellular connectivity if I'm not mistaken

459
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:57,983
Well not this early but again for people in rural areas I think it's

460
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:00,543
That's good because I don't have many Broadband choices

461
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:04,895
Yes

462
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:06,431
Okay so

463
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:08,479
You got your cellular to Wi-Fi connection

464
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,527
That's yay

465
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:16,928
But if your power goes out you know you're not going to be able to control most of these devices cuz most wifi-based devices which is what this works with

466
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:20,256
They are plugged in because such a Powerhouse

467
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:21,536
Right

468
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:24,608
That's where I'm kind of

469
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,192
It seems like a mish-mosh of

470
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:29,984
A lot of technology that

471
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:31,776
Doesn't

472
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:34,592
Yeah I don't think so again

473
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,640
If you don't have good

474
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:38,176
Wired Broadband nagpur

475
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:39,456
Opportunities at your house

476
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:42,528
Then it this might make sense you write will be expensive

477
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:44,832
But at a Smart Hub I just

478
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:46,368
I'm just kind of questioning

479
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:47,904
What kind of man

480
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,744
Oh but we do want to talk about so

481
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,792
One of our listeners John

482
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:55,840
Send us an email John

483
00:21:56,096 --> 00:22:01,728
Morse he actually sent a comment on one of her last blogs that was super helpful so he introduced us to

484
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:02,496
This

485
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:04,544
TI has a technology called

486
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:05,568
Captivate

487
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:08,896
And it basically is touch technology that

488
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:09,920
That works through

489
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:10,688
Wood

490
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,528
Wow that would be so cool he points out the

491
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:18,368
I agree

492
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,392
Real estate like

493
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:24,768
That I'm I'm very excited about like touch technology that works through Fabrics because I'm like

494
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,328
Passive touch screen an arm of your couch

495
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:30,912
Is here there like you could put it on your coffee table as long as it's

496
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:33,984
The MC use can sense their laminated plywood that's up to

497
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,312
2.75 in thick in particle board this one inch thick

498
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:43,456
So I don't know I think this is kind of neat right Kevin oh absolutely am it if you can't agree

499
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:44,992
Capacitive touch into wood

500
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:47,296
Products furniture and sex it would be

501
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,320
Great

502
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:53,952
Do you have to plug in your furniture to make this work a minute this says it can run on a battery for a certain amount of time

503
00:22:58,048 --> 00:23:00,608
Exactly exactly so ideal weight yet

504
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:07,008
You probably want a dedicated power source but if you do that then you think of the possibilities of adding integrated wireless charging to the furniture

505
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,800
Is available today but

506
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,336
You know this just makes sense.

507
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:11,360
How to

508
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:13,664
Go hand-in-hand with a capacitive touch

509
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,432
Element

510
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:15,456
Sound like

511
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:18,784
Again my my sit-stand desk is wood

512
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,088
The top and I would love to not have

513
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,184
Physical buttons underneath it to raise it or lower it may be great to just go to a

514
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,744
Section of the desk itself Express in heaven

515
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,768
Do its thing

516
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:31,328
I would love to see you.

517
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:34,656
We're actually love this I'm like my dining room table

518
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:36,192
Control my dining room light

519
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:38,240
How awesome you'd be like

520
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:41,312
It's a little bright in here at the sun goes down

521
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:47,456
I don't need wireless charging in my

522
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:48,736
Kelso that would

523
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,808
Writing rice

524
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,112
Okay so there is one downside

525
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:54,880
Would you like to tell

526
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:57,184
Oh yeah

527
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,232
That's the dance I almost forgot about it because it's

528
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:01,280
Barely mentioned

529
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:07,936
Yes I'm just going to read this flat out from the Press race touch technology embedded in wood might also be subject to moisture

530
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:08,960
Penetration

531
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:12,800
Send me from a spilled drink on the arm of the chair or rain on a door frame

532
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:20,224
So if your knees in your dining room table don't put your drinks down on capacitive coasters

533
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:21,248
There you go

534
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,528
So

535
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:24,320
Really cool technology

536
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:25,600
TI's got it

537
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:27,392
I thought this was great

538
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:28,416
Thank you so much

539
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:30,464
Kris Kristofferson

540
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:32,512
All right

541
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:35,328
I promised you last week that I would talk to you about the

542
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:37,376
WeMo Wi-Fi

543
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,144
Dimmer

544
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,168
Switch

545
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:42,496
And this is wemo's first dimmer switch

546
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:46,080
They had a normal wifi-connected switch that was on and off and

547
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:47,872
Some people like that some people do not

548
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:50,944
The dimmer switch is $80 so it's

549
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,224
Prasek's

550
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:54,528
My favorite switches which are still Lutron

551
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:57,856
And it's pricier than the Leviton WiFi Decora series

552
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:02,464
Play switch I also have installed cuz those are about 50 bucks and they work with the Amazon Echo without a

553
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:04,256
Cuddly trying to work you need to

554
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:10,912
My install process was a little wonky because I've got some crazy wiring so I ran into some trouble

555
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:11,936
In the first spot

556
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,728
So I stuck it in a different

557
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:17,056
And I put it in the bath

558
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:19,616
And this is a

559
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:20,896
Really nice light

560
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:22,688
It's got a capacitive touch dimmer

561
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:27,040
So you just move your finger up and down the dimmer which is kind of need to turn the lights

562
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:31,392
LED in it that turns on

563
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,160
When

564
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:33,184
The light

565
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:39,072
Is triggered by something so it turns different colors based on what product has triggered it

566
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:41,376
If that is something really

567
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:42,912
Cool cuz if you set like

568
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:45,728
If you're like me you said a lot of different recipes or

569
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:49,312
Things up and then suddenly your lights are going on and you have no idea why

570
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:51,104
Believe me guys

571
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,128
Happens to me more often

572
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:55,200
Be able to look at it

573
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,992
Blue and be like

574
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:59,808
Hey. That means I just turned it on with the Amazon Echo

575
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:00,576
Which

576
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:04,416
Is maybe not a weird thing but if it turns orange that means I've turned it on but if if

577
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:07,232
Which actually is a nice thing because

578
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:09,024
You know that might be an automation then

579
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:11,584
I like

580
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,352
The light

581
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:16,960
To feel it's expensive and then the other things know about it it's got the most

582
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:18,240
Wonderful labeling

583
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,520
Squires

584
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:20,288
Lovely

585
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,312
I got to say

586
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:26,432
The switch itself is

587
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:28,736
Freaking huge just so big

588
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:31,040
So if you don't have a lot of room

589
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:32,832
Like I initially try to install it in a

590
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:33,600
3 games

591
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:35,904
Switch and there's a lot of wires crammed back there

592
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:36,928
It wasn't

593
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,000
It's bigger even than

594
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:42,048
So it's bigger than electrons

595
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,864
It's bigger than the Leviton

596
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,680
It goes as bad as deep as the Leviton but it's also a live

597
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:52,544
That's going to be an issue if you don't have a lot of room in the

598
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,568
The back of your switch box

599
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:55,616
Or you can just hire an electrician

600
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:04,064
You know it's interesting because all the the boxes and all were designed for a traditional light switches for years and years and

601
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,112
Years and now we're adding

602
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,648
Smart sand

603
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,928
Chips and

604
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:10,720
Things radios and such

605
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:13,024
Into the switches that I wonder

606
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:16,352
You know how we run out of room in a sentence

607
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:17,376
Man

608
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:20,448
Okay that's a hugely certified product thank God

609
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,472
Because you don't

610
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:29,920
Standard standard for a reason

611
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:30,688
Toads

612
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:31,456
I think so

613
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:32,480
Yeah yeah

614
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:33,504
That's going to be

615
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,784
A challenge but

616
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:36,832
But yes it is something to think about

617
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,368
If you don't have a lot of room back there

618
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:40,160
You're going to be folded wires

619
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:46,304
I anticipate embedded speakers maybe even cameras and such and switches

620
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,632
Yes there's a lot of weathers motion sensors

621
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:51,424
There's microphone switches

622
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:55,008
Your relay switch for

623
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:57,824
You have

624
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,592
Stick out a little

625
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:01,152
Yes it did

626
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,944
So it it moved forward

627
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:04,992
Fred

628
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:06,784
Which means you could install it in

629
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:08,320
Cycling switch

630
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,136
Soda challenge

631
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:13,184
All right

632
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:14,720
Cheapest to think about

633
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:19,072
Alright thank you so much Kevin

634
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:20,352
No

635
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:21,120
We will

636
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:21,888
Stay tuned

637
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:25,216
For a Our Guest this week Brett Greenstein for my VM

638
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:26,240
And

639
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:32,640
Before we talk to him we are going to have a quick message from this week's sponsor hey everyone we

640
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:39,040
Breaking into this week's podcast with the message from our sponsor this we sponsor is Eros and I have

641
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:43,136
Z Hussain who is the CTO and founder of Eros

642
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:45,184
Here to talk to me about

643
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:47,744
Hot markets for The Internet of Things

644
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:48,768
So

645
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:49,792
Quick Refresher

646
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:51,584
Tell people what areas is

647
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:55,168
Eros is a company that provides a complete solution

648
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:59,264
From the devices that are located out in the field all the way back

649
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,288
Netflix

650
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,360
To the storage and analytic functions that are necessary

651
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,896
Support iot applications

652
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:10,784
From small medium and large Enterprises for their customers or friendly

653
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,320
Markets for iot

654
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:14,368
What are the most rapidly growing areas for

655
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:21,024
What are the natural things about cellular which is what we do and provide for connectivity Services is

656
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,584
The fact that devices that need to be mobile

657
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:29,984
Can be on our networks are roughly half of the units tend to be in the automotive & Fleet Management space not surprisingly

658
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:32,800
On the other hand one of the largest markets that is

659
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:38,432
Coming up to speed is the healthcare Market because of the impact that iot Solutions can have on the cost

660
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:43,040
Problems that are being encountered in the healthcare Arena that market is exploding

661
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:44,064
Those are both

662
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,600
Really good Industries

663
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:48,928
So how should they think about the trade-offs between

664
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:50,464
Wi-Fi and cellular

665
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:56,864
Surly Wi-Fi tends to be a very ubiquitous solution if it's available in a given

666
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:03,264
Residence or given business or given building the only issue is that you have to do a fair amount of configuration

667
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,056
To be able to use that Network

668
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:10,176
And not all applications can take advantage of that or the maintenance and debugging and support

669
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:13,248
Can become an issue so people like to be able to use

670
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:19,648
Networks that are dependent on someone locally providing a support activity support system

671
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:21,184
Netflix

672
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,744
And to be the method of choice because the network

673
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:28,608
We'll manage that for you Eros managers the device behavior on the network

674
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:30,656
Because they can reach out and see the device

675
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:33,472
Completely independent of any local setup issue that might

676
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:36,032
So now I know what's hot and how to connect

677
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:37,568
When should a business

678
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:38,336
Think about

679
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:39,872
Beginning to implement in Iowa

680
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:40,640
Beauty solution

681
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:46,016
The best time to implement an iot solution is when you know the problem you're trying

682
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:50,368
And you have information that you're trying to get remotely

683
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:52,160
And you have an understanding of what

684
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,696
Value that information

685
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:56,768
Has for you your company or your potential

686
00:30:57,024 --> 00:31:03,168
If you don't take advantage of the fact that data is available and that the solutions that are being implemented in the iot space

687
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:09,312
Can provide you the necessary information in a way that will make meaningful sense their business action

688
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:11,104
Then that's not the right time to start

689
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,688
Where can I find out more about what Arris is doing

690
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,040
I want to find out more about iot Solutions and how to deploy

691
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:24,672
And iot solution for their particular problem I would highly recommend that a download a copy of the

692
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:28,256
Free ebook that I have published this available on our website

693
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:34,912
Www.arris.com listen to a copy of this podcast another part

694
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:35,680
Scott Stapp

695
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:42,080
Www.arris.com podcast

696
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:46,432
Hey everyone welcome to the Internet of Things podcast

697
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:48,480
This is your host Stacey Higginbotham

698
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:50,272
And we are joined this week by

699
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:51,296
Brett Greenstein

700
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:53,600
Who is vice president for Watson iot

701
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:55,648
Over at IBM

702
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:56,928
Hi Brett how you doing

703
00:31:57,696 --> 00:32:00,512
Very good nice to talk to Stacy

704
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:01,792
Actually we've talked

705
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:04,864
You guys and Brett is a font of information

706
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:05,632
About this

707
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:06,400
But that

708
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:07,168
It's not really

709
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,704
Talk too much about today

710
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,752
Instead we are going to focus

711
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:12,544
Watson's iot business

712
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,592
And also a broader question of

713
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:18,688
How do we go from all of the sensor data to actually

714
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,760
Taking action or getting valuable insights from it

715
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:22,784
So let's

716
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:23,808
Let's start off

717
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:24,832
Set the hard question

718
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,880
I got gobs of data

719
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:28,416
Tracking everything

720
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:30,208
How do I take that

721
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:30,976
And get from

722
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:32,000
Data

723
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:32,768
2

724
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:38,400
I think you have to recognize that most of the iot data that people collect today

725
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:40,192
Is probably useless

726
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:42,240
It's only valuable fur

727
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:43,264
Microseconds

728
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:45,312
It is awesome noise

729
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:47,104
And finding the signal from the noise

730
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,128
Certainly the hard part

731
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,408
We found

732
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,944
That having model

733
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:52,736
That Define

734
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:53,504
People

735
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:55,040
And places and things

736
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:56,576
How we think they might work

737
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:58,880
Palm is a necessary starting point

738
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:02,976
And then we leverage analytics to look for

739
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:04,512
What's normal and what's not

740
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,072
So that could be something

741
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:08,608
Gets rid of some of the noise

742
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:10,400
Right away for example you can look at

743
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:11,936
Jada coming off the thermostat

744
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:15,008
For the most part doesn't move

745
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,312
But if it spikes to 900 Degrees

746
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:18,848
There is probably a serious

747
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:21,920
Or if it drops really quickly is another series

748
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:24,480
Being able to know what's normal what's not

749
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:27,296
Give me done with machine learning algorithms to assess

750
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:28,320
Anomalous Behavior

751
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:30,880
And I could be something that happens in a moment

752
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:33,440
Three happening something happens Trends over time

753
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:36,000
And it has to be based on having some

754
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:38,304
Hypothesis of what's normal

755
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:42,144
But then using analytics to look for the variations in day that I would tell you when those

756
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:43,424
Moments happen

757
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:47,264
NFL really looking for is not the date itself but the moment

758
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:53,664
I just realized that you're going to be a great person to have it because you can probably help me break down

759
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:55,456
A couple concepts for peep

760
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:58,784
Because right now we talked about analytics all the time

761
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:00,832
We also talked about machine learning

762
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:03,392
And then we talked about things like

763
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:07,232
In a lot of people I feel like people kind of just throw those out there

764
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:09,536
And there he was very interchangeably

765
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,072
I probably shouldn't

766
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,888
So maybe you can help us by

767
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:16,192
Helping us set up definitions and how we should

768
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:17,216
Think about each of these

769
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:17,984
Concepts

770
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:21,056
Of course I probably will not use whatever

771
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:26,688
Textbook definitions exist but my own sort of simpler way of breaking it down into what I say three categories

772
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:27,968
When is

773
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:29,504
After data has happened

774
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:31,040
There's

775
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:35,392
Plenty of analytics tools that go in and look at how you can visualize it in pivot it in

776
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:37,184
And sort through it to find

777
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,512
Correlations in patterns that you expect to be there and that you're looking

778
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:46,912
You looking for particular moment you know what you're looking for so you kind of sorting through the day that glancing through it and providing

779
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:50,752
Are different different ways of organizing that data that sort of astronaut

780
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:51,520
App

781
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:52,800
Now

782
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:53,824
Things that happened

783
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:54,592
Wallet

784
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:56,384
Recurring you may have some

785
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:00,992
Real-time analytics something that is looking for a set of business rules are conditions

786
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:06,368
That occur as date is flowing in and you're looking for moments are you looking for variations

787
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:10,208
Here's where machine learning can be used to help see if things are trending in a way that is

788
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,232
Anomalous

789
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,512
So you have you build a

790
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:14,304
Picture of Baseline

791
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,072
View

792
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:18,912
And the Machine learning is watching the day does it's coming through every day so that thermostat data

793
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:20,448
Everyday 7 a.m.

794
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,752
Probably changes because I change the thermostat

795
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:28,384
It varies with season varies with things and you sort of know what's normal because they machine learning is watching it

796
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:30,688
Animal attacks abnormally you catch

797
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:36,064
So you got the what happens after date it was generated. What's happening as it is being generated

798
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,344
City of Learning System

799
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:39,904
Those are two different types

800
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,696
I'm not an expert in either one

801
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:44,768
But you got started this assisted learning this is where

802
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:47,328
The machine is catching things and then you're telling

803
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,864
Too human interaction

804
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:52,448
Whether these things are correct or not what do they start to approximating model

805
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,520
This is how you might training system for example with images

806
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:57,056
You might see that

807
00:35:57,312 --> 00:36:00,384
Fifty or a hundred or a thousand images that say this is

808
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:01,920
You know a dog

809
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:02,944
And

810
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:06,784
Each time it has exceeded in and it and then based on that you can correct

811
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,624
The next picture you shall it's going to say I think is a dog it might be a cat

812
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,904
Incorrect

813
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:16,000
Say what it really is and you keep feeding it and it will continue to approximate

814
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:19,328
And get closer and closer to accuracy based on the wide range of things

815
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:20,096
You see it

816
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:21,632
So this is where this

817
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:25,728
Human intervention in both what you decide to feed it and of course what feedback you got

818
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,776
Any of our systems that are

819
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:30,592
Amor vincit that learn on their own

820
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:32,384
And has recently been

821
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:35,712
Several articles about systems for example I just get fed

822
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:39,552
Procedures and things that people do it watches what people do and then learns quickly from that

823
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:43,136
And that's less of the assisted part that's more than the Deep learning Park

824
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:45,952
I would say that the range of these different types of system

825
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:48,512
People tend to lump them into one category

826
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:49,280
Golden Corral

827
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:52,608
Yes thank you for going I know that's a scary question to answer me

828
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:53,888
But you just like rocked it

829
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:56,960
So thank you for that because I do think that

830
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:59,008
When it comes to business

831
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,312
It's all lumped together but really

832
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:05,152
For most businesses probably only the first two are really in

833
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:07,200
Important today or the 1st

834
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:08,480
What are your thoughts

835
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:10,272
What are the most practiced

836
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:12,320
Definitely the more dominant themes today

837
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:16,160
We've all been doing analytic Sunday after his creator for a very long time we

838
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:19,232
Italy called analytics and we called a big data cuz it was more buzzworthy

839
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:24,864
But also effectively visualizing and pivoting data in different tables and different structures so you could see it

840
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,400
And to look for patterns or looking

841
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:28,960
Before but I think this idea of

842
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:35,360
Systems that can learn that are assisted is is clearly grown is almost every process and every industry

843
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:36,384
Primarily

844
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:39,712
Because we're really bad at doing something more than a few times

845
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:40,736
Wenis

846
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:47,648
And if you can bring the very best at what you do into the systems and they can learn you can improve that you can improve the repeater bill

847
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:48,928
You can do it at scale

848
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:50,720
In ways that people can

849
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:53,536
But we're still unique and be able to tell a dog from a cat

850
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:56,096
Until we teach our system and then it can tell

851
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:57,888
Not every time not perfectly

852
00:37:58,144 --> 00:37:59,424
The better and better than my teacher

853
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:00,448
All right

854
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:01,472
Let's think about

855
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:03,264
From a business perspective

856
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,032
Because

857
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:05,824
Is nothing if not

858
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:06,848
Which I love

859
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:10,688
How are customers trying to use

860
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:12,224
Assisted machine learning so

861
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,248
Will call Watson

862
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:15,040
That feels like an assistant machine learning

863
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:16,064
Kind of Technology

864
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:18,624
How are they using that for iot

865
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:20,672
Why was

866
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:25,536
We got some really great clients for using visual recognition to help manage drones

867
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,840
In a particular leveraging

868
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:32,448
Training of different things you might look for in a drone that might be inspecting power lines

869
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:33,216
Example

870
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:34,240
If we can catch

871
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:35,776
Defects and problems

872
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:39,360
Was it your own operating from perspectives that people can't

873
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:40,896
And catch things

874
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:41,920
Are more subtle

875
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:43,968
And it's faster than people can

876
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:48,320
It makes our jobs easier cuz we can direct people to go fix the things that need to be fixed

877
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,856
You know exactly what's wrong

878
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:50,624
Things

879
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,720
And it's a very powerful technology so we're using visual recognition

880
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:56,512
Unmanned drones over Powerline

881
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:58,816
And we can use it in all the variety of settings

882
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:01,632
Where that perspective is unique with a drone has a

883
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:03,680
A bird's-eye view that people don't have

884
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:05,216
Well season

885
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:09,312
So we done a lot of really great work with several companies bringing

886
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:11,872
An image recognition to help do defect analysis

887
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:12,640
A manufacturer

888
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:14,688
And my very first job

889
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:16,224
A really long time ago

890
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:21,088
I was doing visual inspection and now there's a Semiconductor Company using Watson to do that

891
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:22,368
Probably much better than I ever

892
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:24,160
And faster

893
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:28,512
But the other part is it can also learn and change over time you may find that this machine

894
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,072
10 Siskiyou Loop celestin Island

895
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:32,608
She doesn't over there

896
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:36,704
So instead of paying people to catch all these variations you can also train systems in

897
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,776
Deploy different models to different tools and manufacturing line

898
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:41,568
Say something unique that's as well

899
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,872
What's a very powerful way to scale out

900
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:44,896
Speed up

901
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:48,480
We're doing similar things with acoustic Analytics

902
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:50,784
I'm listening for the sounds that are normal

903
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:52,832
Knowing if a machine is about to

904
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:55,136
Break a bearing filling is in a house

905
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:56,416
Brookneal glass broke

906
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:57,440
Siamese

907
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:59,232
Actually break into something like that

908
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:03,072
Anything we can do that sort of listens and understands acoustic data

909
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:04,608
And learn from that what

910
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:06,144
Things are good or bad

911
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,472
And then knowing what to do with those moments and we do similar things with boys

912
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:11,520
Personality assessment

913
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:17,664
Damn I tell you a lot about the feedback of your customers or how people are feeling in an elevator we find it all that unstructured data

914
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,480
Really lends itself to these cities Learning System

915
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:23,296
Just go there cuz you brought up a cyst

916
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:29,184
Should I talk to all kinds of assistance in my home I talk to companies who are trying to bring

917
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,256
Voice assistant to the Enterprise it feels like

918
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:36,608
This should be a perfect place for Watson or the Watson technology

919
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:39,680
It isn't I never people do not talk about Watson

920
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:40,960
In that sense so

921
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:43,776
Should they be or is Watson something else

922
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:49,152
Now they should be and they are but you'll often see that we're the technology inside a lot of things

923
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:50,432
So that makes it harder

924
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:52,480
I also think that the consumer

925
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:56,576
Excitement and energy around assistance you can buy in a store and bring it to your house

926
00:40:56,832 --> 00:41:00,416
Is very very high and it sucks a lot of the energy on conversation

927
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:02,976
It's on a bad thing because I think it's also

928
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:04,000
Created

929
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:05,536
A level of comfort

930
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:09,376
That voice interaction and assistants are part of our lives

931
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:11,680
You said you have many in your house I have

932
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:12,704
One of everything

933
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,728
More than one of everything

934
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:15,520
In my house also and

935
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:17,056
I like their differences

936
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:18,336
Different things

937
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:22,944
Maybe I'm working early adopter but I think for all of us we're going to realize that there's going to be

938
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,528
You know the systems and different places we're going to be more comfortable working with them everywhere

939
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:28,320
Because I couldn't be good at something

940
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:33,696
Will IBM we bring a watch in a natural language and Enzo amore

941
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:36,000
Deeper view of understanding people

942
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:39,840
Dental assistants that were doing in hotels in concierge and

943
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:43,168
In various settings and you'll see much more of it in a publicly

944
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:46,240
The programme call with Watson that has watching embedded in things

945
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:50,848
You'll even see if you go to the weather company app we have watching embedded down the weather at 4

946
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,407
But consumers were introducing more and more

947
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:56,991
Dialogue-driven insightful Services even into the weather company

948
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:58,271
This is something that

949
00:41:58,527 --> 00:42:00,575
That we felt that we could bring a dialogue and

950
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:02,879
And engaging kind of service with Watson

951
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:08,767
Get a consumer that we can do it in cars we can do it in hotels other places so we're working with clients all around the world

952
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:09,535
To bring

953
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:11,327
A deeper understanding of people

954
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:13,119
Using watching in those settings

955
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:16,447
And we also obviously do it in the Enterprise at so you won't see

956
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:17,471
The same level of

957
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:18,239
Chatter

958
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:20,031
About what we're doing in the Enterprise

959
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:23,359
But watching has a rich set of engagements across almost every into

960
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:25,919
We talked so much about the cognitive era

961
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:26,687
And

962
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:27,967
1 things I like this

963
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:28,991
The thought that

964
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:30,015
This is not

965
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:31,551
A passing thing

966
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:34,623
It's one of those things that a eyes now and see using the way we work

967
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:38,719
The systems we use where you can comfortable with Chad and the faces

968
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:43,839
Half the time you talk to somebody internet you don't even know if it's a real person or or chatbot or something else helping you

969
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:46,911
We're getting used to it this is the beginning of an era

970
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:50,239
More so than a passing technology face

971
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:52,287
Go smart phone may come and go

972
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:53,311
I don't know

973
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:54,591
Come and go

974
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:58,943
But cognition and these are things going to be with us for a very long time only improving over

975
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:02,527
Alright so we talked a little bit about assistance

976
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:04,063
Watson

977
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:04,831
As an assist

978
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:06,623
Just in general

979
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:08,927
Where do you think all of this is heading

980
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:10,719
These voice-activated assistant

981
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:11,487
Throughout my home

982
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:17,375
I think we're moving from a place where people were doing fairly difficult home automation stuff

983
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:20,959
If you were using you know hubs and things and setting up rules and stand

984
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:27,615
Very complicated for most people in early adopters did it and everybody else looks at it like it's a bunch of wires and

985
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:28,383
And scary stuff

986
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:32,735
But I think we're moving to a point where assistants are trainable

987
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:35,039
I already use if this then that

988
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:38,879
With several assistance where I can create my own custom dialog and words and

989
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:44,767
And stop doing people come over you know I can say hello Stacy and Stacy it's been a long time since I've seen you

990
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:46,815
It feels as if you're understood

991
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:48,607
I think it's just an illusion

992
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:53,215
But it's the beginning I think of the expectation people have cuz I tried that recently

993
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:55,519
That someone come over and you look very nice today

994
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:57,311
They looked all around where's the camera

995
00:43:57,567 --> 00:44:00,127
How did how did that sting on my desk know they look nice today

996
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:01,663
And then they wanted to answer

997
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:03,199
That didn't have a response

998
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:03,967
But I think

999
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:05,247
We leap

1000
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:07,295
To wanting to be understood

1001
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:08,319
So

1002
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:09,087
Quickly

1003
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:11,135
That if anything can understand us

1004
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:14,463
Really understand how we feel build respond more dynamically

1005
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:15,487
We embrace it

1006
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:21,119
And I think that's it that's where the future is headed is much more of these assistants and interactive capabilities that

1007
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:23,679
We will Embrace as an extension of the family

1008
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:25,727
How many people do you know have a Roomba

1009
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:27,519
Annabelle is how many of them named it

1010
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:28,543
IWatch

1011
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:34,943
I think she will get very comfortable with this idea there's something they're taking care of them listening to them understanding

1012
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:40,063
I got a bunch of experiments in my own house that that replicate the feeling of that

1013
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:43,135
And I'm amazed how quickly even non-technical people

1014
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:44,671
Yeah kind of excited about it

1015
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:46,463
This idea is

1016
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:50,303
Device has been and what I want

1017
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:51,071
Before I

1018
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:56,191
Absolutely why should you have to ask to turn on down your lights when you come downstairs

1019
00:44:56,447 --> 00:45:02,335
Your home should turn your lights on for you it should say good morning Stacy it's nice to see you it's going to rain today don't forget your umbrella

1020
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:03,871
Your car is low on gas

1021
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:06,431
Not all at once

1022
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:12,575
You should get it should understand you and the state of your home and where you are where you're going and

1023
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:15,647
Offer things rather than waiting for you to keep asking

1024
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:20,255
Lights turn to Blue unlock front door start car you shouldn't have to say all this

1025
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:22,047
How far away are we

1026
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:23,071
Something like that

1027
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:26,911
Could happen faster than we think just as the smartphone became

1028
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:28,191
Something that we

1029
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:34,591
People embraced much quicker than we expected cuz it's basically a computer in people's pockets I mean it was a time when that sounded ridiculous

1030
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:36,383
And now not having one's ridiculous

1031
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:40,223
I think we're only a few years away from from having a much more Interactive

1032
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:43,295
Home Hotel car environment that is

1033
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:44,575
Proactive

1034
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:48,415
And anticipates our needs and suggest things at the right time and

1035
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:49,951
Feels like an extension

1036
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:51,231
BB do

1037
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:51,999
Not

1038
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:52,767
Sucking it in

1039
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:57,375
It's invasive and not something that is going to have to ask for all the commands to

1040
00:45:57,887 --> 00:46:03,007
So how do we get to that point cuz right now stand

1041
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:05,823
I always thought his inconsistent

1042
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:11,199
And the thing standing in the way worse things like the expensive getting these devices in

1043
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:14,015
And Holmes the lack of standardization

1044
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:15,551
Concerns about privacy

1045
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:19,903
And I don't even think we'd actually solve the UI challenge

1046
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:21,695
We also need to know like

1047
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:25,279
Who's wearing a home and getting some of that information out

1048
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:26,047
So

1049
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:27,327
Are these that

1050
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:28,863
Metal water bottle pieces

1051
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:33,471
But it is kind of cascading now

1052
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:34,751
What started out as

1053
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:38,591
Would really like to have it like that was in every science fiction movie for the last 30 years

1054
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:40,127
And yet

1055
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:41,407
We didn't have anything in our home

1056
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:42,431
Back to us

1057
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:45,247
Now there's millions of people who do

1058
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:47,039
You know you can buy at any store

1059
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:49,599
I could do some very very basic things

1060
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:52,159
So we suddenly now have these endpoints

1061
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:55,743
It will be more cuz every company is working on some

1062
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:58,047
Level of end point whether it's cars in

1063
00:46:58,303 --> 00:46:58,815
Places

1064
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:01,631
I will be able to at least have a thing to talk to

1065
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:03,423
But they're not generally very smart yet

1066
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:05,471
They're more like a mobile app for The Voice

1067
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:07,007
Instead of an actually understand

1068
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:13,663
But that's coming through all kinds of different work we've got some really cool work around modeling a people we did it

1069
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:15,967
Starting fruit from work on Aging in place

1070
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:19,551
Helping people to live better and safer in their home instead of going into

1071
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:20,831
I'm Healthcare

1072
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:21,855
Facility

1073
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:27,231
We started building models of people understanding the better think so we're trying to extend that into some of those

1074
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:28,255
Solutions

1075
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:32,863
Can I see other companies building voice recognition so that they know who's speaking to it

1076
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:37,727
Icsolutions around proximity to know based on a mobile device you have who's closest

1077
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:39,007
Might be the one talking

1078
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:41,567
Together since it might be issuing a command

1079
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:44,895
So it's kind of all the parallel I think it's just a matter of

1080
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:46,431
Building up critical mass

1081
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:48,735
Some of these Technologies and enough

1082
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:49,759
Microphone

1083
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:53,087
Speaker kind of interfaces in people's lives at the Comfort levels are high

1084
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:54,879
Incremental cost is low

1085
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:57,183
The cloud services are very very expensive

1086
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:58,207
To deliver this

1087
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:02,303
They just require some Innovation some companies to really step forward and take

1088
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:03,583
A little bit of risk

1089
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:05,375
Introducing the new technology

1090
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:07,935
All right and what I think about these

1091
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:09,471
In this future

1092
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:11,519
I think about the Amazon Echo

1093
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:13,311
Google home

1094
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:14,335
Atlas Siri

1095
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:15,871
What's wrong in there

1096
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:16,895
Apple

1097
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:19,455
I don't think so where is Watson

1098
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:25,343
Well watches working with the consumer electronics companies around the world as well as

1099
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:26,623
No cars and then

1100
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:28,159
Telco providers in others

1101
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:31,743
So you'll see us maybe you'll see it so differently than you might see others

1102
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:37,887
Don't this is a rule for all of us in this and I think for companies that are trying to deliver deeper engagement between their products

1103
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:38,911
And users

1104
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:40,959
Just keep those and watching don't exist

1105
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:41,727
Did any of the others

1106
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:48,383
But I'm also pleased that there's others out there because they're also bringing the ecosystem of developers to bring me a comfort level with

1107
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:50,687
Voice interface is there helping Drive improvements

1108
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:52,223
Just if nothing else to do

1109
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:52,991
Competitiveness

1110
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:54,271
In speech to text

1111
00:48:54,783 --> 00:49:00,927
Which basically hasn't changed much for most people you know in decades and suddenly now has improved dramatically because of

1112
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:01,695
Competition

1113
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:04,767
Machine learning volumes of users things like that so

1114
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:07,583
I think you'll see watching in many

1115
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:10,655
Things you buy that directly engage with consumers where

1116
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:12,703
Engagement is the value proposition

1117
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:13,471
4

1118
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:14,751
Car manufacturers in others

1119
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:20,127
And you'll see home assistance whether it's Google or Amazon or others I'll be seeing lots of homes

1120
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:21,663
I'm hoping there's some

1121
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:28,063
Emerging standard to happen here I'm still have yet to see it that would allow application developers to build things that are fixed

1122
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:29,343
Environment

1123
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,135
So I still have yet to see

1124
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:33,951
That kind of sanitization occur which is what happened in

1125
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:35,487
Open HTML in

1126
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:40,351
Job and everything else for Bixby to build for one web server move to another I think eventually you'll see

1127
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:44,703
Expertise and skills and applications in a voice interface be a little less

1128
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:49,055
Stuck in an ecosystem in more open so we're obviously aiming for openness

1129
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:51,615
And I'd like to see iot devices be

1130
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:53,407
As open as possible how they integrate

1131
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:54,687
And which I'm seeing through

1132
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:57,247
Things like asking others that are not tight anyone

1133
00:49:57,503 --> 00:49:58,015
Tickler system

1134
00:49:58,783 --> 00:50:00,575
All right Brett thank you so much for
