This week sponsor is

Samsung

20
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:58,368
Samsung artik is the integrated smart iot platform providing the fastest path to secure interoperable in NJ

21
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:00,416
Intelligent iot products and services

22
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:06,816
Samsung's artik smart iot platform provides both Hardware modules and cloud services either together

23
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:12,448
Or an integrated platform with an ecosystem of tools and partners to speed up your time-to-market

24
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:13,216
All right

25
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:15,776
Here we go into the show

26
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:16,800
Oh

27
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:17,568
Kevin

28
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,592
Hit the news

29
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:19,616
Fast

30
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:26,528
Okay so we have some news that is just reported news is not necessarily true

31
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,648
It's not officially acknowledged by Apple but Mark Gorman over Bloomberg is reporting

32
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:35,488
That apple is getting out of a wireless router business

33
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:38,816
And I'm scratching my head over this because

34
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:42,144
They make several routers including one that has

35
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,936
The backup function in a time capsule

36
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:45,216
I'm just kind of surprised

37
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:47,520
Prize that they would do this because

38
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:50,592
It kind of fits in with the whole Smart Home homekit

39
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:53,920
Market to me now the only thing I can think of is maybe

40
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,968
All the other new router

41
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:58,528
People that are popping up on to the market or are just

42
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,088
Pushing the margins out for apple and I just

43
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:03,392
Don't think it's profitable business

44
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:05,184
I don't know I mean I feel like

45
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:09,024
I just spent $500 on 3 mesh routers I feels like

46
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,328
It feels like a space where Apple really

47
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:15,168
Hey has the bonjour is it bonjour is a protocol they use

48
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:17,472
Thank you Spanish or four

49
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:18,752
Yes I'll say yes

50
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:19,776
Keep it simple

51
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:24,384
They've actually put a lot of innovation here in

52
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,176
You know up until

53
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,480
The launch of all these new products

54
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:32,064
What was the way to go if you wanted an easy to set up Wi-Fi

55
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,344
Kind of operation

56
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:40,000
It was expensive yeah that was a couple years back it got it was easy and I agree with you but now it's some of the

57
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:43,328
The newer players make it at least as easy if not easier I think

58
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:46,656
And I don't know what that there's a lot more innovation

59
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:49,728
I don't think Apple can out innovate the month on Simplicity year

60
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,288
Other news is

61
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:56,128
Have you guys seen that now your Amazon Echo

62
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,688
Has all recipes recipes in it

63
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:01,760
So basically you have the skill you

64
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:04,064
Ask for recipes and boom

65
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,600
You got them so Kevin

66
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:06,624
You tried this

67
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,928
Actually I didn't

68
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:11,232
I tried the new text messaging skill

69
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:15,328
I'm sorry

70
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,192
Yes that's what coordinating before they Shone like oh yeah I tried that thinking it was the text messaging I didn't

71
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:20,960
Qunar

72
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:22,496
Recipes

73
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:25,056
Well let me tell you about it cuz I have not tried it yet

74
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,848
Miss you guys

75
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:27,616
Nice butt

76
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:29,408
You should because Amazon

77
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,968
Has enabled an Allrecipes skill

78
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,016
The skill that you find

79
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:36,576
You can actually give the Amazon Echo

80
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:42,976
Ingredients on hand it will help you find a recipe that works for those ingredients and then you can do step by step recipe guide

81
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:46,560
Switch assembly I've been asking so you can say pause next

82
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,328
Repeat

83
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,352
Skip

84
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:49,632
So

85
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:52,960
I actually thought this was pretty cool and I can't wait to cook with it

86
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:56,032
Sadly I have yet to actually make a meal that

87
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:58,080
Involves all recipes but

88
00:03:59,360 --> 00:03:59,872
Soon

89
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:01,920
I will let you know how it is in Kevin

90
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:04,992
The skill that you tripe is this the AT&T text message

91
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:07,808
It is it is I'm actually surprised it's coming

92
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:12,672
From AT&T and not a different carrier kind of figured T-Mobile kind of tries to push the

93
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:16,768
Boundaries of things Lil bit more but I'm so if you have an AT&T

94
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:17,791
Account

95
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:22,911
And an echo you can link the new AT&T text messaging skill

96
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:24,191
To your Echo

97
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:26,751
And then literally you can speak a command

98
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:29,055
To send a text message to

99
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:33,407
One of your preset favorites to set up to 10 favorites

100
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:35,199
When you do the setup of the skill

101
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:37,759
Tel Link through AT&T website in your account

102
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:41,343
And then you can just speak that person's name and say I want to send a text and

103
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:45,951
You can speak the text and it will repeat the text and then send it to that person

104
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,999
The person knows it's coming from

105
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,303
The echo however there's a little

106
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:51,583
Put her in the

107
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,887
Text message they receive it says sent by

108
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,679
Chicken shall not be named yourself

109
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:56,959
Got it

110
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:58,239
Brooks weather

111
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:04,639
That's pretty cool cuz actually one of the Google home features I liked with the if this and that was the ability to actually send a text

112
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:06,431
Message to someone verbally

113
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,711
So

114
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,247
Yay

115
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,319
Are we ready for the

116
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,087
Holidays

117
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:17,695
We better because they're here whether we're ready or not

118
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,999
We'll get away some of our

119
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:21,535
Black Friday commentary

120
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:25,631
In the into this cuz we've been searching for deals for you guys

121
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:27,423
As we do our gift list but

122
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,959
This is the

123
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:31,007
Annual gift guide and I wish we had the

124
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,079
I could sing some

125
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:35,871
You could I could

126
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,455
Let nothing you dismay

127
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:42,271
That are we in the spirit now

128
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,039
Okay

129
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:44,575
Let's get it

130
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:45,599
Started with

131
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,647
The wearables category

132
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:55,583
I got a

133
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,351
Hi love

134
00:05:56,863 --> 00:06:03,007
Use wearables from all my running and whatnot so I'd look for a wide range of wearables

135
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:08,127
Because certain people have funeral on GPS other people don't want GPS I get that

136
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:08,895
I think

137
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:12,735
For most people I would probably recommend a fit

138
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:15,551
Fitbit charge 2 for their activity tracking

139
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:21,695
It's a $150 normally prices Black Friday deals for 1:30

140
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,487
Yeah

141
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,839
I think they do I think they do

142
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:28,607
So don't pay more than

143
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:30,655
Yasso

144
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:31,423
What would I

145
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:38,079
I mean there's tons of good choices in this price point where even last time Garland makes several choices here

146
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:44,479
You know you could even use a pebble watch and track your activities and such but it what I like about the Fitbit

147
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:48,831
Charge 2 with ecosystem it supports both IOS and Android that's a

148
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,623
A big bonus

149
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:56,255
Choose your device by based on what phone you use I really like the social aspect of

150
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,815
Fitbit ecosystem as well as

151
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:00,095
The smart

152
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:03,167
Exercise SmartTrack exercise recognition

153
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,239
There's so many times that I don't have a charge to actually

154
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:09,567
Got these surge cuz I wanted GPS built-in

155
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:13,919
This does not have GPS built-in it will use GPS of your attached phone

156
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:14,687
But

157
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:21,343
SmartTrack I just love it you know you decide I'm going to go for a walk and you don't have a said anything it just decides hey yo

158
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,111
You're walking

159
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,903
I know it's your walking and it just

160
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:26,463
Tracks that for yuan and locks at Sault

161
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:28,767
I kind of like that opposed to Long battery life

162
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:32,351
Can get at least four if not five days out of it. Sleep tracking

163
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:35,679
Get reminders you need some basic smartphone alerts

164
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:38,495
That's I think

165
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,543
Pretty good for most people

166
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:41,567
I

167
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:45,151
10 to wear however I Smartwatch and I alternate between

168
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:48,735
It was for iOS notes for Android so I've got a choice for both of us

169
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:49,503
People

170
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,527
Both platforms

171
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,599
Well obviously the Apple watches is going to be your

172
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:56,927
Your iOS device pick I have an Apple Watch 2

173
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:57,951
They start at

174
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:04,351
369 I believe we have watch to I would recommend watch to over the series 1

175
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,119
Because

176
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:08,703
You get the GPS built-in you get the faster chip and so on

177
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:11,775
Much better I have the old Apple watch have the new Apple watch

178
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,311
Much faster open apps

179
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:16,895
Really really nice does a great job with the GPS in the heart rate

180
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:19,199
So if you have IOS and iPhone

181
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,479
I would definitely go that route

182
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,783
Android you got a lot of choices

183
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,855
And I think Stacy you would said that your mom has like a

184
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:28,671
Gear Fit 2 or S2 smartwatch

185
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:29,695
Gear 2

186
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:32,255
Here to OKC

187
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,815
Certainly not bad I'm in there newer models out there

188
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:37,119
I tried the Samsung devices

189
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,399
Decent

190
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:45,055
I don't care if it's for the fact that they run the tizen operating system because you're limited to tizen only apps in there

191
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:47,615
Far fewer tizen apps that are Android apps

192
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:51,967
So after trying and I think I've got four five different Android Wear devices

193
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,527
The polar m600

194
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:57,343
The $329 has

195
00:08:57,599 --> 00:09:00,415
Integrated GPS and heart rate monitor

196
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:02,719
Waterproof you can swim with it

197
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,535
Obviously get all of your smartphone notifications

198
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,583
It is bulky but if your

199
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,631
Interested in tracking like

200
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:13,215
Everything sleep and outdoor activities swimming and so on

201
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:19,103
I think it's one of the best GPS activity tracking iPhone to be the most stable Android Wear device so

202
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,895
Again 329

203
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:23,199
That would be my take if you have an Android device

204
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:24,991
Got it okay

205
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,015
Good

206
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,551
Pics from Kevin

207
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:28,831
What you got

208
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:30,367
What's a cat what's a guy

209
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,135
Okay

210
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:33,183
I'm into this health and wellness kit

211
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:36,511
So I'm going to recommend the sense sleep

212
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:37,279
Monitor

213
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,815
And the Sleep pill

214
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:41,375
What this is I'm sure you seen it because it's

215
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,399
It's actually very pop

216
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:45,727
It's a white orb with like little lines all over it

217
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,775
$150

218
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:50,335
And basically what it does is

219
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,895
It monitors your sleeping environment

220
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,943
And then it managers

221
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:55,711
Your sleep

222
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:58,015
And then you're supposed to wake you up at like an app

223
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,855
Each day like the best time after REM sleep

224
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:02,623
Can all of that

225
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:07,999
What's interesting is if you have a bad sleep environment it actually tells you

226
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,535
So it attracts like

227
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,071
How you sleep

228
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,351
To your entire

229
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:13,631
Which

230
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,167
Some people

231
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,471
They may not be anything to survive

232
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:21,311
Complete waste of money because they sleep well and they have a totally awesome

233
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:24,639
If that is you this is not a device for you

234
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,943
There plenty of sleep trackers that you

235
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,991
Are built in a fitness tracker

236
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:32,831
But if you're constantly sleeping badly and you're not sure why

237
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:35,135
This is actually really interesting way to find out

238
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:40,511
So I think it's a good gift for someone who's maybe a little Insomniac in

239
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,535
We're just

240
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,303
Freep Sports

241
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:43,583
So

242
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:44,863
And it's pretty

243
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:45,631
So pretty

244
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:50,239
If you know you get all these basically monitors the air condition since

245
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:53,567
Humidity and temperature in your bedroom so if you're interested in knowing that anyway

246
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:54,847
Yay

247
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:55,871
Damn

248
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:57,151
I also have

249
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:00,991
This is something for families and you can buy these in Lowe's

250
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:05,855
This is for the tech afraid person in your life like maybe it's a grandma maybe it's an ant

251
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:06,623
Uncle I don't

252
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:10,207
The nucleus smart intercom system

253
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:12,767
It's 199 if you buy a pair of them

254
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,815
And basically this is

255
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:18,399
I don't think this is good if you have a text Abby person don't buy this

256
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,959
If you have someone who's kind of like

257
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:25,567
Weird are you you're sick of having those calls where you're like

258
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:27,359
Open Skype I'm going to call you

259
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,383
Okay

260
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:31,199
You know and then you're on the phone with someone while they're calling you on Skype and it's

261
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:35,551
You know so in if you got FaceTime and someone

262
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,575
Comfortable using FaceTime

263
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:37,855
Probably again.

264
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:38,879
But

265
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,415
Here Comes nice

266
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,439
It is

267
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,975
A direct link

268
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:49,375
From you your home to someone else's home or at the direct link inside your home so if you just want a video intercom

269
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,167
This is actually really

270
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:52,447
Workable solution

271
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:57,567
The video quality is not super great it's only a 5 megapixel camera in there

272
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:00,127
It didn't adapt to lighting

273
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,663
So like

274
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,199
Don't put it where are you

275
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:03,967
Your back

276
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,015
Find a window

277
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,063
But other than that it works

278
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:10,111
I know that sounds like a terrible wreck

279
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,159
You know half the things I tried don't

280
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,975
It's a good thing

281
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:17,791
So

282
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,351
Alright so

283
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:26,751
We talked so many times about smart assistants and voice control in your smart home or just streaming music

284
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:27,775
With your voice

285
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,823
I was thinking what is the

286
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:34,175
Best way for someone brand new to the space that wants to experience

287
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:36,735
What we talk about when we discuss all that

288
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:37,759
And

289
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,807
I have to say I think the

290
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:42,111
Newest Amazon Echo Dot

291
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:44,415
The second gen. For $50

292
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:47,487
Is the best way to get your foot in the door there I mean

293
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:53,119
It works without a wireless Bluetooth speaker because it does have a small speaker in it

294
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:55,935
So you don't have to connect to another speaker

295
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:59,007
If you would like to you have that option I have mine connected to

296
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,799
Awesome Marshall Bluetooth

297
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:01,823
Speaker that

298
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:06,687
Alexa skills you get your

299
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,223
Information

300
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,247
If you

301
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:11,039
Ever add Smart Home

302
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:15,903
Devices to your house you know you can likely voice control

303
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:19,487
If this then that recipes that work with with the echo so

304
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:21,791
I think for $50 you just can't go wrong

305
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,839
And don't pay more than 40

306
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,911
Because

307
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:29,727
Amazon

308
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:33,311
Best Buy in Target

309
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,591
So Amazon

310
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:38,943
And there's probably some multi packs if you buy multiple

311
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:42,783
Echo dots as well there's a deal for 6

312
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:43,551
6 /

313
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:44,831
I don't remember

314
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,879
One for every room into for the bedroom

315
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:48,671
Bathroom

316
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,975
Bathroom bathroom

317
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:51,999
So

318
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:55,839
I would I would up this because it's Christmas and you love his pee

319
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,119
Alright so

320
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,423
I would say

321
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,471
Spring for the Philips Hue

322
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:05,055
Light bulb set I know there's a hug but it's the easiest one.

323
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:06,591
It works with

324
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,615
Just about every

325
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,919
So that

326
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:10,943
Is

327
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,783
I believe it's $70 for starter pack with two white

328
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:15,551
Ambience

329
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:19,647
And actually actually I think we saw a deal

330
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:21,439
42 bulbs

331
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,743
Two Philips Hue bulbs with a.

332
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,047
Oh yeah

333
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:26,815
Tornado

334
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,607
Seether

335
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:31,423
That sounds right I think so

336
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,191
Okay

337
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:35,007
Something could so many different people

338
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,031
We're terrible

339
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,079
We brought you these deals

340
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:42,687
Everywhere

341
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:43,711
I think

342
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:48,063
A hundred bucks you can introduce them to the smart home Concept in a way that is

343
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,599
Like freaking awesome

344
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:51,647
I would recommend if you do this one

345
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,951
A really great way to put that into

346
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:58,047
Effectus put it in your bedroom and replace your bedroom table side lamps

347
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,327
With those bulbs

348
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,375
And then you've got an alarm clock

349
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,399
Wake up light music

350
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,423
You've got

351
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:07,519
Your news briefing in the morning and then you could be like turn off my bedroom light

352
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:12,383
It wasn't even send text messages from bed hands-free

353
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,431
Yes

354
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:17,503
Cuz we all do that all the time

355
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,551
I have it I have a. In our bedroom

356
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,575
And

357
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,343
It is

358
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,623
We use it as an art

359
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:25,951
Hazard alarm clock now although at the internet does go out we are

360
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:26,719
Your host

361
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,999
You're not leaving forever

362
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:29,535
Maybe not forever

363
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:32,607
We might be late

364
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:35,935
That is that is a great deal

365
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:36,959
Andy tow

366
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:39,263
Google home is on sale

367
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,335
I'm seeing it for $99 at Best Buy

368
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,383
I'm going to tell you guys

369
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:47,455
If your die-hard fans of the space

370
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:51,295
And go for it but right now the home is not as good as the echo

371
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,855
Their ecosystem is Anna strong

372
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,439
I agree with you completely

373
00:15:57,695 --> 00:16:00,511
I do have not ordered one for this very reason it's set

374
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,351
It's it's a new product and we're waiting for partners to come on board

375
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,655
Yeah and Ito Kevin actually

376
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,703
2 years ago didn't order an echo

377
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:09,727
Even though I did

378
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:17,663
I did not when it first came out it wasn't until they added the partner ecosystem for the smart home that I was like oh got to have it

379
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:19,967
Okay

380
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,015
Let's see

381
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,551
Next on our gift list

382
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:28,671
We went low-cost and now you got to go high-cost

383
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:30,463
I don't know who $200 for us

384
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:32,767
Starhub sister 3

385
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,303
Okay

386
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,095
High-cost June oven

387
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,655
I know you guys are sick of you talking about this

388
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:39,935
And I'm not going to talk about it

389
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:40,703
After this maybe

390
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:41,727
Baby

391
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:42,495
Joshua

392
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,263
I probably will

393
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,055
What's this is $1,500 * 9

394
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:46,079
Can I give you the

395
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,103
Gimmicky pricing

396
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:52,735
So $1,500 now the reviews from the tech press have been impressive

397
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:59,135
The reviews for normal people apparently a lot of normal people had some glitches so there were glitches there and there were people who are fresh

398
00:16:59,391 --> 00:16:59,903
Frustrated with their

399
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,951
So I don't know what to say about that

400
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:03,487
I had a great experience with

401
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:04,511
Sing and I loved it

402
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,047
So I don't know

403
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:09,119
But like the Fast Company guy he had a terrible experience

404
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,143
Send

405
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:12,191
His semen took too long to cook

406
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:17,055
I forgot about it and he was irritated by the number of notifications although you could turn those off

407
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,847
It felt very different

408
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,895
Like his experience with

409
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,431
And that happens

410
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:24,991
What happens if it's a brand new product

411
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,271
You know lots of

412
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:28,063
Not moving Parts but lots of

413
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:33,951
Complexity unit to kind of simplify the cooking experience and some people going to have a good experience another system people

414
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,487
I guess so

415
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:38,047
I'm standing by it though cuz man

416
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:40,095
If I found this under the tree

417
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:46,751
After the show I'm going to show it to my wife and I'm going to see what she thinks cuz she's a normal

418
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:50,335
And she gets frustrated on my tax stuff so we'll see what she says

419
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:52,895
I'm going to have my husband Andrew

420
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,175
Come on the show

421
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:56,223
Talk about so you are going to here about it

422
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:01,855
And that's that's a big endorsement there it is

423
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,135
All right

424
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:06,975
Yeah

425
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:09,279
So we talked a lot about bulbs

426
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:11,839
The past two years and

427
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:15,679
Now is always a good time to add more bulbs I think maybe you can get some good deals

428
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:22,591
I keep coming back to two brands of bulbs for my needs and I think they meet a lot of people's needs

429
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,127
They're not fancy

430
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:25,151
But they do the trick

431
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,943
So4

432
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:30,271
Low cost smart connected bulbs that work with

433
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,551
Just about every

434
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:33,087
Platform that I can think of

435
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:39,487
The cree bulbs for $15 white Cree bulbs and get them in soft white or daylight 50

436
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,255
$10

437
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:43,327
Again work with a lot of different hubs in and what not

438
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:46,143
Controlling my voice with different assistant

439
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:51,263
I don't think so wrong for $15 plus their LED so you know your electric bill

440
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:54,335
Also like the osram lightify

441
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:55,871
Tunable connect

442
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:59,455
Did bulb switch again are still white but you can tune

443
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:03,551
The light color the white uniform like that all the way down to

444
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:06,879
From soft wake up to Daylight anything in between

445
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:10,719
You going to pay twice the prices agree about so you had a really really want

446
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:15,071
Tunable bulbs for these became both birthdays are dimmable I should say so

447
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:18,143
Those are my two Bowlby pics

448
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:20,959
And just for perspective cuz I just replaced

449
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:21,983
6

450
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,055
Light bulbs with LED

451
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:27,871
Much cheaper

452
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:29,151
Well

453
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,687
.

454
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,223
Yes they're cheap

455
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:32,991
But

456
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,015
I actually

457
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:36,575
They had for $15

458
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,343
A

459
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:38,879
Sylvania

460
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,159
Not connecting

461
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:41,695
LED in the

462
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:42,975
This was a BR30

463
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:45,279
It was actually br40

464
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,071
Abdou BR30 was

465
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:47,839
1295

466
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:48,863
So

467
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,399
Just for perspective

468
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,679
For $15 you

469
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:52,959
Epic reconnect

470
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:56,543
I decided to not do that because I

471
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:00,639
I just wanted to control it from the switch for these bulbs so

472
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:03,455
It's not I mean you can buy cheaper light bulbs

473
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:04,991
For like

474
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:08,831
High-quality LEDs especially if you're going to put them against a dimmer switch

475
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:11,135
Which you really wanted to get

476
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,415
The higher quality

477
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,183
Don't

478
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:13,951
Don't hum

479
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:17,023
Yeah

480
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:17,791
Keep that in mind

481
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,631
For what it's worth and Anna

482
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,167
The best either not connected or

483
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:27,519
Standard LED bulbs at Home Depot last week and there are

484
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:29,055
Four packs of

485
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:34,687
40 and 60-watt replacements for 20 bucks of 5 bucks a bulb

486
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:37,759
Nice for the creases

487
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:39,551
Answer was this

488
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:45,439
Are the typical normal bulbs and the ER thirties and forties are down that bulbs

489
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:50,047
For those of you who do not speak fluent light bulb

490
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,071
Because why would you

491
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,119
Okay I'll talk

492
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:53,887
Emendation

493
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:59,519
Because I tried these this year and I love them I'm going to recommend the stack lighting

494
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:04,127
Even though I ultimately did not go with them because I have Hue Lights in my house

495
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:05,407
And I just wanted one

496
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:06,687
Setopati

497
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,735
The stack let's have a

498
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:09,759
Hub

499
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:10,783
And

500
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,319
Screw in a lightbulb

501
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:15,391
And what happens is there's an ambient light sensor in there

502
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:16,928
There's a motion sensor

503
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:17,952
And

504
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,256
You basically when you walk in

505
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,816
The lights turn on and you can set the program

506
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,864
With these light bulbs to be like

507
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,144
Hey

508
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,216
I'm turning on at 100% or maybe I'm only turning on it

509
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:30,240
You know

510
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:32,032
5% because it's the middle of the day

511
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,568
So you can settle that way

512
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:36,128
What the schedule and date they learned your schedule over

513
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:36,896
OurTime

514
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:38,176
So

515
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:42,528
After a couple of days

516
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,576
Oh you know around this time

517
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:45,856
She reads a lot

518
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:46,880
Maybe I'll

519
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,160
Will not turn off the

520
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:48,928
The motion detector

521
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:50,208
Turn off the light bulbs

522
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:52,768
So these are pretty neat

523
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,840
I like them they're $89 for starter kit

524
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:59,680
Normal a19 bulb so that's to normal size bolts

525
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:02,240
Or $99 for a

526
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:03,264
30 kit

527
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:04,544
So

528
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:09,664
They don't work well in open floor plans but they do work well in laundry rooms bathrooms

529
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:10,944
Closets

530
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:11,968
Places like that

531
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:13,760
Griffin

532
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,064
Cool

533
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:22,464
Will speaking of if this then that and turning on your lights intelligently

534
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,000
I'm going to recommend

535
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:26,048
For people who are interested in

536
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:29,120
Having your lights turn on when they get home

537
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:29,888
But without

538
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:31,168
Any interaction

539
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:32,960
Automatic Pro

540
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:34,496
This is a little

541
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:37,568
ODB Port dongle you put in your car

542
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:43,200
The main intention of it is to get diagnostic data from your car but also

543
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:44,736
That's a crash alert

544
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:45,504
System

545
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,784
So would you

546
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:52,160
Unfortunately do get in a crash it will paying the automatic Pro folks and they can reach out

547
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:54,720
How to emergency responders for you

548
00:22:55,232 --> 00:23:01,376
You can keep track of where your car is located at all times with the app because again this has three

549
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,912
LG built-in just cool

550
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:07,264
And there's no subscription fee for 5 years without 3G so that's handy

551
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:12,640
You can't I answer if there's some that we're use of a bunch of different apps that are integrated so

552
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:16,480
You can say hey when I'm a half mile from the house on my way home

553
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:22,368
Automatic hate reach out to the nest or whatever thermostat and heat up the house cuz it's cold war

554
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:24,160
Turn on touch lights.

555
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:26,208
Not want to walk into a dark home

556
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,048
So 430 bucks it doesn't awful lot

557
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:30,816
And

558
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:32,864
Mini pottery places

559
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,472
Some of the car services that you can buy from dealers and such like OnStar and so on

560
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:43,360
It integrates nicely with a lot of Smart Home Products so I think $430 is not a bad deal

561
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:44,640
130 or

562
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:48,480
Not macro is 12995

563
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:49,248
Okay

564
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:53,600
All right

565
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:55,392
Let's see what else do we have

566
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:56,928
I have in the

567
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:57,696
Hit the button

568
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:00,000
Business because I love fun

569
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:05,888
So a lot of people are going to tell you like these flick buttons are great and they're not bad but they're Bluetooth

570
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:08,960
And I hate Bluetooth buttons because my phone is never where I think

571
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:09,984
I guess so

572
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:11,520
I spend

573
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:12,288
Speaker money

574
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,592
For the Logitech pop

575
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:15,360
Buttons

576
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:17,408
These are $99 a button

577
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,456
They're made from Logitech so

578
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:22,272
It's a legit company that we've all heard up

579
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:24,320
And you basically

580
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,344
You assign

581
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,672
Tasks to a certain type of button press and then you

582
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:30,208
And

583
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:31,488
It works

584
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:33,536
That's all it does

585
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:36,352
You can do anything you can program

586
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:37,120
Which is kind of cool

587
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:38,400
Yeah so like

588
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:40,704
You can program it to turn lights on and off

589
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,264
And you can stick the button like on your bedside table

590
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:50,176
You can also have it connect to maybe like some sort of Health and Wellness tracker and every time you drink a glass of water you feel

591
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:52,224
Glass of water you can just leave it by the fridge

592
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:52,992
Puppet

593
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:55,808
With Addison that you can just say

594
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:57,600
Hey everytime I pop this this way

595
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:58,368
This happens

596
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,696
So there's a lot of like cool fun things

597
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:02,720
Basically

598
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,000
Just a button

599
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,536
You can tell it to do anything

600
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:08,352
I love in this is why I love buttons

601
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:10,144
Because I'm a very tactile person

602
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,168
So

603
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:12,704
That is a fun gift

604
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,728
Especially if you

605
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:14,496
Do you have someone in your life

606
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:16,800
Quotes

607
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:22,688
So if you have people in your life who lose things all the time there are number Bluetooth

608
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:24,480
Tracking devices that you can get

609
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:27,296
And I got hooked up I think cuz you mentioned it

610
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,576
Yeah we have a CEO in our show

611
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:31,392
Exit the tractor folks right so

612
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:35,744
The trackr Bravo is is small it's like the size of a quarter

613
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,024
Probably twice the

614
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,816
The thickness of a quarter

615
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:41,632
Nothing more than a Bluetooth tracker

616
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:42,912
You can get

617
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:47,520
1 for $30 but I would say take a look at the five packs and they even have

618
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:48,800
Higher quantities as well

619
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:49,568
5 pack

620
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:51,616
You can get them for $18 each

621
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:52,640
So

622
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:56,224
This you can attach the keys put in a wallet stick it in a

623
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,344
Purser a Gadget Bag and anytime you can't find whatever the item is

624
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:07,744
You know you're going to your Tracker app and then I can where might it be where was it last seen and if it's close by

625
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,120
And even have a Tracker make a sound so so yeah so the trackr Bravo you know again a 5-pack

626
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:18,240
You can stock up on him give one to everybody in your family and hopefully they will never lose anything again

627
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:24,640
So here's another little pro-tip for you can actually get your tracker Bravo's monogrammed

628
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:25,408
Weather

629
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:26,176
You get it

630
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,200
A laser

631
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:27,968
Is it laser printer

632
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,272
You guys are etched

633
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:32,832
Design or whatever on it so if you're like

634
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:34,368
You're thinking of like hosting

635
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:37,184
Maybe not party this is kind of an expensive party favor

636
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:46,400
But if you're looking for a gift

637
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,960
Here's a useful product

638
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:51,008
Maybe they'll be like the USB

639
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:52,800
2002

640
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:54,080
17

641
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,360
Okay

642
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:57,152
King of tracking

643
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:59,200
One of my gifts

644
00:26:59,456 --> 00:26:59,968
Recommendation

645
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:02,784
Is the circle router

646
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:08,416
It's really not a router is a device you plug into your router is from Disney

647
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:09,696
And basically

648
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:16,352
It's $99 and it lets you offer parental controls but not just like hey turn off this device

649
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:19,680
This time it actually let you see and control the apps your child

650
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:22,496
Warriors bow sight

651
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:23,776
I guess if they don't have a

652
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:24,544
Privileges

653
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:25,568
So

654
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:27,360
I think this is a really kind of

655
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:33,760
Compelling device for somebody who is really concerned about what their child is getting into online

656
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:35,296
Maybe it's just like you know what kid

657
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:37,600
You don't need to spend 9 hours a day

658
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:38,624
Instagram

659
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,928
Let's take it down a notch

660
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:44,256
It's really simple you just plug it into your Wi-Fi router

661
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:45,024
And it's

662
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,632
That's really all I have

663
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:50,400
How to say about that

664
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:53,216
Cool I have one last item it's not

665
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:57,824
Smart it's not connected but it is saved my bacon so many times

666
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,360
But I think it's worth

667
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,384
Mentioning

668
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:05,760
When we have we live in Northeast and we have storms we often have power outages and

669
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:08,320
No power is no fun so

670
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:11,904
Couple years ago I bought something and it's still available

671
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,440
It's actually cheaper now

672
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:15,488
It is a small

673
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,768
Solar

674
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:18,048
Battery

675
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,072
Set

676
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:20,096
That is

677
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:22,912
Useful as all heck in these kind of emergencies

678
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:28,032
Set of small 15 watt solar panel pretty minutes it's not big at all it's not the kind of solar panel you put on

679
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:30,592
It's kind of like putting a window or

680
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:31,872
But outside you know

681
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:34,432
I mean things probably 18 in wide

682
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:35,200
And foot

683
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:35,968
Deep

684
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:38,272
It plugs into this charging base

685
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:41,344
And in the charging base there's a 54 watt hour battery

686
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:43,904
Laptop charging base also has

687
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:49,024
Two USB ports as well as to other 12 volt Outlets

688
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:52,864
And the set also comes with an LED light that plugs into one of those Outlets

689
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:53,888
So

690
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:57,984
I constantly use the sun to keep the battery in the same charge

691
00:28:58,496 --> 00:28:59,776
And anytime you have an outage

692
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:03,872
We plug-in phones we use the little LED light

693
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,480
It's just so handy to have and it's a hundred and fifty bucks I think I paid

694
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:10,016
229 4

695
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:13,600
It's actually it actually comes from a company called FedEx International

696
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:15,648
Any create Solar Products for

697
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:17,696
Regions of the world that just don't have

698
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:20,000
Electric infrastructure in Grid

699
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:23,584
So this is how they bring electricities places but again

700
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,608
I bought

701
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:25,888
For here because it just

702
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,936
It just made sense and it is

703
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:29,216
Easley paid for itself

704
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:31,520
A number of times so it's $150

705
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:34,080
Fenix readyset solar is the name of it

706
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:35,360
Nice

707
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:38,944
Here's a gift idea for a child

708
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:40,224
Because

709
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,248
We love children here

710
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,040
There's tons of robots in

711
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:45,856
Cool things out there I leave y'all to that but

712
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:48,160
If you really want to push your child

713
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:50,464
I'm going to recommend the Kano computer kit

714
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:56,352
I love this thing my daughter actually loves to sing this is a computer consisting of a Raspberry Pi

715
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:58,656
And your kids basically build it themselves

716
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:00,448
Am I billed at themselves

717
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:01,984
Basically they plug in all the

718
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:07,360
They take the board they take the attached like the little speaker

719
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:08,128
Attachment

720
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,664
Is building it in

721
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,688
The most nominal size

722
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:13,248
That's the word but it's fun it lets kids

723
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,528
How to see how things work

724
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:20,416
And they get like this instant sense of accomplishment and then they can get on there and play Minecraft and learn to code

725
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:22,976
And you know do all kinds of fun things

726
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:28,096
So it is a Black Friday deal so it's 9999 right now

727
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:30,144
Sr850

728
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:31,680
Now

729
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:33,216
It doesn't come

730
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:35,520
With a monitor so you have to plug it into it

731
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:36,800
The TV your

732
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:38,592
An existing monitor that you have

733
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:40,128
If you want

734
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:43,456
They have a computer kit bundle that's $240

735
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:44,736
It does come with a monitor

736
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:46,016
And

737
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:48,832
It's a little storage case so they can

738
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:49,600
It's like there

739
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:50,368
A little laptop case

740
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:54,208
I love this my daughter really enjoyed it

741
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,232
I

742
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:57,792
Maybe it's cuz I'm a nerd but

743
00:30:58,048 --> 00:31:00,608
I really like

744
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:05,216
Yeah sounds great

745
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:07,776
And I think that's it that's it

746
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,312
Did we consult gifts

747
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:11,360
We said we did

748
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:13,664
Are there any other Black Friday deals we wanted

749
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:19,808
You shouldn't pay more than $200 for a nest 3rd generation

750
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:20,576
Thermostat

751
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:23,648
They're 199 all over the place

752
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,464
Keep an eye on that your Amazon Echo is

753
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,488
Is 140

754
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:29,024
At Best Buy

755
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:34,400
Sew-in I bet Amazon's going to have it cheaper Amazon currently also has

756
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:36,192
Tap on sale

757
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:37,472
For like 80 bucks

758
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:39,520
In tap is there little speaker that

759
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:45,920
You press the button down it's the battery power right it's not always listening I have one for outside usage on the deck I love it

760
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:46,688
There you go

761
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,224
Absecon

762
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,504
A smoking deal on that

763
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:51,552
Also

764
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:57,440
Here's here's some fun other deals The Nest cam at Best Buy is going to be 150 so that's

765
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:58,208
$50 less

766
00:31:58,464 --> 00:31:58,976
This Is the End

767
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:02,304
And I'm excited about this one because

768
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,608
I actually have these in love them

769
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:06,400
The Arlo cameras

770
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:07,424
AR

771
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,752
34994 a four pack

772
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:16,640
At least they require you to have a hug

773
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:17,920
So

774
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:18,944
Do you know if your

775
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:19,712
If your Kevin

776
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:23,040
But everybody else will be happy

777
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:29,952
I don't like I've I've now suggested like for gifts that come with the Hub so

778
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:35,840
Buy switch to exactly

779
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:36,864
Maybe two

780
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:40,192
8 Port switch I like the TV

781
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:45,312
Okay so the Arlo's are normally 499 for a packet

782
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:48,128
403-4944

783
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:49,408
These are great

784
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:52,736
They do require batteries are low this year released

785
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:54,016
Rechargeable version

786
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:55,552
So if you're

787
00:32:55,808 --> 00:33:00,928
Not wanting to if you really want the rechargeable version because saving $150 on these cameras

788
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,256
You know what then spending so much on batteries is not your thing that's cool

789
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,560
A word of advice

790
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:09,888
We suck one of our Arlo's up in a tree

791
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,728
Which was great from a visual perspective and getting a grape

792
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:18,592
In a bird's-eye view of the home it's terrible for having to replace or even recharge the batteries

793
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:19,616
So

794
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:20,896
Just keep that in mind

795
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,224
All right I think that's pretty good

796
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,760
That we've given people a lot of

797
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:27,296
Things to buy

798
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:28,832
Yes we have

799
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,880
So go go spend that money

800
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:32,928
Going to stop

801
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:36,256
Stay tuned for a message from our sponsor and after that

802
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:38,048
Stay tuned for vboo

803
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:42,144
Norbit who is the CEO of beta

804
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:48,544
Everyone this is Stacey Higginbotham breaking into this week's podcast with a word from our sponsor this week sponsor is

805
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,312
Bluetooth

806
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:53,920
With us today is Van Kruger who is VP of us operations at

807
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:54,944
Akasya Network

808
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:55,712
Fan

809
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:57,760
What is cassia do in

810
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:59,296
Why do you use Bluetooth

811
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:02,368
Casting Networks we make the first

812
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:04,928
Extended range Bluetooth router called the cassia hub

813
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,976
Really focused on making

814
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:08,512
Bluetooth better

815
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:12,864
And trying to help it become the ideal in a protocol for the internet

816
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:19,776
And the way that we're doing that are they were extending the range up to a thousand feet or also an eagle

817
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:23,104
Multiple devices to be controlled at the same time

818
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,920
22 devices at the same time or in broadcast

819
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:30,016
No draxie able to hear and listen to hundreds of devices at the same time

820
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:34,624
Brussels able to control those devices when we're not on the same local network

821
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:36,160
Still making

822
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:39,488
Bluetooth really the ideal protocol for The Internet of Things

823
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,536
Because you connect to so many things

824
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:43,328
I imagine the interoperability

825
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,096
Is very important

826
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:49,728
Most definitely that's another reason you know we work with the Bluetooth Sig and Bluetooth technology

827
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,032
Different sample in Ark SE

828
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:53,056
Consumer products

829
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:56,384
It lets you stay paired and connected up to 22 devices

830
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,920
Add an extended range

831
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:04,576
Which allows you to control your Bluetooth devices from your favorite spot in any room

832
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:06,624
You know in that language is Lucci

833
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,416
I mean along with cassia and

834
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:11,488
He also takes interoperability as seriously as we do

835
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,096
Are big on collaboration and you know as one of the 3000 member companies

836
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:18,400
Do we have the opportunity to share knowledge

837
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:22,752
Contribute to the development of the new Bluetooth features and functionality

838
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,800
And why is that collaboration

839
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:31,968
You know working with the Bluetooth Sig and using Bluetooth technology

840
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:32,992
Apsara products

841
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:38,624
I guess it's the ability to shape the future of the smart home and you know smart Enterprises well

842
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:41,952
6 goal in which is our goal as well

843
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:44,512
Is to make the iot accessible to everyone

844
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:50,144
Unique features of Bluetooth you notes Ubiquiti interoperability and open structure

845
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,192
Make it possible for secret easy

846
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:53,472
Acure products forecast

847
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:57,568
Participating updates to technology units also important to us

848
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:02,432
And things like increase range speed broadcasting capacity you know Bluetooth 5

849
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:04,480
Eventually there will be standardized nest

850
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:05,760
As well

851
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:08,832
And you know really in a possibility are Limitless

852
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:10,368
And

853
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:14,720
Right now you know we're building some new Bluetooth router Cena specifically for the Enterprise

854
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:18,048
Yeah they're meant to connect even more devices in our consumer products

855
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:20,352
Applications like medical devices

856
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:21,376
Hospitals

857
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:23,424
Elderly Care Homes

858
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:27,264
You know or multiple speakers and spaces like restaurants and hotels

859
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:29,312
Where can I find Out Boy

Their product especially in Connect devices

902
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:09,408
Very strongly bad

903
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:10,432
The way to

904
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:11,456
Approached

905
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:12,736
Selling a

906
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:15,040
Hubbard Park today is to take out the box

907

Tavistock member who has

909
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:24,000
The app on the device so they can show you how it works and so we felt like the best thing to do to solve this problem was actually go out

910
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:28,352
Stop round store we open one in Palo Alto about a year ago called Data V8

911

Yes exactly

915
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:48,576
Sao Paulo x 80 products in the holiday season how about 90 and then our new stores are twice as big

916
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:53,952
Santa Monica have almost a hundred sixty connected products every store is different and it really depends on

917
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:57,024
What these makers believe is going to work in those locations

918
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,816
And for those of us who are not

919
00:38:59,072 --> 00:38:59,840
Santa Monica

920
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:01,120
Or Seattle

921
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:01,888
Or Palo Alto

922
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:06,752
Wake me at Austin it sounds like you guys just did a deal where I might see some beta gear

923
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:07,520
In other place

924
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:10,592
Yes really excited we just today announced

925
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:14,688
Our partnership is Lowe's called smartspot basically we did as we took

926
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:15,968
The same things that

927
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,784
People love about Paul to the you know hands on

928
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,064
Demonstration products

929
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:24,160
Train staff and also a great assortment of not just like the traditional large

930
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:26,208
Check out some of the smaller ones

931
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:27,488
And we

932
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:29,792
Put them into a small shop and Shop

933
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:31,584
Out in the front of a couple bowls tour

934
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:34,400
Unfortunately you still have to be in California to try and

935
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:37,984
Curses I'm shaking my fist at the sky in frustration

936
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:39,264
All right

937
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,032
One day

938
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,056
One day this is

939
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:44,128
There you go

940
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,152
So

941
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:48,480
I actually brought you here because this is our special Thanksgiving

942
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:51,040
Episode where we're going to be talking about

943
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:52,832
What should I give my loved ones for the holiday

944
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:57,952
I also wanted you to come on and talk about the future of retail and to give me a sense of what

945
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:02,816
Kind of Trends we can look forward to in the space because you probably see a lot of really neat stuff

946
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:04,096
Way ahead of the rest of us

947
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:06,144
Yeah I would be happy to

948
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,728
Well let's get started with kind of the future of retail so you guys

949
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:16,128
Have a very interesting business model and then you also have you use a lot of sensors and you understand pretty well how people are

950
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:17,408
Interact with the product

951
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,736
I'd love to know like is that something that would work beyond what you

952
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:23,552
One way to ensure conceptualize what we're doing is

953
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:25,600
Taking the same Concepts

954
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:28,160
Of iot and applying it to an entire

955
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:31,232
Physical store so you can think of our store is a big iot object

956
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:33,024
In the sense that it has sensors

957
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:35,584
It's connected to the internet at all times

958
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,912
And it's sort of a vehicle for picking up data and

959
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:42,240
And also being able to be manipulated

960
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:44,544
Free software absolutely we

961
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,848
You know we always thought retail

962
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:47,872
As a whole

963
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:52,224
Needed to change and not just for connect devices but we really like the space

964
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,760
Because our customers

965
00:40:54,016 --> 00:41:00,160
And you rarely mention we have a different business model to our customers are actually the people who make products day it's a super simple business model

966
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,696
They subscribe

967
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:03,232
Two space in stores

968
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:05,024
And we send 100% of

969
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:06,304
Sales tax

970
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,328
Tibet company.

971
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:08,096
Next

972
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:11,424
The challenge with retail today is not just that it's

973
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,752
Hard to get into if you're a very small company of Say You're Just a product off a

974
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:18,080
Kickstarter or Indiegogo it's that once you get into

975
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:20,640
The store if your product is sitting in a box

976
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:22,176
Kind of lifeless on a Shelf

977
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:22,944
And

978
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,784
This is by far the most common way that we still see every product

979
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,856
Merchandising. Customers are not going to

980
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:32,672
Interested and that was like the most basic

981
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:34,976
Something that we felt like every products

982
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:35,744
Needed

983
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,328
And you guys also give the data on sales

984
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:40,096
Back to

985
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:41,120
The customer so

986
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:45,216
The maker of the product knows like that X number of people got a demo on this in

987
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:45,984
Annex number

988
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:49,312
Which is actually pretty unusual in the space right

989
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:50,592
Yashow retail

990
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:51,872
Is changing really quickly

991
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:55,199
And when people coming to stores today they don't always walk out

992
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:55,967
With the Box

993
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:58,527
Read that moment you know we've all done this I do this

994
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:00,319
We walking to

995
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:06,719
Store and lock her name any names we see a product that we think is interesting and the first thing we do is we take the phone out of her pocket

996
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:08,255
And we load up Amazon

997
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:09,279
And WeChat

998
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:10,303
And see if the price

999
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:11,071
There is better

1000
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:12,095
Oftentimes

1001
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:15,679
It is sometimes more convenient to get the product

1002
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:17,983
Assertive same-day delivery tour

1003
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:20,799
Delivered in 2 days to your house or maybe you're buying it

1004
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:23,103
Real still are stores or two monitors

1005
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:24,383
Everything that's happening

1006
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:25,151
Outside of

1007
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:26,943
Justice sales with me also

1008
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:28,223
Tracking UPS

1009
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:30,783
Easy then what we want to understand is

1010
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:35,903
How many people are actually learning about your product in the store are they engaging with it who is engaging with it

1011
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:38,207
You know how it like you said how many demos are we

1012
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:40,255
Providing of that product as well and

1013
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:41,791
What categories are doing

1014
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:44,351
Really well also has four categories

1015
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:46,143
So we have connected home

1016
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:46,911
We have

1017
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:47,935
Connected play

1018
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:49,215
We have

1019
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:51,263
Future of Transportation which is

1020
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:55,359
Maybe things like electric skateboards and bikes and we have sense

1021
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:59,967
Which is a category of augmented reality wearables virtual reality

1022
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:04,575
Are new stores launching actually have built-in audio and virtual reality

1023
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:05,343
Rooms

1024
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:06,111
So weird

1025
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:12,511
We're going very deep into those categories want to make sure that people like you are trying the Oculus Rift for the first time or not bumping into other customers

1026
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:15,071
Person like the chaos of a normal store Department

1027
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:17,887
I think

1028
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:18,655
Like all of

1029
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:19,679
Retail it

1030
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:20,703
Really depends

1031
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:25,055
A lot on season if you look at our data from all year long

1032
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:27,103
Connected play has been a really big

1033
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:33,503
Deal for us and certainly in December last year we opened that was a really hot category I think we have a lot of

1034
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:35,807
Adults who walk in and want to buy things for kids

1035
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:37,599
In the summer we noticed

1036
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:39,391
Connected home was doing very well

1037
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:40,159
So I think

1038
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:41,695
We've got like

1039
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:44,511
I would say wearables what the Temptation is

1040
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:45,279
Really

1041
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:46,559
All year long

1042
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:47,839
Certainly

1043
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:52,447
Electric skateboards are going to sell the summer and maybe not in a cold place where people can't use them

1044
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:54,751
But wearables are

1045
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:56,287
I've done pretty well we're not

1046
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:57,311
You'll have a whole

1047
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:58,847
Pelota wearables today

1048
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:02,687
I'm a lot of them are made by very large companies that we tend to focus on

1049
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:05,247
The small ones who are getting the first cancer retail

1050
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:06,271
Ibotta

1051
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:07,807
I bought the spire

1052
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:12,159
Been a lot of self-improvement devices and

1053
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:14,975
Like anything there's no magic there you have to

1054
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:16,255
Want to improve in

1055
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:22,143
And actually be proactive and they can just help you keep you on track but certainly like was firing

1056
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:26,751
Upright posture trainer which has been a hot seller for us you got to put in the effort the device can only catch

1057
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:27,519
Pictures of horror

1058
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:28,287
True

1059
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:34,687
Okay so let's get to the fun part of this where you tell us what sort of things are going to be hot for the holiday

1060
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:36,991
Laser that you would put on your Gadget gifts

1061
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:40,831
Sure so yeah just a precursor

1062
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:43,903
The average price point are store for pots. 200

1063
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:45,183
$25 I think

1064
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:47,231
We definitely SKU I think

1065
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:52,351
C-products little bit more expensive than we do have some affordable options but a lot of the suggestions that I have

1066
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:53,375
Today are

1067
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:55,423
Between 200 and

1068
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:56,447
$3,000

1069
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:01,055
This is not a pipe

1070
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:02,591
Yeah absolutely

1071
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:04,639
But they were also like you awesome

1072
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:07,711
All right will let's start with the most expensive just so I can

1073
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:09,247
Level set here

1074
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:10,527
Couple months ago

1075
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:12,831
This is the part that we do not carry it beta unfortunately

1076
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:16,927
We hope to hell months ago Microsoft made their hololens

1077
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:18,207
Available

1078
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:20,511
For anyone to buy a developer

1079
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:21,535
Kit Edition

1080
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:22,815
But

1081
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:24,095
If you have not tried

1082
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:25,119
Microsoft hololens

1083
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:26,911
Is there augmented reality

1084
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:28,191
Glasses product

1085
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:28,959
It is

1086
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:30,751
Truly mind-blowing technology

1087
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:32,799
If I'm thinking about

1088
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:34,079
Someone who

1089
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:37,407
You know maybe engineering your family or you want to go into the future

1090
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:40,223
This is the only one that's readily available on the market today

1091
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:41,503
$3,000

1092
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:43,295
I believe it's $3,000

1093
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:45,855
And it's a headset that I put on and then I

1094
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:47,647
Grar

1095
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:50,463
Basically you put the headset on and

1096
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:53,791
It's got this clear piece of glass that covers your eyes

1097
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:55,583
You can still see the world and

1098
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:57,119
The hololens software

1099
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:57,887
Places

1100
00:45:58,143 --> 00:46:00,959
Objects 3D models in other all kinds of

1101
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:01,983
Pictures

1102
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:03,263
Into the real world

1103
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:05,823
So for example you can play a game in

1104
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:06,591
Your living room

1105
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:07,871
Where

1106
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:10,943
Your hand is a is a weapon and they have these

1107
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:12,223
Bugs coming out of walls

1108
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:14,271
And they look like they're actually coming

1109
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:15,295
From your

1110
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:16,063
Living room

1111
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:19,903
It's super fun super interesting without all kinds of other productivity apps

1112
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:21,951
As well it's really hard to

1113
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:23,743
You have to try it two times

1114
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:28,351

1115
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:29,887
Now we sat down and

1116
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:32,191
Draw in space

1117
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:34,751
A very large screen to watch

1118
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:38,079
IMovie on so you can imagine having like a 40-foot

1119
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:40,639
Display right in your in your bedroom

1120
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:44,991

00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:46,271

A little bit on the

1127
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:53,951

1278
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:46,303

00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:48,095

1280
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:50,143

But the Anki overdrive product is a

1283
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:57,567
Artificial intelligence race track

1284
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:59,103
Where are the cars

1285
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:00,639
You places little cars

1286
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:03,967
On the track and they raised themselves and you can race against them

1287
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:04,735
With your phone

1288
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:06,271
The technology is really cool

1289
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:07,039
But

1290
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:09,087
Having tried this with kids

1291
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:11,391
You know anywhere from five to 10 years old

1292
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:13,695
They really really want this especially

1293
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:17,791
Your kid isn't into cars at all you can pick one up for

1294
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:18,559
Look at it

1295
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:21,375

Oh it's the starter kit not the full

1305
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:44,671
So you don't need the full kit it just comes with I think extra tracks and extra cars

1306
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:46,975

1307

So this is a beautiful display and it's really a monitor but

1349
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:06,079
If you look at it in real life you can

1350
00:54:06,335 --> 00:54:08,383
It's got this interesting for a matte finish

1351
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:10,943
On the display so it doesn't look like a display

1352
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:15,295
And you can Scott gesture control built into it and you can basically swap out

1353

1378
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:06,495
There's been some interesting I mean this

1379
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:07,519
You know we've had

1380
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:08,799
Wifi photo frame

1381
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:10,591
Many many years

1382
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:13,407
And this year in particular has been a new crop of

1383
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:14,943
Very nicely done

1384
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:16,735
Wi-Fi photo frames that have

1385
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:19,807
I really great software that connects to your phone

1386
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:22,367
I'm 1/2 just launched is called Hora frames

1387
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:23,903
What is scattered on the high-end

1388
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:26,207
I believe they retail for $400 but

1389
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:27,999
Beautiful looking object

1390
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:30,559
But the software is really really cool so basically you can

1391
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:33,119
I'll take your entire photo library and never

1392
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:34,911
You know install the app and never ever

1393
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:36,959
I have to like sync photos to your

1394
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:37,727
Frame

1395
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:39,775
It just takes off the best moments in

1396
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:42,079
Magically

1397
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:45,151
You always see something new on your on your friend which is one of the

1398
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:46,943
The big letdown

1399
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:50,527
Oh you know guys this was it this is our aaura

1400
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:51,807

00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:54,367
Favorite thing in

00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:57,183

1410
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:10,495
Coming on the show I should ask you

1411
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:11,263
Because it's

1412
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:12,287

00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:14,847

Yasso

1418
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:31,231
We're doing Black Friday a little differently

1419
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:35,583
So we're not doing like a doorbuster you know wait outside in the cold type of

1420
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:36,863
Black Friday

1421
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:40,703
Partly because it's never cold in California

1422
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:42,239
But

1423
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:44,031
