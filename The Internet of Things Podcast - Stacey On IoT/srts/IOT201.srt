00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:27,648
Talking about a new smart lamp

11
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:29,440
From a mattress company because

12
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,976
When is got a smart

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,512
We've got

00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:36,096
Cameras in disguise

17
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:37,888
Big companies getting in

18
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:39,168
Home electricity

19
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,960
A new way to harvest

20
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:41,728
Energy

21
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:43,008
In Japan

22
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,824
People's devices for good

23
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:47,872
So we also have

24
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:48,640
Ken

25
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:54,272
Kolderup who is the VP of marketing at the Bluetooth Sig who is going to be talking in detail about what we can

26
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:55,040
Can expect from the

27
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:56,832
New Bluetooth specifications

28
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:57,856
And

29
00:00:58,112 --> 00:00:59,392
He's going to explain what happened

30
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:00,416
With beacons for us

31
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:03,488
If we're going to hear from this week sponsor Farrakhan

32
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,024
So all of this

33
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,048
And more

34
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:07,328
Ready for you

35
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:10,400
A moment from another one of our sponsors

36
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:12,192
Guys this week we are

37
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:14,496
Bring it a new sponsor Western Digital

38
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:16,544
Western Digital creates environment

39

Throughout your home

41
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:21,920
Atrocities

42
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:23,456
Where data lives

43
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:26,784
Western Digital is there to drive the Innovation necessary for the

44
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,552
The best result

45
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:29,088
Today and tomorrow

46
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,392
New devices new system

47
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:34,720
New Solutions and world-class data infrastructure

48
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:36,000
All optimized

49
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:40,352
Tune to create the right conditions for data to realize its full potential

50
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,656
Learn more at data make

51
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:43,424
Is possible

52
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,448
Dot-com

53
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,496
That's database

54
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:47,520
Possible

55
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:48,800
Dot-com

56
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:50,336
Okay

57
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:51,104
Hey

58
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:51,872
Kevin

59
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:52,896
We won't go.

60
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:56,224
Too much into the Bluetooth news because we've got a deep dive

61
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,248
Some can holder upcoming

62
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,272
But

63
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,040
We should tell p

64
00:01:59,296 --> 00:01:59,808
WhatsApp

65
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,368
So on Monday the 6th

66
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,392
I said that

67
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:06,720
They are announcing new location based services for Bluetooth

68
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:08,512
Basically this means that

69
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:10,560
Your Bluetooth low-energy radios

70
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:12,096
They will now be able

71
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,888
How to tell where they are

72
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,680
Within about a few cents

73
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:16,960
Which is pretty cool

74
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:22,848
It is and I'm glad Candice here because I wrote a post this week about what I think we could use this technology

75
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:29,248
Before some Curious to hear what he has to say about the new feature in general the features called direction finder

76
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,832
So with current Bluetooth Solutions like you may have like a Bluetooth

77
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:36,416
Tracking device like a tile or a Tracker or whatever you might have

78
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:40,000
And you can use the mobile app and it will track the signal of that

79
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,024
Tracking device

80
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:41,792
And kind of

81
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:46,144
Tell you how far away you are from an as you get closer you may find lost keys where's my bus

82
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,192
What I use a Bluetooth tracker for my house

83
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,984
Direction finding feature

84
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,776
Takes it to a whole nother level

85
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:53,824
And was going to rain

86
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,712
Potential possibilities such as indoor positioning asset tracking again like you said down to the centimeter

87
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:01,760
Level my thought isn't

88
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,552
Maybe I'm thinking too hard on this

89
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,856
This could be huge for the Smart Home

90
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:09,440
And I don't think it's more I'm going to see it right away I think it's going to be more than like acid

91
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:11,744
Tracking inventory type Solutions at first

92
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,560
But if it comes to the smart home think about this

93
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:16,864
You could have actual person alive

94
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:23,264
Presence detection with this to the centimeter level meaning if I have a phone with this technology or maybe

95
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,800
Maybe a device like a

96
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:29,920
Clip-on to myself or I put in my pocket for example my smart home

97
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:30,944
Actually tell

98
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,040
Where I am exactly Mouse and who I am because I would register that device

99
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:40,672
So now instead of like using a camera or motion sensor that says there's somebody in that room

100
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:43,232
You can say Hey Kevin is in his office

101
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:49,632
In this spot and when he's in the spot he likes this music playing in this light on this temperature and so on this could

102
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,168
Could bring a lot more context

103
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:53,728
To the smart home is at least that's what I'm hoping

104
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,032
You are right to help for that

105
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:56,800
It will

106
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,336
A little while now

107
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,360
The way youth

108
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,640
Suggested it could work

109
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,688
So one of the challenges with the

110
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:03,456
This new feature

111
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:05,760
Is that handset makers are going to have

112
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:06,784
Adapter

113
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:10,368
But the sense when the consumer side you're not going to see it on handsets

114
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,648
Until people get new Bluetooth

115
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:12,416
Tooth chips in there

116
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,440
Which means new handset

117
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:14,976
So that's a little ways

118
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,536
On the industrial side they're actually

119
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,559
Companies Rd

120
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,327
Using

121
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,095
Precursors

122
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,655
So that's happening already

123
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,423
Asset tracker

124
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:25,727
With your idea what you would have

125
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,519
Have to do is basically by

126
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,287
A whole.new

127
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,615
So you would have your dedicated thing

128
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:34,687
Your clip-on belt loop whatever thing

129
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,967
And then you would have to have

130
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:40,063
Some sort of Beacon infrastructure that's new around your home with the appropriate

131
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,343
Antennas

132
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,111
That could happen

133
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,135
And so

134
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,159
Will look for that

135
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,439
We'll see and

136
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,975
That was supposed to happen

137
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:49,535
Check with pekin

138
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,303
Again

139
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,583
You guys will enjoy the interview

140
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:54,143
Hugo's fairly deep on all of this stuff

141
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:56,447
Explains what happens with pekin

142
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:57,727
Hey

143
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,007
Speaking of beacons

144
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,799
Is a weird yusuke's but

145
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,079
I think it's weird

146
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,103
It doesn't feel like

147
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:06,943
What ways is using Bluetooth beacons in New York

148
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,223
Cities tunnels

149
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,247
And bridges

150
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,527
Where you might lose your

151
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,295
GPS signal

152
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,831
They're putting beacons

153
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:14,367
Every 40 meters

154
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,135
Roughly

155
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:17,439
So that's what 42 m per mile

156
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:19,487
That's 42 beacons for my Lotus

157
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,791
And at a cost of $28 and change

158
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:24,095
It's about $8,000 a mile to

159
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:24,863
Implement

160
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,655
And ideas you could be able

161
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:28,959
How to say hey when you're driving through there's a

162
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:31,007
Pekin inside a car driven

163
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,031
By subway

164
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,079
And

165
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:34,847
That would actually

166
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:35,871
To tell you how long it take

167
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:36,895
To Traverse that

168
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,175
Particular Bridge or tunnel

169
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,455
I get it

170
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:41,503
I just don't think this is the best

171
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,271
Radio

172
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:44,319
Stalogy for that but

173
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:49,183
Well it means there are few alternatives to good GPS

174
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:53,535
Signal and when you think about the tunnels that they have in New York City as well as the

175
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,839
Gwb the George Washington Bridge has

176
00:05:56,095 --> 00:06:00,447
2 levels of fear on the underneath level you might lose GPS because you've got no

177
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:03,007
Stephen Stephen cars in top of Yuan

178
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:03,775
Top-level

179
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:07,615
I'm not sure what the alternative is other than say well just no signal I mean

180
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:09,151
You don't need it for directions

181
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:12,991
Companies probably want it for data such as the traffic

182
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:17,599
Information you how long is it taking to get across the gwb today at work through the Lincoln Tunnel

183
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,135
That's true and we don't have

184
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:22,463
Great vehicle to vehicle or vehicle-to-infrastructure coming

185
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,743
And so

186
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:27,327
We've been talking about for a few years with Wi-Fi and other

187
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,607
Things with the word 5gf

188
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:29,375
Fix it

189
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,143
Yeah it's magic

190
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,679
Oh yeah

191
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:33,215
Jionet

192
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,239
All right

193
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,031
That was sarcasm

194
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,311
For everyone who was not aware

195
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:38,335
Alright let's

196
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,359
Suck it up lighting

197
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:41,919
Because there's two crazy lighting Products

198
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,455
When is actually not cry

199
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,223
Crazy one is

200
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,247
A big surprise egg

201
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,783
Woke up with a surprise first

202
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,575
Casper the maker of

203
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:49,343
Beds

204
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:55,231
Yeah I order online and get the mattress sent to your house in a box and expand isn't and I fat

205
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,511
Yeah I mean I have a

206
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,535
Leesa mattress in our house

207
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,303
House so it's

208
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,327
It's not a Casper but

209
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:01,375
For Pioneer this

210
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:05,727
They're getting into the smart home space with a lamp

211
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,519
Is called the Casper glow

212
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:09,567
Is actually a pretty cool device

213
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,847
You know how I always help you

214
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:11,615
People I need the

215
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,663
Be smart this is actually pretty smart

216
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,711
It is designed to dim

217
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:16,735
In Brighton based

218
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:17,503
Saint

219
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,271
Your circadian

220
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,831
So different type of light in the morning verse

221
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:22,623
It is

222
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,671
Designer gradually dim at bedtime

223
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,695
I've actually had

224
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,487
It's that have been designed

225
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,023
So this is not

226
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:29,791
Tortellini

227
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:32,095
But it is kind of a pretty

228
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,399
In a neat form factor and it does not work

229
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:38,239
So it also has this ambient light sensor

230
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,519
Gives that

231
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,055
Apparently modifies the light

232
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,591
For the environment you're in

233
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,919
Yeah kind of gets rid of the blue light

234
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:48,223
Didn't miss a warm Hue based on the

235
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,247
Ambient light

236
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,295
So that way it's not messing with your sleep patterns

237
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,575
And the cool thing is

238
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,367
You turn it off by flipping it over

239
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,391
Which iPhone

240
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:57,439
That's a clever implementation because

241
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,975
Essenza behave like

242
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,255
Power charging

243
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:05,375
So yeah you just flip it over it still stays on Rico's off and it's not losing power that way

244
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,679
Yeah and then there's a bunch of other stuff now

245
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,215
The other cool thing is

246
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,519
Portable so you can bring it

247
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,055
Places obviously you have

248
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:13,823
Have to charge it

249
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:16,639
Normal use most of the time

250
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:18,175
You can bring the glow with you

251
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,711
You so they talk about you know

252
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,735
Going to bathroom

253
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:23,551
Getting a drink of water you can bring the lamp in Italy

254
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:24,831
Glow softly for you

255
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,111
Feels like summer

256
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:27,647
Need to see to believe

257
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:30,463
I have solar powered LED lamps

258
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,511
My house for the zombie apocalypse

259
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,559
So I keep one by the band KISS you have on YouTube

260
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:35,839
Stuff around the house

261
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:38,655
I can literally just looked it up on the basement lights up

262
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:40,191
It's not smart but it works

263
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:42,495
I doubt it last as long as Piccolo because you can

264
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,263
Havis

265
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,567
Beyond continuously for up to seven hours on battery

266
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,359
These clothes will not come

267
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:50,431
The single glow will cost $89 and

268
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:52,735
How to pack that sticks together will cost

269
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:53,759
100 +

270
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,039
$69

271
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,575
So Kevin are you in

272
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,111
I

273
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:04,255
Think not I can only sleep for 45 hours at a time anyway so I'll just stick with my connected bulbs in my bedroom

274
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,023
Okay

275
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:05,791
So

276
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:09,631
Sticking with lights and circadian rhythms a new startup

277
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,399
Has come out

278
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,423
Called Oro

279
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:12,959
And Oro is

280
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,239
Connected lights

281
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:15,519
That

282
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,055
There are so many

283
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,079
But

284
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,615
This one is a little bit unique

285
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:21,151
It actually reminds me of

286
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,175
FB stock

287
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,711
Lighting but those were bulbs

288
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,247
Years ago

289
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,015
Kind of had

290
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,551
Both AI motion

291
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,575
Sensors presents

292
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,855
Detection in the light bulb

293
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,159
And they would learn based on your habits

294
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,183
In the balls with dammit

295
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,719
Figure things out

296
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:35,743
It was magic

297
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,023
I tried them out they were

298
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,327
Pretty good they weren't as magic as I thought they'd be

299
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,863
They do get better over time

300
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,655
The Oro does all of this

301
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:43,679
In a light

302
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,727
So the switch

303
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:48,031
You replace it requires a neutral wire

304
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,055
It

305
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,079
It's on your wall that can

306
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,639
Check when someone's in the room that learns your habits over

307
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:53,407
Time in it

308
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:55,199
Basically Tunes the lighting

309
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:59,039
Two again your circadian rhythm so cooler light in the morning

310
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,319
While doing stuff

311
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:02,623
And then dimming and turning orange year

312
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,391
Or at night

313
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:09,535
Yeah what I like about this is the number of sensors in here because they're like switches with this motion detection

314
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,815
They're not whatever cost

315
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:13,887
Smart they just replace one type of switch with another

316
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,423
Logitech motion switch goes on

317
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:16,703
These have I can

318
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:22,847
For sensors in them so it detects motion but also sound proximity and the ambient light

319
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:24,895
To understand when somebody's in the room

320
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:27,711
So aside from the Smart Learning aspect of it

321
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:31,807
I think these would be better more effective than just a traditional motion sensor switch

322
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,343
Now

323
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:34,623
These are persons

324
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:37,439
I was going to say All Those sensors in this market, the price

325
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,231
They're 199

326
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:39,999
Persuade

327
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:43,071
And that is a single game

328
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,119
Ouch

329
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,143
It's expensive

330
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:51,263
So this is probably actually it's not that much more expensive than outfit in your house with something

331
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,031
Like the noon switch

332
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,079
And those if you guys were

333
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,359
Recall our switches that

334
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,895
Have pre-programmed lighting recipe

335
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,175
Already in them

336
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,455
Basically

337
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:01,247
Figure out what lights you have in you

338
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,015
Your house

339
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:02,783
And then cry

340
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:03,551
Create the recipe

341
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:04,831
Is based on that

342
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:05,855
Automatically

343
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,415
So again what we're seeing is more automation

344
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,951
More AI

345
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,231
That's what I'm

346
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:12,255
Curious about is it

347
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,279
When do you live with

348
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:14,815
How

349
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:16,095
The AI meets up

350
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,143
Because that's always the

351
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:18,911
The question will be

352
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:19,679
Start automating

353
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,983
Right it's one thing to say it

354
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:24,031
Can learn but how well does it learn

355
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:27,103
Because remember when everyone

356
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,127
You don't remember when this

357
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:28,895
Just came out never

358
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:33,759
And people still have issues

359
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,551
I mean mine have mostly

360
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:38,111
Subsided but part of that was just a learning curve

361
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,135
+

362
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:41,439
Yeah we'll see how that works with something is integral

363
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,999
That's something you notice right away when I

364
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:45,791
Yep

365
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:48,095
Okay in the creepy factor for the

366
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,703
We have Panasonic launching a

367
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:54,495
The home security camera that's

368
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,519
Part of a

369
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,287
Floor lamp

370
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:57,567
Be home Hawk

371
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:58,591
Floor lamp

372
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:01,151
This isn't Kickstarter so this is

373
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:03,967
You know maybe if no one will find it but basically this is a

374
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,503
The lamp with a hidden

375
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:06,527
High definition

376
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,063
Security camera built-in

377
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:08,831
And

378
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:11,647
I don't love cameras in the home you guys already know this but

379
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,695
I think the Verge put a story out about this

380
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,743
This is an Airbnb nightmare

381
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:18,047
As someone who stayed in airbnb's in

382
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,583
And found cameras I'm like

383
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,351
Yeah

384
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,375
Now I'm going to

385
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:23,167
I have to have like CIA level bugged

386
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:23,935
Detection happen

387
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:26,495
Anyone I've dealt with today and I Airbnb you

388
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:30,591
Yeah but I mean it is integrated the cameras integrated into the lamp

389
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:31,359
It's not

390
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:33,151
Truly camouflage lyrics

391
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:35,711
Take a look at it you can see the camera sensor

392
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,479
Toronto

393
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,527
Major looking for it you'll see it

394
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:42,111
If you're not paying attention maybe somebody has it in their house and you're in the house

395
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:45,439
You might not notice sediment I wouldn't walk around and check her even Lambs

396
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,999
Decided to stay in that house but

397
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,023
It's not like

398
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:49,791
Totally

399
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:54,143
Yeah but it's not for me that's for sure either

400
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,959
And I should clarify it is on Indiegogo it is

401
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:57,727
Not

402
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,007
Kickstarter my badge

403
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,543
Sew in

404
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,359
I don't like this I don't like

405
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,383
You know

406
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,175
Yeah

407
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:11,295
One nice thing I will say it obviously plugged into a wall with making a traditional lamp and you don't

408
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:17,951
Need a smart bulb in there any like that but if the power goes out this can all run up there up to 90 minutes on 8 double a batteries

409
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:21,535
Sienna backup power source for your camouflage camera

410
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:25,887
You're never going to make me like this

411
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,239
Okay go to making a speaker you can talk to somebody from far away right from the lamp

412
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:31,519
Stop reading

413
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,311
Get your feet off my couch

414
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:38,943
I could see why homeowners want to do this but I'm also kind of like

415
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:42,527
Is the trade-off for the sharing economy is

416
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:43,551
Surveillance

417
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,319
Constantly

418
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,087
That's not

419
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:45,855
What were signed up for

420
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:48,671
Are there other countries to move to if you want that

421
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:51,743
Anyway alright so let's talk about

422
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,023
Let's talk about

423
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,815
Google in Amazon

424
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,095
Getting into

425
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,119
Electricity

426
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,679
4 Google this will actually be the second time around

427
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:02,751
They actually had a Smart Energy program so it Microsoft

428
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:03,519
Way back into

429
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:04,287
Mm

430
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,311
11 in mm

431
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,079
12

432
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:08,383
But this is a story from the Wall Street Journal.

433
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,151
Talking about

434
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:11,967
How the big players are looking at home automation

435
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:13,247
And all the data that's being

436
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:14,783
Sterilizing

437
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,063
Hey

438
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,343
We could be better energy

439
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,135
Better utilities

440
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:22,975
It's Marta me where was wonder what are companies doing with all of this

441
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:23,999
Smart home data

442
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:29,887
It's probably not good what song is this

443
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:33,983
During a solar eclipse in 2017 obviously every red solar panel

444
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,287
Wasn't generating any electricity which

445
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,591
Could affect the grid as well because

446
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:39,615
A lot of solar panels

447
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,407
Search to bring tide today

448
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:45,247
Feed energy in Lynnhaven overabundance of it and

449
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:49,343
Google apparently encouraged Nest owners to opt into a program that

450
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,623
Cool off devices

451
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:52,671
Second step in the summer time during the eclipse

452
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,975
Cluster homes around there before the power supply

453
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:56,511
Spell because we eclipse

454
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:58,303
And then during the eclipse

455
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:04,703
Set the thermostat to turn the temp up a few degrees so that the air conditioning is not running and apparently they had three

456
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:10,079
The million customers participating and they reduce the energy consumption by 700 megawatts which is

457
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,871
No small bit of power

458
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,407
Oh yeah and this makes sense

459
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:17,759
A demand response has been around for a while utilities have participated in base

460
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,039
Controlling people

461
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:19,807
You sign up

462
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:20,575
You control someone

463
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,599
Nest thermostat in UK

464
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:22,879
Saola

465
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,415
We got a lot of Demand right now let's

466
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:26,719
Turn everybody's thermostats up by a little

467
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:27,999
People can opt out

468
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:29,535
But

469
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,327
When you start having more

470
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,607
Connected devices

471
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:34,655
You can actually start making an impact

472
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,191
Weider squat

473
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:42,335
In there still going any the biggest energy consumption devices in the home are hbac so HVAC

474
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:43,615
Air conditioning inside

475
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:44,895
And water heater

476
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,687
And they're already

477
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:49,247
Utilities that are looking at Connected water heat

478
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:50,783
Insane

479
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:51,551
Hey

480
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,087
Maybe we can control that

481
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,879
After that we get into

482
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,415
Washers and dryers are

483
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:57,951
Ovens

484
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:59,743
Whirlpool I know his talked

485
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:01,023
Do utilities about this

486
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:01,791
But

487
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,583
It would be much easier

488
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:04,607
4

489
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:05,887
1 monolithic

490
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:06,911
Company who has X

491
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,191
Statistician

492
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:09,983
Do these types of things

493
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:13,055
As opposed to it like a Whirlpool making deals with

494
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,871
Utility providers there are across the US

495
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:16,895
But there's more than just

496
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:21,503
And there's a consumer benefit true this is almost time for giving up there to get you

497
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,783
Something back in return

498
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:23,551
A lot of

499
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,575
Regions have

500
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:26,111
Variable energy rates

501
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,135
Panthers

502
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:32,767
No I'm very high demand rates can Skyrocket so if you pre-cooled your hombres happel

503
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,815
You might be able to do so at the lower rate

504
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:39,935
And just kind of weather the storm where demand is high and therefore prices Ric mashup Payless

505
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:42,495
And still feel relatively the same Comfort level

506
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:43,775
That is the

507
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:46,847
Doesn't always happen as someone who has dealt with

508
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:48,895
Demand response but that is the goal

509
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:49,663
Okay

510
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,479
Speaking of energy use on a

511
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:53,503
Smaller-scale

512
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,807
A team of researchers out of MIT

513
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,855
Has developed a material that

514
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:58,879
Could lead to a break

515
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,415
Through in energy harvesting

516
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,183
And that is

517
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:04,255
Grabbing small bits of energy to power sensors or

518
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,023
Tiny

519
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,047
Battery powered device

520
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:06,815
Isis today

521
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,607
This is really important you guys

522
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:09,887
Why is the Internet of Things

523
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:10,911
We cannot be changed

524
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,959
Can batteries if we're going to have 50 billion

525
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,519
We have to have things that

526
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:17,055
Have energy harvesting

527
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:18,847
So

528
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:20,383
This particular research

529
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:23,455
Has basically created a two-dimensional material that

530
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,223
Striatum

531
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:27,295
That can convert radio signals from

532
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,575
Any sort of radio

533
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,599
Yosoo WiFi selfie

534
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,367
Phone or whatever

535
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,135
Into

536
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:31,903
Our

537
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,183
It's pretty cool cat

538
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:36,767
Yeah it's really cool I mean they call or two dimensional material

539
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:37,535
Because it's

540
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:43,935
Small 3 atoms tickets made of the film made of molybdenum disulfide

541
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:46,495
Pronounce that wrong but I can act as an antenna

542
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:51,615
But additionally it can Harvest energy from the ready ways that antenna is gathering as well so

543
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:57,759
You're not going to generate tons of electricity this way but for small devices small low-power devices may be aware of

544
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,295
Probably pushing but maybe

545
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:02,111
You could essentially maybe have no battery in it

546
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:04,159
And these are the effort to get

547
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,439
Power out of

548
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,463
RF signal

549
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,487
Is not new

550
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,023
This is actually something that's

551
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:12,351
Been happening for a long time you could actually even think of things like

552
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,631
Hey Wireless power is

553
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:14,911
Basically that

554
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,447
These sorts of

555
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,727
Things are being

556
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:18,495
Researched in

557
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:19,263
Lots of

558
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:22,591
Right now what's interesting is

559
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,871
Today we only have a

560
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:24,639
Couple energy

561
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,175
Pek energy harvesting

562
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:26,943
Technologies

563
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:27,711
They are

564
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:29,247
Pythiosis movement-based

565
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:30,783
Clicking

566
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,319
Changing things anything kinetic

567
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:35,135
Temperature differences can also generate power

568
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,415
And then solar

569
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,183
So like

570
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:39,231
Those are all probably more efficient

571
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:44,607
At this moment and they're not very efficient especially at small rages I mean solders pretty efficient but

572
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,143
You got a small device

573
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:48,191
You have a small solar panel on top of it

574
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,471
It will generate as much

575
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:50,495
But

576
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:52,031
We've got to get better

577
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:52,799
We got to do more

578
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:54,335
So it's really important to have the

579
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:59,455
Right and then she said this has been around for awhile in practice because

580
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:02,783
Anybody sees an RFID Card safe to enter a building for example

581
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,063
That has

582
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,111
An antenna in it

583
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,903
It has no power than a battery

584
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:09,439
But when it received a signal

585
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:11,743
It can get a little bit of juice just enough to

586
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:13,023
Basically say hey

587
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:16,607
Send a signal back or read the signal and and therefore unlock a door

588
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:17,375
For example so

589
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:21,215
We have a second ology but we're not using it in ways that we need to fry.

590
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,007
So

591
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,031
Let's go friend

592
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,311
Cool energy Harvest

593
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:26,591
Let's keep that up y'all

594
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:27,871
All the way to

595
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:28,895
Japan

596
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:29,919
Kevin

597
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:31,455
What are the Japanese do

598
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:33,247
What the Japanese

599
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:36,831
Government is going to hack into millions

600
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:39,391
Japanese citizens connected devices

601
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,671
But it's not a bad thing

602
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:47,071
It's actually being done to improve cyber-security so what they're doing and by that I mean Japan's National Institute of information

603
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:48,351
Animation and Communications

604
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,119
Technology Group

605
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:54,751
Is going to basically use default passwords and password dictionaries of basic passwords

606
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:57,567
A break until about 200 million devices

607
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:01,151
Liquor store with webcams and router so I don't have to actually

608
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:04,223
Move beyond that at the phones and other things but regardless

609
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:08,063
When they do that if they're successfully gaining access to a device

610
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:14,463
They're going to contact the owner of that device to advise them hey you might want to change your password

611
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:17,791
The finding out who owns what

612
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:20,351
Found them but I think this is a great program

613
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,119
Because

614
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:27,519
Too many people have the weak link is that password or maybe it's the router in the home and so on so this is a thing from

615
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:29,823
Good not for evil so this is one hack that I like

616
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:31,871
Okay and

617
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:35,967
Finally let's talk about Amazon making it easier to build

618
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:37,503
Skills for metal

619
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:41,087
Yep if your developer and making Amazon

620
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:42,367
Echo skills

621
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:48,767
You may be doing two things one building a scale but to worrying about all the backend stuff on the server to host

622
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:50,815
Stair and do processing and so on and so forth

623
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:53,631
Amazon actually has a beta program

624
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:55,935
Madame a hosted skills

625
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:59,519
And that is now available to all developers that was very limited

626
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:03,615
Can a private preview but it's open to everybody now and what this does is instead of

627
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:07,455
Worrying about the hosting for your AWS Lambda bits and all

628
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:12,575
Amazon washable just hosted for you and they have a free tier with access to AWS Lambda

629
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:16,159
5 gigs of storage and 15 gig of monthly data transfer

630
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:17,696
So you don't have to worry about

631
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:22,560
Setting up a server or setting up some instant somewhere else on the cloud that's not Amazon

632
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:26,400
Take all that away and that way you can just focus on

633
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:27,168
Skillet

634
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,240
And I have an update from last

635
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:32,288
So last week we talked about smart

636
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,056
Apartments

637
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:34,336
I assume you guys

638
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:36,128
We talked about a

639
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,920
Particular woman who was

640
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:42,016
She as a security researcher was not come

641
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:43,040
Pitbull with her partner

642
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:43,808
Ain't going

643
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:46,880
With automated door locks mostly but just an overall automate

644
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,928
We talked about why we thought

645
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:51,744
Hey this may not be the best implementation of this

646
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,024
Cuz she wasn't given a choice

647
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,304
Lesley Carhart

648
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,584
Who is the White House

649
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,608
Packer who did this

650
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,888
She actually wrote

651
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,680
Blog post about it

652
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:01,984
Talk about security things to consider when you're

653
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:02,752
Apartment goes

654
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:04,288
Smart and

655
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:05,056
She talks

656
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:06,336
Bit about

657
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:07,360
The situation

658
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:09,920
But she also brings up some really good points

659
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:10,688
I think or were

660
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,712
Sharing with

661
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,552
So she talks about when assessing the sort of thing

662
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:17,088
What is your threat mod

663
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,624
And for her

664
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,392
It's pretty high be

665
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:20,672
Because she is a professional hair

666
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:22,208
Packer of nation states and other

667
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:22,976
People end

668
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:24,512
If those kind of people

669
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,816
They might often becomes hard

670
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:29,376
So bad for her it's a big deal

671
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:30,912
For maybe

672
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:32,448
Kevin or I am I

673
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:35,008
Not be a big deal especially because we live in a single-family home

674
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,360
If someone were going to go to the trouble to want to break into our house we are door locks

675
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:40,896
It'd probably be better off just using

676
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:41,664
A screwdriver

677
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,432
Crowbar

678
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:45,248
Now in an apartment building

679
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,272
Because there's

680
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:48,576
The potential for someone to be able to open

681
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:49,344
A bunch of doors

682
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,136
Once that does change the threat

683
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:52,160
Model there even if your

684
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:54,720
So that was one point I thought

685
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:58,560
And then she also did a really deep dive I'm linked to this

686
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,328
Listen to

687
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,352
How you define

688
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:01,888
Smart Lock and how

689
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:02,912
Basically

690
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:04,960
Key box or taking care of Howell

691
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:06,496
PIN codes work

692
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:07,520
Etcetera

693
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:09,568
And it's actually a really good look

694
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:11,104
About how the locks work

695
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,176
Indifferent exploitation methods that have been used to break them in the

696
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:16,736
So did she say she's moving

697
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:18,016
She did not say that she

698
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:21,856
Okay and then she went into the issues associated with the Hub

699
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:23,392
We talked actually about

700
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:24,160
A lot of fees

701
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:26,976
To her credit she actually talks

702
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,512
About why a landlord might

703
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:29,280
Want some

704
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:31,584
And I do think that there are benefits

705
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,352
To Orlando

706
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:33,632
Lord and if done correctly

707
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:34,656
Everybody wins

708
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:36,704
That's the thing I don't think any

709
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,776
Either you me or her have an issue

710
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:44,128
With smart of finding an apartment it's the implementation that's being done in this

711
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:44,896
Particular case

712
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,432
So

713
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:48,992
I love this story I love the death and what she goes

714
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:50,528
You should probably check it out

715
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:52,064
And maybe a sass

716
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:54,112
How you feel about your old smartphone

717
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:55,392
Insecurities in the way

718
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,184
All right

719
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,208
Let's

720
00:23:58,464 --> 00:23:58,976
I know that's

721
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,512
For someone like me

722
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:03,072
All kinds of craziness in my house

723
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:04,608
But I actually do

724
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:06,912
Consider every device I bring in and I talked

725
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:07,936
People about the security

726
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:10,240
So not this

727
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:11,520
Crazy pell-mell

728
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:13,312
Adoption of technology that makes sound

729
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:14,848
The shower

730
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:18,688
Okay

731
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:20,224
Now it is time

732
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,296
For our iot podcast hotline

733
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:24,320
Voicemail

734
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:26,880
So this week we have a new sponsor

735
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:27,904
For the hotline

736
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:28,672
Except

737
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:32,000
It's an existing sponsor that you guys are probably really familiar with

738
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:35,072
A pharaoh has taken over this month sponsorship of

739
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:36,608
The iot podcast

740
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:41,216
Ferromex platform that helps companies get their devices on the internet

741
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:43,008
Kenmore and dealing

742
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,288
Have both used a pharaoh

743
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:48,640
And as part of that they have experienced as much as an 80% reduction in time to Market

744
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:50,176
99%

745
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,200
Your support calls

746
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:52,480
Antenex higher Act

747
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,272
So

748
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:56,064
If you were in the market for an iot

749
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:58,624
Provider or someone to help you

750
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,392

To learn more

755
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,512
That's

756
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:05,792
A fer

757
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:06,816
Dot IO

758
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:08,352
Okay

759
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:09,888
This week's color is

760
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,192
Monte who wants to find

761
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:12,960
Appropriate

762
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:13,984
Z-Wave hub

763
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:15,264
Let's hear from him

764
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,824
Kevin and Noah

765
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,592
If you're listening

766
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:19,616
This is Monty

767
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:20,640
Salt Lake

768
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:22,432
Just starting to do some smart

769
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:25,504
Trying to find a Best

770
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,040
Z-Wave

771
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,320
What's a github

772
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,112
Thank you

773
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,648
Okay mighty

774
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,208
I'm actually going to steer you away from a hub

775
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:35,488
If you are just beginning

776
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:37,024
I don't know if I would recommend

777
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:37,792
Bringing

778
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:39,072
Z-Wave into your house

779
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:43,424
And I think there are plenty of other options even in the sensor depart

780
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,704
I thought you could get away with

781
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:46,240
Just using Bluetooth

782
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,264
And Wi-Fi

783
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:50,080
And probably something like a Google home or a madam

784
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,128
Hate that idea

785
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:54,432
Kevin has some excellent Z-Wave Wrecking

786
00:25:55,712 --> 00:26:00,576
Yep since Monty says he's kind of just getting started out I would say was keep it simple

787
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:03,392
And go with either a Samsung SmartThings Hub

788
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:05,952
Or a wink Hub because both of those would have

789
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:06,976
Bluetooth Wi-Fi

790
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,000
NZ wave

791
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:11,072
Do not too expensive the relatively easy to set up

792
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:13,632
If you want to get into a little more

793
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:14,912
Technical

794
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:15,936
Solution

795
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:16,960
Habitat woodwork

796
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:23,616
For you but again it's not for somebody just starting out and actually in the process of finishing up my review of The Hobbit

797
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:25,664
And even if somebody is

798
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,200
It's been playing with these things

799
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:28,992
For the better part of eight years

800
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:30,272
It's a bit of a

801
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:32,576
Learning curve on setting up and automating things

802
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:34,624
I should have come up with two other options

803
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,184
Tremonte if my teacher looking for

804
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,000
A Z-Wave Hub and you're also in the market

805
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,024
To add

806
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,816
Some smarts to a television set

807
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:45,376
You might want to think about the Nvidia

808
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:51,520
Shield TV box which is an Android TV box so you can stream all kinds of online things services

809
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:56,640
Pretty much anything and everything other than iTunes right now and what you can do is they sell a

810
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:57,664
SmartThings

811
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:01,760
USB dongle which turns it into a SmartThings Hub as well

812
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:08,160
It's two-for-one you're going to pay more obviously you're looking at probably about $170 for the Nvidia Shield TV

813
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:14,560
And then another 30 or 40 for the jungle but I just want to put that out there so last week if all you want is a Z-Wave

814
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:17,376
Play pop and I don't think that's what you want but just in case

815
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:23,520
Sbarro actually they make the Home Center to it doesn't have Wi-Fi it doesn't have Bluetooth but it does have Z-Wave so

816
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,312
It's a nice use case

817
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,592
It doesn't give you

818
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:32,480
Probably what you want in the future but it's something that considers well ideally that's just me

819
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:34,784
Relatively the easiest one to use

820
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,320
Has been Rock Solid for me

821
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:38,112
I will endorse

822
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,136
Wink

823
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:41,952
And SmartThings as a distant second

824
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:42,720
If you are

825
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:43,744
Willing to get into

826
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:44,768
Some kind of flake

827
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:46,304
You're really into DIYs

828
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,072
My things is the way

829
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:51,680
Again I would encourage you to look for Bluetooth and Wi-Fi so

830
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:56,032
Solutions you actually don't have to go Z-Wave anymore there are even Bluetooth

831
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:57,568
WiFi locks out there

832
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:59,616
There are plenty of light switches

833
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,968
Yeah it depends money on what you're trying to make smart

834
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,064
Take a look and see what options that device or devices have

835
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:13,952
If they're just Z-Wave okay you need your Z-Wave Hub but if there are options for Bluetooth or Wi-Fi for the same product

836
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:17,280
I consider those we talked about this quite a bit in the last few months

837
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:20,096
It seems like the industry is just simplifying and going with

838
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:22,656
Consolidated WiFi and Bluetooth

839
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:24,448
Solution in the smartphone these days

840
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:27,008
And if you decide that

841
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:29,312
I don't need Z-Wave but I really want to be

842
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:31,360
You could get the Amazon Echo Plus

843
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:32,640
Is a slightly easier

844
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,408
User experience

845
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:35,712
But that will work with every single zigbee

846
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:37,248
Their self

847
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:40,064
Just bare all that in mind

848
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:43,136
All right

849
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:44,672

850
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:45,440

This is a Wi-Fi dimmer

881
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:33,056
It's lovely

Who is VP of marketing at the Bluetooth

887
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:44,064
He'll be talking about Bluetooth new location

888
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:44,832
Auction Services

889
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:46,368
What happened to Beacon

890
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:47,904
+ 4

891
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:54,816
Hey everyone we are taking a quick break from The Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor this week sponsor

892
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:56,864
Where is database provider Farrakhan

893
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,912
And we have Aldo

894
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:03,008
Who is here to talk to us about fear comes New sitri Edge

895
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:03,776
Database

896
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:06,080
Has developed

897
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:09,664
What about the cloud what role does it have fridge

898
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,456
Computing and how can a database

899
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:16,832
Are they called is absolutely critical for IRT looking for a complication there's no question about it

900
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:19,136
Especially because of the incredible amount of

901
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:20,160
Rasta pasta

902
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:22,720
See you in a little sister to eat at the club brings to the table

903
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:24,512
However some of the limitations

904
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:26,816
The cloud has they might be a problem price

905
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:32,960
Typical Cloud latency like hundreds of milliseconds are way too high if you're trying to

906
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:36,032
Control somehow they destroy multi million dollar equipment

907
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:42,176
Imagine that some critical sensors has been triggered and indicate an obstruction that made damage your machine that you have about 10

908
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:43,200
20 milliseconds

909
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:47,040
Stop the machine is going to be done with the cloud as part of the critical path

910
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:51,648
Has a much better alternative is to make sure you have all this data readily available on the edge

911
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:52,416
Write beside them

912
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:53,696
Machines or tricycle

913
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:55,744
So that's what I database really makes a difference

914
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:59,072
And how does that help in Edge application developer

915
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:03,424
Application your add application needs to be able to read the state as fact

916
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,752
Responsible with minimum layers in between application of the date itself

917
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:09,056
Making sure you guarantee that the state is also

918
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:11,872
Properly persisted is critical for a later on

919
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,176
Trinity mitigate root causes

920
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:16,736
And last but not least

921
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:20,064
Keeping the sequence of events like a typical transactional system

922
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,624
Will help you to understand the events that triggered

923
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,696
This place is all features of what

924
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:27,744
Provide and they're all covered by

925
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,304
Excellent so can you explain house

926
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,328
Sitri Edge helps

927
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:33,632
Customers to address all of these concerns

928
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:38,752
Sure design with this requirements in mind let's talk about throughput

929
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:41,568
Ultra-fast keto store

930
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:42,592
Facebook application

931
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:43,872
Just acquired it

932
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:47,712
With all typical extra leaders that the SQL database is usually introduced

933
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:52,576
Complex SQL relational queries are necessary Friday Saturday.

934
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:56,160
Example of using all the power of Iquitos for Engine 2

935
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,184
Sports Wheels

936
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:59,232
Another good point is the guarantee of

937
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:00,256
Persistence intrinsic

938
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:03,840
Did you add score engine is a full transactional database

939
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:05,632
Starting acid compliance

940
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:09,984
Relieving application from concerns like making sure that it is properly written to the Discord

941
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:12,800
Autosource can rely on database

942
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:13,824
Did you know for sure that they

943
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,848
Historical data

944
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:15,872
Fatty past events

945
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:21,760
Automatically to remote location like the cloud

946
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:26,624
It's not important feature that you can provide and do it for you without the need to develop

947
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,648
Application that does that

948
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,440
About last week

949
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:32,768
Situations highly secured with 256 AES encryption

950
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:33,536
Finally

951
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:36,608
Also provides multicollinearity microservices

952
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:40,704
That makes integration with your application much easier like providing an embedded

953
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,496
Sympathy broker as part of the solution

954
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:45,568
So where can our listeners find out more information

955
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:46,848
About Fair Combs

956
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:48,128
Sitri Edge database

957
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:50,432
What we just published a great video

958
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:52,736
Xiaomi

959
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:55,808
Simple running on a Raspberry Pi that collects data

960
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:57,088
Sensors in real time

961
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:59,648
Persistent data you can check it out in our website

962
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:00,928
It's available pets track home

963
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:02,720
Dot-com IV

964
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:15,008
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host

965
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:17,568
Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest is

966
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:18,848
Ken kolderup

967
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:21,408
Who is VP of marketing at the Bluetooth

968
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:23,456
Hi Ken how are you doing

969
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:25,248
I am doing very well

970
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,784
Thank you for having me on the show

971
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,832
We are glad to have you

972
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:30,624
Because Bluetooth is

973
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,648
I'm going to go with

974
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:32,416
Pretty important

975
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:33,696
For The Internet of Things

976
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:34,464
And

977
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,048
There's a lot going on with Bluetooth about a year-and-a-half ago you launched

978
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:39,072
Bluetooth mesh

979
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:42,656
Which will cover I'm sure but this week you actually just launched

980
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:45,984
A new capability which is better location

981
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:48,800
Can you tell us a little bit about that

982
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:54,688
Yell the last couple years that you mentioned we've been introducing than the community really is the one who does all the work here

983
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:55,712
Adding up

984
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:56,992
Capabilities Bluetooth

985
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:58,016
To help out in

986
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:02,368
Either opening up new opportunities or trying to do a better job and some of the

987
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:03,136
Aries

988
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:05,184
She's already plays

989
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,000
Five longer range connection

990
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:09,280
Kaspersky connection

991
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:14,656
And so now the community actually just this next week is going to be adding a new capability called

992
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:15,424
Directions

993
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,448
What's fractions

994
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:19,520
At a very high level this is a new feature

995
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:22,592
That will enable one Bluetooth device to determine the direction

996
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:23,616
Another Bluetooth

997
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:24,384
Device

998
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,176
Aura lightning

999
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:27,456
I only belay

1000
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:32,576
Bluetooth receiver to be able to determine the direction of a signal is coming from

1001
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:36,416
So very simple concept

1002
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:38,208
Direction of a Bluetooth

1003
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,488
The reason

1004
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:42,560
This is so important than Kathy applications of this is

1005
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:45,888
The members really added this capability to help out in this hole

1006
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:46,912
Location

1007
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:50,752
Services

1008
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:52,032
3-4 years

1009
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:55,872
What's going on here is it today

1010
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:58,688
Bluetooth location services everything from

1011
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:01,760
He's going to consumer-level item finding products like those

1012
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:04,832
Tiles and trackers is little personal asset tags

1013
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:11,232
Your wallet or things like that so either those kind of more Simple consumer-level Solutions

1014
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:15,584
Sophisticated enterprise-level real-time locating systems that are used

1015
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:19,680
People looking kind of locations like hospitals

1016
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:22,752
All of them

1017
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:23,520
Simple

1018
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:25,824
Building block with Bluetooth

1019
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:26,592
2

1020
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:27,616
Bluetooth devices

1021
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:33,760
Really understand when they're in range of each other and then to use signal strength measurement

1022
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:37,088
Between them so that little basic capabilities

1023
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:37,856
Powering

1024
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:41,184
This whole location services Market which is expected to go to

1025
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,720
400 million

1026
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:43,744
Unity

1027
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:44,768
Couple of years

1028
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:51,424
So basically this is the equivalent of standing in a crowded room and shouting here I am here I am and someone else

1029
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,704
Beijing how far you are

1030
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,472
I'm basically

1031
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:55,264
Sounds like she's about

1032
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,288
20 feet away

1033
00:35:56,544 --> 00:36:02,688
That's right so it's we use and Bluetooth using signal strength you how loud do I hear you two then estimate

1034
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,736
How far away you are

1035
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:09,344
But now imagine if my smartphone can only use

1036
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,112
Signal

1037
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:14,976
Francs to determine the distance to another device

1038
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:19,328
So now that I have my smartphone couldn't tell me how far away it is

1039
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:20,864
Point me in the right direction

1040
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:28,544
Agreed so when were talking about Direction this means like I'm going north or south

1041
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,336
The writer left her how does that work

1042
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:37,760
The directions to go back to that analogy you yelling and be trying to hear you not only could I kind of

1043
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:39,808
Justify how loud I hear

1044
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:42,112
Or you can get to me how far away

1045
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:45,440
Now I can actually determine which direction you are in

1046
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:50,816
It's not north south east kind of direction or coordinate they can just

1047
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:51,840
Understand

1048
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:53,376
Where that signal is coming from

1049
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,424
The boys out of your mouth

1050
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,728
Understand where it is Miss Kay's Bluetooth

1051
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,776
A Bluetooth receiver

1052
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:00,800
Can understand

1053
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:01,824
In which direction

1054
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,872
A Bluetooth transmitter happens to be

1055
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:07,968
360° around you wherever it might happen to be a

1056
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:11,808
Okay and so if I'm a developer and I'm building an application

1057
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:12,576
And I wants to take

1058
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:13,344
Take advantage of this

1059
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:16,160
How would I Implement that for the end

1060
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:17,696
Consumer what does that mean

1061
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:20,512
Oliver's building and then people who are with their building

1062
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:25,632
But in this one

1063
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:27,168
Is more consumer anyone

1064
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:29,728
This one requires a handset guys

1065
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:31,520
To add this capability

1066
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:36,384
Things I need to do including

1067
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,944
The addition of an antenna array inside the devices

1068
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:44,832
So that may take some time but once that's done I would presume that the hazard vendor in

1069
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:46,368
Coordination with their

1070
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:47,392
Other suppliers

1071
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:53,792
Within surface apis to the developer community that would be able to then yes the information

1072
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:55,072
From the Bluetooth radios

1073
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:57,376
In order to estimate determine signal Direction

1074
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:59,424
And then that could be built into berries

1075
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,728
Stations like this item finding one we talked about

1076
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:06,848
So this is the application you expect to develop first or is this the other more

1077
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:08,128
Consumer-friendly

1078
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:08,896
A different one

1079
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:14,016
Yeah anytime a new capability and it

1080
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:16,320
Necessary for the handset vendors include

1081
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:17,344
Yeah that takes time

1082
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,392
Cycles that are involved

1083
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:21,440
There is another

1084
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:26,048
Kia Rio location services where I think we might start seeing Direction finding included

1085
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:30,144
Sooner and that's in those more sophisticated Solutions I mentioned earlier those

1086
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:36,544
Enterprise level real-time locating systems like asset tracking and things like that

1087
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:42,944
They use that same basic building block we talked about earlier with two devices understanding range and signal strength measurements

1088
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,992
Distance between

1089
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:46,016
There are number of

1090
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:48,832
Bluetooth locator devices that are deployed

1091
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:50,368
Young six locations throughout

1092
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:52,416
Building in those locators are

1093
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:54,464
Constantly listening for

1094
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,232
Your Bluetooth

1095
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:56,768
Tags or tabs

1096
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:58,048
Mobile

1097
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:59,584
Are people with him

1098
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,632
In a system is tracking allegations of

1099
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:05,728
Ethos locators is also

1100
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:08,544
Reporting back to a central server all the time

1101
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:10,336
As well as

1102
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:11,872
Signal strength

1103
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:15,712
Distance from the locator to each of the tags attic

1104
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:18,784
And using that data from all the locators

1105
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:20,576
Calculator

1106
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:23,904
Exactly the physical location of any tags

1107
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:25,184
Three or more locators

1108
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,512
And today using that kind of technique

1109
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:29,792
We just talked about

1110
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:31,840
These systems are able to

1111
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:35,424
Determine the location of something with so-called meter level a

1112
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:38,240
They can figure it out right here within kind of

1113
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:40,288
12102 penny

1114
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,664
Now he's locators can Donnelly report back

1115
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,504
After the server the signal strength coming from the tags that also the directions

1116
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:54,112
So not only do I hear it at a certain level

1117
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:55,392
And by

1118
00:39:55,648 --> 00:40:00,256
Reporting back all that additional information to server can out romantically improve his

1119
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:01,536
Accuracy of determining

1120
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:03,072
Where something is going from

1121
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:05,120
Meter level of Acura

1122
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:08,960
Required for the deployment

1123
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:10,240
Saudi systems

1124
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:11,264
Where the hands is not

1125
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,544
Necessarily

1126
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,824
It just locators

1127
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:18,944
Things like that that's what I think you'll start to see this direction finding feature

1128
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,528
Brats first and that's there's actually you commercial

1129
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:23,552
Bluetooth Bass

1130
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:27,904
Systems today that are doing it they're just doing it with a free-standing implementation.

1131
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,952
Direction finding capability

1132
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:32,256
That's why I think you'll be coming

1133
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:36,864
I think some of those folks maybe you upgrading their existing systems to now.

1134
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,144
True standard

1135
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:41,728
Got it so you said within centimeter accuracy

1136
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:47,616
Pretty impressive and then also does have a sense of up-and-down so if I'm in a multi-story building

1137
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:48,640
Can I find things

1138
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:49,408
That way

1139
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:50,432
Right now

1140
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:55,552
If it's required and there are vendors out there they're doing

1141
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:57,856
Deposition something in real time

1142
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:59,904
Within 10 to 20 cm

1143
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:00,928
So

1144
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:01,952
The really really

1145
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:13,472
And yeah the nice thing about this

1146
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:19,872
Multiple locators all getting a signal

1147
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:20,896
Elevation as well

1148
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:21,920
Okay

1149
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:23,712
So when should we start seeing it

1150
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:24,736
You say soon

1151
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:29,088
Now that the standard is out there when will we start seeing this an Enterprise application

1152
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,648
And then when will we see it maybe in consumer

1153
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:33,696
And yes the handset Cycles will matter

1154
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:36,768
That's right

1155
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:38,560
Certainly this year I think we'd expect

1156
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:39,584
See some of those

1157
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,632
Existing systems upgrade

1158
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:45,728
Standard and potentially some of the others are in the space adding this capability

1159
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:48,800
Consumer level applications that require

1160
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:54,943
Yachts always hard for us to give guidance there that really is up to us a few players out there and we

1161
00:41:57,503 --> 00:41:58,527
These capabilities

1162
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:00,063
Maybe this time next year

1163
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,599
Sing some stuff come to Market

1164
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:04,159
It looks talk about some of the news you guys

1165
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:05,695
Disgust at CES

1166
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:06,975
Which was profile

1167
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:10,303
And you know if I can take folks back down memory lane

1168
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:11,583
Bluetooth

1169
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:12,863
Has been around for a long time

1170
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:16,703
But historically it's been I say historically cuz I'm old

1171
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:19,519
It was focused on audio and

1172
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,823
Being able to transmit yunnan

1173
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:22,847
Audio to EUR

1174
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:24,127
Speaker to Bluetooth

1175
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:25,919
Speaker audio to your headphones

1176
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:27,967
And now we're really

1177
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:29,247
Taking something

1178
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:30,271
Deped

1179
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:31,551
Pretty narrow focus in

1180
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:32,831
And turning it into something that is

1181
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:34,111
Really applicable

1182
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:35,391
For everything from you.

1183
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:36,671
Sensor readings

1184
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:38,719
All the way up to location

1185
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:40,511
Even things like old light bulbs

1186
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:41,279
So

1187
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:42,303
Talk to me about

1188
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:44,607
Come to the journey that Bluetooth has made

1189
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:45,631
In the concession

1190
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:46,655
The shake is trying to

1191
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:48,191
Tries to

1192
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:49,727
Build out these use cases

1193
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:50,495
Which is better

1194
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:51,519
Usually buried

1195
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:52,799
That's riding

1196
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:55,615
And I mentioned earlier that you that's one thing it's always

1197
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:56,383
Impress me about

1198
00:42:57,407 --> 00:43:01,247
Community as it doesn't stand still it's the community's continually adding

1199
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:03,039
Can you keep abilities to address

1200
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:03,807
Demarcus

1201
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:05,855
Multiple levels I mean

1202
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:07,135
If you go back far enough

1203
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:08,671
Bluetooth

1204
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:09,439
Classic Radio

1205
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:13,023
Community added a whole new radio

1206
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:18,399
And that wonderful opportunities and another cell

1207
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:24,031
But not only the rails layer but even now that he look at more of the ways that the cookies enabled devices to

1208
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:27,103
Tanisha you mentioned it was all about

1209
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:31,199
A simple point-to-point connections of streaming audio between my handset and speaker

1210
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:34,527
Expanded to broadcast

1211
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:37,343
So allowing one device

1212
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:39,647
Many around it that's what's power the whole

1213
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:40,927
Bluetooth speaker

1214
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:44,767
Talk about it many many use cases for using Bluetooth broadcast

1215
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:46,815
And then

1216
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:51,679
The community added yet another way with mesh Network

1217
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:52,959
So allowing

1218
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:55,263
Tens hundreds thousands

1219
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:58,847
To all be able to communicate to each other in a many-to-many kind of

1220
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:00,383
Apologies

1221
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:05,503
Shirley reliably and with high performance be able to exchange messages

1222
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:10,879
Get to really be a catalyst or an enabler for a lot of

1223
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:13,183
Emerging-markets lifesmart almonds

1224
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:13,951
Building

1225
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:15,487
Will you have that need for

1226
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:16,511
Many many devices

1227
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:17,279
To be able to

1228
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:18,559
Securely and reliably able

1229
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:20,863
Eachother one another

1230
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:25,215
One of the markets at this Mesh networking technology was targeted at is

1231
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:28,031
And a lot of progress

1232
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:30,847
That market has evolved a lot over the last

1233
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:31,871
Gears

1234
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,151
If I take a little bit

1235
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:35,711
The back put into different

1236
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:38,527
Connected home and then

1237
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:39,551
Animation

1238
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:41,087
The connected home is where

1239
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:43,903
Lucas is being used to disconnect lots of things in the home

1240
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:46,719
It's kind of stuff you looted to earlier TVs are connected

1241
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:47,999
Soundbars gamebox

1242
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:50,303
Controllers my smartphone is connect

1243
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:51,583
How to test tools

1244
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:54,911
Poise toothbrushes lots of things in the home and there's probably

1245
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:56,191
Half a billion

1246
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:57,727
Just as last year alone in

1247
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:59,519
Marcus and then there's a more

1248
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:01,311
The kind of full home automation

1249
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:02,335
Areaware

1250
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:05,663
Sophisticated Solutions being deployed

1251
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:07,711
Control and automation

1252
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:08,479
Home

1253
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:10,527
Lighting heating cooling

1254
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:11,295
Security

1255
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:15,647
And things like that and that's the one that is

1256
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:18,975
Almost a hundred billion units is last year in that area

1257
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:21,023
But it's one that I decided to see a lot of Prague

1258
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:23,071
We made

1259
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:24,863
Couple of years we've seen

1260
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:27,935
You lie for me it's been good to see the big Tech players

1261
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:29,215
You're stepping in hearing

1262
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:32,287
Providing tubs next order to some of the chaos

1263
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:34,079
In this market for a while

1264
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:36,383
The Google and Amazon domestically

1265
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:38,175
Alibaba and xiaomi friends

1266
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:39,455
China

1267
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:43,039
Chinese companies are really coming in and then they have the wherewithal to really

1268
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:46,623
Hold things together to create large enough ecosystems to attract

1269
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:49,183
The developer community and to deliver truly

1270
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:50,719
Italian experiences

1271
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:51,999
And things like that

1272
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:53,535
And we've been excited that

1273
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:59,935
About that happening cuz I think it's going to represent the next Crow and we've had several these big ecosystems now make

1274
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:01,727
Strategic

1275
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:02,751
Decision to

1276
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:05,311
Select Bluetooth and specifically Bluetooth match

1277
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:08,127
Protocol for their overall

1278
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:08,895
Smart Home

1279
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:09,663
Strategy

1280
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:14,527
The number of products

1281
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:17,855
Little booties matter

1282
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:18,623
6 months

1283
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:20,927
If 6 month since we lost

1284
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:23,231
Spectre re30 qualify products

1285
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:24,511
After 12 months it was up to

1286
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:25,279
60

1287
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:26,559
After 18 months

1288
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:28,863
It was just about a month ago there were over a hundred

1289
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:29,631
20

1290
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:32,191
Does growing really rapidly on this

1291
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:35,519
Doubling up after every 6 months and based on everything I've seen

1292
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:36,543
I think we should expect that

1293
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:37,823
Continue for a while

1294
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:41,407
Alright let's talk about the Enterprise and

1295
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:42,431
Industrial use

1296
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:44,991
I know that there are a variety of

1297
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:46,783
Hub makers and companies from

1298
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:47,807
Khasiyat

1299
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:49,343
We're trying to

1300
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:50,367
Help bring

1301
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:51,391
Make Bluetooth

1302
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:52,415
Is a little bit more

1303
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:54,207
Accessible for Enterprises

1304
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:58,303
How is that going and what are five of the things that those use case

1305
00:46:58,559 --> 00:46:59,071
Need that

1306
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:03,167
Yeah it is just a couple of

1307
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:04,959
Emerging markets for Bluetooth

1308
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:07,007
Really big growth Opera

1309
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:12,127
Enterprise or we just generally referred to as the smart building Market is absolutely

1310
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:12,895
You're one of those

1311
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:15,967
You're right now we're seeing really strong growth on a couple of fronts

1312
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:20,319
Relates to the one we were talking about earlier in this whole area location

1313
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:21,599
And services which has been

1314
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:23,135
Your building very well for

1315
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:25,439
Also Bluetooth

1316
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:28,767
So

1317
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:30,815
Large facilities in Enterprises

1318
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:32,351
English shopping malls

1319
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:33,887
Plano systems to

1320
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:36,959
Facilitate visitors navigations routed Airport

1321
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:38,751
Do the same so visitors

1322
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:41,055
Find a way to Gabe's in the manatees routed

1323
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:45,919
Location services

1324
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:48,223
You're the other newer area and smart

1325
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:51,295
Billy has really started with this whole laundromats networking

1326
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:57,695
Want to go in the big bright spot

1327
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:58,463
And

1328
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:00,511
You know what we've been seeing is that

1329
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:02,815
Humana commercial buildings

1330
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:04,607
And I'm making this rapid shift from

1331
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:07,167
Compact fluorescent lighting to LED lighting

1332
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:11,263
At the same time they're doing that they're looking to move to wireless lighting feature

1333
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:13,823
It provides lower-cost

1334
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:14,591
Ability

1335
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:16,639
Next level of sophistication to me

1336
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:19,199
Regulatory requirements things like that

1337
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:20,735
And that has been building

1338
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:27,135
You're very well so you can seen a lot of lighting vendors

1339
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:28,159
Especially over this last

1340
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:28,927
80 months

1341
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:31,743
That whole shift to Car Smart connected lighting

1342
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:34,559
Seems to be a really really good growth area for us right now

1343
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:35,839
Make Bluetooth with matches

1344
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:37,119
Very well positioned

1345
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:40,703
And as Bluetooth evolves I'd love to talk to you

1346
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:41,983
About Beacon

1347
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:43,263
Because they felt

1348
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:44,543
So promising

1349
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:46,079
And then they ended up being

1350
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:47,615
So not from

1351
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:49,663
Sing and yet a lot of the technology

1352
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:50,431
These were talking about

1353
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:53,247
In this conversation are things that we thought we'd do with pica

1354
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:56,575
And now we're basically going to do it

1355
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:58,367
With gateways and other devices

1356
00:48:58,623 --> 00:49:00,159
So can you kind of talk to me about

1357
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:01,695
I guess what happened with beak

1358
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:03,999
Then how that concept has adapt

1359
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:05,535
2 maybe what we hope

1360
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:07,583
Yeah sure I think the

1361
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:09,887
If you take it back far enough this goes back to

1362
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:11,423
What happens with many technology

1363
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:20,639
This community added Bluetooth low energy again one of the things that got introduced with that was the ability to

1364
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:21,919
Broadcast

1365
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:24,479
We talked about the Bluetooth device canal

1366
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:25,503
Broadcast

1367
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:28,831
Messaging messages and any device around you can hear those

1368
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:33,951
And you're the community's been very creative with ways to use and that's what led

1369
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:39,071
If you go with your member a little bit of the progression apples and one that introduced the ivy can protocol

1370
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:39,839
As a means

1371
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:40,863
The kind of figure out how to

1372
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:42,399
Let's use that capability to

1373
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:43,167
Support

1374
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:45,215
Point of Interest information Deacons

1375
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:47,263
Are using broadcast apology to serve

1376
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:48,543
Variety different

1377
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:49,311
Opportunities

1378
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:53,919
A lot of interesting ways to use Bluetooth broadcast one is as a

1379
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:56,479
June support these Point address information

1380
00:49:56,735 --> 00:49:58,783
A lot of

1381
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:01,599
Museums putting these deacons on exhibit

1382
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:03,903
Allow visitors to get more information

1383
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:05,439
Retail environments

1384
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:09,791
Deplane Deacon's on various products and end aisle displays and so4 2

1385
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:11,071
Facilitator

1386
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:12,095
Experience

1387
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:17,215
Bluetooth broadcast capability Servicing

1388
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:21,311
But that broadcast capability Bluetooth for many many different

1389
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:24,639
Thanks so it's actually the fundamental technology behind

1390
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:27,711
So the network are actually using

1391
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:28,479
Broadcast

1392
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:31,295
Telecommunications is a way for them to communicate to each other

1393
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:34,367
Oh I just answering your question yes it is

1394
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:38,719
And this is partly I mean this is as you point out this is technology adapting

1395
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:40,255
This is basically like

1396
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:42,047
Where can I put a capability out there

1397
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:43,839
See how people react to it

1398
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:44,607
What they do with it

1399
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:45,375
So this

1400
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:46,143
This makes sense

1401
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:48,703
Add onto that

1402
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:50,751
You're in another area code so friends

1403
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:59,711
Solutions that use Bluetooth they can choose any different way to communicate

1404
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:00,479
Gateway

1405
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:02,271
They can use a broadcast

1406
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:05,855
Communication is kind of Beacon communication to communicate information

1407
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:07,135
Go back to a gateway

1408
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:11,743
So that's one of the things this developers really like about Bluetooth is this

1409
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:12,767
Flexibility

1410
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:14,559
Not just one way to communicate

1411
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:15,327
Communicate

1412
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:19,167
What connection I can do Dover broadcast connection

1413
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:23,263
Flexible platform

1414
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:25,567
Is the right approach for them

1415
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:28,127
Alright thank you so much again for coming on the show this week

1416
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:29,919
Of course thank you for having me

1417
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:32,223
That's it for this week

1418
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:33,759
Thanks so much for listening
