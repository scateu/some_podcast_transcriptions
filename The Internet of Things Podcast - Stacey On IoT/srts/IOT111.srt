Andy rubin's playground Ventures

00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:42,240
Cut some industrial iot news and we are doubling down

15
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:43,776
From our perspective

16
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:44,544
With

17
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:46,592
Three more people talking about

18
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:48,896
The Echo Show including

19
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:52,992
Jonathan Frankel the CEO of nucleus which kind of just saw its business

20
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:54,016
Take it over

21
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:55,040
Buy the Amazon

22
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:57,344
Fred Meyer

23
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:58,880
We also have

24
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,160
A message from this week

25
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:01,440
Play sponsor Arris

26
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:02,208
And

27
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:04,256
This is a good time to remind everyone

28
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:05,792
Did this week show

29
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:06,816
You need to turn

30
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:12,192
There's just no way around it that we're probably going to say her name

31
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:13,728
Normally we are really polite

32
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:14,496
What is this week

33
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:15,264
Is not going to be that

34
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:18,592
We'll try not to say her name but boil boys can be tough

35
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:19,872
And I'm going to tell you right now

36
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,664
When we get to the gas segment

37
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,688
The guests were not as

38
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:23,712
It just got to me

39
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:24,736
It was too much

40
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:27,296
They were name dropping huh

41
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:28,064
So

42
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:29,600
Take this moment

43
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:32,160
I hit that like button if you got one year

44
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:33,440
Okay

45
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:34,464
So

46
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:36,000
Shall we get started

47
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:37,536
We shall

48
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:38,816
Okay

49
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:40,352
So Kevin and I both

50
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,120
Try.

51
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:42,400
The Echo Show we should

52
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:43,424
But what it is for

53
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:49,568
Well just to clarify we didn't try the Echo Show we tried a feature that comes with Echo Show

54
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:51,360
Because the news is that

55
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:55,200
Amazon launched or introduced the Echo Show device which is a

56
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:56,480
Screen

57
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:58,016
With a speaker and

58
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,552
8 microphones

59
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:04,160
It will cost you $229.99 available black or white

60
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,464
It will be released on June 28th

61
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:12,864
And I should note that if you buy two Echo Show devices you can save $100 with a promo code

62
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,448
Amazon is posting it is show the number two

63
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:17,216
Pack

64
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:22,592
And you might want two of these because it has a new feature which we did try

65
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:25,920
Saying the called she who shall not be named

66
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:26,688
Calling

67
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:27,968
So it's video and voice

68
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:28,736
Calling

69
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:32,064
Yeah that's what it is one thing I think you

70
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,344
Forgot

71
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:34,880
Show which

72
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,160
Probably will make a lot of pee

73
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:37,696
It has a camera

74
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:44,352
It hasn't always on camera in an always-on Mike that actually cannot be turned off physically it has to

75
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,120
2B only

76
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,400
It can only be turned off

77
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,168
Digitally

78
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,728
There's no physical shutter

79
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:50,752
On the camera

80
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:51,776
Interesting

81
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,824
I just threw that in there because

82
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,104
Cuz how would you do me a call

83
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:56,896
Without the video

84
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:02,016
This means we've got we talked about the other one last week but the echo look

85
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,296
Which is the

86
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,856
Hands-free selfie

87
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:11,488
The thing that were like

88
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,768
I ordered one

89
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:15,584
I could I could suddenly feel Washington

90
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:22,240
We tried the calling feature and just so you know everyone now if you have an echo device

91
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:26,080
You update if you update the app you're going to see a brand new app icon

92
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,104
On your phone

93
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:27,872
On your phone

94
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,408
Google Voice cloud

95
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:31,200
And you have the ability to

96
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,736
You should see in your home screen

97
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:35,040
Conversations

98
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:36,320
And

99
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,624
That's going to let you set up the ability to

100
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,416
Use your Echo as a

101
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,440
I people

102
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,256
It doesn't do a video on the phone does it

103
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:49,120
Kevin and I just tried this in a brief interlude here inspired interlude

104
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:53,472
And what we discovered is that you cannot do video from

105
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:56,032
On the phone so this isn't going to compete with you know

106
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:57,568
Skype

107
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:58,336
Order

108
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,104
Hangouts

109
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,384
Duo or FaceTime

110
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,176
At least not yet

111
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:04,224
But what we did discover in

112
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,040
What I thought was kind of interesting as when Kevin called

113
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,320
My echos

114
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:10,112
All of my echos in my house when

115
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,392
Any calls me ring

116
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,952
And my phone rings

117
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:17,280
Now it'll be interesting is if I'm away from home

118
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,327
What happens

119
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,631
Because my husband is also on our Echo

120
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:23,679
And

121
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,983
His number should be associated

122
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,519
It with this device so I'm like

123
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,311
Could he answer my phone calls from

124
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:33,663
That could be a minute is all tied to a phone number because when you set this up

125
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:36,735
You enter the your phone number into the app

126
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,015
And

127
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:42,367
It didn't send you a confirmation code so it ties or links your phone number to your devices

128
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,647
Great butt

129
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:45,439
It also allows you to be in a house

130
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:46,719
So I'm

131
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:48,255
I'm curious

132
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,303
I will try that

133
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:52,863
Be kind of

134
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:53,631
I don't have

135
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,935
My other household member has a job that is not

136
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:02,335
So the question then becomes Kevin

137
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:05,919
You of the Isle of the echo would you buy an echo

138
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:06,687
Did you buy

139
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,247
I did not

140
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:14,367
And the main reason is I think the biggest use case here and there multiple use cases

141
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:16,159
The biggest one is the video

142
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,695
Calling and

143
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:20,767
I have so many devices that already do that

144
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:21,791
Mean yes

145
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:25,119
I would say this is nice from a hands-free perspective

146
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:27,167
But I don't really

147
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:30,239
Again to have that use case I want to do have tablets with

148
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,775
Stan's in things that

149
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,311
In computers

150
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,615
I just don't need another way to make

151
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,151
These kinds of calls

152
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:43,039
However I do like the fact that the screen shows you you know flash briefing videos and

153
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:45,087
Weather and so on just like

154
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:49,183
If you have a Fire TV and use you know use the intelligent assistant

155
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:53,023
You get visuals of what you're asking about so it's kind of nice but

156
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:57,887
For $229 I'm not sure what this replaces for me it's why I didn't buy one

157
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:58,655
Got it

158
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,423
All right

159
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,191
I may send you a

160
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,727
Just for fun

161
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,775
Listen I see

162
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,847
People infected in the marketing video for this

163
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:10,175
They're showing me no moms on the road calling on home

164
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:14,271
Talking to her daughter and the daughters grandfather who are working on a

165
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:17,599
You know school project together so Mom can check in and see

166
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:18,623
How it's all working

167
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,695
I can see people wanting to certain people but

168
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:22,719
Big enough for me

169
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:26,047
I thought the baby monitor like the look in on the babies

170
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:26,815
Was kind of in

171
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:27,583
Interesting

172
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,119
Baby monitor

173
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,655
Because the babies are probably not

174
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,191
Aldo

175
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,983
What if your baby's first word was Alexa

176
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:39,103
What if your baby's name is that

177
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,151
I don't know

178
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:47,551
You right you right because this does like any other equity-based tie into all of the smart home goodies and things that we

179
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,575
Musicals for today

180
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:52,159
So yeah you can turn into if you know the camera

181
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:55,999
Of another show for example I would have imagined

182
00:06:56,511 --> 00:07:00,095
Could I use it to look at a nest camera don't know

183
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,911
It does say that you can shut

184
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:08,031
It says she can show you the front door monitor baby's arm is compatible cameras from ring and Arlo for example

185
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,079
Well I don't know about

186
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,895
Then right but certain things

187
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:13,919
That's exactly

188
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:16,991
So you could have like your own security system

189
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,015
I like it

190
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:22,879
Okay lot of cool stuff Happening Here we will talk more about it in June

191
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:23,647
When you get one

192
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,415
When I get one

193
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:28,255
I did only order one now I'm thinking I should have ordered two

194
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,023
One for me and

195
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,047
One for Kevin

196
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:30,815
But you know

197
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,607
Find a friend on the internet

198
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,679
Are you my friend

199
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,471
Also

200
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:41,823
We should say that Microsoft is planning a home hub function for

201
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,359
Windows 10

202
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,895
Shooters

203
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,943
I'm okay with this even though

204
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:48,479
I feel like the market is

205
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,551
Yeah I mean so this is

206
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:54,111
Returning from The Verge who has

207
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:57,183
Some what they call internal documents that they

208
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,207
Obtained

209
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:02,303
To show how Microsoft's home hub all one word Capital H's

210
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,839
I will work

211
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:04,607
And

212
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,375
It's

213
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:10,751
To the ideas it's going to be a place where you can control your devices

214
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,031
Where you can

215
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:15,103
Collaborate with family on calendars and such

216
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:20,991
I just don't really see it I don't see people using the PC for controlling smart home stuff

217
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:23,807
It's always got to be on you have to be in the home Hub app

218
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,599
I don't know

219
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:26,367
I'm with you

220
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:30,207
The only time I'm in front of a PC or PC like devices when I

221
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,231
Working at my dad

222
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,559
Granite people have laptops

223
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,351
How often

224
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:39,679
Now I open my laptop so rarely when I'm not quoting

225
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:40,959
Creating content

226
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:42,495
Register

227
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:52,223
Yeah for folks who are curious what the tentative plans are according to these documents support for hue

228
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,783
Nest insteon wink and SmartThings

229
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:57,599
Use Cortana of course for voice

230
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,135
Controls and such

231
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,159
I am just

232
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,439
I'm not Jazz but

233
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,023
Also

234
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,583
We have a really interesting

235
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,351
Start up

236
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,119
Coming out

237
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,399
It's called lighthouse

238
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:13,471
It's backed by playground Studios which is the

239
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,263
Adventure fund

240
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,055
But Andy Rubin

241
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:19,359
Of Android and Google Fame started

242
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,383
And also is like

243
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,919
Is he psychic or danger

244
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,711
Danger

245
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:26,015
We've had this conversation before

246
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:30,111
Sorry

247
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:32,671
The lighthouse is a new startup

248
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,975
And what they're building is a personal assistant

249
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,791
That has 3D sensing technology

250
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:43,423
That they built as part of the DARPA Grand Challenge and it lets you accurately distinguish

251
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,447
People

252
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,471
Embarrassed

253
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:46,751
Actions

254
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:50,847
And so what it does is it adds this layer of understanding

255
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,127
Both who's in the room

256
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,687
But then it also has a deep layer of understanding in it

257
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:59,039
So you can tell it very complicated things and it will actually do them

258
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,319
So to make this

259
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,087
Real

260
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:05,183
You can tell it notify be at the babysitter doesn't get home

261
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,207
By 4

262
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:09,535
And think about all the tablet that will impact all this happening

263
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,839
So you just hold in plain English

264
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:13,631
A person that has to write

265
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,703
I'm your set a time so you've done kind of Summer

266
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,239
If this then that programming

267
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:20,543
Location

268
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,567
And location

269
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,895
That's really freaking

270
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:25,663
Powerful

271
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:31,295
Well this is what the promise of a smart home is to me and if they can deliver that's great because

272
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:35,135
Very few devices and platforms are delivering

273
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,671
At this level yet

274
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:43,583
Yes we can take our existing assistance and we can tie our own if this then that recipes and so on to make this happen

275
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:46,143
But this is a native solution

276
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:46,911
And

277
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:47,935
I

278
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:50,751
Suspected will work better but we'll have to see

279
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:53,823
Exactly so but we won't see any time soon

280
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:54,591
Assume

281
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:57,151
This is really expensive

282
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:03,295
This won't be available until September and when it is available

283
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:09,695
Getting a device is going to cost you $400 and that will include one year of the lighthouse intelligence

284
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:10,719
Service

285
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:14,303
Look at that point your intelligence service cost $10

286
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:21,215
Right you could pay more Upfront for 99 to get 3 years of the service with the device

287
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:26,591
599 is an interesting bundle because you get 5 years of the television service

288
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,127
And the device

289
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:30,431
Well it says it renders the device free

290
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,991
Which makes me wonder is the device

291
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,015
599

292
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,319
I feel like the device is probably

293
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,599
399

294
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,391
Or thereabouts

295
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:40,415
I mean

296
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:42,463
That makes sense matter

297
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,487
Exactly

298
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:44,255
The cost of the Dubai

299
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:46,559
Nice cuz like this is one of those things that I actually

300
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:48,351
People may not love this

301
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:52,447
I like how they're trying to get people away from paying for a subscription if they want to pay more upfront

302
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,543
Doing something like this is going to require a lot of constant

303
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,103
Computing and support on the back end

304
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:01,663
So it makes sense that this is going to need

305
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:04,223
Some kind of

306
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,783
Your subscription fee just to help pay short

307
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,575
Absolutely

308
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:11,135
I'm pro-life idea of what they're doing here

309
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,927
Pro having a business model

310
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:17,023
I don't know if consumers are going to be stoked

311
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,815
I'm stoked about this but I'm a creep

312
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:19,839
Chongqing

313
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:23,935
So I don't know if real consumers are going to be stoked about this when

314
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:27,519
Make something like the echo is out there doing crazy things

315
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:28,799
True

316
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,079
Truing and you have

317
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:36,479
Developers that are climbing onto these different platforms that are readily available mainstream people have and they're always knew

318
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:39,039
Skills coming out a new intelligence and so on

319
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,831
One thing that might

320
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,111
Appeal to

321
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:44,671
People fought for the lighthouse device

322
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,207
They say that

323
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:52,863
Lighthouse customers data is only viewable by the customers themselves and never by Lighthouse employees or part

324
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:55,423
That's a big deal

325
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:56,959
Oh so you can pay for

326
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:57,727
For privacy

327
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,519
Which in a sentence

328
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:00,543
Is something

329
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:01,567
Is a thing

330
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,151
Yeah you know if you know what I see I see something like this getting

331
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,479
Is something like this would make home

332
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:09,503
Just

333
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,783
Miles better

334
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:13,599
Miles in apple already understands this they brought

335
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,623
What about the guys

336
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,391
Define Siri

337
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,439
IC

338
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,719
That's illogical

339
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,791
That's all right because I I don't see it actually

340
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:29,727
Speaking of Apple Apple

341
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,519
If I accompany called

342
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,055
Barrett

343
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,383
Didn't see that one coming

344
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,199
I've never tried a bit it although I have I have

345
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,223
Graze

346
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,343
Browse thank you

347
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:49,439
I think what scared you away from

348
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,463
Bet it is

349
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:53,023
The technology that uses because you can't say it

350
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,047
Oh Kevin

351
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,583
Go for it I'll give you 10 points

352
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:58,399
Ballistocardiography

353
00:13:59,167 --> 00:13:59,679
10 points

354
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:00,447
Kevin

355
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:03,007
Yeah at the end of the show you'll have

356
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,055
I'll give you a trinket

357
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,591
Sure

358
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:10,175
Yes words are meaningless but I'm winning

359
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:12,479
Gamify all the things

360
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,527
What is ballistocardiography

361
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:17,087
Well I better get more points than 10

362
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:23,487
So it measures the mechanical activity of your heart lungs and other body functions which shall not go into detail what does MyPay

363
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:25,535
Because I've no idea

364
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,327
It's actually

365
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,095
Along

366
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:28,863
Sensory thing

367
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,167
That you place under your mattress and it measures your

368
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:34,495
I'm very intrigued by this device but I've never been

369
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:42,175
So Apple bought it at this will be amazing

370
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,711
Data for

371
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:44,735
Okay

372
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:49,087
We don't always hear a lot about healthkit but you know the people I talk to you for using it

373
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:55,487
Researchers medical folks it's a very credible platform so having kind of granular sleep data

374
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,511
Makes me feel like

375
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:58,815
This could really adalah

376
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:02,399
Makes me think that that is if you want

377
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:06,495
Really good sleep center might be the way to go cuz I'm assuming Apple that at all the other company

378
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:10,079
I can't I could see one other function that Apple would use

379
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:18,015
So every time they announce the new iPhone I have to get up at 3 in the morning to order it because that's when they order stuff on sale and Lease

380
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:18,783
Coso

381
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,831
Just a little alarm

382
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,135
Little little nudge for your bed

383
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:27,487
They work you that

384
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,023
Say that means by it

385
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:29,791
Yeah

386
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:33,375
Yeah that way there's no alarm feature vibraciones just a sensor

387
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,423
That's awesome

388
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:41,823
All right we also have this is kind of exclusive to us so we'll talk about it company that I followed for years

389
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,359
It's called you know me

390
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,663
Yonomi

391
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,943
And there

392
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:51,295
Consumers you can download it it connects to all kinds of things and

393
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,599
Establishes what it calls routines with

394
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:56,415
If this thing called applets or other companies called robots

395
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:59,231
But the idea is an in they do it automatic

396
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:04,095
So what they've done is they've created a product called that you know me thin cloud

397
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,631
In this isn't for consumer

398
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,655
This is for

399
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,703
Manufacturers of

400
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,519
Connected devices especially those working in the smartphone

401
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:13,567
The first customer is Schlage

402
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:14,335
DJ Norm

403
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:18,943
Complete so you know me think loud is basically a way to

404
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,991
Get your devices online

405
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:23,295
Connect them manage them

406
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:27,903
Do all of that but it's it's very thin they're using the AWS

407
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,439
Lambda functions

408
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:32,511
So there's a couple key things here that you need to know

409
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:33,791
1

410
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:34,559
Is

411
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,327
That

412
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:36,863
A manufacturer

413
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:37,887
By this

414
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,679
Once so

415
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:45,823
They don't have to pay yonomi on an ongoing basis adding to their own ongoing cost

416
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:46,591
4

417
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:48,639
Turn off all the provisioning and fun stuff

418
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:52,223
But there they will have to pay for the AWS cost

419
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,759
So there is still an ongoing

420
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:55,551
Right but

421
00:16:55,807 --> 00:17:00,415
This is where we get into this concept of server list and I feel bad that I haven't talked to you guys about this

422
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:03,743
4 because it's actually a really big deal for iot

423
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:05,535
From an economic stance

424
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,815
Disappear With Me

425
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,119
Because later on we're going to come back to Target

426
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,399
Take a shower

427
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:12,959
Serverless computing

428
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:16,287
Things like AWS Lambda Google functions

429
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:20,383
The Computing instance only spins up when it's needed

430
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:24,735
Really important for iot because a lot of times you don't have like a constant

431
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:26,527
Compute job you have a sensor that wakes up and is like

432
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:27,551
Oh my God

433
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:30,111
Quickteller home hub my door is open

434
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,135
Is it a ghost

435
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:33,951
So if you had a server running all the time for that

436
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:36,511
That would be just disliked ongoing tiny little cost

437
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:39,071
But if you want you serverless computing

438
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,607
It wakes up

439
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:45,727
Perform that function charges you only for that function and then goes back to when it goes back to sleep

440
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,007
It's been Stout

441
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:52,127
So that's the concept we're talking about here so serverless Computing is really important for iot

442
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:54,431
Because it keeps your cost

443
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:55,967
Only when you use it

444
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:58,015
And I know that's what everyone told you about

445
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,039
Cloud computing

446
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:00,319
But that's not actually true

447
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:03,647
What is becoming true now

448
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:05,183
The way this approaches

449
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:05,951
Yes

450
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:07,999
And it's not the right approach for every

451
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:09,279
It new

452
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:11,839
But Netflix isn't going to use this

453
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:16,447
It's a really big deal for iot so now you guys have this

454
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,983
Amazingly nerdy

455
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:21,055
Party talk that will actually make people run away from you

456
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,335
So maybe picture

457
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:24,127
But in your management meetings

458
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:29,759
So what you know me does is they've built their platform for

459
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:32,575
Another server list kind of function Basecamp

460
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:34,367
And they did this to help

461
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,391
Cut costs again

462
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:36,671
So

463
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:38,719
What we've got with a Janome send

464
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:43,071
Is software the manufacturer buys once a one-time cost

465
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:45,631
Can pay for you no service another

466
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,399
Other things

467
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,423
If you want but you don't have

468
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:49,215
And then you've got the

469
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:52,543
Most as-needed function of AWS run

470
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:55,871
Basically you can run a smart

471
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:56,639
Hallmark

472
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,919
Connected device

473
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:00,991
Basically you can run a connected device

474
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,015
With

475
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:02,783
Minimal

476
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:03,551
Overhead

477
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:04,831
And that's what's so cool

478
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,879
That's what Schlage is excited about

479
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:10,207
That's what other customers they have are excited about so

480
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:12,511
I don't know I think this is really into

481
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:17,119
I agree it's it's far more efficient and specifically tailored to

482
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,167
The iot industry because as we

483
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:19,935
Just said

484
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:21,727
These devices aren't

485
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:22,495
Requiring

486
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:23,263
Qtime

487
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:25,567
All the time and so why pay for it

488
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,871
And why not make it more efficient so that

489
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:30,431
Computations take place as needed on demand

490
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:32,991
So yes the other things I should say

491
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,271
Because this is really important

492
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,295
If you're building this stuff

493
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,063
Is

494
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:38,111
When you buy the license to the thin called

495
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,135
You get the source code

496
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,415
So

497
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:42,207
You're not locked into it you

498
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:46,559
And that's a big deal because I have talked to many

499
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:49,631
Connected device companies who've gone with a

500
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:50,655
A cloud provider

501
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,447
Maven like

502
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:56,543
Crap we want to change our luck in this sucks

503
00:19:57,055 --> 00:20:03,199
And that also is a benefit if a service provider for some reason goes out of business but not that I'm saying

504
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:06,783
You know me would or whatever but we talked about this

505
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:12,159
We talked about this in the past what happens to the the customers you know at that point well somebody can

506
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:14,463
Take up the torch and continued on with

507
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:16,511
Because they already have the code and they can

508
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:19,839
Obviously as you said tweakin to customizer do whatever they need

509
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:22,143
But still I think that adds a level of

510
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,935
Insecurities not not

511
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:24,703
The typical

512
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:28,799
Definition security not like device in data security but security that this

513
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:30,079
Service will be

514
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:31,359
Around for a long time

515
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:32,639
Exactly

516
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:33,663
So

517
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:39,551
Retrieving into kind of some industrial stuff I've got one more industrial news bit for us before we move onto our guest

518
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:41,855
Plural plural

519
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:45,183
Also for people who are building as opposed to just buying

520
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,463
Connected devices

521
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:48,767
CB insights the

522
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:50,303
Oh how do I describe them

523
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,839
They do Venture Capital data

524
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:52,863
They

525
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,655
Earlier this month put out

526
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:56,703
The industrial iot stack

527
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:58,239
Where they looked at

528
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:01,311
What it takes to build the industrial iot

529
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:04,895
They highlighted 125 startups transforming

530
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:09,503
All kinds all aspects of the industrial iot I can see that they forgotten some they

531
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:11,039
Put some on there that I'm like what

532
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:13,343
Their stack is really interesting

533
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:15,391
Because they break it down into sensors and connect

534
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:18,208
Edge device isn't connected

535
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:18,976
Objects

536
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:22,304
Universal platforms and Edge intelligence

537
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:27,680
Applied sensor networks which are very vertical specific so thank boiling glass

538
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,216
Cleat

539
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:32,032
And then Advanced analytics protection

540
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:34,080
Which I'm kinda like everything else

541
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:37,664
If I think about the way that business is going

542
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:40,736
Feel like a sensors and connectivity side

543
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:42,272
Are going to be pretty high leak

544
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,320
I would agree

545
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:46,112
Now some of the companies here

546
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:48,160
They've got sigfox Center

547
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:50,720
Engineer those are all connectivity side that got

548
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:54,048
In the censors of monitoring side they have companies like electric and power

549
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:58,144
What I see those companies doing is actually going all the way up to the

550
00:21:59,168 --> 00:21:59,680
The topper

551
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:01,728
The analytics and Security Site

552
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:02,496
Height of the stack

553
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:03,520
So

554
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:07,872
When I look at this I disagree a little with the order but I see a lot more movement between the

555
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:09,152
Companies in these classify

556
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:12,992
Locations in the show notes you come look at it

557
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:16,832
I'm also going to include this in the newsletter on Friday so you

558
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:18,368
You can spend even more time with it

559
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,392
If you want

560
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:20,672
And

561
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:22,720
I'm glad that someone did this because

562
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:24,768
You don't even I sit there and try to

563
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:25,536
Create a stack

564
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:31,424
Industrial Computing iot industrial iot and I'm like

565
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:32,448
I give up

566
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:34,496
And it's hard

567
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:40,384
So it is hard I didn't even noticed they say while some companies may fit into multiple categories and parts of the stack

568
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,968
Weedmaps companies based on their primary use case of these sort of

569
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:45,504
I think I agree with what you're saying

570
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:49,344
A tendency right this is a challenge this is not to

571
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,368
And there's no

572
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:51,648
Correct answer here

573
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:52,672
To build a stack

574
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:55,488
But looking at this

575
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:58,304
There's like over 700 Industrial iot

576
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:05,472
This really reach we talked about this but the newly-launched platform Edge X found

577
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,288
That the Linux Foundation is doing

578
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:10,080
And we had a guest from dalian

579
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:11,360
Police are talking about

580
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:12,640
This is

581
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:14,176
Part of why that

582
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:16,224
Because they want to take

583
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:19,552
Some of these companies and push them together and then let

584
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,088
Push them together

585
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:24,928
Let them linked together without having to write individual

586
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:29,024
That's the Technic

587
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:29,792
Pickle side happen

588
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:32,864
They're just pushing them together

589
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:39,008
And then let people really focus on some of this exterior stuff so they're trying to come out if I the stuff in the middle

590
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:41,824
So not just sensors and connectivity but

591
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,616
Just at middleware where you just

592
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:44,384
Connecting

593
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,248
With that

594
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,016
Let's

595
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:51,808
Take a momentary break

596
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:53,344
Get into

597
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,648
Guess this week which

598
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,928
Are Michael Wolff

599
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:57,952
Jonathan Frankel

600
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:00,256
The CEO of nucleus

601
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:06,656
Mark Rolston the head of argodesign

602
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:12,288
For a message from this week's sponsor this week sponsor is Eris and we have

603
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:17,664
Z Hussain who is the CTO and founder of eras here to talk to us today

604
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,456
Let's get started with an easy one

605
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:20,736
What is Eros

606
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:27,136
This is a company that was founded on the premise that people needed to get remote information

607
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:31,232
From equipment and devices and applications out in the field

608
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:33,536
Process them and take some business action

609
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:38,144
That's what we've been doing for the past 20 plus years providing these kinds of services for our

610
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,424
Enterprise customers

611
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,472
Why should a company think

612
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:42,496
About implementing

613
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:46,848
One of the first things I tell people is to understand

614
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:52,480
Exactly what the outcome is that they looking for from a business perspective meaning

615
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:54,272
Is there some basic

616
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:58,112
Cost advantage that they get by implementing an iot solution

617
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:02,976
What is there some kind of enhanced Revenue that they will generate because they've implemented in Iowa

618
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:06,560
Lucia having said that there may be other drivers as well.

619
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:09,632
Create the need for deployment IRP application

620
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:13,216
For example if a utility company wants to do

621
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:17,056
Time of day billing and they have to measure and take him

622
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:23,456
Information from the electric utility meters and that creates the requirements of the opportunity for implementing and iot

623
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,992
Solution even though it's in perhaps

624
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:26,272
Santander Consumer

625
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:27,296
Meter reading app

626
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:29,856
That sounds great so what does it take to

627
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:31,392
To implement some sort of Iota

628
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:33,952
They need to understand what

629
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:39,072
Data Vinnie together what control functions they might need what business action are they

630
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:41,376
Going to take on receiving that data

631
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:45,728
What are the worst things you can do is gather data for the sake of gathering data and create

632
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:50,080
But I will call Haystacks of unimportant data that actually has no

633
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:56,224
Relevance to what they're the problem is that they're trying to solve any to understand exactly what it takes to get that data

634
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,760
And what day does it need now

635
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:00,320
Transport of that data if it's a remote

636
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:06,720
Device is very very important how do they need to get that data back to their facility where is the device locate

637
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:13,120
Then they need to go beyond the conductivity portion of it I understand where they're going to store the data how reliable is that storage

638
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:19,776
Do they need to perform an analysis of that data so what areas does is when these companies are look

639
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:26,176
Looking for a iot Solutions Paris provides them guidance right from the start as to what their solution is

640
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:26,944
Things to look like

641
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,808
And then once the Enterprise has made a decision that they needed to play an application

642
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:36,416
We provide them the network transport from the cellular device at my PR

643
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:42,048
Filled all the way to the cellular system where there's within the United States or overseas internationally

644
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:45,632
And provides a data to them in a in a massage Orem

645
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:48,192
That they are expecting to see

646
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:50,496
Where can I find out more

647
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:51,776
About what heiresses

648
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:56,640
We want to find out more about iot Solutions and how to deploy

649
00:26:56,896 --> 00:27:02,272
And iot solution for their particular problem I would highly recommend that it download a copy of the

650
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:05,344
Free ebook that I have published it's available on our website

651
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,136
Www. Eres

652
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,160
Atrrs

653
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:08,928
Dot-com

654
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:12,768
We can also listen to a copy of this podcast another podcast app

655
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:19,168
Www.arris.com podcast

656
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:25,568
We're doing something a little bit different this week on the guest portion of the show because we are

657
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:27,616
So excited about the Amazon Echo Show

658
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:30,688
I got a few people to talk about what they think this means

659
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:31,456
So

660
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:34,016
My first guess this week is Mike Wolfe

661
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,320
Who is a smart home analyst

662
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:38,624
And who has his own site called

663
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,392
The spoon

664
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:41,440
Where he covers smart kitchen stuff

665
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:43,488
It's not as the spoon. Tech

666
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,280
If you're really lucky

667
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:48,096
You'll be in Seattle for a smart

668
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:49,120
Kitchen Summit

669
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:50,400
So

670
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:51,168
Mike

671
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,704
Amazon

672
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,472
Show

673
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:55,008
What do you think

674
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:56,800
Well

675
00:27:57,056 --> 00:28:00,128
It came so fast after the walk it's like the looking show

676
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,432
Was in what two weeks in a row

677
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:05,248
But I'm not surprised because I wrote a piece I think early

678
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:06,528
About 2 months ago saying

679
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:07,552
Amazon

680
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:10,368
As a whole bunch of connected Home Hardware coming this year

681
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:13,696
I'm Thor's I've been hearing out of the Doppler side of things

682
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:16,768
And I just out of out of Amazon for my sources is

683
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,304
They're not done

684
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:21,120
After what they showed up that with Echo with a.

685
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:21,888
So

686
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:23,680
I think they're just going all-in on this thing

687
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:25,472
What do you think about Amazon

688
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:26,496
I think it's

689
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:29,824
As doing everything they can to get you to buy more stuff

690
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,688
Does that still fit in with this Smartphone Vision or should I expand

691
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:36,480
My Amazon is going to take over the

692
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:42,624
I think they're just trying to like find of a fit with Alexa for every type of user

693
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,208
Modality every type of preference in whether that's a

694
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,488
A touch screen

695
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:49,280
Were you going to show some things

696
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:51,072
Whether it's a

697
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:53,888
A camera which you know as we know people love

698
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:56,960
Some people love cameras either one I don't know if I want a camera in my in my

699
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:58,752
My bedroom

700
00:28:59,008 --> 00:28:59,520
But

701
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:02,592
There's they're just different looks in different use cases they're trying to

702
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:05,152
Fit into and give people

703
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:07,712
A way to use Alexa

704
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:09,504
Really what it's all about

705
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:15,648
And I think it's over taking everything in terms of their connected-home Vision including I think it's in a way replacing

706
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:22,560
Dash I think the physical done for Dasher starting to go away you starting to see them just went to Virtual buttons are they really think they're going all-in

707
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:25,632
When is an Alexa has the weight of the century by stuff

708
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:28,960
And and get people like you said to interact with our conversation

709
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:33,056
So I'm with you on the dash because I always thought those buttons were stopgap

710
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:36,640
And I thought the real story was with the dash replenishment service

711
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:41,248
Because you can build ERS into anything and that feels so powerful

712
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,832
For any maker of some sort of like razor blades or

713
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:45,856
Pet food or whatever

714
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:47,136
Brita water pitchers

715
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:49,184
So the idea of

716
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:49,952
Having

717
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:50,976
Different

718
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:52,512
Echo form factor

719
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:55,328
Who is most threatened by alipay

720
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,096
This is it

721
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:59,680
You know Google home with its me to speaker is it maybe

722
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:02,752
Apple with its I don't know if it's going to launch a speaker

723
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:03,776
What do you think

724
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:06,848
I don't know if they're not knocking out of the park

725
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:07,616
Either

726
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:08,896
The walk

727
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,688
Or the show

728
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:11,456
I feel like

729
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:14,272
The go-to big winner still is the

730
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:20,416
Backhoe the primary product that started it all I mean we'll have to wait and see I don't necessarily feel like this

731
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:22,976
One factor is like a huge winner

732
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:24,768
It look when I first saw the picture I thought like

733
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:26,304
Okay this is just someone's

734
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,328
Physical

735
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:31,424
Idea but it wasn't going to be the final products I was kind of surprised the final product look

736
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,752
So 2007 quite honestly

737
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:36,800
And what surprises me is like

738
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:38,336
I'm wondering if

739
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:41,152
If Amazon is using there are lots of fun to invest in companies

740
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:44,224
The price for discovery mode because this looks a lot

741
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:50,880
It feels a lot like the nucleus and also asking a lot of ways like that the tribute which is it another company busted in inbox yet

742
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:51,904
To the kitchen speaker

743
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:55,488
They've invested in comes with Alexa fund that

744
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,048
The ultimate creative practice very similar to

745
00:30:58,304 --> 00:30:59,328
So that's interesting to me

746
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:02,656
And we have Jonathan Frank

747
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:03,424
Nucleus

748
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,192
Is coming on in a

749
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:05,728
He shares your opinion

750
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,336
If they are using this is a Discovery Fund as opposed to an actual advance

751
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,616
You know the platform

752
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:16,480
What would you advise startups who are looking at taking money from the Amazon

753
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:17,760
The city Alexa voice

754
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,064
Get a great lawyer

755
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,160
To write your agreements although you may be at the mercy of whatever they want to do

756
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:27,488
But just go into this with full understanding that

757
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,768
Amazon

758
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:30,048
Is never going to be

759
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:33,632
Someone other than maybe coopertition then maybe ultimate your competition

760
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:34,912
Like they're ultimately

761
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:36,192
In it for their own

762
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:38,240
Motivations

763
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:42,848
Step back and say I do think they want it have Alexa distributed among the different devices

764
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,408
There's going to be categories that they don't go into

765
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:48,736
But I mean you can never fully right off the fact

766
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:52,576
The idea that they mailed maybe your competitor even if you had their your investor

767
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,368
Where won't they go

768
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,648
I think

769
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:00,256
Most everything has to have a Commerce orientation I don't necessarily see them going into

770
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:01,792
Connected

771
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:06,144
Sprinklers or garage door openers or those types of things at

772
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:08,192
You emailed me get some sort of

773
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,776
Level of adoption but it's never going to be like this massive

774
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:14,848
I don't think they've ever going to like low-volume

775
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:15,872
Niche products

776
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:18,688
I was going to ask so there's this idea that it like

777
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:23,552
Roughly 5 to 6 million Amazon echos either in the dot or the echo format

778
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:25,088
WhatsApp have been sold

779
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:32,000
And usually when I talk to people who aren't interested in it they're not interested in it because they don't want to have a speaker always listen

780
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:33,536
I kind of freaks them out

781
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:36,864
So

782
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,400
Do you think the

783
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,960
Telenovela can

784
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:42,240
I can't find anybody who wants to

785
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:44,544
So do you think the show is

786
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:49,664
Going to bring Ian that audiences so far is kind of worried about privacy and that sort of thing

787
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:50,944
Maybe

788
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:54,528
I think the main motivation for the shows is a video screen

789
00:32:54,784 --> 00:33:00,928
I mean Wilder you receive platonia natural decline in in tablet shipments I mean iPad numbers Court

790
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:02,720
Continue to go down

791
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:04,256
I still feel better

792
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:05,792
Our people are very visual

793
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:07,072
Want some sort of

794
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:08,864
Touch interface video interface

795
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,144
What's interesting news

796
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:16,544
Remember we were at 8 on the one of the podcast when I talk about the cabinet project cabinet that talk about a rumor kitchen computer

797
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:21,664
From a couple years ago I think this is what they told me was this Maybe Might their kitchen computer

798
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,712
Cuz you can do things like video

799
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:24,992
Demonstrations of a cup

800
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:28,064
Like Buzzfeed video recipe how to

801
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:28,832
I think

802
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:31,136
Basically the kitchen use cases very visual

803
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:33,184
There's just certain things you can't do

804
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:36,000
With a voice interface like I may ask Alexa

805
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:37,280
To tell me how to cook

806
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:40,096
But I can't show me how to cook with a video

807
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,144
Dennis it's has somewhat Limited

808
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:45,216
Usefulness I think so I think this kind of sauce for that

809
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:47,264
Okay and what about the voice calling

810
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,288
Again this kind of

811
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:50,336
Tizanidine nucleases stuff

812
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:53,152
I was kind of excited by the fact that

813
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:56,736
Looks like it only goes from

814
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:58,016
Do you have any thoughts there

815
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:03,648
I really liked video calling I don't think anyone's going to necessarily replace FaceTime

816
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:06,464
You know Skype video calling

817
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,488
Or even

818
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:10,816
Google Hangouts with this thing but I can see them

819
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:11,584
Sewing

820
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:15,168
These and then maybe coming out with an app much like they did with the Kindle app eventually

821
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:16,704
The Royce attraction

822
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:23,360
Video calling maybe they've go that direction okay so after Amazon has released all this Hardware I'm looking at it and you know what I think

823
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:26,176
I think it might be time to relaunch the Fire Phone

824
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:27,456
Phone now

825
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:32,064
Now you serious I'm serious think about all the data that they could get from being able to

826
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:32,832
Put this

827
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:34,624
Basically think of

828
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,416
Alexa on your handset

829
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:40,768
And there is definitely a market for that today but now that you've got you know calling

830
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:44,864
Now you can create this entire ecosystem around that I don't know either

831
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:47,168
What are they did a killer

832
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,192
Wearable

833
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:50,752
Like no one's really done I think Apple watch

834
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:56,384
It's kind of like okay are people done with that boy that you did this really great wearable with Alexa integration I'm just Breeze from

835
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,920
Just kind of spitball in butt

836
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:59,712
I feel like big Commerce

837
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:05,856
Because of Commerce being so big to them I don't know if a wearable make sense unless we think about it as like a bio

838
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:08,672
But what if what if it has

839
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:13,792
Some sort of like scanner in it or something to tell you when you watch Walking to a store if you just scan a product

840
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:15,584
It goes into your Amazon account

841
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:17,632
And I'm let me advise or something I don't know

842
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:18,400
Just thinking out loud

843
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:20,960
I like when people think out loud Mike

844
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:21,984
Thanks so much

845
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:22,752
For coming on the show

846
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,800
This has been a lot of fun things Stacy

847
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:31,712
Alright I'm here with Mark Rolston who is the founder of argodesign and he's here telling us about how

848
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,760
The Echo Show

849
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:35,040
Was inevitable

850
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:36,576
Hey Mark how you doing

851
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:38,880
Good to talk to you

852
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:40,416
We have spoken

853
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:42,720
Several times in the past about

854
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:45,536
Amazon Echo in the voice as an interface

855
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:48,864
So can you kind of break down what you mean for me when you say that

856
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,680
This designer this product was somewhat inevitable

857
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:54,240
Yeah well when you look at the echo

858
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:55,776
It's fantastic

859
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:58,336
Devices you can imagine talking to

860
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:00,640
Soon as you start doing that

861
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:01,408
You realize

862
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:05,504
You really not

863
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,320
Look for it to read out the answer verbally

864
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:10,880
For you

865
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:11,648
The time

866
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,184
You can start talking back

867
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,256
Now you realize that I have a list of restaurants

868
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:18,304
A grocery list

869
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,096
Store what are my points

870
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:24,192
Anylist that's beyond one or two words any sample of words

871
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,496
Just not tall ago.

872
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:28,800
Tablet computer

873
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:30,592
So

874
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:33,408
You realize you need a screen

875
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,944
Anywhere and everywhere but

876
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:36,224
Queens

877
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:43,136
Super useful for any kind of like the concert so it wasn't a glamazon

878
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:47,232
Obviously the show is there

879
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:48,000
Response

880
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:51,072
Alright a lot of people have said that this thing

881
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:51,840
Is ugly

882
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:55,680
I think someone earlier in the show's 10th it look like it was a design from the

883
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:59,264
2007 so as a professional product designer

884
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:00,800
Give us your take

885
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:05,152
Agreed

886
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:06,432
Ugly because

887
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:09,248
I think so read on it as soon as I hear

888
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:11,808
Is Billy twofold wine is

889
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,136
Quietly into my home

890
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:16,672
Cincinnati

891
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:17,440
Does

892
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:18,976
As much as I can

893
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:20,768
Given what it's doing today

894
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:23,072
Does it look like a gorgeous objects

895
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:27,680
First run

896
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:28,448
Consumer

897
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,752
Introducing everybody

898
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:32,288
I understand why they didn't

899
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,664
Sasori what they're trying to do is say

900
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,200
Form around it

901
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:39,968
Just look

902
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:43,296
It is

903
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,112
In the nursery speaker

904
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:49,952
I really don't mind I don't think it's a silly silly

905
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:51,488
Got it let's

906
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:52,768
What's your profession

907
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:04,288
True and I feel like we are kind of to this point where we have fetishized

908
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,360
Electronic objects these white plastic

909
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:09,408
Maybe they're space gray plastic

910
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:13,248
Things that we stick out our home and I'm kind of like

911
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:18,112
I don't know if I need any more like UFO looking like things that control stuff in my house

912
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:22,720
What do you think of it

913
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:26,816
Unnecessarily

914
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:32,192
But as a stepping stone it's an all-in-one device and it has

915
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:34,496
Thing that is causing it so much

916
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:35,776
Mass is

917
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:38,336
This microphone and speakers

918
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:40,128
Vim screen

919
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:43,200
But that's just because that's when we are

920
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:46,272
I'm really look forward to this answer when

921
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:48,064
I've got a set of

922
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,344
Potential screen

923
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,880
Microphone array

924
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:53,952
Organic part of a well-equipped home

925
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:59,072
The speaker's Maybe

926
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:01,632
The same way that were starting to hide

927
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:03,936
Speakers that we listen to music with

928
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:06,752
The device speaker

929
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:09,568
We're not anywhere near that yet

930
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:14,944
Kind of hardware stores on come on

931
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:16,224
Breaking news

932
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:17,504
Find

933
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,808
Because it's introducing a lily

934
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:21,856
Magical 7 features

935
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:26,208
Everyone recognizes how complex that scenario

936
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:31,072
Understand this is really pretty successful design and it took a lot of engineering

937
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,912
Well let's talk about those other ideas kind of us the final

938
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:36,704
Bit of all of this

939
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,520
You once showed me a prototype when you are at frog

940
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:46,432
And it was his concept of house that understands context

941
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:51,040
Adapts to you and show you information kind of where you need it

942
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:52,576
It was really kind of cool

943
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:54,112
And so

944
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,392
From

945
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:58,464
And I don't remember how long ago without pus but from that time

946
00:39:58,976 --> 00:39:59,744
To hear

947
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,048
Where do you see us evolving

948
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:05,376
When it comes to building these kind of contextually aware smart

949
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:11,776
Elsa Rumi was our future mission to imagine instead of devices

950
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:14,080
That we got a lot of this

951
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:16,640
What is low-level functionality

952
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:19,456
What time is it change the temperature turn on the lights

953
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:21,248
I almost died.

954
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:24,064
Devices that will help you with that

955
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,112
Which required

956
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:27,904
GoDaddy pocket unlocked

957
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,952
Go to Red Lobster Vine app

958
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:30,720
And such

959
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:33,280
But we imagine that the home

960
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:34,304
Itself

961
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:37,632
Was equipped with all the necessary for

962
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:39,936
To do that for you orthodox

963
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:43,008
Any environment that humans

964
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:46,080
Commonly existed within them could be equipped

965
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:49,152
With the level of computing where you would say the room is

966
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:51,456
The computer in the corner

967
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:56,832
Is really

968
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:58,112
Beautiful example of

969
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:59,136
First product

970
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:01,184
Way back into a guy

971
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:02,976
Chesnaught

972
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:05,792
Was thinking if we wanted to build this

973
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:09,120
The first thing we need to do is essentially make a box with some of it

974
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:12,448
Then we thought maybe the first box will be the projector

975
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:15,776
We want to quit

976
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:17,056
Field that product

977
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:17,824
Be kind

978
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,360
It's obvious today

979
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:20,640
Got answer so.

980
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:22,176
Amazon go

981
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:24,992
I'm extremely coffee

982
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:26,016
We will get

983
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:27,296
Back to that

984
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,880
Instead of these discrete boxes you have

985
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:34,208
Corner yoga

986
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,744
You instead

987
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:38,048
Put the next one up into the ceiling

988
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:40,352
I like all.

989
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:41,632
A can light

990
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:44,704
Socket you put one of those dogs will be your max

991
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,544
We kind of see this today with if you look at like the ecobee did with the

992
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:54,687
Alexa powered thermostat in there actually doing light switches with both of microphones and speakers in them

993
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:57,247
So that feels close to this patient

994
00:41:58,527 --> 00:42:00,063
Cats getting their rights

995
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,343
They're basically

996
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:03,135
Exploiting existing

997
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:06,463
Appliances in the house or existing affordances

998
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:07,743
Alexa light socket

999
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:09,535
To sneak in another mic

1000
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:11,839
More control service

1001
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:17,215
Eventually you have a an overarching system

1002
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:20,287
Something Amazon Rhymes or Apple

1003
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:21,055
Google Now

1004
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:24,895
Back to the room

1005
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:26,431
Into other room

1006
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:28,991
Cost of laundry room

1007
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:32,575
It's really one conversation one

1008
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:35,647
You'll stop thinking of it is that thermostat

1009
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:38,719
Calories

1010
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:39,743
Black

1011
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:41,279
Monolith in the corner

1012
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:43,839
I'm really just talking to the room

1013
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:47,167
Go back to the question of what do I think of

1014
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:49,471
Echo Show

1015
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:51,775
It's a great stepping stone

1016
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:53,055
All right

1017
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:54,335
Well thank you so much

1018
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:59,455
Can you have Jonathan Frankel who is the CEO of nucleus

1019
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:02,783
Which as you can imagine today just found out

1020
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:04,319
That the Amazon show

1021
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:05,855
Looks kind of like

1022
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:06,623
Bear pride

1023
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:08,415
Hi Jonathan how are you

1024
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:14,047
So we talked for years I've tried out a nucleus I thought it was actually pretty

1025
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:17,631
Pretty sweet what was your reaction today when you saw the Amazon show

1026
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:22,495
I thought hey that there's an eerie resemblance to product

1027
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:25,823
And how is it how is your day been so

1028
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:27,615
Let's ask it like that how is your day been

1029
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:30,175
It's been a rollercoaster

1030
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:32,223
I like it.

1031
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:34,527
Elf crystallized thing

1032
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:35,807
We

1033
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:36,831
Having a

1034
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:38,111
Yeah that this was

1035
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:38,879
Coming

1036
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:39,647
But

1037
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:42,719
At the same time you're under the impression that it was

1038
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:43,999
Not overly

1039
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:45,791
Competitive by

1040
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:46,815
Signal leak

1041
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:49,375
Nothing video this morning yeah kind of

1042
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:51,167
Different direction

1043
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:52,447
But

1044
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:54,495
Panda strategic part of my brain

1045
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:55,775
Working as well

1046
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:56,543
And

1047
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:58,591
As I'm watching this as much as I make

1048
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:03,199
Straight in my chair thinking about the future of nucleus and

1049
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:04,991
Call the Family petrolina

1050
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:06,271
I also think about the

1051
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:07,551
Ordering.

1052
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:08,575
Walmart

1053
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:09,343
Target

1054
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:10,111
Comcast

1055
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:10,879
Google

1056
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:12,159
They also have

1057
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:13,951
Wondering

1058
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:15,999
How do they remain relevant

1059
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:18,303
Amazon has

1060
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:19,071
Potentially

1061
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:19,839
Shopping cart

1062
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,143
Every room in your home

1063
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:24,191
The reason

1064
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:25,983
Why I think Amazon is willing

1065
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:27,007
2 +

1066
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:28,799
Directly with

1067
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:32,127
By the time you were the single largest investment from the

1068
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:35,199
Why would they

1069
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:38,783
Shut the marketplace that it can't be trusted as

1070
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:39,807
Sandwiches

1071
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:41,599
Ecosystem

1072
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:47,487
I think it's because

1073
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:49,791
DeGraff Butler wheatgrass glitches

1074
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:51,327
Using communication

1075
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:52,607
Is the pat

1076
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:53,375
Ticket

1077
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:56,703
Normal everyday people to put devices throughout their home

1078
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:59,007
And exact their homes out of people's houses

1079
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:01,823
The Amazon has this once-in-a-generation

1080
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:04,895
Opportunity to get their shopping cart

1081
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:07,455
To every room in millions at home

1082
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:09,759
And logout all the other retailers

1083
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:10,783
Elsa

1084
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:12,063
Interacting with the customer

1085
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:14,879
I guess is Al Pacino's too good to be true

1086
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:21,279
And if I was a teenager retail today

1087
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:25,375
Okay

1088
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:28,959
Well let's break that down because that's that's a pretty big strategic threat

1089
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:31,263
How exactly do you feel that this is us

1090
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:32,543
Threat for these guys

1091
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:34,591
Now that Amazon has a shopping cart

1092
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:37,919
Video and Communications access in every room in my

1093
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:42,015
So

1094
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:45,087
Amazon Pennsylvania Plaza building blocks

1095
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:46,879
Price of a minion

1096
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:48,159
Stair look

1097
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:49,439
Heather Cameron has

1098
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:51,487
Image recognition Technology Building

1099
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:55,839
And now that has Echo Show which all sides are always on camera and no private

1100
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:01,215
Imagine typical family

1101
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:02,495
I wake up in the morning

1102
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:03,519
There

1103
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:04,543
Preparing breakfast

1104

Ever since the milk

00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:08,895
Fans on camera see if the milk is empty

1106
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:13,503
And immediately pops has a message and says hey do you want to deliver milk later today

1107
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:17,855
They were in the office

1108

1109
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:24,511
Why would you ever step foot into a supermarket ever again

1110
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:26,303

Tell if you're italco

1115
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:43,711
Tacos today mean that many lines of business

1116
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:45,759
Internet phone

1117
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:46,783
And entertain

1118
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:48,575
So song

1119
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:53,183
Amazon announced the ability to do phone calls together with

1120
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:54,207
Ecuador

1121
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:57,023

A whole home

1124
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:07,263
I think I've taken that pillar out of the the triple play

1125
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:08,543
Set entertainment

1126
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:09,823
Lights out

1127
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:11,615
Cable bundles on their taxes

1128
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:13,919
Lots of different type of Amazon

1129
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:15,455

1130
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:18,527
Amazon Fire stick that plugs into your TV

1131
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:19,551
Did Billy

1132
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:25,695
Use your voice to turn on your as your show that you want at anytime that Amazon Prime video

1133

Screen in your kitchen so you can watch shows while you're cooking or getting ready

1134
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:33,375
They're going to lock you more more

1135
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:34,143
Enter

1136
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:36,959
I can't take it one step further

1137
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:37,983
Netflix

1138
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:40,287
Is renowned for using data to help them

1139
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:41,055
Programming

1140
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:44,895
It didn't have a microphone or camera in every room

1141
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:46,431
Amazon Uno

1142
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:47,199
Who is watch

1143
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:48,991
When they're watching

1144
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:52,831
That's what the camera that can know when you're watching the screen or looking down your phone

1145
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:55,135
Amazon has better data

1146
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:57,439
Any Android can play in the industry

1147
00:47:57,695 --> 00:48:00,511
To create better content for the La Quinta

1148
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:03,839
The entertainment portion of the bundle kind of Falls away

1149
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:06,399
Taco becomes an internet line

1150
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:08,191
Is

1151
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:15,359
It's lucrative but but it's hard to sell additional services

1152
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:19,711
I don't know what if they killed it

1153
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:20,479
That changes

1154
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:22,527
But we're not going to go there

1155
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:23,807
Now for you guys

1156
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:26,879
You mentioned that you were rethinking possibly

1157
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:28,671
I think about your business in light of this

1158
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:30,463
What is this mean for nuclear

1159
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:32,255

1160
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:36,607
We have thought deeply about family communication for

1161
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:38,655

1162
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:40,703
Tens of thousands of people

1163
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:45,311
I understand what movies does he look at Arden Heights versus Amazon

1164
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:47,103
Different devices offline store

00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:47,871
Shopping

1166
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:50,431
Optimized for family communication

1167
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:52,991
Physical properties

1168
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:55,807
Because he wanted to feel comfortable in your own home

1169
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:58,623
Inland Steel

00:48:58,879 --> 00:49:01,439
City Center cuz they want the camera recording

1171
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:07,583
Look into partnering companies other Industries Antonio's auto companies that are threatened by Amazon

1172
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:09,119
And we can help them

1173
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:11,423
Yeah by putting nucleus devices

1174
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:15,519
Potentially with or without Alexa

00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:32,415
Even better family

1184
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:37,023
But also not the relationship that they have in it

1185
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:41,119
With their customers of a billion dollars and decades building up

1186
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:44,447

They took Amazon's money

1194
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:55,967
And now
