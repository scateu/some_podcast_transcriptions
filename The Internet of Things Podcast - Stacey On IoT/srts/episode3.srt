1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:04,096

We better Newfie music

4
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:16,896
Since we don't have any

5
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:18,944
I'm actually going to pick out the music

6
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:22,016
All right

7
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:23,552
Today

8
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:25,088
Closing because I realized

9
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:27,392
For all the poor people out there

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:28,928
I think the show just

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,512
Yeah I kind of want to give him a little heads up

12
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:33,280
We like

13
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:36,096
Thank you for listening I think that's all

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,984
That's fine I think I think we're all on board with that we're on board with something other than

15
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,288
The person be like yeah thanks for having me that was fun

16
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:49,152
This is not the internet of things so let's

17
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:51,456
Let's get down to it first things up

18
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:55,296
Kevin you woke up at 3 a.m. on with a Friday

19
00:00:55,808 --> 00:01:00,416
Friday morning on the East Coast I know I'm still I'm still tired from that

20
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:01,952
Yeah that was to

21
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:05,024
Pre-order the Apple watch which

22
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,656
Honestly after playing with a device twice I'm not going to say I'm not impressed by it but I don't know that I need it

23
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:15,776
However from a work perspective to test gadgets and try different things I did buy one

24
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:20,128
Welcome

25
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,176
No nobody got it

26
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:29,344
It launched but you can't get it yet and April 24th you'll be able to go into a store and still not get it because all you can do is

27
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,624
Order it online

28
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:32,672
Now so I don't have it

29
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:36,256
If a cat 307 that was 7 minutes after the

30
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:41,376
Pre-orders began it had already pushed me back to a mid-may delivery date

31
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:43,680
So I'm not even having on April 24th when it

32
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:45,216
Quote-unquote launches

33
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:46,496
And I

34
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:49,056
Shame on me I ordered the most popular

35
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:52,128
Apple watch with the most popular color and of course

36
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:57,248
The most popular colored band I got a space gray aluminum sport model with

37
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,016
Black

38
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,040
Sport strap

39
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:02,880
And yeah everybody else got that too so

40
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:07,232
$350 later I am waiting at about 5 weeks for the

41
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:09,792
So was there an option

42
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:11,328
Pink strap

43
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,168
Absolutely although I have some data

44
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:22,080
From slice intelligent stop talking about who ordered what and sliced I don't have ever use slice it's for iOS

45
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,104
An Android you can

46
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:27,200
You can slice and what it does is it monitors your email so it finds

47
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:30,272
Receipts email receipts from things you order online

48
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:34,368
And then they actually gather that data and get rid of all your personal information and then

49
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:36,928
Put together reports and they put a report together on Monday

50
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:38,464
And said that the pink

51
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,256
Strap and one of the other

52
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:43,584
Pasteli color Caesar they like the iPod touch colors

53
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:47,680
For only 4% of people ordered those

54
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:50,752
So I did not and I could have gotten that but

55
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:54,592
I didn't want that I want something I can wear everyday pretty much all settings and

56
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:57,920
Yeah I don't think that pastel pink or blue or

57
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:00,224
Whatever was is my thing for that

58
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,248
I could have warned

59
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,272
Pastel pink

60
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:06,624
I know you could pull out of I could not

61
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:09,184
Although I say this wearing a white

62
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,720
I see the way

63
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:11,488
Pebble watch there

64
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:15,072
It goes well see it's going it goes with my current outfit right now

65
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,704
You got the whole monochrome thing going on here

66
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:24,032
On the radio

67
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,056
And don't see my

68
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,920
So I am excited to get to watch because of the potential that it brings

69
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:34,528
And the fact that may lead a little bit into WWDC

70
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:38,624
I was going to say you can tell by the time it comes out maybe we'll have homekit devices

71
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,160
And start playing

72
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:41,696
I

73
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,000
I suspect we're not going to have

74
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:48,608
A big homekit push until June 8th which is when WWDC

75
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,168
Kids place at Moscone West in San Francisco

76
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:57,056
And the reason being if you look at the logo for the WWDC event which

77
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,592
Just today it came out

78
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,896
Yeah I don't want to read too much into this is not like

79
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:06,272
And I'm trying to decipher the logos here but it sure looks like an Apple TV in the center of the logo to me

80
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:11,904
And we've heard rumors of Apple TV getting an upgrade hasn't really seen one since 2013 refresh

81
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:14,464
And there's talk of homekit

82
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,488
You know being

83
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,351
On the Apple TV as a as a hub which I like as we know from the last show because

84
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:22,911
I don't want to get zillion Wi-Fi things on my network

85
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,447
And say she's laughing at me again

86
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,311
The big thing about home

87
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,127
What's the big thing about made for

88
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,151
The made for

89
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,175
I

90
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,455
Devices program

91
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:37,247
It's

92
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:39,551
Kind of Wi-Fi beso a lot of these

93
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,575
Devices have a

94
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:42,879
Part of the security + cert

95
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,159
Location is over the Wi-Fi

96
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,183
So

97
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,975
It could be that even if there is a

98
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,351
That's all right

99
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:55,167
Europe you're bursting my bubble but that's okay I can live with that

100
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,471
I was just thinking with this this whole

101
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:58,751
WDC

102
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,823
WDC WDC

103
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,871
Worldwide about WWDC

104
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:04,639
Yes yes

105
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:07,711
H-E-B wdcb whatever worldwide developer,

106
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,479
Okay

107
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:13,343
We need to get you like a conspirator Kevin's conspiracy corner

108
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:16,415
We're going to change your name

109
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,695
Because I can't do it

110
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:19,743
Not happening

111
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,607
CCC so this is your Apple

112
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,655
WDC conspiracy

113
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,727
Get the logo is shaped

114
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,007
It's like an Apple TV

115
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:34,591
We're going to have an Apple TV refresh

116
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:35,615
At the event

117
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,407
And it's going to be home care

118
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,687
Kind of face

119
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:39,455
Because

120
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,479
Apple TV

121
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,271
Refresh might include

122
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,295
The homekit

123
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,343
Apple TV

124
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:51,999
I think that's a safe that regardless of the logo, so I think that's a safe bet mean there's been

125
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:55,327
Some leaks and rumors about the new Apple TV and that it will have

126
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,887
More apps will get a refresh in terms of apps

127
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:00,191
And when you think of home kit and apps

128
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,727
So just all fits together

129
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,519
I agree with you so

130
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,079
As someone who has played around with most

131
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:06,847
Apple home

132
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,127
Hobbs already

133
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:11,199
The biggest weakness of apples

134
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:13,247
Can't when it was tied to the phone

135
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,271
When your phone leaves

136
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:15,551
Your house suddenly has

137
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,343
And that

138
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,927
Because you still want things that you

139
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:21,695
Scheduler

140
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:22,719
Seems to happen

141
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:23,999
Especially things

142
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,279
Security like my lights

143
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,047
To go on and off

144
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:28,607
Midas shades

145
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,935
All of those things still need to happen

146
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:34,751
So it makes total sense

147
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:35,519
That you would have some

148
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,591
Now

149
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,895
I am really excited

150
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:43,199
I'd like an Apple TV is fine

151
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,479
I hope that apple

152
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:45,503
Doesn't just

153
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,343
Because I don't

154
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:53,183
I would love to see any of the intelligence

155
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,207
Get a home

156
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:55,999
Not be relegated

157
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:56,767
It's just one

158
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,583
Because I don't want to buy Asus

159
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:00,607
Take device to me

160
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,167
Like to act as a bridge basically

161
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:03,935
Ready

162
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:08,543
So could that be done and we'll iCloud be a big part of this I suspect yes

163
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:09,567
Probably

164
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,591
So Apple has

165
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:11,615
Apple TV

166
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,151
They also at the airport

167
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,175
For example

168
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:16,223
So I could see like

169
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,247
Bad acting

170
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:18,783
Bridge device

171
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,647
You know you want to add Wi-Fi to

172
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:24,927
Cheap locksmith

173
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:27,487
Instead of buying

174
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:31,583
How many Outlet

175
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:33,887
None

176
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,679
Right

177
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:41,055
So you would hate all these Bluetooth Lawson Bluetooth devices that require a Wi-Fi Bridge cuz you have to

178
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:43,359
Plug in and out within just live there all the time

179
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:46,431
Every outlet has a Wi-Fi device in my house

180
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,199
It's crazy

181
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,783
You got more stuff on your network and they're taking about

182
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:51,807
I know

183
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:56,927
You got a device

184
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:01,535
So I just thinking about all the kind of protocol

185
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,839
All the devices that apple

186
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,631
Reasonably call ahead

187
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,959
Apple TV that I don't know what else to do

188
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,775
It could be their brand new cool device like a

189
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:16,127
Amazon Echo type devices

190
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,407
Siri I don't know

191
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:22,015
I like that idea

192
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:24,063
Fundamentally here's my crazy predict

193
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:26,623
Like a year or two after homekit is lost

194
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,159
Apple will launch

195
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,439
Real product

196
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:33,023
And that product will be fundamentally different

197
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,559
In a true kind of

198
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:37,119
Something completely different for the home

199
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,143
It makes it

200
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,935
Usable for the mange

201
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:45,055
I don't know I think you're wrong cuz I can't see how they would design a logo for that

202
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:47,615
But that's just me

203
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:50,175
No I think you're I think you're spot on

204
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,455
This is

205
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:57,855
This is been a long time coming I'm an apple announced homekit at last year's WWDC if I recall correctly

206
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:58,623
The last June

207
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:01,695
It's been a long time just to get to product version 1

208
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:02,719
And

209
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:04,255
As we all know it's

210
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:10,655
What is Apple do they introduce a product that doesn't have every single possible feature or the best features just yet we're the best

211
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,423
Experience yet

212
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:16,799
And the iterating iterating all of a sudden they got you know a market-leading products oh yes I would agree

213
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:19,359
World and they don't even have a crime rate

214
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,127
Actually

215
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:22,431
At South by Southwest

216
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,455
Jason Johnson

217
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:25,503
Who is the CEO of August

218
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,783
B-connected lot

219
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,063
Who is a homekit partner

220
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,855
Actually said that

221
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,647
What you may not realize

222
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:33,439
This is Apple came to them

223
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,207
NSAID

224
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:34,975
Hey

225
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:36,511
We need a lot specify

226
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,559
Application and since you're one of our partners

227
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:40,095
Expensive

228
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:43,423
So they did in so

229
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,471
That's kind of how that came to be

230
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,007
And that's how

231
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:49,823
Home kits facts for other products also came

232
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:51,615
State work with their partners

233
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:54,431
My hunch is Chamberlain

234
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,967
Winchester Park around the garage door side

235
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:57,503
The garage door

236
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,295
So

237
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,343
Yay for all their partners

238
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:03,135
Got in on the ground floor

239
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,671
And that

240
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:06,207
Means actually for

241
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,487
People who are used to working

242
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:08,767
Does products you probably have

243
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,095
What is going to be like to work

244
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:14,655
Specs

245
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,191
The huge advantage

246
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,471
Totally

247
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:20,031
But it also means that

248
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,591
We probably are going to see a lot of really cool innovative

249
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,895
You know we're going to see kind of what we

250
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:28,735
I don't have a sign I'm trying to picture what I need in my home

251
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,015
Today or tomorrow

252
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,551
Aluminum

253
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:32,575
Or aluminium

254
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,927
I want sitting somewhere doing

255
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,207
Something that I don't even know

256
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:40,511
Actually I do know I want it to end

257
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:45,375
Is that too much to ask

258
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,143
I mean

259
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,703
I'm still waiting for my husband and my daughter.

260
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,895
You mention Amazon Echo

261
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:04,831
There's some big news I read it

262
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:08,671
But not into tell I knew you were that's why I didn't

263
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,975
What's the big news because it is big news

264
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:13,023
I think it is

265
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,559
Amazon

266
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:16,095
Actually supports

267
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,887
Hue and WeMo

268
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,935
Over the Amazon Echo now

269
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:20,959
So

270
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,591
I'd leave my living room guys

271
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,359
And

272
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:28,383
I say

273
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:29,663
Alexa

274
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:30,943
Turn off

275
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:31,967
Living room lights

276
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:33,503
Go off

277
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,807
Alexa says okay

278
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:38,879
I think it's amazing I always want to say thank you

279
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:41,439
Can I catch other people in my house doing the same thing

280
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,743
We're always like talking to Alexa we like

281
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,279
Please do this

282
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:50,399
So I have both the polite family and

283
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,679
We don't know how to text

284
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,215
So

285
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,239
What it does

286
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,007
Is

287
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,543
If you want to set this up

288
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:59,103
If you're one of the few people who have an Amazon Echo

289
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:00,895
It's in beta

290
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,431
And you just say Alexa

291
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,711
Discover my device

292
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:07,295
And Alexa goes through your Wi-Fi and discovers

293
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,831
Your WeMo devices

294
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,879
Right now it only supports

295
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:11,647
Three wheel motor

296
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,439
It support

297
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,207
What's the

298
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,231
Outlet

299
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,791
The Outlet Plus energy saving

300
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:18,815
And a light switch

301
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:20,607
Arduino

302
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:22,399
And the WeMo is a little buggy

303
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,423
I'm going to tell you this

304
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,727
The WeMo API

305
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,335
On the Hue side it's

306
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,359
Support Steam

307
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,127
Hugh

308
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:32,895
Colored lights

309
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:34,943
In the light bulb shapes with a night

310
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,527
The lights

311
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,599
And the moon things

312
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,903
Does not support the other thing we talked about last week

313
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:44,671
Hugo

314
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,463
No Hugo

315
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:51,071
The bowl with a light in it

316
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:53,119
So it doesn't support that yet

317
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:56,191
And it also supports do I say the Hue Lux white lights

318
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:59,775
He didn't but now you did

319
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:00,543
It is

320
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,335
A little bit weird

321
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:04,639
So it took me awhile to figure out how to group the law

322
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,687
In the Hue app

323
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:09,503
You can't actually group your Hue Lights

324
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,295
In a room setting

325
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:13,087
Which I've always liked you after I speak

326
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,367
Yeah

327
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:17,951
So I got four living room lights and their names really stupid things

328
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:19,743
Left front

329
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:20,767
Living room light

330
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,863
So if I were talking to Alexa

331
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:25,887
I would have to

332
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,167
How to say turn on left

333
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,591
Excruciating

334
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,871
So

335
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:39,711
The Hue app you have to prove it in the

336
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:40,479
Amazon

337
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:44,575
That's I was wondering if there was an interface in the Amazon app now

338
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:48,671
There is but it took me awhile to find

339
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,439
Whois

340
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:51,231
Wander over it that's not funny

341
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:53,279
If you guys like our show you love that's enough

342
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,327
Is it

343
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,119
The URL just wwd

344
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:01,215
Wf.com

345
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:04,543
He took me off to hell

346
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,079
How you can actually find

347
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,871
Amazon Echo

348
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:09,919
Intonow

349
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,455
I've named it living room lights

350
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:12,735
And so

351
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:13,759
Once group

352
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,807
You can just tell Alexa

353
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:16,831
Turn on

354
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,367
Living room lights you can

355
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,391
Tell Alexa

356
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:20,415
Dim

357
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,183
Living room lights

358
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,207
To 50%

359
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,487
You cannot

360
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:24,255
Manage the

361
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,279
Color preferences

362
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,047
Sindecuse

363
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,327
With Alexa

364
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:28,607
And

365
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:30,911
There's a little weirdness that I'm sure they will

366
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,447
Update out

367
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,983
But right now if you're

368
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,519
Turning the Hue Lights Off

369
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,823
You can say turn off

370
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,591
Switch off

371
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,639
But if you're turning the WeMo

372
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:41,407
Off

373
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:43,455
You have to say switch off

374
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,991
Only switch off

375
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:50,367
Yeah I'm not a I'm not a fan of those very specific commands like my Xbox has the same thing and I'll turn it off

376
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,135
By voice

377
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,671
A lot of noise control with it

378
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:59,071
And sometimes I say the wrong turn off command I'll say switch off or something and it does nothing but blink at me like what

379
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,863
Obviously not the right thing

380
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,399
The nice thing about

381
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,935
The interface is

382
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,471
When you get it right

383
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:06,239
Alexa

384
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,519
Will say okay

385
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:10,591
When you get it wrong you get this tone that is like

386
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,151
Sad trombone

387
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,943
If it would be better

388
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,735
Womp womp

389
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:18,271
Instead you just get this like

390
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,623
Yeah

391
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,391
Makes sense

392
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,951
Let me ask you this since you now have

393
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:29,279
Connected I'm sorry you have control these devices

394
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:31,583
Through several interfaces now in the past

395
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,863
I don't know how many months

396
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:37,727
Is there what would kind of lag time is there between Alexa and say your lights going on or off

397
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:39,519
Less than a second

398
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:42,591
Okay it's a really it's really very effective

399
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:45,919
What I've done because Alexa has a remote

400
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:46,687
Control

401
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:49,759
A lot of people brought this up there like I only have an echo in one room if my

402
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:50,783
My house

403
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:51,807
Q's in other rooms

404
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:52,575
Good point

405
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:53,599
My

406
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:54,879
Downstairs is a

407
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,415
Floor plan

408
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:57,695
So I have it

409
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,975
Downstairs

410
00:15:59,231 --> 00:15:59,999
Kitchen area.

411
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,535
Control my entire kitchen

412
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:06,911
That's the area where you have your blender that just goes on by itself when somebody hacks your network

413
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,615
We keep it there but I keep the remote

414
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:16,639
Control

415
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,663
Stairs cuz I have

416
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,431
The Hue Lights

417
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,223
Thai table lamp

418
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,247
So now I can

419
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,135
And that work

420
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,535
Controlling my

421
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,815
In-N-Out

422
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:38,911
Yeah because the remote that comes with the echo actually you can speak to and it

423
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,191
Does its thing just like

424
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:42,495
The Amazon Echo itself does okay

425
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,263
That makes it

426
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,871
Is there a third option in that you can control through a phone interface with

427
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:48,639
Amazon

428
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:51,967
You know I'd there is an Amazon Echo app

429
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,015
I don't believe it's in here

430
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:57,343
So there you go something

431
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:03,487
So there you go

432
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:05,279
Cuz then think about it

433
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:07,839
With iOS

434
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:10,143
Or Android Wear watch

435
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:11,679
You could even

436
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,471
Speech you're watching

437
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:16,543
Do it that way to take the phone out of your pocket

438
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:18,079
So here's the deal.

439
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,383
Once you take your phone

440
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,431
And you open an app

441
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,735
You might as well just do it from the apps

442
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:25,759
Already on

443
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:29,599
You don't even have to unlock the phone or open yet

444
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:33,183
Because all these apps right now for the lunches are extensions of the phone apps

445
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:34,975
So boom

446
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:39,071
Oh my say boom okay

447
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,863
True fairness you are right

448
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,911
All right so stay tuned

449
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:43,935
Because

450
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:46,751
This is all I have on the echo

451
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:48,287
Unless you have other questions Kevin

452
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:53,663
No I'm just happy to see that kind of integration I didn't buy an echo even though I had the invitation

453
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,967
Partly because it didn't do enough and had no

454
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:58,783
Home integration now we're seeing the first

455
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:01,599
Steps for that and now I'm much more intrigued by

456
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,391
But you don't have any Hue Lights

457
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,439
I don't have any

458
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:07,487
Thing right now because

459
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:11,839
Cuz I'm a slacker and haven't reinstall all of my crap

460
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,375
So once again I'm going to

461
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,447
Here right now

462
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,727
Kevin

463
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:19,007
Where where are we now

464
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:21,311
How many 6 months behind I'd say

465
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,103
You've been harping on me

466
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:26,431
If I'm going to my wife

467
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:29,503
Ashley she could care less tickets

468
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,575
Hey it was it was my birthday on Sunday

469
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:34,623
I know happy birthday

470
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,159
Yeah and you know what

471
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:42,303
Turning on your blender from Pennsylvania here but

472
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,863
I was going to say let me make you a mixed drink

473
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:52,031
No I would say

474
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:52,799
Beyonce

475
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:55,871
Okay

476
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:59,711
Since you're not going to get the Apple watch for a while

477
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:03,551
I got nothing better to do than setup insteon stuff at my house you're right

478
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,439
You're not covering mobile or anything

479
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:14,815
You're not right for five bucks a day, 7 days a week again

480
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:16,607
Oh okay

481
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:18,399
I think

482
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,679
That's probably

483
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:20,703
Some awesome stuff

484
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:21,727
That we talked about

485
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:25,823
And if you stay to you will learn we have Bluetooth lighting

486
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:26,847
Coming down

487
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:28,895
We talked to

488
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:29,663
Volume

489
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:30,431
Syllabus

490
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,199
Smiths

491
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:34,527
Who is a VP of marketing at Sora

492
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:39,391
In Surah is a company that provides lights for restaurants like California Pizza

493
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,927
And hotels

494
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,719
Like Starwood

495
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,487
And

496
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:46,047
They did a deal with company called C

497
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:51,423
To put bluetooth connected lights in a lot of really cool public places

498
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,959
That you will be at

499
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:55,007
Can we talk about what that means

500
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:56,543
Where and what it means

501
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,311
For the businesses

502
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,335
And opportunities

503
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:00,639
And diet

504
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:02,431
It is pretty darn exciting

505
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:07,039
I very curious to hear what he has to say because what I think of Bluetooth I think of

506
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:10,367
Personal security and pairing and such so

507
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:11,391
I'm curious

508
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,183
Personal security

509
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:15,999
Well like when I when you turn your Bluetooth

510
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,791
Phone Bluetooth on your phone

511
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:20,607
Don't you see like a gazillion Bluetooth devices around you

512
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:21,631
Be prepared

513
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,399
A lot

514
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,191
Fair enough

515
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,983
Box of stay tuned

516
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:30,847
Hey everybody and welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast

517
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:31,615
And

518
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:34,943
We are talking about my favorite topic this week with

519
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:35,967
William

520
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:40,575
Silversmiths who is the director of marketing for a company called sora

521
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:44,927
Sora is a lighting company based out of Fremont California

522
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,975
So hi William how are you

523
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:48,767
I'm fine

524
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,839
Thank you for joining us today so

525
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:55,935
I would love for you to tell us a little bit about Sarah

526
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,335
Because one of our founders

527
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:06,431
Nobel Prize

528
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:10,015
Chitticks last year in 2014

529
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:16,672
Because of his contributions

530
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,976
General illumination

531
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:22,048
Time in Japan

532
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:28,192
Later he moved to California inventions

533
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:34,592
By which he called LED 2.0 it's based on a different material system and

534
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:47,392
He has to be manually making lamps on this new LED technology

535
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:51,232
And we have done that since 2012

536
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:53,792
Buy lamps you actually mean light bulbs

537
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,656
And for the most part your customers are

538
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:01,984
Commercial clients in high-end residential

539
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,776
Yes that's correct

540
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:07,872
What we do is in our lamps when you focus on very good, right

541
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:10,432
And we focus on directional lights

542
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:15,040
And directional lights are used in restaurants

543
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:20,416
Instance stores for example

544
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:24,768
And some of your commercial customers are companies like California Pizza Kitchen

545
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:27,072
And let's see who else are some of your customers

546
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:33,728
Do we have a restaurant change

547
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:38,336
The Jews are lamps desk hiring restaurants anywhere

548
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:42,688
Dona looking at restaurant

549
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,528
People trying just to create a pool of light over the table

550
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:49,856
Dinner table

551
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:52,672
And you need to pretty nail spa

552
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:55,488
Tattoo creator

553
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:05,728
Okay

554
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,080
Until we're talking today because For the First time ever

555
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:16,480
You guys are announcing that you're doing a partnership with a company called seed to add Bluetooth connectivity to your

556
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:19,296
I thought that this was pretty cool

557
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:24,160
Because one I feel like this is 2015 is the year for Bluetooth

558
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:25,696
Into

559
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:31,072
I think it's actually a really interesting to talk to a kind of lighting manufacturer about

560
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:33,376
Cut up the future of connected lighting

561
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:37,984
And I I wanted to talk to you about why Bluetooth and then go into kind of

562
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,800
What your customers are going to be doing with this so

563
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:45,152
What are you guys think like why are you adding connectivity to your lighting now

564
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,944
What is the promise in the Hope here

565
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,088
You know

566
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:59,488
Things that sent people that that determines how lighting looks like an intervention who is Neymar

567
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:01,024
Augusta

568
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,816
60 lighting designs

569
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:05,120
And then when they do

570
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:10,752
Lighting design that we try to figure out how to space looks like

571
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:12,544
I want to get dark

572
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:16,640
So you can imagine that you want to lie.

573
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:20,992
Embarrassed

574
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:27,392
How they talk about this

575
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:33,792
Today

576
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,936
And how it works today

577
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:44,288
It is every group of light as Beyond common

578
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:46,592
If you want me to calculate you snaps together

579
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:49,664
So you have me

580
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:53,504
Artistic desired and spaces designs

581
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:59,904
Everything is flying together

582
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:04,256
Things that you can do with wireless

583
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:08,608
Is it to control every land individually

584
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:15,008
So this whole constrains us how everything is going to be wire together that is gone you can have

585
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:18,592
Switch off switch

586
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:20,640
Orange and 1 control panel

587
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:21,408
Cast

588
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:23,712
Directions to everyone individually

589
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:29,344
At what level

590
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:32,160
And you can look at it individually

591
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:36,512
For customers

592
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:39,840
It's kind of at a lighting designer level so if I'm in a restaurant

593
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:44,704
I know that I've been at a restaurant because I have a young child so we tend to die in a little early

594
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:49,056
And we'll have this kind of moment in time around like 6:30 or maybe it's a

595
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:51,872
7 when all of a sudden we go from like

596
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:53,920
Daytime dating two

597
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:58,528
It goes dim and we're suddenly in romantic night time dieting

598
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:02,112
The lights are 30% lower and somewhat your

599
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:03,392
Telling me is

600
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:09,280
That could be maybe a more subtle shift or maybe that happens in certain areas of the restaurant or certainty

601
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:12,096
How does this actually play out for the consumer

602
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:14,144
When they're sitting in a restaurant

603
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:20,800
What you mean example

604
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:27,200
Restaurants

605
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:37,440
Everything games to the same degree while if you're still at the window I'm right outside

606
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,720
Chicken restaurant that is

607
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:43,584
Individually dawlod in

608
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,680
Especially related to Bluetooth to something

609
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:48,448
Really

610
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:54,848
Interesting what we like about Bluetooth is that everybody has

611
00:26:55,104 --> 00:27:01,248
Just be like this for quite a while already so and if you have a Bluetooth

612
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,160
You would need a louder

613
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:09,184
Spanish words

614
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,208
And the whole

615
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:13,280
A process of connecting to a connected device

616
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:18,400
But it's not

617
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:20,960
And what you can do with Bluetooth

618
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:23,520
Instantaneous access to Atlanta show

619
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:29,920
You can imagine in a restaurant that I think people think that restaurant when you come in

620
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:47,584
We can imagine that the restaurant within a certain band

621
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:54,240
Are we get people adjustability

622
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:57,312
Difficult

623
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,848
We can imagine.

624
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:02,944
Did bring you sit at the table depending on your mood and your niece

625
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:07,552
How you make within a certain range adjustment

626
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:08,832
That is possible

627
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:11,904
Directional lamp

628
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:13,952
Okay so I could

629
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,000
I could read my menu if I

630
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:17,536
I can't see it or maybe I could

631
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:19,072
Turn the lights up when

632
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:22,400
I'm looking for my inevitable drop silverware napkins

633
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:23,168
Always happy

634
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:24,192
Since when I'm at a restaurant

635
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:25,984
You can't take me anywhere

636
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:29,056
So what is this mean for the restaurant

637
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:31,872
If I'm you know California Pizza Kitchen or

638
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:34,176
Stacy's fine dining establishment

639
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:36,736
Are there opportunities for me to

640
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:38,784
I mean it's a better customer experience

641
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:42,624
It also seems like it might be kind of a pain for servers

642
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:44,672
In terms of having to educate the

643
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:45,696
The consumer so

644
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:47,488
How are they looking at this

645
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:48,256
As

646
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,280
Kind of

647
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:52,096
Revenue-generating opportunity or maybe it's

648
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,120
One of those things

649
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:55,424
Things were there like hair designers love it but

650
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,448
The servers are like

651
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:59,520
Oh this is like TVs in the back of a plane where you're like

652
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,568
Pain in the butt

653
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:02,592
I'm a tech perspective

654
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,640
Talk to Consumers about

655
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:06,432
Keep running I don't know

656
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:09,248
We don't know yet

657
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:13,344
I can't breathe

658
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,416
You know what I'm seeing

659
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:21,024
Restaurants

660
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,304
Can happen alone

661
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:28,704
App Store

662
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:35,104
It's not always clear what you do

663
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,944
In general what we see if we give customers

664
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:45,344
Interactive that opens new ones for the retail chain

665
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,928
How to create Interactive

666
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:50,208
Alexa get more

667
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:53,280
Applications

668
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,096
Applications

669
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:05,824
I can see the menu and that's about it

670
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,896
Lighting

671
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:10,944
Connection with Bluetooth connect

672
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:21,440
Mobile application

673
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:22,976
That makes sense I mean that

674
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,792
The Starwood Hotel chain is using

675
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:28,352
Connected locks actually as part of

676
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:31,680
A reason to join the Starwood kind of guest program

677
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:35,008
And that is a really compelling reason to book through them

678
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:41,920
Is that you can actually use your phone to unlock the doors these sorts of kind of real-world interaction

679
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:43,456
Are really

680
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:46,272
Interesting reason to get people to actually use

681
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,040
Who's the apps

682
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:48,832
I will say though

683
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,952
Having 800 apps on your phone for each individual place that you go is still

684
00:30:55,488 --> 00:31:00,864
Not something that I think most people want to do but for like the top 10 places it could be a compelling enough for

685
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,824
Can you do the room

686
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:16,480
You stayed there before

687
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:22,880
Immediately

688
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:26,208
Oh no that would be cool art his star with a customer of yours

689
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:30,048
You're working with a company called

690
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:30,816
Seed

691
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:33,120
It has a protocol called Silver

692
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:34,144
That is

693
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:36,448
The Bluetooth kind of backend for all of the

694
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:39,520
Now my guess is that if

695
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:41,568
Are you integrated with Starwood

696
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:44,384
Are you decided to work with Starwood and

697
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,664
Entitled to their guests

698
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,736
Back-end they have a different Bluetooth back in for their locks

699
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:49,760
This program so

700
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:53,344
Would something like that be difficult to kind of bring together

701
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,624
How how would that work

702
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:59,232
Reason for us

703
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:00,000
Sheet

704
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:04,864
Is that what about lighting

705
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:09,728
We think we know more about LED

706
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:16,640
Palace pets that are home to us but we really like it I want you to use

707
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:23,040
Distributor

708
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:35,840
Bluetooth SmartWatch

709
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:40,704
I think she will help

710
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:43,008
That would be really exciting because

711
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:45,568
Lamps are a great spot to put

712
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:50,432
Presence detection and Bluetooth beacons are kind of something I'm really excited about

713
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,480
And I'm curious

714
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:53,760
With your lights

715
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:58,368
Are beacons something that you're considering kind of presence detection via the

716
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:03,488
It could be for your restaurant customers it could be like in hotels

717
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,352
But once you have kind of a Bluetooth radio you also have the ability to say

718
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:11,680
Hey this phone belongs to Stacy or this

719
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:13,472
Is Stacy's wearable and then

720
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:16,800
Using that information tied to an app on my phone you can

721
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:19,616
You can offer me that that preference that

722
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:21,152
Stacy likes her

723
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:23,456
Her room this way or

724
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:28,320
Last time Stacy was in this restaurant she ordered this maybe you want to offer her a coupon

725
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:31,904
Absolutely

726
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,440
The nice thing is about Lambs

727
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,000
And there's power

728
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:38,816
My definition to every LifePoint so

729
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:45,216
If you talk about Deacons

730
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:47,264
Not long ago on my phone

731
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:51,616
How many Bluetooth

732
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:55,712
It's already

733
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:58,272
So attached to the beacon

734
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,368
It's something that is

735
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:08,000
G-Eazy and I think she lives in India

736
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:10,048
Lives

737
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:12,864
Platform protection sensors

738
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,400
So is that something that

739
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:17,728
Sora does or is that something that see does

740
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:19,776
With their platform like

741
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:21,824
How does that kind of get worked out

742
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:28,736
So anybody integrating sensors into

743
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:31,040
That is something that we would work on it

744
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:37,440
Coming full circle for you guys so these are the first connected products we should see these in the market for you guys at what time

745
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:39,744
I know you're worried you've announced the partnership

746
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,280
So how long till we see

747
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:42,816
Connected sorella's

748
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:46,912
So I expect before this summer

749
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:53,056
2 years

750
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:56,384
Or do you think you'll go all connected like what is the future of your biz

751
00:34:57,408 --> 00:35:03,552
I firmly believe that everything will be clean

752
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,536
You know that there's a lot of stuff

753
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:20,192
Don't be wire homes or don't be why in restaurants and hotels every every two years

754
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,872
Do you know everything that we will sell in two years

755
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:32,224
I will be wirelessly connected

756
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:35,040
I am super excited about kind of pet future

757
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:39,136
And I can't wait for more Bluetooth lamps I kind of like

758
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:40,160
Chafing at the bit

759
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:41,184
To actually

760
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:44,512
I'm sitting here looking at my own house and I'm like

761
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:47,072
Gosh we can rewire a circuit my

762
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:49,120
Yeah I guess

763
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:53,984
We could and I'm like or we could just wait another year and then they'll be Bluetooth lights in my husband to his

764
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,800
A longsuffering man I have to tell you

765
00:35:57,056 --> 00:36:00,128
When it comes to Connected gadgets kind of looks at me with like

766
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:02,176
A little bit of fear in his eyes he's like

767
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:05,504
Yes we could wait for a Bluetooth gadgets

768
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:07,296
Light bulbs

769
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:08,320
I guess

770
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,256
Getting the electrical circuits

771
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:21,120
Replace a dumb b**** is one of my biggest headache

772
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:23,680
Because I wonder likes what insurance pays

773
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:26,752
There's no Outlet there is no

774
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:34,688
Anime

775
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:35,968
And then

776
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:36,736
With

777
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:42,880
Connected lamp

778
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:48,256
But you don't have to worry about

779
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:49,024
Or

780
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:53,120
Implementing

781
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:54,912
That's why I can't wait for

782
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:57,728
This year which is supposed to be the year of Bluetooth so

783
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:00,800
Start launching get those products out in the market

784
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:05,152
Alright in so how long do you think it'll be until you guys have

785
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:07,968
Possibly more than just Bluetooth in your

786
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:09,248
Lamps are we was talking

787
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:12,320

Kind of like sensor Rich lamps in the home in business environment

789
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:19,232
No it will be it'll be quicker than that

790
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:21,536
We're moving as quickly as we can

791
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:27,936
I'll be next year

792
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:35,104
Architecture down it's pretty straightforward

793
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,152
Silento

794
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:39,712
The length of the side by side

795
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,016
So

796
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,672
Smart Launcher

797
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:55,328
Or a light source to become smart we have to ask

798
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:04,800
We we going to leave

799
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:07,616
I love it I agree totally with you

800
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:09,664
You do need sensors for things to be smart

801
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:10,944
So

802
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,528
