00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:13,824
Hey everyone welcome to the Internet of Things podcast which this week will be held on a construction site

2
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:17,920
I am your host Stacey Higginbotham and this is your co-host

3
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:19,200
Kevin tofel

4
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:21,248
And the construction site is mine

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,528
So just

6
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:24,320
You're not under attack

7
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:28,416
I thought maybe you were at the Target near the Metreon and they're expanding the IRT store

8
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:32,256
Or maybe it's Apple getting ready to build their own smart home next door

9
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:36,608
That's not happening y'all that was not an official sanction a rumor

10
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,424
Okay so

11
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:41,728
Got you all excited

12
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,776
But there are really cool things happen

13
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:45,056
Socially start with

14
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:48,128
Google onhub router reviews or should we start with

15
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:50,176
New thermostat

16
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:51,456
Take your pic

17
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:58,368
What's up with Nest cuz you got the information I don't really know what's going on with Nest other than I saw hints of an FCC

18
00:00:58,624 --> 00:00:59,136
Filing that

19
00:00:59,392 --> 00:00:59,904
Eluded

20
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,696
To a new Nest Thermostat

21
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:06,304
Is that the real deal

22
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,352
New 3rd generation

23
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:09,376
Thermostat

24
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:11,168
Is a Slimmer profile

25
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,008
And a 40% larger high-resolution screen

26
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,056
It's party

27
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:19,872
And now my nose looks bulky and ugly

28
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:24,736
Dang it

29
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:26,528
I will not

30
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:27,552
I'm sorry

31
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:28,832
I don't know if they can hear me

32
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:30,112
If it can

33
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:31,648
I'm going to be prepared for

34
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:34,208
I don't know either too warm or too cold sleeping tonight

35
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:36,000
This is what happens when you have to

36
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:38,304
Can the smart things in your house

37
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,352
So it's got new features

38
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:41,632
Including

39
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:42,912
They are calling this one

40
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:45,216
Farsight it automatically displays the

41
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:46,496
Target temperature

42
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:49,056
And the time when it senses movement in the room

43
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,592
And I'm not sure

44
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:52,384
What that means exactly

45
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,176
Oh I can tell you okay you tell me

46
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:57,760
I don't have this but I can tell you that my Nest has nearsighted meaning

47
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:00,832
You have to be back within two to three feet of it

48
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:01,600
Ford

49
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:05,184
The screen to actually open up and display show you the temp in Saint sauveur

50
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,744
So far sight sounds to me like

51
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:11,584
You can like you know being further away from it and the

52
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,376
The screen will actually light up

53
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:16,960
This explains also for people who heard

54
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:19,264
Probably a couple weeks or maybe a month ago

55
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,312
The Apple Store was

56
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:25,664
Seen getting rid of its nest thermostats and everyone's like

57
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,944
Spirits

58
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,736
Google owns Nest Apple Altamonte

59
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:29,760
Yes

60
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:34,112
With apple putting out yunnan pushing homekit what is this mean

61
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:39,232
But really what it meant was that they were clearing inventory the old inventory so

62
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:41,280
When the new Nest came out you could buy

63
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,328
Fresh new Destiny you wouldn't buy one

64
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,120
Today

65
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:45,888
Right before they

66
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,960
So this is actually available

67
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:52,032
Now for 249 the same price as the original nest

68
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,056
Yes

69
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:55,360
As of the time this podcast will Air

70
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,896
This is available now

71
00:02:57,152 --> 00:03:02,784
It'll be available at amazon.com and it will come soon to Best Buy retail store

72
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,320
Google stores

73
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:06,112
And Lowe's the Home Depot

74
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:10,464
Target Verizon Wireless and the retail price is 249

75
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,304
Aren't you tell him

76
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,448
Thank you don't want this better display you can save yourself fifty bucks because they're going to

77
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:22,496
Discount for 2nd generation Nest

78
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:26,848
That's like retailers for 199a suggested retail price money to find a cheaper

79
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,640
So there you have it

80
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,760
Yeah so that's that's the new Nest news very exciting for everyone who

81
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,040
Lexi's nest

82
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,600
Anything else we should know

83
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:40,928
I do people care about how many pixels per inch are on their nest

84
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,464
229

85
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,488
But now they don't

86
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:47,328
That's why I know the new one has 229

87
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,352
Pixels per inch

88
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,120
Is

89
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,912
I wouldn't call it

90
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:55,776
Comprable to the retina displays and such on iPhones and similar devices but it's pretty darn good

91
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:58,336
More than the second

92
00:03:58,848 --> 00:03:59,360
Generation X

93
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,896
If you go

94
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:03,200
Again to me I'm like am I watching

95
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:03,968
YouTube I mean

96
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:08,576
No no no I don't think and I would not recommend

97
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,136
That most people who currently have a nest

98
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:13,440
Upgrade to the new one I don't see the point

99
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:15,744
I don't either unless you're like

100
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,327
Your thermostat has something you're continually running into and the fact

101
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,351
But this is slimmer

102
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,655
Be compelling but

103
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,959
I Don't Think It's $249

104
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:27,519
If you're really running into your nest

105
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:29,055
Currently a lot in your house

106
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,871
I would just save your money and buy their house because

107
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:36,479
I can see by some glasses or stop drinking quite so much during the day

108
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,343
Your kind

109
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,647
So that's the new nest

110
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:44,927
Exciting

111
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:45,695
And

112
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:46,719
That's yes

113
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:51,583
Was it last week that we talked about the onhub router from Google it was tired last night

114
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,375
Oh see this

115
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,399
This maybe be drinking

116
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:56,703
Can too much during the day cuz I don't even remember

117
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:02,847
Because I am so excited

118
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,383
And this router

119
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:07,967
Is Google's router and it has weed inside

120
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:11,039
Which is Google's kind of protocol for The Internet of Things

121
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,319
It also has

122
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,087
Red

123
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:16,159
It supports thread we should say which is

124
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,951
Wireless radio

125
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:21,023
Nest Samsung and several other semiconductor

126
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,047
Companies are pushing

127
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:24,607
As an alternative mesh Network

128
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:25,887
2

129
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:26,911
Zippy

130
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:27,679
Z-Wave

131
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,567
So what we have here are

132
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,103
The reviews are out

133
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:37,919
And actually today today is the day guys

134
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,711
I feel like a dr. Seuss book today's

135
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:42,527
The day you're on your way go to the store

136
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,807
And by 1 today

137
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,879
You can actually buy Google onhub router

138
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:47,647
Yes

139
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:48,415
Today

140
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:51,743
At many locations including the Google Store Walmart

141
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:52,767
And

142
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:54,047
Amazon I believe

143
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:58,399
199 and I was interested in buying one

144
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:03,263
Because I do have while I do have an 8:00 or 2:11.

145
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:06,591
11 AC router that I bought

146
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,895
Timbuktu years ago

147
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,175
AC

148
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:14,271
66 you and I know they've upgraded at once already to the 68 you

149
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:21,183
It's been great for me except the routers in one corner of the house on the second floor and in the opposite corner on the first floor I've got a

150
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,463
4K TV

151
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:24,767
Sketchy with signal

152
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,047
So I thought about it

153
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,583
And then I read the reviews

154
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,119
And I'm not thinking about it anymore

155
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:29,887
Because

156
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,191
I would say they're generally

157
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:34,239
In agreement that it's not that spec

158
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:36,543
Angular the only one I read that was

159
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:40,127
It was with the verge

160
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:42,687
It works really well in his house he

161
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,735
Router issues in his house

162
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,807
That's great I'm happy for Dad

163
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,087
But

164
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,879
Ron Amato guitarist

165
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:57,279
But if you're interested in the actual graphs and charts of actual test of this router versus many others that are out there

166
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,327
At similar price points are even less

167
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:02,399
You can see by the throughput and signal strength this is not up to

168
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,495
So that the big thing here is yes it makes it easy to

169
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:08,287
Set up because it comes with that

170
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:10,079
Software the on software

171
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,359
What

172
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:16,223
ARS Technica is testing worries ma'am and it just doesn't seem like it's going to solve any of my

173
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,247
Current problem

174
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:21,087
Then there's the other thing you've using the back of this thing right

175
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:21,855
I have

176
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:23,903
I will get there

177
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,999
They are lovely pictures however

178
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:30,303
The picture show that there is a definite

179
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,327
Black ports

180
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:37,215
Is there is one USB port that is basically useless right now if you can't connect to

181
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:39,263
Hard drive to router near the storage

182
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,543
There is

183
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,335
S1 internet port

184
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,615
On the back of it

185
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,383
And that's

186
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:50,527
And then while I appreciate that this looks nice and you could put this anywhere in your house and they want you to I want you to put in the middle of your house

187
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,575
Most people don't have their

188
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,599
ISP

189
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:54,623
Hardware

190
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,671
Wiring coming through the middle of their house

191
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:02,047
So you're still got to stick this somewhere in a corner of your house probably for most people

192
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:04,863
What else is on the back of that thing I'm looking for my pictures now

193
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,911
There is there's one additional

194
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,983
Port one Additionally the airport

195
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:15,871
So that brings it to okay Stacy you got X number of hugs here that all to connect to your router.

196
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,687
Or you have to buy it

197
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:19,711
Start Me Up

198
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,735
Switch right

199
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,783
And I actually so i a

200
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:28,159
We already have a switch plugged into my router Plus

201
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:31,231
Four ports

202
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:31,999
Send my router

203
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,559
And they're actually already taken up and I have

204
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,327
Switch

205
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:36,607
With

206
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,143
For additional ports

207
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,935
And those are

208
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:42,751
So you're an edge case I'm

209
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:48,383
Not quite that edge but I manage case as well

210
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,919
Your you're done

211
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:50,687
You have nothing

212
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,711
You have nothing

213
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:54,015
No help for you

214
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:57,343
You have to do the whole switching thing in that takes away from the

215
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,879
Simplicity

216
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,487
It's clear that Google has

217
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,791
High aspirations for this because this has a

218
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:10,143
Say relatively high-end smartphone processor inside from Qualcomm

219
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:10,911
It's got

220
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:15,519
A gig of RAM it's got 4 gigs of storage and I guarantee that is not all four

221
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:17,311
You know that the song

222
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,847
They're going to do something more with

223
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:19,871
Best we know that

224
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:25,247
But you can't do anymore with it just yet and what I want to do with it I really can't

225
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:26,783
Here's what

226
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,319
I didn't see a lot of

227
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,343
What's up

228
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:32,671
I didn't see great things on the software side of

229
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:33,951
Sinner reviews

230
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:37,279
A lot of things I don't like this was kind of a missing issue

231
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,583
Did you end I only saw so I

232
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,423
I read the verge's review I didn't spend a lot of time with ours

233
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,191
Ours is

234
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:44,959
Sweetie

235
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:47,519
Did you see that any coverage of like

236
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:51,103
I did and basically they said

237
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:54,943
It seemed towards Simplicity and the non power user

238
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:59,295
So you know for us you may have to go in and change the NAT tables or

239
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:01,855
You know Pocahontas firewall and so on

240
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,415
I don't know how much we can do here

241
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:07,487
I'm taking less nap tables and firewalls in Moore

242
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:10,815
When I think about a router today in the home

243
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:13,631
I think about a router from list

244
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,423
10 years ago in

245
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,191
A corporate Network

246
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:19,263
So as a parent I want to be able

247
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,799
Not just as a parent but is like

248
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:25,407
Connect network administrator of my home even though I don't think of myself that way

249
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,431
I want to be able to come

250
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,455
Control access to

251
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,223
Add devices

252
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:34,879
I want a software interface that lets me turn off my daughter's Kindle or computer at 8 at night

253
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:41,279
Yeah and as I look through the many many screenshots I know ours has a bunch I know

254
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,815
Some others do as well

255
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,863
I don't see any weight

256
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:48,959
You can prioritize Wifi traffic to a particular device

257
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:53,567
And it does capture the device names and the uploads and downloads

258
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,847
Of data over the past

259
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:57,663
7 days 30 days whatever so you can see

260
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,199
Historical usage

261
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:02,271
Do I see any

262
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:04,063
I don't see any

263
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,599
Setting such as that

264
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:08,671
There's just DNS and wins settings there's

265
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,719
Cloud services and usage stats

266
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,023
What's a good I mean

267
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,351
Oh yeah

268
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,399
I think that's really

269
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:21,727
Important to have that kind of clearly defined

270
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:26,079
Ability to control devices and I also think

271
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:28,895
As iot becomes

272
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:31,455
The router is a great place to

273
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:33,247
Control a lot of devices

274
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:34,527
Like

275
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:36,063
Especially things like gas.

276
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,343
Access

277
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:39,647
That's up where we be great to be like

278
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,671
Hey

279
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:43,999
Sure like the five devices I want my guests

280
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:44,767
Where am I

281
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:45,791
Kids to be able to

282
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:47,839
I don't actually want my

283
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,143
Especially as my daughter gets older

284
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,935
Maybe I don't want her to be able to

285
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:52,703
Control the nest

286
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,471
Because you know

287
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,007
I know when I was a kid

288
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,031
You know I always wanted

289
00:11:56,287 --> 00:12:00,895
Turn my air conditioning down to like 70 in the summer

290
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,199
And that never met her

291
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,735
Talk to me you know so I was just

292
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,015
You know Crank It Down

293
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,039
Going to be like

294
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:09,599
Battlerite

295
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:19,071
You know I'm going based on the reviews I don't have it a unit here right again I thought about buying it but I'm already heading towards not

296
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,351
Waiting to see

297
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:27,007
What they admit you know cuz I again nobody's mentioned any setting and as I look to the screenshots and it's pretty expensive

298
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,055
Bunch of screenshots of the software

299
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:32,127
On hard I don't see what it is that you're looking for

300
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:34,175
And I think it does need to be there

301
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,991
It almost seems to me like they got this thing out there

302
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:39,551
It's a lot of potential

303
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:46,463
The capabilities

304
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:49,535
No Doubt

305
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:52,351
And it looks it looks very kind of

306
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:54,399
Programmable kind of like an egg

307
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:55,679
What kind of a

308
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:57,471
We kind of way to program

309
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,519
So

310
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:01,311
I'm actually considering buying

311
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,359
Although I would say for your problems

312
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,407
Have you considered an access point

313
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:10,783
I actually do have two additional extenders range extender as access point in such so yes

314
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:18,463
Yeah I know I mean I'm not I'm not sucking wind in that that room is just it's not as consistent as I would like because I'm sharing this again

315
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,231
Pushing it

316
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:21,535
No further further access points

317
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,095
That is not ideal

318
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:26,655
I just want something more stable

319
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:29,983
But that's just me you also mentioned

320
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,007
Ziggy

321
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:35,103
You did it because this does

322
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,895
Work with zigbee

323
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:37,919
However

324
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:41,503
I'm looking at again Rotten Tomatoes review

325
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:43,807
Here's here's the deal

326
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:48,927
I'm going to just throw it in here so it supports

327
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:51,999
Sew thread is a wireless protocol.

328
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,023
It's built on

329
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:55,839
The IEEE 802.

330
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,119
15.

331
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:57,887
4

332
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:58,911
Standard

333
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,447
That's standard

334
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,471
What is the same

335
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:02,239
Radio

336
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,007
Precinct

337
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:04,543
So

338
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,567
Zigbee

339
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:08,383
As it is is that radio + software stack

340
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,711
And if use a different software stack

341
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:12,991
It makes it thread

342
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:14,783
So

343
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,575
Because

344
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:18,879
The differentiation is in the software

345
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,415
If you can make the

346
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,951
Two things work

347
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:22,975
Can run

348
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,535
You can

349
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,071
I mean but the question is

350
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,863
Will that eventually happen.

351
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,655
I'm just going to quote Ron here

352
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:34,751
Onhub 02. 15.4 support is close to zigbee

353
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,799
But it isn't compatible with zigbee

354
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:41,151
Zigbee devices can toss out the zucchini label get a software update and join Google team

355
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:44,223
But it doesn't seem like it will make itself compatible with them

356
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:45,759
That makes sense

357
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:47,039
Yep

358
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:53,951
Integrity software and chipsets

359
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,023
Backwards

360
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,303
Compatibility

361
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:02,143
Companies that are using those chips

362
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,679
Update your software

363
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,727
See what it comes down to me is

364
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:11,615
Again a lot of potential here I see where Google is going and I applaud them and I'd like the directions

365
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:14,943
But this gets back to way back when the vehicle came out

366
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,271
I didn't buy the echo in November for $99 because I looked at it like

367
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,807
It's got potential

368
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:22,111
Blackjack no guarantees or it's going to be able to do

369
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,647
You know eventually

370
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:27,743
I came around obviously in got one because of the additional features and things that work

371
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,535
I'm just leery of

372
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:33,631
What I'm getting for dinner dollars right now would I have to wait for and what may never come

373
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:34,911
I am with you on this

374
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,447
I am actually

375
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,775
So this is in my device I don't know about

376
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,823
I know I had it

377
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,359
I have it on my wishlist

378
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,663
And I'm I'm thinking about it and I

379
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:52,319
There's also a Kate Spade handbags

380
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:55,903
And it's basically the handbag

381
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:00,255
Well

382
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:06,655
You're like I really don't know what to say there I'm not sure where to go after that what I'm going to do is

383
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:09,727
I'm actually going to go to the Google store right now

384
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,287
And I'm going to see if there is

385
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:14,847
A 30-day return policy

386
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:18,175
Because that's the only way I would consider doing this

387
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:20,479
What's currently out of stock so it really doesn't matter

388
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:27,135
If it does have a 30 day return policy I will consider buying one and taking the chance for now

389
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,671
I'll look at you

390
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:29,951
Take one for the team

391
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,559
If you go to Amazon right now

392
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:37,119
It's not available right now so it's only

393
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,399
It's $400

394
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:40,959
No it's not cuz I'm not paying that

395
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:44,031
I may have a really good return policy too but I would not

396
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,079
Buy a 3rd party through Amazon

397
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:50,175
I'll wait and see when it comes available and maybe I'll get it

398
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,991
How can eliminate my access points

399
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,039
And still have fantastic coverage

400
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,087
Then it's an upgrade

401
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:59,391
But that's a lot to pay for that upgrade

402
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,183
With more potential

403
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:01,951
You know

404
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:03,999
It's true in

405
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,535
It's designer

406
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,559
Living room

407
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,583
Speaker

408
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:13,471
Is there a microphone out there's no microphone I've already looked at Maaco here's their answer to the echo

409
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:14,495
There's no microphone

410
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:16,287
Kadai enabling

411
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:19,103
Smartphone app that you talk to your phone and then

412
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:21,407
Maybe but

413
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:27,807
3 watt speaker Echo 15 watt speaker

414
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:31,647
Will in the here's here's the deal I've been waiting for this

415
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,927
And I don't know if it's actually

416
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:36,767
Make it in time or what there's a there's other wi-fi system

417
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,559
That I've been waiting for

418
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,095
It's called the Eero

419
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,631
Ber

420
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:43,423
And that's not going to come out

421
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,727
December 1st 2015 butt

422
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:48,287
Amazing

423
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,567
From a router stand for

424
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:50,847
For the internet

425
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,407
Thanks

426
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:59,551
It's a pretty sweet handbag

427
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:07,743
199 for the individual

428
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,303
The back has the same two

429
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,071
To Port problem

430
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:16,191
You can buy a three pack that has these access points

431
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:18,751
What are designed to solve what your problem is

432
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:19,775
Gotcha

433
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:20,543
So

434
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,615
Decisions decisions

435
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:28,735
I know I'm really excited though that Wi-Fi is actually finally becoming like the thing it should be which is

436
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:31,807
A recognition that it's super important

437
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:32,575
We still in

438
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:37,439
What is dead zones that we're trying to solve

439
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:41,023
Too much time talking about Wi-Fi

440
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,047
What is so important

441
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,399
Let's go into this new sensor thing because I am super

442
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,167
Interested

443
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,959
I don't know if you

444
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:53,823
Is this the sensors that make that according Cordon ApplianceSmart

445
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,359
From LG

446
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:00,991
Good lunch

447
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:02,271
Like I said

448
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,295
Lunch to Spanish

449
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:07,135
Smart brilliant

450
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:10,975
I'm so these are LG's new smart

451
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:11,999
Fix'd sensor

452
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:13,791
This is ifacs

453
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:17,887
Just this week and next will probably be talking about last stuff that I have Hader

454
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:20,959
Everything about today are at the LG sensor

455
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:21,983
Quickly and then

456
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,031
SmartThings coming on later

457
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:24,799
In the show

458
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:28,383
So this is the sensor it's a circular sensor you can stick it

459
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:29,663
On things in

460
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:32,223
It sent you a notification to your smartphone

461
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:37,855
Twining

462
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,207
So

463
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,487
I'm trying to see what's

464
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,535
Pretty sure this has all join

465
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:50,143
You don't want that kind of cool so that kind of opens it up a little bit

466
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:54,751
Supposed to like some of these older DIY

467
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,543
Tech savvy.

468
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:00,383
I'm hoping that when they officially debut this

469
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:04,991
Words free that would be better

470
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,271
No I hope that

471
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:08,831
Very quickly there's an if this then that channel

472
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:10,879
Alex gets to support this somehow

473
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:14,719
Maybe I mean with all joined what would be really cool is

474
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:16,511
This actually so

475
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,303
LG TVs already

476
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,071
Support

477
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,863
And I know not everybody has an LG

478
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,143
Letv but

479
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,167
Certain

480
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,959
Android phones can support

481
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:25,983
So

482
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,775
If you start looking at things like that

483
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:29,055
Maybe even cooler

484
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:32,895
Instead of having an assistant that channel for like my mom

485
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:34,943
Nativist better I agree

486
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:38,783
This suddenly just gives you a notification on your TV hey your washer

487
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:39,807
Stop

488
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:44,415
Oh crap I was just in the best part of the show

489
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:48,767
That's exactly what they're going after here

490
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:49,535
For people who

491
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:53,375
You don't know what these could be used for him and you can put it on the fridge and they say yeah

492
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:58,751
Send notification when a food item is about to expire or how many times the doors open

493
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:03,615
It's just about capturing data from these appliances which is interesting

494
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:04,895
I like it

495
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:14,623
Homeowners to use their smartphones to set the cooking mode temperature and cooking time for a given dish

496
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:17,184
I don't know how it actually implements that

497
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,488
I'm assuming that's on an LG oven

498
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,328
That's my suspicion because they even care

499
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:27,168
Sorry if I ever

500
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:29,984
Now they also have a smart air conditioner as well

501
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,008
Okay

502
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,544
Plastic lettuce.

503
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:33,568
Proprietary

504
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,592
Yeah soup

505
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:38,688
Not a retrofit

506
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:39,456
Bossa Nova

507
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:40,480
Okay

508
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:41,248
So

509
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,272
There we go

510
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,296
I was excited

511
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:46,112
Sorry to burst your bubble

512
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:48,160
My bubble can't stay Bruce for Long Beach

513
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:50,208
Also this week

514
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,232
Starting

515
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:52,256
Today

516
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:53,792
Hey you guys

517
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:55,584
If you go to smartthings.com

518
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,352
Order

519
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,376
And receive

520
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:59,168
The Next Generation huh

521
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:03,520
For $99 you can get the

522
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:05,568
42409 you can get a

523
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,848
A package of

524
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,640
Hub Essentials

525
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:09,664
Hub Essentials that is

526
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,432
That's not what I meant

527
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:11,968
Looking for a house

528
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:13,248
Security Essentials

529
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:15,296
So the new Hub is out

530
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:20,160
It is not homekit certified so I was speculating did

531
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,184
I was wrong

532
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:24,512
Tell us later on in the show

533
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:26,304
I guess it's Alex Hawkinson

534
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,840
CEO of SmartThings

535
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:30,144
He will tell us that it was actually

536
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:34,240
For international distribution and

537
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:36,544
Rebuilding entire app

538
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,336
From scratch

539
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:42,944
Cause of delays

540
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,040
We asked him about that so stay tuned to understand

541
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:47,808
Why that's not

542
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:50,368
Does he also

543
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:52,928
Tell you what's difference in this house

544
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,208
Of course he does

545
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:58,304
The short answer is

546
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:00,352
It has a battery backup

547
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:02,400
It has its own brains

548
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:05,472
So the previous version doesn't have an arm processor

549
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:08,032
So basically when it goes offline

550
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:10,336
It can think for itself so

551
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,872
Your programs will still run

552
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:13,152
I can't even do that

553
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:17,248
So that that's

554
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:18,272
Crucial difference

555
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:20,320
It has Z-Wave

556
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:22,112
I believe that will support

557
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:23,648
It adds Bluetooth

558
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,608
Other stuff so the new service it's going to

559
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:34,656
New services including

560
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:36,192
It supports

561
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:37,728
Video cameras for the first time

562
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,360
The services that they built

563
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:47,200
And what else do we want to know about smart things

564
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:50,272
I don't know but for 99 bucks

565
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:52,320
Just met order one

566
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:54,112
Dude is a great hub

567
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:56,160
The wink

568
00:23:56,416 --> 00:24:00,256
I have a shoe release you said to me just before the show Hugh really only does lice so that's

569
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:04,864
Not too exciting so I can take the Hue out and put the SmartThings in there

570
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:07,680
She still has to

571
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:08,704
Prudential

572
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:09,728
With all of these

573
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:12,032
So much of that router

574
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,312
CC

575
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:14,848
Don't just go get a switch

576
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:18,688
The reason I'm excited because SmartThings

577
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:22,528
SmartThings is not supported on the Amazon Echo

578
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:24,064
Yes and you know what I have

579
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:28,672
No shield for SmartThings which means you can make

580
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:32,000
To work with your smart thing

581
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:33,280
If you're so inclined

582
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:34,816
Interesting

583
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:35,584
Which

584
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,936
You know if you're a DIY kind of person which some people on the show are

585
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:42,496
Not just on the show

586
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:48,640
You can actually make some crazy stuff this is not something that I do necessarily but

587
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:49,664
You Kevin

588
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:52,480
So maybe maybe I could

589
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:58,880
Ask my echo if the stock market arctis a how's the stock market doing and through the smart things are dino

590
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:04,512
We could light up green yellow or red depending on if the market Valpo down or unchanged

591
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:06,560
Sea or lake

592
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:08,864
Your house could go into like lockdown

593
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:16,032
You could prepare the apocalypse right there I am so prepared for the zombie apocalypse is not even

594
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:16,800
Funny

595
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:19,616
Just ask the people at Costco how much water we have bought in the last year

596
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:21,408
Water in canned goods

597
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:22,944
Can't wait

598
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,224
Bring it on zombies

599
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:29,600
So you know most people use it to make like homemade garage door openers that

600
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:30,624
Thanks but you know

601
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,392
You do what you want

602
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:35,744
I like to make little pretty lights blink

603
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,024
So there is

604
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:37,792
There's what you

605
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:39,072
I can do that with that

606
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:39,840
And

607
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:41,120
Yeah I think

608
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:48,544
Alright well let's hear more from from Alex cuz you got all the details

609
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,824
Stay tuned for that

610
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:59,552
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast and today

611
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:03,392
We have on our show Alex Hawkinson who is the CEO of smart things

612
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:04,416
Hey Alex

613
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:05,696
Hey Stacy

614
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:08,256
So good to have you here so

615
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:11,584
Last week actually Kevin and I talked about the integration of

616
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:14,144
SmartThings with Amazon Echo and

617
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:17,984
This week we talked about the new SmartThings that is coming out

618
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,008
Actually

619
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:25,408
Now for people who will buy it online and then in October for people who want to buy it on retail stores show

620
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:27,456
Retail store shelves

621
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:29,248
It's probably a graceful way to say that so

622
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,296
Congratulations

623
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:32,832
Yeah thanks it's been a

624
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:33,856
A big year

625
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:37,696
A lot of heads down work and getting ready for this so we're really excited to have the next

626
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:40,256
Next version to product in the platform out the door

627
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:42,816
See I was going to say it's been a long time coming

628
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,936
You can tell I'd I'm not trained by anyone to say things politely

629
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:50,496
People avoid me at parties

630
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:53,824
You guys actually have been

631
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,616
Pretty heads down pretty quiet

632
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:56,640
4

633
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:58,432
Actually like the last year so

634
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,736
I've been working on the new platform

635
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:03,552
We were expecting it back in May so

636
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:06,880
What happened what have you guys been doing and then

637
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:08,672
I'm going to say what took you so long

638
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:14,048
Oh you know just getting everything ready for the global scale now

639
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:20,448
Since we merged with Samsung a year ago you know the opportunity to scale up all the way

640
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:22,752
Around the world this is in front of us now and

641
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:24,032
Realized

642
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:26,336
You know announce the new Hobbit CS

643
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:27,360
But then we looked across the

644
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:30,944
The platform and realized you wanted to do much more and bring it all together

645
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,736
So not just the new hot but new

646
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:33,760
Devices

647
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:37,344
I totally new person at the Avenue video platform

648
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,624
And then of course please

649
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,720
Distribution channels for the make it accessible to people in the US send

650
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:44,256
And now beginning in

651
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:46,816
In the UK and send them to you as well

652
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:49,888
So you're right that is that is a lot going on

653
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:52,192
And since we actually

654
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:54,496
This last week we talked about you guys being

655
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,544
The granddaddy of smart

656
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:58,336
DIY smart home moving

657
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:04,480
Surreal to me because it still feels like it's gone so quickly you don't have to

658
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:09,600
Wake up everyday and realize that again remind myself it was just three years ago

659
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:12,928
You know that our our Kickstarter campaign is actually went live on August

660
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:13,696
XXII

661
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:14,976
2012

662
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:16,000
And

663
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:21,120
33 years ago that were in the middle of the kickstarter campaign and not notice or knowing if we're going to tip

664
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,656
Yeah and so on and it

665
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:23,936
That's really been a whirlwind

666
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:24,960
Since then.

667
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:25,984
Of course now

668
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,776
Tucson news very quickly and

669
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:29,824
3 years is a is a lifetime

670
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,616
You know we didn't know about a lot of things

671
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:33,152
Things that happened in Market

672
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:33,920
At that time

673
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:37,504
Let's jump in our time machine and go back a little bit because

674
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,808
I think it's worth kind of exploring

675
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,624
What has changed and how your philosophies

676
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,648
Changed because

677
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:46,976
The I actually recently picked up my SmartThings

678
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:48,256
Hub an app

679
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:51,072
After kind of a bit of a Hiatus with

680
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:52,608
The whole Amazon thing and I was like

681
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,400
Oh man you know

682
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:57,472
I've long bulbs SmartThings because of your open philosophy

683
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,080
And that has been my favorite and I recommend it to anybody who has

684
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:04,896
A lot of technical expertise in a lot of patients

685
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,432
Because

686
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:08,480
To me it's kind of like the Android of the smart

687
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:09,504
The sense that

688
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:12,320
My God it will work with anything

689
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:14,368
But you kind of have to be willing to work with it a little

690
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:15,904
It's not exactly

691
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:17,184
Intuitive

692
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:18,208
I'm sorry I

693
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,488
I'm so sorry

694
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:23,840
But it does require you to like really be like I know what I want to do

695
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:26,912
Erica Robertson dead.

696
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:29,984
It's been a big fight at point of the new launch but yeah you know

697
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,008
If you want to talk about this

698
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:31,776
History

699
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:36,896
I think the vision for the company's been consistent throughout and putting with this new launch you know we always

700
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:42,272
Yeah I had to sweat in my family house in the mountains and it was shocked back in

701
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,064
Zack and 2000

702
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,648
11 when I didn't realize that it was happening

703
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,696
How can be how can the world

704
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:52,512
Connected in a way that other things are

705
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:57,888
Jesse our smartphones and the initial Vision was going to try to make this easy enough for

706
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:02,752
Everyday People to get access to you but really realize also that the Innovation was

707
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:03,776
Income from

708
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:09,152
A worldwide movement of developers and device makers send to all sorts of other things in

709
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:10,688
It isn't open plateau

710
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:12,992
Farm so easy and open of all has been at the heart

711
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:14,016
Of SmartThings

712
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:18,112
And your your top use cases are security energy-saving inconvenience

713
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,392
And then

714
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:21,184
What you would call sign in

715
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:22,208
Entertainment

716
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,512
I think during sex

717
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:25,280
Monitoring

718
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:26,304
Dirty I don't

719
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,632
Like to just focus on security cuz it really is just out of answering the Clash

720
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:30,912
Is everything okay

721
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:35,520
In my home at this moment send that's a universal need and it's by far the

722
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:37,312
The top starting point then after that it

723
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:40,128
We said comfort and savings so kind of making it

724
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:44,480
Simple to be comfortable while saving money and the thermostat selenium

725
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:48,320
Example. There's lots of others by using energy rides and then

726
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:52,928
Bizaardvark episode of convenience and entertainment trying together its fans things that

727
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:59,584
May or may not save you money but people love them for lots of different reasons I connected lighting and then things that entertain you or make your stay

728
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,352
Please come to life

729
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,120
Like

730
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:07,776
Can I get audio then send more so those are the big three I wanted to kind of get to this idea because

731
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:12,640
A lot of other companies have had to do this in the space which is building a developer community

732
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:13,920
And then wrangling it

733
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:15,200
In front of everyone

734
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:18,272
I'm in front of your users in front of the press in front of

735
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:19,808
Everyone in

736
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:24,160
I actually think you guys have done it really well you've been very graceful as a comfy

737
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:24,928
Company doing this

738
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,720
And I would love to get

739
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:29,536
Sense of how you guys have done this

740
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:31,072
Speakwrite

741
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:33,376
I'm most of it is where were

742
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:34,144
Straddling

743
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,472
Set of two competing things seen as being easy and being open

744
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:40,544
You can be a toll against each other in some way

745
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:45,664
To be easier it's right something to close things down and try to make it narrower and narrower

746
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:47,968
But you know it's really this

747
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:48,736
Unconscious

748
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:50,016
Amaze to buy

749
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:53,344
The developer community in what they're doing

750
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:58,720
With the platform and all the things we didn't think of that are really meaningful in Prosecco

751
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:00,000
You know in everyday life

752
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:02,816
Frontier that easy nothing vision

753
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:05,120
Has always been at the heart of the company but it's

754
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:11,520
It's always it's fundamentally they pull in each Direction because developers want to do new stuff so that's not necessarily

755
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:13,056
The mainstream

756
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,592
I need queso

757
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:16,640
Enterprise at the heart of it I guess it

758
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:23,040
It took a while as you saw in the first-person the product and then we went through some decorations and now getting to this full revamp of the u.s.

759
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:25,344
Blacks but it hardens probably are

760
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:26,880
Are certification

761
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:27,904
Program

762
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:28,928
And

763
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:33,280
All the processes we built around that so developers start to get a sandbox

764
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:34,560
I can do whatever they want

765
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:37,888
But it's not exposed to all the other consumers in the ecosystem

766
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:39,680
And then we've created this

767
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:41,728
This really rebuff process where is smelt

768
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:42,752
Just want to share

769
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:43,776
With the can

770
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:50,176
Consumers and publish their Innovations for the devices are apps are now apps can have a ufi user experience inside of

771
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:52,992
May nap if you will

772
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:55,552
They have to go to the certification program

773
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:56,832
Not now includes

774
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:58,624
Security privacy checks

775
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,184
Enough putting it into the taxonomy

776
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,024
Consumers can understand where it goes and how it extends their lives

777
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:08,608
I think we're still in the early stages but thanks for the company

778
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:11,680
If we can't make the two sides the

779
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:15,264
Ecosystem easy and open both work then

780
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,824
You know I'll feel like we failed the position of the company

781
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:22,688
We're dead set on making it happen I'm sure but this next iteration

782
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:24,224
You'll get a lot more feedback

783
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,248
Is this looks like

784
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,784
This actually looks like

785
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:30,112
The version of the product that's probably going to hopefully push it into the mainstream

786
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:37,024
This user experience kind of concept in how your

787
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:38,560
Cuz this also

788
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:41,632
Touches on how you guys are introducing services

789
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:43,168
So there's kind of a lot to unpack here

790
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:43,936
Care of it

791
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:45,984
A new service

792
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:49,568
That you guys are launching as part of your security and monitoring

793
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,360
One of your security and monitor

794
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:52,384
Offering

795
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,200
So why don't you describe that for us and then we'll talk about like

796
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:56,224
How developers can

797
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:58,016
Sure

798
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:58,784
So

799
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:04,928
That there's a lot to unpack I mean in a nutshell what we're launching is we called smart home monitor and there's

800
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,512
I literally new kicks that goes on the retail shelves called the

801
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:10,560
Home monitoring kit that lets you

802
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:11,584
Answer that

803
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,608
Problem is everything

804
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:13,376
Okay at home

805
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:17,216
And it is made to be incredibly simple it's got its

806
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:18,240
User

807
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:19,520
Grant's inside of our app

808
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:21,312
It's very centered on

809
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:23,104
I'm answering that question

810
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:26,432
With that comes a premium service that's totally optional

811
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,200
Which is

812
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:29,248
Adding Bisquick video

813
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:33,344
Recording for connected video cameras and we did that in a very I think Innovative way

814
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:35,392
Consumer cell

815
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:36,928
It's unlimited clip

816
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:39,232
Recording where if they have connect

817
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:40,512
The cameras when an event

818
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:43,072
Checkers near house like the door opens in their way

819
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:45,376
It can take a snapshot of

820
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:46,144
That that's been

821
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,424
Acute up on our hub

822
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,192
And

823
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:52,288
See see what happened before and after the events and do that for any number of connected cameras

824
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:54,336
Tendency that way to be clear

825
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,104
4

826
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,408
People to get this they actually have

827
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:58,688
To buy the new hub

828
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,224
For $99

829
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:01,248
And then

830
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:03,040
You also have to buy the

831
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:05,088
But the additional new sensors

832
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:07,648
Which would be that whole kit for 249

833
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:08,928
You have to have the new hub.

834
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:10,208
That's true because we

835
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:11,744
We don't let the data from these

836
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,120
These cameras leave your house unless you physically requested or there's an incident they're not all the streaming

837
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:18,912
Because we found a lot of people.

838
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:19,680
Didn't want that

839
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:22,496
A model so it needs a new hub

840
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:25,056
But anybody that buys that and then I ended up working

841
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:28,896
A camera that works with it initially it's a lineup of Samsung

842
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:34,016
Cameras and D-Link cameras and then I will be over others but it's part of a broader Ark

843
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:36,320
We found that the Developers

844
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:37,856
You want to not just

845
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:42,976
Still device Integrations to make new devices work or a new what we've called smart apps

846
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:44,768
Historically which is for the behind-the-scenes

847
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,584
Rules or recipes or

848
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:52,192
Whatever your analogy is that run behind the scenes in SmartThings sensor to make

849
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:56,032
Yeah but they lights come on in response to the other things like that but now

850
00:35:56,544 --> 00:36:01,152
We found this big desire to make life better for consumers by adding the services and

851
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:02,688
We created a mechanism

852
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:03,456
4

853
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:05,504
Using our own developer tools

854
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,552
We built this smart home monitor

855
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:11,136
Lippitt Hall uri inside of our app and now developers have access

856
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:11,904
It's not

857
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:12,928
As well as

858
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:15,488
And so we haven't announced them yet but we

859
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:21,120
See a proliferation starting to happen where there's this opportunity to launch Services that's all

860
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:23,424
Consumer problems and make life better

861
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:26,496
Upper people and the model will be

862
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:31,872
The developers have a chance to make money from that will take a small Revenue share that is similar to an app store

863
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:36,224
A model and you never really excited about it cuz it lets

864
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:42,880
What's a guy knows those mainstream consumers let them see a solution in place whatever that might

865
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:46,720
Be rather than it being the sort of gadgety things that run behind the scenes

866
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:48,768
So I could always set up

867
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:51,328
The smart home monitoring

868
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:53,376
But what I would pay for it

869
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:58,240
Where is the ability to store those clips for an extended amount of time from any of my cameras

870
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:01,312
Correct yes

871
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:04,640
As the solution inside of inside of smart things that you buy the smart come

872
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:05,920
The home monitoring kit

873
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:09,760
You can do it for free forever and if you have connected cameras

874
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:13,088
Streaming from them and then you get a trial of this

875
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,368
Premium

876
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,648
The clip recording

877
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,184
DVR service

878
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:22,816
And the ability to escalate to friends and family and so on and all that that is part of the page

879
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:25,376
It service and we don't know what the pricing is

880
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:26,144
Going to be on that

881
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:33,056
We haven't announced it but it's even my commitment as its you know part of making it easy is making it so accessible

882
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:38,944
That's going to alienate some of your partners who might also have a Services Revenue option so

883
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,480
I know that today

884
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:43,296
You guys don't have like a formal works with nest

885
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:45,344
For example but their nest cam

886
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,648
Has a Services model where

887
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:48,672
You can pay

888
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:49,696
X amount

889
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:50,720
I think it's

890
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:52,768
$10 a month for unlimited

891
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:53,792
Cloud storage

892
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:58,400
So if I look at what you might charge

893
00:37:59,168 --> 00:37:59,936
And if I have a nest

894
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:02,752
Wait a second

895
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,056
I'll just store the interesting mon

896
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:07,104
Events for my SmartThings system

897
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,664
Finessed me look at you guys and be like you know what

898
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,432
SmartThings

899
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:11,456
Never

900
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:15,040
I hope that's not the case I mean it

901
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:16,576
Again we I think we have

902
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:17,600
The most open

903
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:20,160
That's of any platform out there so

904
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:21,440
Even our own

905
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:22,464
Services

906
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:27,328
Solutions which we're just trying to do it right by the consumer and make things easier for them but

907
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:30,144
Those are all published as exam

908
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,496
Samples in our developer tools they're all built with our own developer tools and

909
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:41,152
I'm sitting this test but I use for what an open model looks like but if others built a connected device with it

910
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:42,176
Sun premium service

911
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:43,968
We love to expose.

912
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:45,248
In the platform

913
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:47,552
And so without talking to nest

914
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:50,368
Yes specifically you know about their devices but

915
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:52,416
In a sum of their approach has

916
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:54,720
Then as open as we would love

917
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:55,488
To see

918
00:38:55,744 --> 00:39:01,888
So how you know from my standpoint I want to give consumers maximum choice I don't think it's one size fits

919
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:05,984
And you know we'll let the marketplace in the developer because

920
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,288
System consumers decide for themselves

921
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:09,312
What they want

922
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:10,336
And

923
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,896
Let's while we're on the topic of devices

924
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:19,040
What kind of devices are going to be working with your new Hub in platform that we should be excited

925
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:20,576
At this point were

926
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:22,112
About 200

927
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:22,880
Compatible

928
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:26,720
Devices that consumers can all Discover right within our new app

929
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:30,304
And we talked back at CES

930
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,352
That you had mentioned that you guys were

931
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:35,936
Interested and supportive of homekit which is Apple's

932
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:37,984
Kind of standard in this space

933
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,824
We actually even talked about being interested in supporting thread on the new

934
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:43,616
So

935
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:45,152
Where Do We Stand assist

936
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:46,176
Is this

937
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:47,200
Sublet out

938
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:50,016
I don't believe it's hunk it certified so what happened there

939
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:52,832
You know I I love Zeppelin

940
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:54,112
Virus

941
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:54,880
Products

942
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:57,184
Apple products use a lot of them myself

943
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,744
Considering placing our customer base and

944
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,768
And I think that

945
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,304
It was funny after the

946
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,096
Integration of Samsung

947
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:06,144
The first iOS bugs that came out in

948
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:06,912
Spell community

949
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:07,680
Initially like

950
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:09,728
See I knew it you know but then we

951
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:11,776
Continue to iterate

952
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:13,056
And have a very big debt

953
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:15,360
Team around it Monster Apple Watch app

954
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:17,408
Yeah completely committed

955
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,712
I'm with homekit you know I think the

956
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:26,112
The disappointments so far we've been watching really carefully is been the proprietary Hardware components that you need in it

957
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:27,392
And we haven't seen the value

958
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:30,464
Yes in that ecosystem does not mature enough yet

959
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,232
So

960
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:32,256
It's not

961
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:37,120
The homekit chip isn't in the tub this new Hub can be expanded

962
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:43,776
Of your ports on the back so we're looking at it carefully and I'm totally open-minded about homekit in the future it's just

963
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:45,312
Still in the really early stages

964
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,080
So

965
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:47,616
Indeed it's not

966
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:49,920
Homekit certified the bunny hop

967
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:51,200
I yelled at this point

968
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:54,272
Standard scene I really all the scene SmartThings

969
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:55,552
Horsham clinic VA

970
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:56,320
Gnostic

971
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:57,600
Soldan's DeWitt

972
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:58,624
So

973
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,440
In cases like thread will say

974
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:02,720
French leaving weave

975
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:09,376
And others this Hub is LSA future ready for a lot of these things so as the red becomes means

976
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:10,912
Stream are Hub and devices

977
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:11,936
Portage

978
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:13,984
And then there's other emerging stand

979
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,824
That were very involved in some of the older ones like sigelei

980
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:24,224
Which is matured a lot of the last three years you know we're on the board for zigbee we're on the board for Z-Wave and we're trying to shape all these things

981
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,248
Directions that

982
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:28,832
Makes things easy for consumers and make it open for

983
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:32,160
Developers going to start charging you a quarter every time you say easy in open

984
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:36,000
Eugene open

985
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:37,024
That's my pocket song

986
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,816
You're like I'm just going to throw it out there

987
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:41,888
Demanding radio

988
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:44,704
Alright for that one

989
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,984
I want Lutron

990
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:49,312
And that one

991
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:51,360
Give me a test you know we see the actress

992
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:52,128
System emerging

993
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:54,431
I think the open model is

994
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:55,711
Is winning but I

995
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:59,551
You know you don't see in all cases of the other large companies

996
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:01,855
In space we don't see them all with a pure

997
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:03,135
Model that we

998
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:04,159
Be best

999
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:05,439
So we try to hammer

1000
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:10,303
Sam of those those two messages every every time we sent

1001
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:13,119
Especially without using the words easy and open but let's see what happens

1002
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:15,423
How have you fared

1003
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:17,471
Under a Samsung's ownership

1004
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:19,263
Especially

1005
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:23,871
You know that you you mentioned Apple obviously and people were very skeptical there like

1006
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:25,919
Given their relationship

1007
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:26,943
That's kind of dicey

1008
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:28,991
But I think it's the

1009
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:30,015
As other

1010
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:31,807
Companies enter the Smart Home

1011
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:34,879
You know I'm even thinking like appliances and

1012
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:36,415
Televisions

1013
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:39,743
Are you finding that companies

1014
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:41,535
Speaker companies especially

1015
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:45,375
Are a little nervous or skeptical about working with you guys

1016
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:47,423
No I mean it's been

1017
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:48,191
Honestly

1018
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:50,751
This has been just the opposite it was what I was most paranoid

1019
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:53,055
About when we decided to go forward

1020
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:56,639
With the acquisition we we wanted to do it to reach Matchbox

1021
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:59,711
Scale cuz we've always felt like we have this chance to

1022
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:02,271
Bring our platform instead of change the world

1023
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:03,039
Dubai

1024
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:04,319
Bringing together consume

1025
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:05,343
Sun Developers

1026
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:06,111
True that

1027
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:08,415
Model those two words

1028
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:09,695
I talked to you earlier but

1029
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:11,999
I'm in Samsung has incredible reach

1030
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:12,767
Around the world

1031
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:14,047
1 scale opportunities but

1032
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:17,631
You know how to keep it I was worried about it staying completely pure and opa

1033
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:21,727
I'm so if maintain SmartThings as a separate company you know we have our own offices we

1034
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:24,287
Do things that are first principles like

1035
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:30,943
We Samsung uses the same as a partner uses the same developer tools and certification price

1036
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:34,527
But anyone else does on the outside so there's no

1037
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:38,111
Favoritism towards their devices in our model on

1038
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:42,463
Customer privacy and so on is Sanford developers this you own your own data

1039
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:44,767
Answer that applies internally as well

1040
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:48,095
It's actually not used in an available to anyone else so

1041
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:55,007
All these policies I think of kept us open and then we seen what's great is that the ecosystems loves the scaling

1042
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:57,823
Trinity so the chance to go out and serve reach more

1043
00:43:58,335 --> 00:44:00,127
People touch deeper into the home

1044
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:03,711
Make this more inexpensive through the manufacturing scale

1045
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:07,295
God and so on so I think it's been

1046
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:09,343
The belief will be an execution now

1047
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:10,879
That we are out in the market

1048
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:12,415
Continue to demonstrate

1049
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:13,695
That openness

1050
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:14,719
But I think

1051
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:20,095
Consumers and developers will really realize the benefits of the the scale knows we're in millions of households

1052
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:22,655
Well think about the opportunity that that creates

1053
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:25,471
If you're craving services on top of the platform to

1054
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:27,007
Reach additional consumer

1055
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:29,823
Berserker creating new device to get it rapid exposure

1056
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:33,663
Guitar bass cell really excited.

1057
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:36,479
No I'm not saying that he's not

1058
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:37,759
But I

1059
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:39,807
I'm confident that we're on the path

1060
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:40,831
To be

1061
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:44,671
You know even in this past year you know continue to grow really well

1062
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:45,951
The company

1063
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:51,071
You know it's four times the size that it was at the time of the acquisition and the developer ecosystem is really

1064
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:53,119
Really accelerated end

1065
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:56,191
I would mention the consumer numbers but you know the smart home is

1066
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:58,751
Living right now past

1067
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:01,055
The early adopters into that

1068
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:02,591
Really majority so

1069
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,127
Weihai

1070
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:10,783
Good timing and we have a lot of resources to help educate people around the world about what we're doing

1071
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:12,575
You're going to get me your numbers I know it

1072
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:16,415
Alright well thank you so much for coming on the show this

1073
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:20,511
Thank you Stacey I was enjoyed and love to talk to you and your

Maybe her not familiar Alex was actually

1078
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:28,191
I think the second guest on the

1079
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:31,263
The iot podcast many many years ago

1080
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:34,847
Bullock back together and say back in the day

Get out at some point so I can't believe you called me the grand far off the grandfather of

1082
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:44,063
The grandparent of the SMART Notebook and what what's it going to be in a few years we'll see

1083
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:47,135
The great granddaddy

1084
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:47,903
Good Lord

1085
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:49,183
Wow
