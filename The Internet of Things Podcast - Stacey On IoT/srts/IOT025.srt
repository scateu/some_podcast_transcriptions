00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:09,984
Hey everyone welcome to the internet

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,776
Things podcast

3
00:00:12,032 --> 00:00:12,800
Stacey Higginbotham

4
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:14,336
Is your co-host

5
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:15,360
Kevin tofel

6
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:17,152
Today's podcast we have

7
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:20,224
So much stuff for you we promised we talked about Apple

8
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:22,272
A crazy access

9
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:23,552
Point from Samsung

10
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:24,576
And we have

11
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:26,880
Salesforce getting into the Internet of Things

12
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:27,904
And

13
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:31,488
Kevin we get to find out about his onhub router

14
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:32,256
Experience

15
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:34,048
Yes

16
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:36,096
And our guest this week is Paul Masson

17
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:40,960
And he is with Ping Identity and we're going to talk about creating and identity layer for The Internet of Things

18
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:43,008
Okay so let's start with Apple

19
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:44,544
What did we hear from Apple

20
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,616
At home kit about their show that we were so eager for

21
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:48,384
Last week

22
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,152
Kevin

23
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:51,200
I can sum it up in one

24
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:51,968
Word

25
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:52,992
And that where it is

26
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:54,016
Nothing

27
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:54,784
Yeah

28
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,600
It was a real bummer I'm going to be honest

29
00:00:58,112 --> 00:00:59,392
It's it's kind of it

30
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:03,744
Interesting him and what does it say about where they're at with the platform in

31
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:06,304
You've written several stories in the past several months

32
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:09,120
About how the challenges are with the

33
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:15,008
The platform requirements Apple security requirements the hardware that's needed to be home to get certified

34
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:15,776
And

35
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:22,176
Apple you know it's probably said no everything's fine you know we're just we're just had flow products at WWDC

36
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:24,992
Yeah but

37
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:26,016
I would have thought

38
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:32,416
Especially with the new Apple TV that they did announce as well as new iPhones new iPads and everything else and watch over

39
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:33,440
Os2

40
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:36,256
Oh I thought they would have done

41
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:40,096
Homekit demo at some Home Care partner and some announcements

42
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:46,752
In fairness though I don't know if you saw the event Stacey but it was about two and a half hours log there was a lot of stuff

43
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:52,640
In it so it's possible that it just wasn't enough to Warrant a spotlight on the stage

44
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:53,664
So

45
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,200
What I'm hearing is

46
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:56,992
There's been a lot of back-and-forth

47
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:59,296
There's been a lot of

48
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:00,576
Between the Apple

49
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:02,112
The chip suppliers

50
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:04,416
And the actual vendors of the

51
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,440
Connected products

52
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:07,744
What's been going on behind the scenes

53
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,280
What is people have been

54
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:10,816
Building and testing

55
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,632
During the test things have come back

56
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:14,912
Not working the way there

57
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,216
And so they have to go back to the drawing

58
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:18,752
Not all the way back

59
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:20,032
Necessary that the chip layer

60
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:24,384
But this is a lot harder basically what's happening is Apple's trying to build

61
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:26,688
An entire ecosystem

62
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:27,968
Behind the curtains

63
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:31,040
It certainly does seem like apple is trying to

64
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:34,112
Round up a herd of cats to some degree

65
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:34,880
But

66
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:35,904
I kind of put

67
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,488
The burden on them they're the ones who brought all the cats into the

68
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:40,512
Yard to play

69
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:45,376
Maybe is not it I mean

70
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,144
Yes

71
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,424
Can I see all the cats

72
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,216
Sounds like actual cats peas

73
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,776
Maybe maybe the dogs that are really trying to

74
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,336
Did you want to work with

75
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,360
Destiny want to make this

76
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,128
Work so

77
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:59,456
I think we're actually going to see a big Improvement

78
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:01,248
From what I hear from people

79
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:03,808
Is this next iteration of homekit

80
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:05,088
We should see

81
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:06,624
Improvement

82
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,160
And features in usability

83
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:08,928
So

84
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,328
What I am looking for an iOS 9 which should come out of beta you said maybe tomorrow

85
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,728
I'm on the day after recording this podcast by the time everybody hears this podcast it will be available

86
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:22,752
Think about too many things I live

87
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:27,616
So we're going to see some really interesting things like triggers

88
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,384
Which

89
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:34,784
You know most of our audience who actually has smart home devices are probably pretty familiar with but these are things like

90
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,832
Location so

91
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:39,136
When you're coming to an area

92
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:42,208
Your location actually triggers like a light to come on

93
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:45,536
A certain device or sensor going off

94
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:46,816
Can trigger

95
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:48,352
Something else to happen so

96
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:52,448
When my garage door opens for example it triggers my porch lights to come on

97
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,984
We talked about that on the show

98
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,008
Schedule

99
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:56,288
Time is also a trigger

100
00:03:56,544 --> 00:04:00,384
So those are things that we should see their support for that in iOS 9

101
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:06,784
And I'm actually really interested to see how Apple has created the programming interface for that

102
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,088
Because that's one of those things that

103
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:11,136
Make-or-break kind of things

104
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,160
Consumers I think

105
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:15,232
If it's too complicated people won't use it and

106
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:20,607
Honestly Apple does try to extract the complexity away from things so I think they'll succeed in that area

107
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:21,375
I'm hoping

108
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:23,935
I'd like that is like one of the first things

109
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:32,127
Yeah I mean this was a big event and apple apple typically has to fall events one in September for the iPhones

110
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,711
And whatever else and then in October that generally have

111
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:36,991
And IMAX

112
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,015
Anything else

113
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,807
Kind of thing so it's possible

114
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,855
But they still have an October event

115
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:43,903
Even though the announce the iPads

116
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:44,927
In September

117
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:45,951
It is

118
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:46,719
India

119
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:51,327
So the other thing that was a little strange and it was kind of awkward for Apple I thought

120
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:56,703
Was that when they did the iOS beta put up a website after the event for iOS 9

121
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:57,727
In-Home Care

122
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,775
And at the bottom of that website

123
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:03,615
They actually had a link that said find homekit enabled products

124
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:08,223
The Apple site for homekit enabled products and if you click that link

125
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,271
Took you to the Apple Store

126
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,807
For any of their home

127
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:16,159
Even the non-home Chipmunks gas so I spent like the night

128
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:18,463
Went last Wednesday I spent that evening

129
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:21,535
Emailing everybody I do on that page

130
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,327
Are you home yet certified all of a sudden

131
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,631
And basically everyone came back

132
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:26,655
Me and said

133
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:28,191
No not yet but we will be

134
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,215
Stay tuned

135
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:30,239
So

136
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:32,799
A lot of the results like Phillips for exam

137
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,079
The makers of the Hue Lights

138
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:36,895
They actually updated their developer page

139
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:43,295
The day before or maybe it's two days before the Apple event saying that they would be releasing a new SDK for Developers

140
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:45,087
Before October

141
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:48,671
So they were hoping sometime in September and before October

142
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:54,559
And my hunch is that that's going to have homekit support so we should see Phillips hopefully before October

143
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:56,607
Anticipating that

144
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:58,911
We should see idevices switch actually made

145
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,215
Splash at CES

146
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,031
Maybe even connectsense

147
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:06,335
Have devices very soon

148
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,871
They're homekit certified

149
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:08,639
So

150
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:10,175
At this point

151
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:14,271
The insteon the newest insteon Hub is homekit certified

152
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:15,551
The insteon

153
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:16,831
They have a hub

154
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:24,255
Sorry I'm trying to think of who has hugs at our home gets her to find I can't think of any others but you may know some

155
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,279
And Neutron both have

156
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,559
Subs that are certified

157
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,607
And

158
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:33,727
That is if it's elegado has a sensor Bluetooth sensor kit that is

159
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,519
Certified and then ecobee

160
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,055
As its

161
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:42,943
Thermostat ecobee 3 thermostat that is homekit certified

162
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:45,759
They've been the same for products for the last

163
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:48,319
3ish months I would say

164
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,903
And nothing else is come on

165
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:55,487
It is now default time frame so we are expecting some new ones

166
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,511
Yay

167
00:06:56,767 --> 00:07:00,607
Reaching out to people that that time frame seems to be reasonable

168
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:05,471
I have seen though that some companies have actually pulled back

169
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:07,263
From certification so Lake

170
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:11,359
We talked to Alex Hawkinson a couple weeks ago in the podcast and

171
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:13,407
They actually did not get there

172
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,175
Home hub

173
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:14,943
Certified

174
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:15,967
With SmartThings

175
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,527
They may one day do that but they aren't

176
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:19,807
Going that route right now

177
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:26,207
Ian said that he had told Mashable in an interview that he'd prefer to cover the open route

178
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,999
Yeah so that's that

179
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,535
So you know

180
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,303
That was kind of

181
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:32,351
I'm surprised they will still support iOS

182
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,375
And you know

183
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:36,447
Maybe one day they can always add

184
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,983
Hardware for

185
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,007
It support if they were

186
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,823
So we'll see

187
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:44,895
So that's the homekit news for everybody who is like me in

188
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,175
I can't wait

189
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,223
Equating

190
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:48,991
Yeah

191
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,527
Maybe you'll see

192
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,111
Maybe next week is the week that I will be able to try

193
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,719
It didn't even get a mention with the Apple TV which

194
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:03,839
If you go to Apple support site for the Apple TV it says it is a homekit gateway for remote access

195
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:08,703
It's not the only one who can do it also through iCloud from what I'm hearing and things up

196
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:11,775
That is true that that's one of the things that

197
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:12,543
That I've been

198
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:15,359
That was one of the things that

199
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,127
I was kind of a sticky

200
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,687
All right

201
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:25,087
Let's see what else have we learned this week isps are adding third-party devices which is good if you

202
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,367
Rely on

203
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:31,231
Comcast or AT&T to provide your home automation setup or you're interested in going to

204
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:34,559
Comcast or AT&T to get a home automation setup

205
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:38,143
Because they do have that Network installers and they will do it for you

206
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,167
So yeah

207
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:43,775
Comcast has added Chamberlain garage door opener to MyQ

208
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,311
Iona

209
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,079
In love

210
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:46,847
Chewits

211
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:51,967
Network of third-party devices it's also going to add sometime next year the Arlo

212
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:55,807
Camera which is from Netgear this is actually a wireless camera

213
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:58,879
The wireless camera that can go inside or out

214
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:02,975
Side and an AT&T their Digital Life home they are going to support the nest

215
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,511
They don't have as many

216
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:06,815
Devices is Comcast is supporting

217
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:10,399
Comcast is now going to support through Xfinity home 11 devices

218
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:17,823
Correct me if I'm wrong Xfinity home platform users out there but I don't believe any of them are actually supported

219
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:18,591
Today

220
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:21,663
Believe support is coming in the next few weeks for most of them

221
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,967
I think it's a good solution for people who are like

222
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:29,855
I kind of want something cool devices out there but I really don't want to install a bunch of motion sensors and other stuff in my house

223
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,135
Yeah like

224
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:37,535
I get what you're saying and I know that again I said I was before you and I are edge cases would rather get her roller sleeves up and break up the toolbar

225
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,815
Boxing install these things

226
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,351
It's getting to the point where

227
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:45,983
It's not that difficult to install these things and if it is then there's something wrong with the product itself I think

228
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:51,871
Yeah and Comcast has charge like $40 a month but with that $40 a month you do get monitored security

229
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:53,663
And a lot of people are really excited

230
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:54,687
Like that so

231
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:57,247
I can't not people for

232
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,295
You know I know

233
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:02,879
I just spent like 2 hours this weekend playing with freaking light

234
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,183
So

235
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,463
There are get it

236
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:14,143
Lucy Samsung they have a new

237
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,167
A new access point

238
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:15,935
Tell us about that

239
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:21,567
We don't know too much yet because there's nothing that I could find on Samsung's official new site or anyting

240
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,615
Whoever is this Korea

241
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:24,895
Which is based in

242
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:25,663
What do you think

243
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:26,943
I'm going with South Korea

244
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,223
You are correct

245
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:31,295
They have put out a story that on the 14th

246
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:33,855
September Samsung released an iot access point

247
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:36,415
That has the support with three radios

248
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,183
Zigbee

249
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,207
Wi-Fi

250
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,743
An Bluetooth

251
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:42,303
Wi-Fi is 802 11 AC

252
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,607
Say it sounds to me like this is

253
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:50,751
I want to say it this is kind of like an Uber access point because they already make access points for your home network

254
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:54,079
And they're able to 11ac access point so they will

255
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:58,175
Extend your current Network further to get onto the nooks and crannies of your house

256
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:01,759
It seems to me like this is the same thing only data Bluetooth

257
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,039
Nzb

258
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,087
To help with iot

259
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:07,647
Networking site coverage as well in your home

260
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:09,439
And I thought this was going to be accessed

261
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,719
Picacho car if you

262
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,583
So yes that's exactly what this

263
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:17,119
Siri can do that for you

264
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:17,887
Siri

265
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:19,423
That'd be a really fun thing

266
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,215
High breathalyzer

267
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,495
2 Series sew in

268
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:23,263
Take the breathalyzer

269
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:28,127
If this then that if this is what alcohol level is greater than .08

270
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:33,503
Contact Yellow Cab Company and send my location

271
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,831
That baby

272
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:38,623
Make it so

273
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:39,903
Desiree

274
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:43,231
That's really all we know about this but I like the fact that

275
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:47,583
Companies in surprise that Samsung mean they're making a big iot push right now

276
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,631
I like the type of companies are

277
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:50,399
Thinking about

278
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:56,031
Creating additional useful radios in traditional devices access points for example for Wi-Fi networks

279
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:58,847
This week is dreamforce which is like

280
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:01,919
Someone said it's the Super Bowl of it conferences

281
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:02,943
Fair enough

282
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:09,343
I would agree considering that it when it's in town in San Francisco I mean they shut down so blocks

283
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,879
Yeah I went stayed in like

284
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,927
The crappiest Hotel I've ever stayed at

285
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:13,951
Because

286
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:14,719
For same here

287
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:16,767
It was like a blanket on top of a card

288
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:17,535
Box

289
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:21,119
It was 50

290
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:26,751
Alright so Salesforce introduce today it's

291
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,031
Iot cloud

292
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:30,591
And that is iot cloud with a

293
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:31,359
Kelsey

294
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:33,663
And what this is basically

295
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,455
It's a data Repository

296
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,991
So what you do is

297
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:40,831
Companies can send their data through any of the Salesforce

298
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,623
Apps so any of the apps

299
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:45,695
I said so if you got Salesforce running if your company

300
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:47,487
You can have it all of your

301
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:50,303
Salesforce data going into this iot cloud

302
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,583
If any of your

303
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,119
Force.com apps

304
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:53,887
Can also

305
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,167
Center data in there

306
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,959
And it can link up with other

307
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:59,007
Companies that also are using

308
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,311
Salesforce and iot Cloud

309
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:06,175
So it's very similar in concept to something IBM actually launched a year ago

310
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,199
Called

311
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,735
Iot Foundation

312
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,783
They're really good with these names

313
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:14,367
Like I said I can't mock this because I have something

314
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,391
Called the iot podcast

315
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:18,463
Salesforce's iot cloud

316
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:20,255
IBM's iot foundation

317
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:23,327
And pussy Salesforce has partnered with Cisco

318
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,887
Dively which is a very

319
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,423
LogMeIn product

320
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:30,495
And all of these are very enterprise-focused

321
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:31,519
And

322
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:34,847
It's basically a place where you can run a lot of data analytics

323
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:35,615
Really quickly

324
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:38,175
And I'm trying to think what else people might want to know about the

325
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,967
What would you want to know about this

326
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:42,527
Well it's Enterprise so probably not much

327
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:49,183
I don't know I'm kind of surprised that Salesforce is getting into iot it just doesn't seem like a

328
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:49,951
Natural

329
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:56,351
A natural fit horses love the internet of things since time immemorial because really

330
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:59,167
What they can do I mean this is all about data

331
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:02,239
And The Internet of Things is all about making

332
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,775
Your data accessible

333
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:04,799
All to you

334
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:07,359
Collecting all this data from customers anyway

335
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:10,175
And now it's basically to try to find a way to monetize

336
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,455
August 8th

337
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,223
And

338
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,271
Then offer people

339
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:18,111
Once it's got the data in there at connect let you buy additional software

340
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,647
So you can see the data

341
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:20,927
So you can analyze

342
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,975
It's all about the money

343
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:26,815
It is the nice thing is once you have is data in there

344
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:30,143
You can offer people infinite services to like let them

345
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,423
Do things with a

346
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:35,007
People aren't going to want to lose that data all around

347
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:35,775
And

348
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,055
The other thing is

349
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:41,151
Garage Motel rate once it's in there you really don't want to let it out

350
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:47,551
And because it's Salesforce and you got a million other people and companies using this data

351
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:49,087
If you have someone else

352
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,623
If I make widgets

353
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:51,903
And you make

354
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,439
Okay let's not use which

355
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:54,719
Craigslist

356
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,999
Pekin actual price

357
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:58,559
So let me make light bulbs

358
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,095
Jose I make light bulbs

359
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,119
What's in you make

360
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,143
Lamps

361
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:04,191
So we have a partnership

362
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:06,239
Because my light bulbs are really great in your land

363
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:09,055
I can start sending you data

364
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,847
About my light bulbs in

365
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:14,431
I'm sure you would probably send me your data about the customers buying

366
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,455
Your lamps

367
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:17,247
I can share

368
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:20,063
The dated about the light bulbs that fit in your lamps

369
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,087
With you

370
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:24,671
And you can share the data about the customers buying your lamps

371
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:25,439
With my light bulbs

372
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:31,583
And we can actually only share that sub segments of data that relates to our shared partnership base

373
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,887
Basically in bills like really

374
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:37,983
Partnerships or sales strategies around it

375
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:40,799
And that's a great business tool

376
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:44,127
That's kind of what Salesforce is trying to sell

377
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,407
I was kind of a

378
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,687
I don't know if that was a great

379
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:53,599
No no I get it I get it now I just surprise me I don't think of them as a kind of company in iot company but I probably should

380
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:55,647
Considering all the big data that they handle

381
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,183
You know I have to use going to

382
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:00,511
Lots and lots and lots of little bits of data and it's going to be

383
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:03,839
Hard to manage that into something useful so

384
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:07,679
Speak about it like nobody wants to be a lamp come

385
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:09,983
They want to be a Services Company

386
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,287
And that date is going to allow you to then

387
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,823
Offer people services

388
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:19,199
What's wrong with you being a limb company because lamp companies they just sell a product once you want to get

389
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,223
Recurring Revenue

390
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,295
That's why the cords break after 3 months

391
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:26,367
Oh come on built-in obsolescence

392
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:28,159
Come on alright

393
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,303
I think it's time though

394
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,351
For the onhub router

395
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:39,423
Because I really want to hear

396
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:40,703
Got to say about this

397
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:42,751
Goodwill and ordered it

398
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:49,151
Literally right before he started the prior show week ago it was supposed to be here in 2 days and it came after the next day

399
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:49,919
It was awesome

400
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:52,991
Thank you bestbuy.com I did buy this out of pocket

401
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:55,295
I got to say after having setup

402
00:16:55,551 --> 00:17:00,671
Taylor modems and routers and bridges and hubs for the past however many years

403
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,207
This was by far the

404
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,231
So

405
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:03,999
Google

406
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:06,559
Kudos you have succeeded in that area

407
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:08,607
It was drafted Temple Italy from

408
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:12,703
The time I open the box till the time I had the network up and running

409
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:13,471
What's 5 minutes

410
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:14,751
That was it

411
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:15,775
Super simple

412
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:17,311
Super Simple Songs

413
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:22,687
Onhub app is available for IOS and Android I had an iPhone in my hand at a time so

414
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,479
I use my iPhone very simple

415
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:30,879
You actually you actually set it up like the echo your how you connect a device to

416
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:34,719
To the echo via Wi-Fi to set up the Echoes Wi-Fi

417
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:36,511
You do the same thing here

418
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:43,167
Got it. That's how you set up a Wi-Fi network on the onhub router you actually connected Wi-Fi to Wi-Fi Direct

419
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:45,215
To set it up in terms of

420
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:45,983
Using the app

421
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:52,895
You can only set up one network and I actually have multiple networks on my prior router so that was a little

422
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:55,455
Disappointing the reason I do that is probably

423
00:17:55,967 --> 00:18:00,319
Not something everybody needs because I do video show that I co-host on Wednesdays

424
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:04,671
I have a dedicated Network just for my online video

425
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:06,975
Cleanscapes Connection in Summit

426
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:10,559
Actually cheated was using that for my 4K video streaming as well bits

427
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:16,191
Regardless I just have one network out that Ashley brings a little more Simplicity as well because now everybody in the house is like

428
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:20,031
Do I connect to a or b they don't ask me that anymore there's just one network

429
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:23,615
One of the downsides and I'm finding is that it's a little too simple

430
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:24,639
You can't

431
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:28,479
Really control things and I know you would ask this question we talked about this

432
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:31,295
Before there's no parental controls you can't say

433
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,831
Limitless device

434
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:39,231
To access the internet until 10 p.m. after that it can't go out so you couldn't shut off the kids devices for sample

435
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:41,791
The only thing you can do on a device level

436
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:44,095
AC in real time and historically

437
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:44,863
How much

438
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,655
Been with her using up and down

439
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:48,959
And you can actually prioritize

440
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:52,031
Traffic fast track it is what it called it to a device

441
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:55,871
For a set amount of time so if I know I'm going to be watching 4K TV

442
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:58,175
And I don't want anybody to mess with my stream

443
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:00,479
I prioritize the TV

444
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:01,759
That way I got the best connection

445
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:05,087
That's about it there's not a lot of advanced features here

446
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:09,951
Are people who are tinkering with the routers installing your own firmware this is not a device for you

447
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:12,511
This is more for a mainstream home

448
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:16,095
That may have not great coverage or not have the fastest

449
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:16,863
Speeds

450
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,399
Tenda WiFi router

451
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,167
Because

452
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:25,567
Contrary to some of the reports on reading I'm having no problems with coverage and signal and Steve it's actually working

453
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:28,383
Better than my old 802 11 AC router is that was

454
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:29,663
I thought that 2 years ago

455
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:32,223
So I'm very happy with the performance

456
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:38,367
I think some people will be disappointed in that it's not Advance you can't do too much to it or with it

457
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:42,719
And yes it is limited to only have one available ethernet port

458
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:46,047
I actually thought I was going to use that for a smart home hub but I'm not

459
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:50,399
I forgot I have a network printer that I connected with her either not to router

460
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:52,959
So that's what's taking up my extra

461
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:53,983
Ewnetwork

462
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:56,287
Luckily the wink Hub that I use

463
00:19:56,543 --> 00:20:02,175
Runs over Wi-Fi so it doesn't need to be connected to a router so I didn't lose any smart home functionality as a result of that

464
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,223
Philips Hue hub

465
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:10,367
Which is not working right now because I don't have a place to put it yes I can get a bridge and all that but you know out of the box

466
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,903
You're right I'm I'm kind of stuck

467
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:13,951
Maybe I'll send you a switch

468
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:18,559
This was a hundred and was it 199

469
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:24,191
It is 199 99 I know I've got to return. With Best Buy that I can send it back but

470
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:26,751
I don't think I will I mean it looks nice but then again

471
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:28,543
My Broadband comes in

472
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:29,311
In the

473
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,591
Second floor

474
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:33,151
In a far corner of the home so nobody can see this

475
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:36,223
If I have a broadband connection the middle of my home

476
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:38,015
Yeah I need this thing out looks great

477
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:39,295
But I don't

478
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:41,087
Okay and you've got a

479
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:43,135
She who shall not be named

480
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,671
An Amazon Echo so

481
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,719
Next to the echo

482
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:47,999
Is it the same size

483
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,279
It looks just like

484
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,071
Yeah it's it's shorter

485
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:52,351
And it's wider

486
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:55,935
And the Ridley does have a ring of light at the top just like the echo does but

487
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:57,471
That ring is always on

488
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:02,079
And that's because it has four different colors to tell you am in setup mode and BM

489
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:05,151
Working fine or see there's a problem and so on so

490
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:07,455
Again it's hassle-free

491
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:10,271
I don't need to switch networks when I'm having problems I don't need to

492
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:11,551
Seek out the best network

493
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:12,831
It's all just happening

494
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:14,623
And I have no complaints

495
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:16,672
I want to say full disclosure

496
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:18,464
There are so many variables

497
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,512
Two wireless network signals that

498
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:24,352
What is working well in my house at my architecture and my setup

499
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:26,144
May not work for everybody I just

500
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,424
I got to say that because

501
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:30,496
I don't want people thinking this is going to be the best thing since sliced bread

502
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:33,824
And they have no Faraday cages are at their house and it's not working so

503
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:36,128
But those of you who live in tinfoil houses

504
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,992
Boat Fender tip about buying from Best Buy with a good sword

505
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:43,296
Return policy and restocking fee

506
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:48,928
Oh I don't think so I don't think I've ever paid a restock fee

507
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:51,744
Alright Kevin thank you and

508
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:53,792
Good show good show of Jeff

509
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,328
I don't know where that came from

510
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,400
Weirdest from Stacy

511
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,168
Surprise

512
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,472
Alright well thank you

513
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:04,800
For this week show and everyone to stay tuned

514
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:09,152
For Paul Madsen as WeChat about identity

515
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:15,552
And what is next for passwords and The Internet of Things

516
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:23,232
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast and we have our guest today who is Paul metzen

517
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:25,280
He is in the office of the CTO at

518
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,560
Ping Identity

519
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:29,888
And as you can guess we are talking about

520
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,448
Identity and The Internet of Things

521
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,728
And Paul

522
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:35,264
Thanks for coming on the show today

523
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:36,800
I'm happy to be here

524
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,592
I'm really excited to have you here

525
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:39,360
Because

526
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:43,712
I follow you on Twitter and you get into some really interesting discussions and

527
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:47,296
Unlike some of them are a little above my head so I'm going to have you

528
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:51,136
Probably keep it down a notch at the hits ale People level for me

529
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:53,696
But I go I go all levels

530
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:57,280
All levels all layers of the stack

531
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:58,560
So

532
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:01,888
Let's just get it started with kind of let's frame the issue

533
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,472
Because I know my issue with identity and then another thing

534
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:06,240
Switches

535
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:07,520
Well there's there's a couple

536
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:08,800
My issue is

537
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:09,824
1

538
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:11,872
I find it very hard

539
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:12,640
2

540
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:13,664
Enter

541
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,480
My identity and password across

542
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:19,296
Like the 30 to 40 devices that I've got

543
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:21,856
I got different passwords for different Services cuz

544
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:24,416
God help me I know I'm not supposed to have the same password

545
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:25,440
Search for everything right

546
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:27,744
That in theory and Theory

547
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:29,536
I'm going to confess that

548
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:32,352
I have a certain limited number of passwords

549
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:33,120
It's because

550
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:34,144
Your humans

551
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:36,448
I am human I'm not a machine

552
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,288
And I don't have like one password or any of those things running on all my devices

553
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:42,080
That's

554
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,616
I don't do they even do that

555
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,480
No I don't think of you right girl optimized for the web We Have Nots

556
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:51,296
That's one issue that I know I have I'm like

557
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:52,832
I feel kind of guilty about it

558
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:54,624
So there's that

559
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,904
But there's also

560
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,184
The issue of

561
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,464
The identity of

562
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,560
There's my identity but then there's other people who are accessing these devices

563
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,096
And I have to share my

564
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:08,704
Current passwords for some of these devices with them and sometimes they get their own password

565
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,728
Depending on the device

566
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:10,752
So

567
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,032
There's like

568
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,568
My family's idea

569
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:14,592
And there's also

570
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:15,360
Guess I did

571
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:17,152
And I don't know if we're going to talk about that on the show

572
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:22,784
Play I hope we do because it's yeah let me know if those use cases are going to become more and more important

573
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:25,856
And as you say sharing a password

574
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:26,880
Weather for you

575
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:28,160
Wifi router alert

576
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:30,208
For that things in your house

577
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:33,536
Doesn't scale well maybe it works when it's just your rotor

578
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:38,144
But when you want to allow your houseguests to play through your

579
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:39,424
Sound system

580
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,960
Can you connect two speakers

581
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:42,752
Beginning of your

582
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,872
Can you search he's got a couple of points

583
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:50,432
Ux constraints

584
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:51,456
These things and

585
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:54,016
And as bad as passwords are

586
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:56,064
Typing into websites

587
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:59,904
And now they're infinitely worse if you have to try to enter them directly in

588
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,024
Yeah. There's one issue how do we get around the usability

589
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,048
Limitations

590
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:08,096
Clearly that

591
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:09,632
Songs that we have

592
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:10,400
Offer

593
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:12,960
Something there right we are going to be

594
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:15,264
Used to connecting

595
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:17,056
Devices and things

596
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:19,104
With the assistance of our phones

597
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,408
So there's opportunities there

598
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,944
Far easier to

599
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:24,224
Buying

600
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,528
Non-existing identity to a device

601
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:27,808
Leave your phone

602
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:31,904
Trying to type it directly into your thermostat or what have you

603
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:35,744
But separately from just the pain passwords and entering them

604
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,560
Is Sir the reality or the recognition that

605
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:41,632
I don't always want to have to create a new identity

606
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:43,168
For everything

607
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:44,704
I bring into the house

608
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,288
We've been through that on the web right where every site

609
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:49,568
45 years ago

610
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:53,408
Command that you create your own account unique account with

611
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,944
Usernames and passwords are

612
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:57,504
And just the number of accounts

613
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,552
That implies for users

614
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:01,344
Dragon scale on the web

615
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,672
So we count ways to use existing ID

616
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:06,208
To get into application

617
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:07,744
Can I take that model

618
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,280
Is going to be necessary

619
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:10,816
On the iot as well

620
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:14,656
Rather than create a new account for some

621
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:19,776
Speaker or light bulb when I bring it into the house I'm going to be able to use my

622
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:21,568
Existing identity

623
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:26,176
Either out of social provider like a Facebook or Google or maybe some

624
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:27,200
Iot platform

625
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:27,968
I've already

626
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,504
Soda created

627
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,784
Start a relationship with

628
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,808
You're my provider

629
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,624
Okay so we're talking about something like

630
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:37,184
Lego watch which is like hell Facebook

631
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:37,952
Twitter

632
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:39,488
That's what they use right

633
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:40,768
2

634
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:41,792
Facebook

635
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,352
Exactly that sort of experience

636
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:45,888
Login with app

637
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,168
We're exes

638
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:48,192
Some providers

639
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:49,472
I already feel comfortable with

640
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:51,776
Should have already invested in the relationship

641
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:53,568
You want to use their

642
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,848
Version of you

643
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:57,152
To interact with that thing rather than something new

644
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:59,456
No I already do that with

645
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,992
A bunch of my device

646
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:06,880
What's interesting is I'm not just logging into these devices but I'm also giving certain

647
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:07,904
Permissions

648
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:09,184
To those

649
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:12,256
Like what will go to examples because

650
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:14,304
What is the easiest thing in the world

651
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:15,328
So

652
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,376
I log into

653
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:19,936
My Nest thermostat and they have

654
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:22,496
Works with Nest their developer program

655
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:24,288
Bright and when I

656
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,104
Link my Nest thermostat to

657
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,128
My

658
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,176
Wink hub for example

659
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:31,968
I log into my

660
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:32,736
Nest

661
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:33,504
Tlingit

662
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,528
To my wink

663
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,552
Home hub

664
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:36,832
And when I do that

665
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,112
I'm giving

666
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:40,160
The wink system of variety of

667
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:42,208
Permissions associated with the nest

668
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,512
We can see the temperature

669
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:45,792
It lets me I think

670
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:47,840
Turn it up and down from the

671
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:50,912
Wink app as opposed to the nest app

672
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:52,448
Write in a get certain

673
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,984
Can a data access

674
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,032
Permissions but it also doesn't get

675
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:56,800
Other things

676
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:58,848
Right now today though

677
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:01,152
I'm not exactly clear

678
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:03,200
In all cases

679
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:05,248
What it can and can't do

680
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:06,016
In like

681
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:10,112
I know for example but I'm authorizing a Twitter app for example

682
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,648
Or signing in with Twitter

683
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:13,696
A lot of the time I can see what it

684
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:14,976
Can and can't do

685
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:17,280
I don't actually get that right now

686
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:19,328
With everything at the device level

687
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,424
Consider two points that sort of disability into

688
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,728
Permissions you've assigned it is critical

689
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:29,312
Sell Twitter Facebook Google me I'll give you a page where you can

690
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:31,872
CD other apps that you

691
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:32,896
Connected

692
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:35,968
And you know what you dig deeper what permissions you've given them

693
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:39,808
And I give you the ability to revoke those permissions

694
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,600
And that's that's kind of

695
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:43,904
You get that for free with with a loss

696
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:44,928
If

697
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:46,208
The Google and Facebook

698
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:47,744
Choose to implement that model

699
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,560
Now what you described when you connect wink

700
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:51,840
Two-ness

701
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:52,608
Right

702
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:53,376
Believe

703
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:54,912
You're actually doing is

704
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:56,192
Is your connecting

705
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:56,960
The wink

706
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:57,728
Cloud

707
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,264
To the nest cloud

708
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:01,824
So you're using your using a wasp

709
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,592
Queen

710
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,896
Two servers right Andrew

711
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:08,992
Pub talks with Cloud through some proprietary

712
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:10,784
Identity mechanism

713
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,344
And the nest thermostat does the same up to its cloud

714
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,160
And then to Cloud your sugar glue together with or

715
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:17,696
Which is powerful

716
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:20,000
But you still created multiple identity

717
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:23,072
It's just sort of the permissions layer that they

718
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:25,376
Giving you two to control permission

719
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,192
You know I think that model

720
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:29,984
Using something like or

721
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:32,032
More generally

722
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:32,800
Delegated

723
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:33,824
Authorization

724
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,104
We can also try that

725
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,152
Right down to the things themselves

726
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:39,712
And and not necessarily rely on

727
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:40,992
The cloud for

728
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:42,016
Hooking everything up

729
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:45,856
Oh okay so that's a very subtle distinction that even I hadn't thought of

730
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,392
Okay

731
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:48,672
Just a matter of

732
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:49,952
Who gets

733
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:50,720
Token

734
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:52,512
That is going to be presented on

735
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:53,792
On all these interactions

736
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,584
And how you got it

737
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:58,912
So then in that case what happens is

738
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:02,752
Devices themselves each generate a token

739
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,592
Albany not generated something with generate it

740
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:08,384
For them but then they would

741
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:09,664
Issued ID

742
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,200
And somehow they would

743
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:13,760
Get that token stored away in their own

744
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:15,040
Secure Storage

745
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,576
Can I use that

746
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:18,112
Whenever they need to

747
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:19,648
Interact or Fennekin

748
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:21,184
Something else whether that's

749
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,976
In another device

750
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:24,000
In the home

751
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,024
Maybe it's

752
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,816
The router maybe it's some

753
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:28,352
Third-party cloud service

754
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,192
So before we get into the token because that's going to get a little technical

755
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:35,520
Let's talk about what this looks like then

756
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:36,800
In the real world

757
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:42,432
The theoretical real world where we have these tokens and lots of things so

758
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:45,248
Help me understand what this might look like in my house

759
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,272
Where I have

760
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,552
You know sensors and

761
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,112
Today actually my sensors

762
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:51,392
Connect to

763
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:52,928
Cubs in

764
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:57,792
The onboarding process is usually through like as a zigbee radio so I'm pairing them

765
00:30:58,304 --> 00:31:00,096
There's an authentication process

766
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:08,032
Yes and you don't necessarily when you bring up a new device into the home you got to get it onto the network weather

767
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:10,592
Wi-Fi so

768
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:13,920
That's one secret or one credential

769
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,224
The bootstrap

770
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:18,272
On to the network before that

771
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:19,552
Viceland

772
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:21,856
Do anything else whether talking to the

773
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:23,648
The cloud or just staying local

774
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:25,440
So I think

775
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:26,464
Clearly

776
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,024
NFC or rble

777
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,304
Different ways where we go

778
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,096
Bootstrap that credential

779
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:34,656
That the Wi-Fi credential or or similar

780
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:35,936
Aunt advice

781
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,776
But the next hurdle for that singing

782
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:41,824
When you say bootstrap that

783
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:43,104
Credential

784
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:44,384
Right is that me

785
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:47,456
Ultimately we got to give

786
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:48,480
To the new device

787
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:51,296
If you're trying to hook it onto your Wi-Fi

788
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:52,576
You got to give it

789
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:53,856
Either the password

790
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:55,648
For the Wi-Fi network

791
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,208
And there's various ways you can do that everybody

792
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,512
Kingsville hit dented their own whether it's

793
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:02,304
An ad hoc WiFi

794
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,096
Network that you connect

795
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,888
Via an app on the device

796
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,680
That's the means by which you

797
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:08,448
Provision

798
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:09,472
The real Network

799
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:10,240
Credential

800
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:13,568
The flashing lights

801
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:15,104
But some people have or

802
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,432
I know that I've got some security systems that I've done that have like

803
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:20,736
Some audio cable thing that

804
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:23,040
It's like highly secure in magical

805
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:25,088
Right okay I see what you're

806
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:28,416
Flashing lights are typically away of

807
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:33,024
Helping you validate that you were actually connecting to the thing you think you are

808
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:33,792
Because there's

809
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:35,584
There's an opportunity for someone

810
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:38,144
This way to insert themselves into that protest

811
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:39,424
Get on to the network

812
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:44,800
But you've got to get it onto the network before it can start talking to the other devices

813
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:46,592
Let's go to the first

814
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:47,872
Authentication challenge

815
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,176
But arguably a bigger one

816
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:51,200
Maybe there's

817
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:54,272
Chance for optimization in the future where

818
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:57,856
Typically you

819
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:59,648
You've got to tell that device

820
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:00,928
What

821
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:01,696
Count

822
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,000
When you already have it when you chew

823
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:04,768
Shut up

824
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,816
With the corresponding provider

825
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:09,120
Q light bulb

826
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,192
Set it up with a new account

827
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:15,008
Currently

828
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:17,056
The reality is

829
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:17,824
You know you're going to

830
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,848
Download the app

831
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:20,384
That is specific

832
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,456
Take two that lines light bulbs are that device

833
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,808
You're going to create an account in the app you're going to log into the app

834
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,088
And then.

835
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:31,904
Different mechanism

836
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:33,952
Connect you

837
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,000
That account you just created

838
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:37,536
To the device the light bulb

839
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:44,960
Ceremony or that experience for the user presumes that they're willing to create a new account

840
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:46,752
That you aren't supposed to

841
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:50,336
No using an existing account

842
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:51,360
Some other

843
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:52,640
Platform provider

844
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:53,408
Whenever it's

845
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,688
Apples

846
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:55,968
Coyote calls

847
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:58,272
Platform on Google store

848
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:01,856
Brightlight listeners I have

849
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:04,928
I'm probably going to stay at least 60 of those based on

850
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:06,208
The devices I have

851
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:07,744
Tried out

852
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,024
Closing those accounts

853
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,304
After

854
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:11,584
Sending back

855
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,352
Device

856
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:16,192
Yeah it just just keeping track of those

857
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:17,728
Identities writing

858
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:20,800
Do I have an account what was the password they are needed

859
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:23,104
It's the same challenge we have on the web just

860
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,152
Steel. For everything in your house

861
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:29,760
Now you know you're an early adopter but that's the reality

862
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:31,040
For the users

863
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:32,320
Economist we

864
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:33,856
Something different

865
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:36,928
Okay and so your suggestion is creating this

866
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,464
This identity layer

867
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,048
And it is an interoperable layer

868
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,328
It's associated

869
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,352
With whatever

870
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:46,912
Whatever stack whatever technology stack that

871
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:47,936
We're going to build for the inter

872
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:50,752
What I argue is the

873
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:52,544
The importance of

874
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:54,080
Standardization

875
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:55,360
And so interop

876
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:57,152
At night

877
00:34:59,200 --> 00:34:59,968
Talk about that

878
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:00,992
DeKalb right now

879
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,296
That work has started I think

880
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,856
I'm not alone in recognizing the

881
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:09,440
The importance of that so there's there's some encouraging

882
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:10,976
Initial steps on

883
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,512
Define in how

884
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:13,792
How to bond

885
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:14,816
These Concepts

886
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:16,608
Identities and

887
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:19,168
Relationships onto those new

888
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:19,936
Protocols

889
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:22,240
And what are some of those steps so far

890
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:26,336
So for instance there's a ace group Ace

891
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:29,408
Authentication for constrained environments

892
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:30,688
India ETF

893
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,480
Panera working group.

894
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:33,760
Looking at

895
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:35,296
Reality of

896
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:36,832
Constrained devices

897
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:38,368
What are the constraints is

898
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:40,416
Memory your size or battery

899
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:42,976
There's an effort in the

900
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:44,256
Open ID Foundation

901
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:45,024
So

902
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,840
Not an organization historically focused

903
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:48,864
Coyote

904
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:50,656
But there's early

905
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:53,216
Work there in defining

906
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:54,752
A model where

907
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,824
Cancel silicate the issuance

908
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:58,848
Betoken

909
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:00,128
To a device

910
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:02,944
An app on the phone

911
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:07,808
Let's talk about the constraints because we kind of went right in there and I never got back to

912
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:09,856
The constraints which are

913
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:11,136
Some of these

914
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:16,512
Devices so if I look at a sensor I'm I'm looking at a tiny little arm base

915
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:20,096
You know it might be like an arm zero microcontroller on these things

916
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:23,936
This is not something that is capable of

917
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:25,216
Running out of

918
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:26,496
128 bit

919
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:29,056
What is an encryption

920
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:31,104
Actually I'm saying that like I know

921
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:31,872
I don't know

922
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,456
The acronym

923
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:38,528
It is not a nice acronym I feel like it

924
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:39,296
That's a lot

925
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:43,904
That that's kind of a lot of number I'd I have a vague sense of hashing and What needs to go into that

926
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,208
It feels like a lot for that level of

927
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:47,744
Microcontroller

928
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:51,840
I made that statement I was actually presenting

929
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:53,632
On on stage in the summer night

930
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:56,448
Just made that blanket statement

931
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:57,984
These things will not be able to do

932
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,008
Modern crypto

933
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:02,848
And I was immediately corrected by somebody who knows

934
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:03,872
That would be nice

935
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,152
Macaulay Culkin

936
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:06,944
So

937
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:08,480
We're both wrong

938
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:11,808
Well point is valid

939
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:14,624
Right perhaps not specifically around Cliffdale butts

940
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,928
At least these things cannot do

941
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:18,976
Clara mobile phone can't work

942
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:20,000
Some of them

943
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:23,328
Write summer going to be connected to the house

944
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:26,656
Electricity and so we eating Taco battery

945
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:27,936
Battery power

946
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:32,288
Some definitely have constraints that we need to

947
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:33,568
Anticipate

948
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:39,456
Music about how they authenticate to other things and how they prove that they are

949
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:41,760
Still valid in an operating and a half

950
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:43,296
A particular user

951
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:47,392
And how often do they need to do that because if I look at like the latest zigbee hack

952
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,440
I'm it wasn't really a fact

953
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:50,464
If somebody who's like

954
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,024
Hey look most people when they do zigbee

955
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,328
You know other occasion right now they're just like

956
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,400
For the most part they don't use all of the encryption

957
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:00,192
Available to them they're just like

958
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:03,264
They use the same encryption code every time

959
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:04,288
Yeah

960
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:06,592
I'm not familiar with that hot but

961
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:08,896
But yeah there's a general pattern of

962
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:10,432
Relying on

963
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:11,712
Whatever

964
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:15,040
Shirts Ortiz were were burned into the device

965
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:16,832
At manufacturing time and

966
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:18,368
I just relying on that

967
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,392
Fault

968
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:20,160
So

969
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:22,464
If and when those things are compromised

970
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:23,488
You're just shot

971
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:24,256
Right cuz there's

972
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:25,024
There's no way.

973
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,304
Step back from that

974
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:28,096
The model that

975
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:29,120
Wheat

976
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:30,656
Argue for is

977
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:31,680
Ghost

978
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:35,776
Secrets that are broke into the chip when the thing is manufactured

979
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:37,568
Primary credentials

980
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:41,152
MasterCard goes we don't want to use those

981
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:43,456
Each and every time that device

982
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:44,224
Appendix

983
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:46,784
We want to instead

984
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:47,808
Issue

985
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:48,832
Secondary

986
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:50,624
Secret secondary credential

987
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:53,696
You know Austin

988
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:54,464
Primary

989
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:56,256
I know secondary

990
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:58,048
Secrets can be shorter lives

991
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,888
They can be issued only if the user consents

992
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:02,912
To the woods

993
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:06,752
They can be targeted at particular applications

994
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:08,032
Lots of

995
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:10,080
Security and privacy damages

996
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:11,872
That's simple operation of

997
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:14,176
Start with the shirt that was

998
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:16,736
Burnt End of the chapter trade it for something else

999
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:20,320
And finally is as the end user

1000
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:24,160
When we start talking about adding an identity layer

1001
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:25,952
And making that interoperable

1002
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:30,048
What does that mean for me in terms of additional

1003
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,352
Steps or work

1004
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:33,120
Or

1005
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:35,168
If it's shorter battery life on my

1006
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:36,704
Devices Maybe

1007
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:38,752
What does it mean to me what am I going to

1008
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,312
I hope what you see is

1009
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:42,848
1

1010
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:43,616
Skewer

1011
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:45,152
Prompts for password

1012
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:46,176
Yeah

1013
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:49,504
Yeah that's a good thing right we're seeing that on the web

1014
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,528
Not reflect

1015
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:51,552
Emergency

1016
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:54,880
I suggest you're also going to see

1017
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:57,184
More prompts for strong

1018
00:39:57,696 --> 00:40:00,000
Vacation by bringing something into the house

1019
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:03,840
Credential or token that it's going to use to

1020
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:04,608
Do its job

1021
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:06,912
That's a sensitive operation

1022
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:07,936
I want to protect that

1023
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:11,008
I'd argue that it's relevant to

1024
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:11,776
Impose

1025
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:13,568
Rarely and infrequently

1026
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:15,872
A greater authentication on bird

1027
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:16,896
Burden on users

1028
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:18,944
And we currently do

1029
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:19,712
So Prince

1030
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:23,296
Bringing something ended up the home and I'm setting it up

1031
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:27,392
I should be expected to the fennec 8 through more than

1032
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:28,160
Single

1033
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:29,440
More than

1034
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:30,208
Password

1035
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,280
Also perhaps by swiping

1036
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:34,304
Something on my phone

1037
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,096
Communicate that's mean idiot

1038
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:38,144
Touch id based login

1039
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:42,496
So I'm going to have to use a fingerprint login

1040
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:45,056
Whenever I bring a new device into my phone for the for the first time

1041
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:50,176
Well I'm not saying it has to be fingerprint I'm saying it should be something more then

1042
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:51,712
Just a password

1043
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:53,504
That you used to login to that website

1044
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:55,552
It's appropriate

1045
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:56,320
I think

1046
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:58,112
To require greater

1047
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:58,880
Assurance

1048
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:00,928
Of these sensitive operations

1049
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:04,000
And provisioning a new device a sentence

1050
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,072
Passwords

1051
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,352
More

1052
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:10,656
Strongest indication operation

1053
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:11,680
Stun infrequently

1054
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:12,704
And

1055
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:14,752
Fewer account creation

1056
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,032
Right

1057
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:18,336
Not a given that every device

1058
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:19,616
I bring into the home

1059
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:21,152
Should have

1060
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:23,456
Corresponding unique

1061
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:24,992
Identity

1062
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:26,784
There's a cloud

1063
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:29,600
Why can I not use an existing identity

1064
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:30,624
Like I can on the web

1065
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:32,416
That would be exciting

1066
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:33,696
I could use

1067
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:35,488
Fewer apps will

1068
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:37,280
Right now I can use fewer apps

1069
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,816
And fewer account creation

1070
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:40,096
Yeah

1071
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:41,120
That would be fun

1072
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:41,888
Okay

1073
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:44,448
Will Paul thank you so much for talking to me about the

1074
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:45,728
Recite I feel

1075
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,032
A little bit better how how far off do you think

1076
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:52,128
Well the model

1077
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:54,175
Has already proven itself on the web

1078
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:55,455
People.com

1079
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:56,223
Respect

1080
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:57,247
This sort of

1081
00:41:57,503 --> 00:42:00,063
Identity interoperability they don't call it that of course

1082
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:01,087
On the web

1083
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:02,879
So that the protocols of the Earth

1084
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:04,159
Patterns are there

1085
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:07,487
That the standardization efforts are just beginning

1086
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:11,327
I expect in one or two years we might see some

1087
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:14,143
Products that actually Implement these models

1088
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:16,191
Ultimately depends on

1089
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:18,751
Pressures better

1090
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:21,055
Consumers in this context

1091
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:22,079
Play something

1092
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:24,383
Device manufacturers in the platforms

1093
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:26,943
Alright we'll device manufacturers

1094
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:28,735
Consider yourself pressured

1095
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:30,015
Because by golly

1096
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:32,831
I am running out of passwords

1097
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:37,951
Alright thank you so much for coming on the show today I really appreciate it

1098
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:40,255
Was my pleasure Stacy thank you very much

1099
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:44,351
That's it for today show thank you guys so much for listening

1100
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:50,751
And we'll see you next week on the iot podcast
