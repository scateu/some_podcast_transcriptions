00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:12,544
Hey everyone welcome to the 206 episode of

2
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,568
The Internet of Things

3
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:14,336
Podcast

4
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:15,360
This is your house

5
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:17,920
Stacey Higginbotham

6
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:18,944
Kevin tofel

7
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:21,248
And this week we have a

8
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:22,528
Pretty tremendous chauffeur

9
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,600
Today

10
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:26,624
At the edge

11
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:29,184
We've got Apple buying some patent

12
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:29,952
Consider of in

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,280
I want an echo Auto

14
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:35,584
We got a new August video doorbell

15
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,376
Get some tips for madam

16
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:38,144
A

17
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:39,680
Got a dead robot

18
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:40,704
Plus

19
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,240
We got a lot of advice

20
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:43,264
Saint hubs

21
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,312
And

22
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:46,848
We're going to hear how

23
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:48,384
Mitsubishi Bank

24
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,152
Has

25
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:49,920
Connected

26
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:51,968
Any devices using the affair

27
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,344
We're going to hear from Chrissy Mayer Who is a partner at root Ventures

28
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,136
She's going to explain why Ark

29
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,928
Connected devices cost

30
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,208
Souderton

31
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:05,792
Let's get this party started

32
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:06,816
But first

33
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:07,584
A message

34
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,608
From our sponsor

35
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:15,520
This week sponsor is Western Digital Western Digital builds Data Solutions that enable the world to see

36
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:18,592
The biggest challenges

37
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:24,992
What's your digital is introducing its most advanced flash storage solution the eu5

38
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:30,112
511 this is built to empower 5G mobile devices it'll allow you to

39
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:36,512
Play board games save more memories and binge more videos so get ready for

40
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:40,096
5G future at Western Digital.

41
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:42,400
Okay

42
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:43,168
Kevin

43
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:45,216
I guess we're going to start off with

44
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:46,240
Machine learning

45
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,800
So Google has

46
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:49,568
Anu

47
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:50,592
Development board

48
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:51,360
Let's talk about that

49
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:53,664
Actually announced

50
00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:00,064
This last year at the Google next conference that's a big cloud conference

51
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:00,832
Products

52
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,368
Now they are

53
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,416
Launched in beta

54
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:06,464
Name is coral as you would said

55
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,768
When is a USB stick

56
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:11,840
Raspberry Pi

57
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,888
Ginormous

58
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:20,288
Heatsink and fan on the processor I would have thought it was a Raspberry Pi but it's not it is

59
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:22,080
I'm bored

60
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:26,432
Google's Edge TPU that's their tensorflow processing unit

61
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:31,296
So for example you could connect this to a camera device

62
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,064
What

63
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:38,464
Google says it can use state-of-the-art mobile Vision models up to a hundred or more frames per second

64
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,744
Power efficient manner

65
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:44,864
Very specific types of processing again at the edge

66
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:48,192
I think these are development

67
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:52,032
This is really geared towards people that want to build products using it so

68
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:58,432
Other product announcements but this has tons of potential and I know you're all about processing at the edge so

69
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:00,736
You're going to tell us what the potential as I suspect

70
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:02,528
Yes so

71
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:06,880
This is in line with what movie is Intel with its movidius stick

72
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,928
Actually offered about a year-and-a-half ago

73
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:09,696
And

74
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:11,488
Right now we're looking at these on Lake

75
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:13,280
Computers these are USB sticks

76
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:16,352
Do you plug in the computers but imagine being able to plug this into

77
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,656
Like a video camera is Kevin mentioned

78
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:21,728
Or even unlike an industrial iot Gateway

79
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:24,288
And what you're going to be able to do is you're going to have

80
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,056
You'll have to

81
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,848
Pre-trained your algorithm in the cloud

82
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,640
But this allows you to do

83
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,432
Inference at the edge

84
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,016
It's computer vision is one thing you could do

85
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:36,320
Predictive maintenance kind of algorithms

86
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:39,392
You could actually do a lot like even like anomaly detection

87
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:41,696
Would be a really good one

88
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:42,464
So

89
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,816
The sky's the limit here and we don't actually even really know how we're going to use

90
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:47,840
I can even see it

91
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:49,888
Processor

92
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:51,936
Inside a car but

93
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:52,960
Getting your bikes

94
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,008
That I don't know

95
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,056
Think about all these fun

96
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:00,128
Computer vision or better AI

97
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:03,200
Oil processing would be another

98
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,736
Oh yeah they doing

99
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,784
Expanding your wake word

100
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,576
Capabilities might be an option

101
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:10,880
So much

102
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:11,904
Very exciting

103
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,232
Look for that if you are into building this sort of thing if you're not

104
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:19,071
Send all those people were building it look for in like a year to having

105
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:23,423
Just even better machine learning at the edge that could be applied to Machine Vision

106
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,447
Anomaly detection

107
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,471
Audio

108
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,007
I don't even know what

109
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:29,311
Whatever you desire

110
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:34,687
As long as you have $150 cuz that's the cost of the coral to report

111
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:38,783
Okay

112
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:39,807
Wicked

113
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:42,367
Actually I did mention this to the beginning which is

114
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,135
A shape

115
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:45,439
We have a bankruptcy filing in the smart home space

116
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:46,719
So I feel like

117
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,535
Last month in February

118
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:50,559
Centralite

119
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:51,327
Which makes

120
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,607
Bunch of sensors in

121
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,143
It is supposed to be sent

122
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,703
They filed for chapter 7

123
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,519
And chapter 7 means

124
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,311
Are not coming back from

125
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:05,919
Chapter 11 is restructuring chapter 7 is like we are done

126
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:06,943
We are closing

127
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,479
This looks like

128
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:11,551
Someone had sent this into us and they're like this might be because of

129
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:17,183
You know the end of Lowe's Iris central nervous system

130
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:20,767
Shut that system down or is in the process of shutting that system down

131
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:25,119
They also made the sensors that were used by Xfinity

132
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,143
And some other

133
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:29,215
Pink are two things here

134
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:31,263
When is the end of the year

135
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,823
Companies buying this trap in their own

136
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:34,847
Phone brand to sell

137
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:38,943
Lesson focus on sensors and

138
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:42,015
We all thought this was going to be like

139
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:44,063
People were going to buy these cool sensors

140
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,879
Create these cool longtail applications for iot

141
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:48,415
Way back at the early days of this

142
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,463
That's not actually what happened

143
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:52,511
Instead what we seeing is

144
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:56,607
A lot of the heavy lifting has been done by you

145
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,143
Amazon Echo

146
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,959
And sensors have been a pretty small part of

147
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:02,751
For the mainstream

148
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:03,519
Hyatt

149
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,287
So

150
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:07,359
I tried to get a list of deaths that these guys have all like

151
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:09,919
Could get was the list of creditors

152
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,967
Pretty much as you would expect

153
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,247
Their basic

154
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,527
Lourdes

155
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,319
Cable service providers

156
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,855
Nothing really exceptional

157
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,879
I didn't see anything

158
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:26,303
And if you bite

159
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,583
You have until

160
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,119
May 28th

161
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,143
This year

162
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,191
To file your

163
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:32,959
Claims

164
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:38,847
He comes later in the show. But maybe we should talk about something else too

165
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,383
Say goodbye to

166
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:43,967
Wish I could say something a saying goodbye to us if you think about it

167
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,783
Yes we also have another goodbye

168
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,575
We actually saw this goodbye

169
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,927
Lighthouse which made a connected

170
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,743
Which also had a Time

171
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:56,511
A flight

172
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,047
Sensor in it they gave it

173
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,071
Really exceptional

174
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,351
Depth perception

175
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:02,143
This allowed it to get a lot

176
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,191
More information about the environment

177
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,215
Even more accurate

178
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:07,007
But beyond that

179
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:10,847
It had voice recognition that it been translated into automatic

180
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:14,431
So I might tell the camera do you like your lighthouse

181
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:19,039
If you don't see my dog walker by 4 p.m. today send me a note

182
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:19,807
Application

183
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,647
And what it would do is it would take that command which is really complicated

184
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:26,975
To do it would recognize it and then parse that out and then

185
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:30,559
If it did not see the person it new as your dog walker

186
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,351
By that time

187
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,375
It would be like

188
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:35,167
Hey yo your dog

189
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:38,495
That kind of usability is

190
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,519
Pretty exceptional

191
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,311
The downside was It was a

192
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,079
Very expensive

193
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,127
A subscription

194
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:44,895
The associate

195
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,175
So

196
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,455
The company did not do well

197
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:49,503
Shut down

198
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,367
But

199
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,463
There's been a lot of talk about

200
00:07:59,231 --> 00:07:59,999
Siri

201
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,047
The homepod and how it's

202
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:04,095
It's not an awesome experience

203
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,119
But

204
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,911
With something like

205
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,959
That capability

206
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:10,751
Become an awesome experience

207
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,055
What will be interesting is

208
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:17,407
Such a platform would have to be expensive because you would need all that ready

209
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,431
Are you ready for this

210
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:21,759
That machine learning at the edge that we talked about

211
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,807
To really understand it

212
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:25,599
Parse all those commands

213
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,391
And understand what it was looking

214
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:31,487
And somehow that dated actually does have to get to the Cloud

215
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:35,327
I guess it could be aggregated data so what we'll see how it does that

216
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,863
It still has that app

217
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,399
Privacy

218
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,423
I think

219
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:40,703
Lighthouse

220
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:41,983
Was ahead of its time

221
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,775
Nothing much

222
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:46,591
But I suspect that in the business model you know what

223
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:48,383
Subscription to use Etc

224
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:52,991
It's what heard it and it's typical Apple to wait for a great product

225
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,271
Market open up

226
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:59,391
And then go Apple Magic to make it simple to use etcetera so

227
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:02,975
I'll be interested to see if they use it for any

228
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:03,999
Homekit

229
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,535
Devices of Their Own

230
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,071
Cuz I don't think they would

231
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,119
License without 2

232
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,655
Other Hardware makers

233
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:17,055
It's also possible they just want to improve face detection on the phone

234
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,591
That's true I mean

235
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:22,175
Possible

236
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,455
Awesome Face detach

237
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:24,735
All right

238
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,807
So that's

239
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:29,087
Not so long ago.

240
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,135
There is actually a recent death

241
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:33,439
Cash

242
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,303
The most morbid podcast

243
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:44,447
The my buddy that actually glad I did not drop $900 on

244
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,031
Jibo robot

245
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:53,663
Which we knew that Jibo was shutting down

246
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:57,503
And everybody who bought a Jeep

247
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,295
So you going to have a useless

248
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,831
Jibo robot

249
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,367
It's done

250
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,183
The company credit

251
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,999
Geebo itself

252
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:10,303
The robot itself in people's homes is

253
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:16,959
Saying things like

254
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:17,727
Around

255
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:20,287
It's kind of cute and funny it's up to make

256
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,823
Bad situation somewhat

257
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,359
Easier to deal with but

258
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:24,639
$900 brick

259
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,479
I came close to buy on two

260
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,247
I know you did

261
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,551
This was a case

262
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:34,879
It being announced really early and then the functionality just

263
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:40,767
Skyrocketing ahead in this was like going to be like a Amazon Echo on Wheels basically

264
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:42,047
Amazon Echo

265
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,583
Got so much better so

266
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,399
Satchel

267
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:48,191
There is a new product out

268
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,471
And it's worth talking about

269
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,519
August

270
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:54,335
Made the August lock and the August video doorbell

271
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:56,895
And was bought by us

272
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:00,991
Has a brain bailout

273
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:01,759
Meet

274
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:04,319
It is neat for a couple of reasons one

275
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,599
It has no wires

276
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:09,183
It is $230

277
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:13,535
And 3 It is Well designed and unlike the last doorbell switch

278
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:15,583
Cool looking squares this is

279
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,607
Something that quote

280
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:17,887
Looks like a doorbell

281
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:23,519
It does it looks like a doorbell there's lots of different options at least 8 to choose from to match your

282
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,799
Homes exterior

283
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:26,591
230 on the prices

284
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:31,967
Nest hello is why

285
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,759
And this has a remote

286
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,575
Thought I paid 204 - 2

287
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:38,111
You probably got it on a cool day

288
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,135
MSRP

289
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,951
Oh I could be

290
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,743
So I'm going to hold off

291
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:49,375
Being very excited about this until I can try it in the reason is because I actually have

292
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,167
The first gen and 2nd gen

293
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,447
August doorbell camera

294
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,727
The first gen was it

295
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:54,751
Nautica

296
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,055
I'll just be honest

297
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,079
Didn't have

298
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,359
You know at night

299
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,383
It had no

300
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,943
Lighting options

301
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:06,527
If your street was dark you were just out of luck you can see who is at your door

302
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:07,807
This kind of glitchy

303
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,343
I didn't love it

304
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:14,975
The next version fixed a lot of those

305
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,791
HD video resolution it's got night vision

306
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,583
Digital Zoom

307
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:21,631
It's got the remote chime

308
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:23,935
So yeah we're going to just see how it works

309
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:28,287
It also has a little bit of a limitation unless you want to pay five bucks a month

310
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,823
Does it how it has a

311
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:30,591
Video recording

312
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:35,711
Yeah so you can do a livestream at anytime if you want to see eclipse

313
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:42,111
Set a recording when it sees motion you can only see 5 seconds and they only hang around for the last 24 hours

314
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:45,183
If you want to pay

315
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:45,951
See

316
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:50,047
So actually I don't have a problem with the current setting I have

317
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:54,399
So prior to August

318
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:58,751
Sickness

319
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:01,567
Press on the

320
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:06,431
And I do pay $10 a month

321
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:11,551
Two nest for my Nest hello doorbell video

322
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,855
I had a nest cam in my front window

323
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:18,719
And an SD card

324
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:19,743
Yes

325
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:20,767
Cheap

326
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,815
We are cheap cheap

327
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,119
I am singing

328
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,143
Okay

329
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:30,239
Other than August video doorbell

330
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:31,263
I'll try it

331
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,079
When it comes out and let you guys know

332
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,615
Pretty much every doorbell out there

333
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,151
And have strong feelings about the

334
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:40,479
There's something else you want to try and I don't I guess I don't know why

335
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:45,087
Yeah I want the echo Auto I saw a story in wired about how Amazon

336
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:48,671
Did voice recognition and search for the noisy car environment

337
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,439
For the echo Auto

338
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:52,767
And I don't have my invite yet Amazon is

339
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,815
It's getting them out an invite only basis

340
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,119
Really want

341
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,399
And the reason is

342
00:13:59,167 --> 00:13:59,679
I

343
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,471
Constantly want to ask

344
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:06,079
Not necessarily to do anything in my home

345
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:06,847
I'm just like

346
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,639
Hey what's that

347
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:11,711
What's that song and you like Stacy why don't you do that

348
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,735
Google Assistant

349
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:13,759
On your phone

350
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,295
The answer is

351
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,831
I can't get Google Assistant

352
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:17,855
My song because

353
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:18,623
It doesn't recognize

354
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,391
SYM

355
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,463
Now I understand

356
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:28,095
There She Goes she's talking to me but she will never ever answer my request because

357
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:30,143
I logged into the wrong account

358
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:36,799
And you guys maybe like Stacy or an idiot but I swear to you guys I have

359
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:37,567
I have spent

360
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:39,615
Trying to figure out

361
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,687
Reason is

362
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,991
My daughter wants to be able to she doesn't like to

363
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,527
Google she doesn't have her own

364
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:49,343
Spice so she wants to just be able

365
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,111
Able to ask Matt

366
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:56,255
I don't know if it's going to allow you to play liked songs from Spotify over your car stereo

367
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:57,535
But

368
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:00,351
That would be awesome if it did or if it just played them for me

369
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,119
There

370
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,911
That would also be a reason to why

371
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:03,935
Want that despite the fact

372
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:04,703
I have a Tesla

373
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,775
Ask it to play me all kinds of

374
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,335
I really just want to talk to one taken

375
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:15,711
Great. Now I get it it's fifty bucks for this

376
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:22,879
It's not expensive it's it you know you can plug it into USB or if you have an older car with a cigarette lighter 12 volt

377
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,927
You can connect it to your car speakers

378
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,719
So I suspect you can have

379
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,487
Play music if you

380
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:32,095
Tulsa design

381
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,887
Road noise

382
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:37,215
Other things so using the phone may not be the best

383
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:40,287
Smartwatch

384
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,823
Get information by voice

385
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,103
And we have a ton of

386
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,127
Questions I mean

387
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,967
When you get a twelve-year-old riding in the backseat or multiple 12 year olds

388
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:50,783
We have a lot of things we want to inquire about

389
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,063
Randomly on the road

390
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,343
Okay

391
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:56,415
What's the difference between a dairy cow and a beef cow

392
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,183
I don't know

393
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:57,951
Probably

394
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,231
Mattamy doesn't know either

395
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:04,607
Actually a new device gets

396
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,631
Support for that

397
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:06,655
System

398
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,423
Roku

399
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:09,471
Which I am super excited about

400
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:13,567
Because right now I have a Roku that's attached to a Harmony

401
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,151
Disattached all my TV stuff but this would have give me

402
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,943
A little bit more granularity in the

403
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:19,967
Control and

404
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:23,807
I kind of like that cuz right now the only remote controller I use now

405
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:25,599
When we're watching TV is the Roku

406
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:31,743
Because you'll be able to ask Madame a Define comedies or

407
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,047
Or open

408
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:38,655
Hulu apps on Roku changed

409
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,191
And

410
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:40,959
Now

411
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,775
Submitting content on the show

412
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:46,591
So we're going to have a broad discussion about

413
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,127
First off

414
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,151
We're going to start with

415
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,175
The Wirecutter

416
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:50,943
Last week

417
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,503
Put out after last show they put out a

418
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:54,783
Update on

419
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,575
Do you need a smart home hub

420
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:57,599
And

421
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:58,623
Which is the best way

422
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,671
Wirecutter was basically like

423
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:02,207
Most of you do not need

424
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:04,255
And I think they're right

425
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,279
Most of you probably

426
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,583
And if you do need one

427
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:11,423
They picked SmartThings which runs counter to what

428
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,727
I would do but I

429
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:17,567
For everyone else they're like you know what just use like an Amazon Echo or a goo

430
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:18,335
Google home

431
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:20,127
I will say

432
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,919
Did we have had push back

433
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,967
From some of our listeners who are like

434
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:25,247
Guys

435
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,039
You really should put people

436
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:33,695
Zigbee and Z-Wave devices because they're little bit more secure and you have a extra layer between the internet

437
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:34,719
In a device

438
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:36,255
And that is a good point

439
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,047
But I still think it's too,

440
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,607
I don't know what you think about the wire

441
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:47,519
They have to appeal to as many of broad set of readers as possible so I completely understand

442
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,055
Why they

443
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:51,359
Position the article this way and I don't

444
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,639
Disagree with that either

445
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,943
You and I are hubpeople

446
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,479
Like true how people not

447
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:57,503
Voice assistance

448
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,783
Concord as a hub

449
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:01,855
Voice assistance

450
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:04,927
More automation that may not be easily done

451
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:05,695
Without

452
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:10,559
I get it I agree with you I'm not a SmartThings user these days I pretty much

453
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:11,583
Run everything on wink

454
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,119
I think it's

455
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,655
SmartThings does have some

456
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:16,959
Devices

457
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:20,543
And you can eat you know when I create custom device handlers

458
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,591
Gradle groovy you can do that

459
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,895
Great for people who need that

460
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:29,247
I don't think most people me that I don't think of wire cutters audience really needs that

461
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,783
So I get it

462
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:34,879
It depends what you want to do you just want to keep things simple

463
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:36,159
You can do that with just

464
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,951
Voice commands in memory

465
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:38,719
My devices

466
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:41,279
If you want to start expanding things

467
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:45,375
Get a broader range of devices

468
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:47,423
Sure

469
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:50,239
So that was The Wirecutter

470
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,055
Now as dedicated hub

471
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:55,871
As a warning sign

472
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:56,895
For you

473
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,455
Kevin has a

474
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,735
I'm a dummy story

475
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:04,063
Because I feel like a dummy in summer

476
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:07,647
Considering we when I say si switch

477
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:11,999
Hubs and devices so often for testing reasons

478
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:15,327
I'm going to get myself a little bit

479
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:17,631
Flog you today

480
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:18,911
Not today

481
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:21,983
Yes I wrote a story on the Block

482
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:24,031
Listen

483
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:26,335
Here is why you should always remove

484
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:28,895
What smart devices from the old one

485
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:31,455
And it sounds like common sense

486
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:35,551
But I'm going to tell you what happens if you don't do that because quite often

487
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:38,879
We got a hobbit a style just like unplug my wink

488
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,927
Who set up a new home

489
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:43,231
Put devices on it

490
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:45,023
Put everything back on wink real quick cuz

491
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:48,095
I got to get it back

492
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:50,143
Enough for the family

493
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:53,727
And that's exactly what I did when I tested the SmartThings

494
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,263
USB

495
00:19:55,519 --> 00:20:01,407
Stick on the Nvidia Shield TV last year was infected

496
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:04,223
I tested it with some devices on it did my review

497
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:06,271
Took everything off and went back to wink

498
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:09,343
I never removed everything from that

499
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:11,903
Cub and what I found out

500
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:12,927
Was

501
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:15,231
I signed into my SmartThings app

502
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:16,511
Earlier this week

503
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:20,863
And I have a developer account over there because I had some custom device Handler

504
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:21,887
And I noticed

505
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,423
It's still listed

506
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:26,751
On Samsung server

507
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:28,799
But I had connected to that

508
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,079
SmartThings Hub

509
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:34,687
Wasn't a total panic at first but then I realized

510
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:41,599
Especially the Wi-Fi devices although I'm seeing I'll call a heartbeat pain coming from zigbee and Z-Wave

511
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:43,135
Which is very strange to me

512
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,159
Because they

513
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:45,183
Don't have

514
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:49,023
Access to the internet through the SmartThings Hub anymore

515
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:53,631
Connect to my wink hub

516
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:55,679
But we're going to break that process down into

517
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:56,703
But first off

518
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:57,983
Let's tell people

519
00:20:58,495 --> 00:20:59,007
The process

520
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:00,287
Purchased basic

521
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,311
Hub removal

522
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:02,335
Suggestion

523
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:08,735
The first thing you should do to a new house Etc

524
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:11,039
Go to the app

525
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,575
Your current hub

526
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:14,879
And one by one delete

527
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:16,159
All your devices

528
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:19,488
It's especially important if you've got Z-Wave and zigbee devices

529
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:21,792
The Secret of Isis should

530
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:24,096
Wander off on their own when you delete them

531
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:27,168
Z-Wave devices you actually I know when the wink

532
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:30,752
You have to actually manually remove them by clicking

533
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:31,776
Edifice

534
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:34,592
So I go in the week to go to the hub

535
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:35,360
Section

536
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,664
Remove Z-Wave.

537
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:43,296
That's how you need to do it in the SmartThings app also has

538
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,064
Remove Z-Wave

539
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,088
Devices function

540
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,904
Where you're actually going to hit that button

541
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:52,512
And then you actually physically press the radio the Z-Wave there's always a button

542
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,304
Turns the radio into pairing

543
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,864
That's going to physically on

544
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,472
Reason you do that is because a Z-Wave and zigbee radio

545
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,520
Can only be paired to

546
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:04,288
Onehub

547
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:06,848
It just becomes really relevant

548
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:07,872
In a moment

549
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,480
Correct and even though I didn't have the SmartThings Hub running for the last year

550
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:14,016
I put the SmartThings

551
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:15,808
App back on my phone

552
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:16,576
This week

553
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:22,976
And I'm still able to use it to control some of these devices so I know these are actively talking to Samsung

554
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:28,096
And there's a lot of data there any devices that are no longer

555
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:28,864
Active

556
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,704
It shows the last state so you could see like the temperature in my home when

557
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:38,336
Mac addresses of devices IP address

558
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:44,736
No and this is something I'm thinking is

559
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,368
Manually delete your

560
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:51,392
Your account basically

561
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,952
Let's get into this weird

562
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:54,720
Question

563
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:58,560
That we have which is some of Kevin Z-Wave

564
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,632
Somehow getting

565
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:02,656
This data

566
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,960
And we for the life of us

567
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:06,240
Can I figure out how

568
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,360
Right because those devices cannot directly connect to the internet on their own

569
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,896
They need to go through

570
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:14,432
Wireless

571
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:15,456
Device

572
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:19,552
And it can only be

573
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:21,856
Sakura

574
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:28,256
Any event log I have all kinds of events

575
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:30,048
Look at the most recent events

576
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:34,400
And the only thing I can think of all the stuff

577
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:35,680
Some of those

578
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:36,704
Devices

579
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,984
Zigbee and Z-Wave

580
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:38,752
Art at

581
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:44,384
To my voice commands and also routines

582
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,968
I don't know how they would still have

583
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:49,760
Access to the

584
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:53,088
Internet to get back to Samsung servers but maybe

585
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,904
Something is triggering something

586
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:57,952
And I will continue researching obviously

587
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:59,488
This is our mystery of

588
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:00,256
The day

589
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,024
Or week

590
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:03,072
Maybe it's going to be a whole week's worth of Mystery

591
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:05,120
Guys who know so we'll update

592
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,912
On what's happening there

593
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:10,496
As we figure it out this is like our own iot podcast hotline

594
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,432
This is also good for people who like you Stacy are moving you need to

595
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:21,248
Undo everything and reset it all up and so on

596
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:27,648
If you switch a hub this is I think something that most people know they should do I don't know if everybody does it

597
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:28,416
I didn't

598
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:29,952
Shame on me for that but

599
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:31,488
Really makes you think

600
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:33,792
When you are doing some type of migration

601
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:36,864
Uninstall everything properly

602
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:40,448
Speaking up this whole thing was sparked by a question

603
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:44,288
Hey

604
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,056
Guys

605
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:47,872
I lost all the data on my Hub and I had to reset it

606
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:48,896
And

607
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:50,176
It took 7 hours

608
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:51,456
That sucks

609
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,016
He's like is there anyway

610
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,040
For us too

611
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:58,112
An answer to that is

612
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,648
Not really

613
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:06,048
Not really I mean that there might be some hubs that juice supported but the mainstream type hubs do not not with wings

614
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,072
SmartThings

615
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:09,120
Don't even with insteon

616
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:10,912
The safest bet like as I'm

617
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:12,960
Isn't dismantling my house

618
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:13,984
And taking things off

619
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:16,800
Beside his bed is actually to do a reset of

620
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:18,848
Everything so delete all the data

621
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,688
Cuz I'm having some weird issues because I didn't do that

622
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:23,456
But some of my

623
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:25,760
Lutron lights in my Amazon Echo

624
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:27,296
It's just not worth contact

625
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,648
And smart home devices I think a little more finicky than any other

626
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,696
Joyce's used today so

627
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:36,256
I think you're right

628
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:40,608
But speaking of the iot podcast hotline

629
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:43,680
I believe it is time to take a

630
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:44,448
Question

631
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:45,728
From

632
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,008

633
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:49,312
But before we do

634
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:50,848
I should tell you

635
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:52,896

And

639
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,320
WeMo dimmer switch

640
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:01,856
So we're going to send that out to

641
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:03,648

Okay so this week's question

668
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,712
Comes from Derek

669
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:00,480
Let's hear it

670
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:06,880
Hey Stacy Hey Kevin this is Derek coming from Gilroy started to leave you a message I'm not sure if it

671
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,952
Sager. Anyway you can use this on me

672
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:12,512
Section 8 regarding vehicle tracking

673
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:15,328
So you be have something out there and

674
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:18,912
Sprint offered something call the Sprint Drive and so

675
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,960
I guess I'm curious Are there any

676
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:24,544
Concerns that I may have you know I currently have

677
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,848
That's my primary provider so

678
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:31,456
Resume in addition to Google spent probably already knows where I'm at and what I'm doing anyway

679
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:35,296
But I'm getting wanting to get one of these for my

680
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:39,648
Teenage kids so I can see no, see where they're going Heather Drive in and give him some

681
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:40,416
Feedback

682
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:44,000
Just curious if you guys have any experience with the

683
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:46,304
Is there any privacy concerns and

684
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,632
Is there something that's even better out on the market

685
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:50,912
Okay Derek

686
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:53,472
At first I was like privacy and then I heard

687
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:55,264
Teenage driver and I was like

688
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,848
We don't need privacy we need to keep an eye on our teenage driver

689
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,920
And here you have a bunch of solutions

690
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:03,968
And you named a couple of them already

691
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:06,016
You could use a Tracker

692
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:07,296
Just to know where they are

693
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:09,088
But I don't like that because

694
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:11,136
Are teenage driver I actually do feel like

695
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:14,208
There's a lot of benefit for knowing how they're driving

696
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,024
So I'm going to suggest an OBD Port monitor

697
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,048
Device

698
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,096
And I'm actually going to suggest

699
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:21,632
You can actually do any number

700
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:22,656
Thursday

701
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:27,264
Two variations the cheaper ones usually connect via Wi-Fi or something

702
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,824
Over your phone so the data is not

703
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,104
Continuously sent to you

704
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:36,736
The more expensive ones that come with a subscription be like Verizon Tom or the Sprint one that you mentioned

705
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:38,016
Those are connected

706
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:40,576
Cellular and you can get real-time

707
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:41,856
Status updates

708
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:43,136
Where they are

709
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:43,904
How fast

710
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:46,976
How they are applying their brakes and all kind

711
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:51,328
Which is pretty useful for a new driver has I think

712
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,632
The Privacy aspect I think

713
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:55,424
Eric is writing at this point

714
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,960
The carriers and these are

715
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:58,752
Solutions you just mentioned

716
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:00,032
Which is why I bring this up

717
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:05,664
They already have so much information from the smartphones that we all have those of us have today so

718
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:10,784
Yeah you're giving him a little bit more

719
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,832
Hey how fast is this person going

720
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:13,856
How are they breaking

721
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:16,160
Where are they going

722
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:22,816
The flipside is

723
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:24,352
Based on

724
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:26,144
Set time of

725
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:29,728
Driving the captured data saver 30-60 days Etc

726
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:30,752
From

727
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:33,312
That device and you will get a discount

728
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:34,080
You headache

729
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:35,104
Relatively safe

730
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:36,896
Driving. So

731
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:41,248
Save your money again. You're giving up data to somebody else but

732
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:42,784
And that's up to you to decide if that's

733
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:44,064
Worth anything

734
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,600
Potential cost savings but

735
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:50,976
Turn on privacy standpoint it's just a teeny weeny bit more information than they probably already have

736
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:52,000
He and I

737
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,560
Keep an eye on this

738
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:55,584
The zoo

739
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,656
Or the automatic also doesn't integration with if

740
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,704
This is interesting be

741
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,264
Because you can actually use that data

742
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:06,336
Put their driving date or their location data into spreadsheets

743
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:08,896
And then you could apply that to like a map and see what

744
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:09,664
Like Bradley

745
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,432
What your team

746
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:11,200
Avatar

747
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:12,992
Or you could just get you

748
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:15,808
You can also set up like notify

749
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:16,576
Applications for

750
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:20,160
You can get an email when the car's engine is having

751
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:21,184
Or attacks

752
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:23,488
And that sort of thing might be really interesting to

753
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:26,048
I would say check out

754
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,608
Put automatic in zube because of those

755
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:33,216
Connections I'm sure you can set up that on Verizon's hum as well or the Sprint thing

756
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:34,496
But I think

757
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:35,520
It just has a

758
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:36,544
Richard

759
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:39,360
Bass option so Derek that is our advice for you

760
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:41,408
Good luck with your team driver

761
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:44,736
I'm not there yet but I'm really nervous about

762
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,552
All right

763
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:53,952
That concludes the news portion of this week's show stay tuned for a conversation with Krissy Meyer

764
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:55,744

767
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:04,448
How to build hardware for Consumer and Enterprise

768
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:05,216
Iot

769
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:07,776
As well as explained to us

770
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:09,056
Why the heck

771
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:10,336
Connected devices

772
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,104
Costume

773
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:16,480
And what you can do for your favorite companies to support them and give them a little extra margin

774
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:18,016
Woo

775
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:18,784
Before that

776
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:25,184
Let's hear from our sponsor this week sponsor is a pharaoh hey everyone we are taking a break from the in

Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor sponsor is a pharaoh and I have

778
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,888
CEO Joe Britt back on the show

780
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:38,240
Text with Joe

781
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:43,104
SoJO last time we talked we talked about Mitsubishi Bank combining iot

782
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,896
Banking before we get to that

783
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:46,944
Can you remind our listeners what a pharaoh.

784
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:48,736
Of course

785
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:50,528
And thank you Stacey it

786
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:51,552
Really good to be back

787
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:52,576
Can talking with you again

788
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:53,856
Cheryl provides

789
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:55,648
Everything that you need to connect

790
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:56,928
Anything to the internet

791
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:58,976
From helping you build a business case

792
00:31:59,232 --> 00:31:59,744
All the way

793
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,512
To roll out

794
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:02,560
Ongoing management and data analytics

795
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:08,448
Our customers tell us that a pharaoh is the best choice for a great end-user experience and developer productivity

796
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:09,984
It's also beautiful design

797
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,264
Really easy to use

798
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:12,544
Very fast

799
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,824
And very very secure

800
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:18,432
Alright so let's talk about what's happening with the Pharaoh in Mitsubishi

801
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:22,016
This is the largest bank of Japan one of the largest in the world

802
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:23,552
And it has a pretty long hair

803
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:25,088
That's right

804
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:27,392
Mitsubishi ufj Financial Group

805
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:29,184
Dates back to the 1880s

806
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,512
It's actually the world's fifth-largest Bank by total assets

807
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:35,072
About 2.5 trillion dollars

808
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:39,424
This project with Mitsubishi ufg is really one of the killer wraps if I owed

809
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:41,728
Connected things of course deliver value

810
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:43,008
And in many occasions

811
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:44,288
That leads to a financial

812
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,104
Transaction fees things typically transaction

813
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,200
Person holding a mobile phone but down the line will also be able to transact

814
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:54,784
Directly with each other based on Smart contracts and things like that

815
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,344
We called it project the bank of things

816
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:59,136
Why is Mitsubishi bad

817
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:00,160
Creating this

818
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:04,512
Mitsubishi bank is creating the bank of things

819
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:08,096
To exponentially increase the surface area

820
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:08,864
Of

821
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:09,888
Devices

822
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:12,448
That can actually be paid for digitally

823
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:15,776
Most of these devices are things that fade into the background

824
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:17,056
Crown dinner so

825
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:19,360
Cost constraint or resource constraints

826
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:22,176
It doesn't make sense to attach a traditional

827
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:23,712
Expensive pain at terminal

828
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:24,992
To the actual device

829
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,528
But using a pharaoh

830
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:30,368
With a very inexpensive and simple but secure Bluetooth connect

831
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:31,648
Mitsubishi Bank

832
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:33,184
Can allow their customers

833
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:34,976
To make secure payments

834
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:38,048
Almost any kind of device at almost any price point

835
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,144
The idea is

836
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,680
You got things like parking meters

837
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:48,800
Vending machines why aren't all those things connected to the internet. All connected because it's really expensive

838
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:53,664
Either have to put a cellular radio in each one which would cost a lot

839
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:59,552
And then you have to provide some Wi-Fi connection nearby but with the affair a solution all you need is a really Annex

840
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:00,576
Expensive Bluetooth radio

841
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:02,112
And then we're able to set up a

842
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:04,416
Secure connection through the user smartphone

843
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:05,440
Back to the intern

844
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:07,744
And we use that secure Bluetooth connect

845
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,024
To the cloud

846
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:12,864
Command the device to do something after the payment has been processed

847
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:18,240
Apeiro. IOS

848
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:19,520
Go - big

849
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:20,800
Is always the best place to

850
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:22,336
Start if your developer

851
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:23,872
You can also check out

852
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:24,896
Developer.

853
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:30,016
Affero. IO and check out all the resources that we have on the Pharaoh. IO

854
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:42,560

Super excited we're going to talk about crazy things you are building in your own we're going to talk about Venture Capital Trends in consumer

862
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,064
Versus Enterprise iot and if we're really lucky

863
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:06,112
Managing Supply chains

864
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:06,880
So much fun

865
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:08,160
Let's get started

866
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:10,720
Why don't you tell us a little bit about root Ventures and

867
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,304
Thrift Ventures is a venture capital firm

868
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,840
We are hard

869
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:16,864
Tech investor

870
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:18,400
Let me focus on

871
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:21,216
The seed stage the basically what that mean

872
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:24,544
Making investment really early and

873
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,312
Startup company

874
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:26,592
Who are solving

875
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:27,616
Very hard

876
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,432
Things like

877
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:31,456
Hardware

878
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,224
Iot

879
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:33,504
Robotics

880
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,320
Manufacturing and developer tools

881
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:38,880
I spent the past

882
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:39,904
Decade

883
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:40,672
Golang

884
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:42,208
Consumer electronics products

885
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:44,256
So at huge companies

886
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:45,024
Light

887
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,816
Apple and square

888
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:49,120
Skeleton mask

889
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:50,144
Volume

890
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,192
And then all the way to very early stage

891
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:53,216
Hardware startup

892
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:57,312
Kingdom Builder organizations

893
00:35:57,824 --> 00:36:00,128
Heart of China inside factories and Empire

894
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:02,432
Suppliers mostly in Asia

895
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:05,504
Now I got to take everything that I learned over the

896
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,064
Horses that career and use it to help guide

897
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:10,112
Roots investment Visa

898
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:13,952
And also help advise all of the company that we in Bastion

899
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:19,072
Awesome so let's use that expertise and talk first off

900
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:21,120
About at route in

901
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:25,984
Specifically as a venture investor cuz that isn't that is a different mindset than someone who's an entrepreneur

902
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,032
Product designer with income

903
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:33,152
What are you looking for when you evaluate consumer iot

904
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:33,920
Hardware in Bessemer

905
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:37,248
So not many investors

906
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:38,016
Shaving

907
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:39,808
But I really

908
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:42,368
The Sounders that we're most excited

909
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,904
You are the one

910
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,208
To walk into our office with

911
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:47,744
1/2

912
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,536
Prototype rather than a

913
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:50,816
A super polish

914
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:51,840
Ed stock

915
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:52,608
So

916
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:53,632
We're looking for

917
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:55,168
Deeply technical founder

918
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,216
With a bold idea and

919
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,264
The experience

920
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,312
And who have the know-how

921
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:02,336
To be able to

922
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,896
It's funny that people

923
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:07,712
People showing me demos are often

924
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:14,112
Super apologetic that's their robot didn't work or that their software hit a bug or that there

925
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:18,208
Hearts were 3D printed and not injection-molded but

926
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:21,024
Honestly like as a technical investor

927
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,816
That's really what I wanted

928
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:24,608
I feel like I want to talk about the Chow

929
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:31,264
But they're having and I want to see the areas that are super high res can I want to hear about their planet

930
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:32,800
4

931
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:34,080
How they're going

932
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:35,616
To overcome those issues

933
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:38,176
Okay so guess if I bring you my

934
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:39,712
My disassembled prototype

935
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:40,992
I'm I'm already

936
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:42,016
Looking good

937
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:46,624
What are the pitfalls you see in the consumer iot

938
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:49,184
Around Hardware startup so once here's

939
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,720
You started on your journey

940
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:52,512
Maybe it's got something awesome

941
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:56,096
Where do you see companies or maybe Founders start to

942
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:58,912
Make the mistakes and it Hardware your mistakes

943
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:02,752
Can really cause a lot of problems you can't fix it quite as easily as soft

944
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,056
Definitely true

945
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:08,640
Enterprise's car and I don't want to downplay that at all

946
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:10,944
But building Hardware

947
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:13,760
Consumers is

948
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:14,784
Even harder

949
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,064
I feel like on the

950
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,088
Riverside

951
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:19,648
More than half the battle is

952
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:21,440
Figuring out who the

953
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:25,024
Hack is going to buy your products it's really not as straightforward as people often.

954
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:27,840
So once you have that figured out and you know

955
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:28,864
Who your target

956
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,424
Market is that you have to figure out distribution

957
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,752
So another words like how are you going to get your

958
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:37,568
Product to those customers that

959
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,616
It retail stores

960
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:41,152
Amazon

961
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:42,688
Direct online

962
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:45,504
My partnering with other businesses

963
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,528
Bundling it with

964
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,576
Products like those are all a

965
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:54,464
People fail to realize a lot about building

966
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,744
Consumer Hardware

967
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:59,840
Really difficult to make any money

968
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:02,144
The product

969
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:04,704
It's so before we get to kind of

970
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:05,984
Laying out all the

971
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,544
Costs associated with the connected device which I think

972
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:11,616
Trying to build one and people who are

973
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:12,896
Find one will appreciate

974
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:15,456
Let's go back to this idea of identifying your

975
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:18,016
Your Market because I do see a lot of people

976
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,040
Build things

977
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:23,648
Did seem to solve a particular problem for them which in some cases like Dropbox

978
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:27,232
Is awesome and in other cases like maybe

979
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:31,328
Juicero comes to Pint it feels like who that was so nice and

980
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:32,096
It cost so much

981
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:33,888
How do people find their target

982
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:41,056
It's not an easy thing it takes a lot of time it takes a lot of Blood Sweat and Tears in it and take a lot of getting out and

983
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:42,336
Walking to the

984
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:43,616
Customer

985
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:44,640
The number one

986
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:47,968
Better than Vice that I like to give the people if

987
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:51,296
To test early and test offense oh

988
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:55,904
I don't care if you had like 3D printed parts and I don't care if your prototype is

989
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,208
Is barely held together like

990
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:00,000
Cheap prototype

991
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:03,072
Even if you have something that you can

992
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:05,888
Has even a subset of the functionality

993
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:09,216
Get out there and get people using it because that is how you find

994
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:11,264
People and what does

995
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:12,800
And that's also how you

996
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:13,824
You find out

997
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:14,592
Who

998
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:16,896
It wasn't it was and who it doesn't run

999
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:19,712
Can respond your product-based

1000
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:24,064
But the real challenge with it takes a lot of

1001
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,088
Another get out

1002
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:31,232
Those customers again and again and again and doing that as much on the

1003
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:32,768
Brunch and a view

1004
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:35,072
Possibly can because

1005
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:35,840
Further

1006
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:36,864
You get along

1007
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:37,632
In

1008
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:38,400
Product design

1009
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:43,776
Further you get along in manufacturing it gets

1010
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:47,104
Harder and harder to unwind wrong decision

1011
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:50,688
It's hard to iterate when you've already produced a millionaire

1012
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:51,712
10000 device

1013
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:54,272
Okay so let's talk about cost

1014
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:55,040
And

1015
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:55,808
My favorite word

1016
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:56,576
Bomb

1017
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:58,368
Which stands for bill of materials

1018
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:00,416
It's basically a fancy way of saying

1019
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:01,184
How much it cost

1020
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:07,584
Let's break that down because you shared a surprising stat with me about I have a cost to produce something of

1021
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:11,680
Like a bill of materials for $100 then I actually have to sell this for likes

1022
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:12,448
300

1023
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:13,984
Yep

1024
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,544
Unfortunate reality of shipping

1025
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,080
Timber Hardware

1026
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:20,384
People don't always fully under

1027
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,408
Understand that

1028
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:27,808
I can't build a device for $100 and sell it for $200 and make money

1029
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:28,832
Not how it works

1030
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:35,488
So there's so many things that you have to add in like so don't be teasing Freight charges and warranty

1031
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:37,024
Using credit cards

1032
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:39,584
To keep going

1033
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:40,864
The reality of this

1034
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:41,888
Situation is that if you

1035
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:43,424
Build a hundred dollar device

1036
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,960
$100

1037
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:48,032
To assemble a $100 Bond, then

1038
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:49,568
That might bring you up to like

1039
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:52,128
$130 if I'm lucky

1040
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:53,919
By the time I check on all

1041
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:59,039
And then if you're selling through retail you have to turn around and go

1042
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:02,367
Thanks to the retail store for every single product that

1043
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:03,903
So

1044
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:05,183
And that's just the difference

1045
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:06,207
Wholesale in

1046
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:11,071
Yeah and it's it's to the point that I will every retailer

1047
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:12,607
Expect to take margin

1048
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,655
To actually stop your products

1049
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:18,751
Inventory and put it on their shelves so now this product that cost $100

1050
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:19,519
To build

1051
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:21,311
I just thought for $200

1052
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:22,335
Just to break even

1053
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:23,615
And then I have to sell it

1054
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:26,175
$300 if I want to make

1055
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:29,503
Any real margin or making it real money

1056
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:31,039
So it's it's

1057
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:33,599
The bends when you're building a

1058
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:35,903
Product and you've got to remember that your

1059
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:36,671
Average

1060
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:37,695
Consumers

1061
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:39,231
Pretty price-sensitive

1062
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:41,023
After selling a product for $100

1063
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:44,095
$300 might make Lee

1064
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:47,679
Huge impact on their decision whether or not to buy it

1065
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:54,591
Okay and this is why is consumers we see a lot of companies like launch their products sell only on their website and made

1066
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:56,127
Maybe sell to Amazon how does

1067
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:58,175
How does Amazon hire from

1068
00:42:58,431 --> 00:42:59,711
Putting something on a fist

1069
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:00,479
Spell Shelf

1070
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:06,879
Amazon also takes a fairly significant margin so they'll also take a pretty significant chunk off the top

1071
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:09,439
But they're able to do so at a much

1072
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:11,231
Encourage you

1073
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:13,791
Physical retail stores that are carrying

1074
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:15,583
Significant

1075
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:16,351
Mentori

1076
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:18,655
So if you really love a startup

1077
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:19,423
You should buy for the

1078
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:23,263
Absolutely they would love you

1079
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:24,031
Before that

1080
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:30,431
Okay so let's say we talked a bit about consumer let's talk about Enterprise how is investing in Enterprise

1081
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:31,455
Fry's iot

1082
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:34,271
Company is different and specifically the hardware

1083
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:36,063
What are the differences

1084
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:36,831
In

1085
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:38,623
Selling Hardware to Enterprise

1086
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,695
So on the Enterprise side

1087
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:42,975
We are selling products

1088
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:45,791
Companies you got to remember that

1089
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:48,095
Sales cycle can be

1090
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:50,143
Painfully painfully long

1091
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:51,679
I can make a really long time

1092
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:52,959
Close the contract

1093
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:57,311
Really want him to get a purchase order approved

1094
00:43:57,567 --> 00:44:01,663
Five levels of the management change to get signatures from everyone

1095
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:03,967
You might have to go through multiple rounds

1096
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:04,991
Pilot

1097
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:06,527
Before you get anywhere

1098
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:07,551
Close to even

1099
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:09,343
Clothing that that contract

1100
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:10,623
At the end of the day if

1101
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:11,903
Cast by episode

1102
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:12,671
Same time like

1103
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:14,719
You can sustain and you can

1104
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:19,839
Grow a successful business by selling primarily in the Fortune 500 companies are bigger Enterprise customers

1105
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:23,679
And on the Enterprise side when you're building hardware for them

1106
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:26,239
Do you have to worry quite so much about

1107
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:29,055
Things like always just the prettiest package is

1108
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:30,847
Does this have that space age

1109
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:33,151
White shiny Apple designer that

1110
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:36,735
Fabric-covered I don't even know there's all kinds of design Trends happen

1111
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:40,831
On the consumer side what do Enterprises look for when they buy

1112
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:43,647
That's a really good point usually you don't

1113
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:50,047
But sometimes you do it very dramatically based on who your customer is here selling to

1114
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:51,071
The product is

1115
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:51,839
And what it does

1116
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:53,631
Interesting

1117
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:54,911
Square for a while

1118
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:57,983
And we were building the little credit card reader

1119
00:44:58,239 --> 00:44:59,519
We were not selling

1120
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:03,871
Zoomers we were selling the business as they were small and medium-sized businesses

1121
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:05,663
But it was still a business

1122
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:06,431
Business

1123
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:07,199
Play

1124
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:08,991
It was

1125
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:13,599
Has the piece of Hardware was going to be storefront for them when they were interacting

1126
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:14,879
What's in there

1127
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:16,671
It was very important

1128
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:24,095
Have a level polish that you would expect in a in a consumer product so I think it really depends on

1129
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:26,655
Depends on who you're selling it to and how it's going to be

1130
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:28,447
Alright in Seoul

1131
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:30,751
For any of these companies Enterprise

1132
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:31,519
Consumer

1133
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:34,847
Let's break down some of the challenges that you might have

1134
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:35,615
In

1135
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:38,431
Your supply chain in getting this sort of thing

1136
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:39,967
Built and manufactured

1137
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:42,271
You know a lot of this happens in Asia

1138
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:44,319
All hear horror stories

1139
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,855
We also hear horror stories about

1140
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:46,879
Do I get in the US

1141
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:49,695
So what kind of advice can you offer

1142
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:51,487
People about physically

1143
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:53,791
Manufacturing the device and then managing the

1144
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:54,559
Supply chain

1145
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:55,583
Go into it

1146
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:56,863
Play I Like It

1147
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:58,399
People that you can have

1148
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:01,215
Product design in the world but if

1149
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:03,007
You don't have a supply chain

1150
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:05,823
Playoff you're never going to make it to Market with your product

1151
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:09,151
I spend

1152
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:15,551
A pretty significant check on my China advising new hardware companies were just starting to think about how to go about

1153
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:16,575
Shutting up

1154
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:17,599
Supply chain

1155
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:22,207
And there's a few mistakes that I've seen people make and if it fits of advice that I like

1156
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:26,047
Tell people outside and one is that your manufacturing partner

1157
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:27,327
Has to be

1158
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:28,607
Well mat

1159
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:30,399
To your company Sage

1160
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:31,679
And also to your

1161
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:33,215
Product complexity

1162
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:35,263
You have to look Beyond

1163
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:36,031
Justice

1164
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:40,127
Technical capabilities that they can check all the boxes on the technical side

1165
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:42,943
Culture fit an attitude

1166
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:44,479
Is super important

1167
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:47,039
To that they're not willing to move it at speed that you're you

1168
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:49,855
It's not going to be a good set

1169
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:55,743
Asia isn't always the answer so people I see the people are

1170
00:46:56,255 --> 00:47:02,143
Consider the hardwood products made it to Asia but I don't think that's the right way to think about it I think that you need to be

1171
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:07,007
Pushing really significant volumes for Asia to make sense and even then it

1172
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:08,031
It doesn't always make

1173
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:10,591
You shouldn't make that leap

1174
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:14,431
To Manufacturing in Asia until you know

1175
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:15,711
That you're really

1176
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:16,991
Read me ready

1177
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:17,759
The last

1178
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:18,783
Mistake but I see it

1179
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:20,831
People assuming that like bigger is better

1180
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:23,135
That I want to work with the biggest

1181
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:29,535
Factory Partners I can find because they have a big name in there will know and of course they're going to do a good job but

1182
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:33,375
Being a small customer at a large

1183
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:34,399
Talk to your

1184
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:37,215
Supplier means that we run into

1185
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:38,239
At 1

1186
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:40,543
You're going to struggle to get resources

1187
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:42,591
Then you're going to struggle to get attention

1188
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:48,223
I've had that problem many times over any one time I was I was working with a start-up when we were partnered with us

1189
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:52,575
Very well-known top-tier Factory I'm not going to name any names but

1190
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:54,111
We have been given

1191
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:55,391
Empathic

1192
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:58,975
A+ players they were doing

1193
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:00,511
An amazing job

1194
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:02,559
Hijack and then

1195
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,375
Again tired team

1196
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:06,655
Disappeared

1197
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:08,959
Overnight and was replaced by like

1198
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:10,239
Newly-hired

1199
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:13,055
Engineers and I mean like they're bad

1200
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:13,823
Warm hunting

1201
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:16,895
Literally people that they had hired

1202
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:18,175
Like 2 to 3 days

1203
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:18,943
Beforehand

1204
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:21,247
And of course I freaked out

1205
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:23,295
But it turned out that like my

1206
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:24,063
Amazing

1207
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:27,903
Like a big famous customer and since we were such as

1208
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:30,463
Small startup working with this big fat

1209
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:32,511
There really wasn't anything I

1210
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:34,559
I can do about it and that is the key

1211
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:35,583
Problem

1212
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:41,983
That you can run into if you haven't been really dirty Jacob Frey and if you aren't well match

1213
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:44,031
With your supply chain partners

1214
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:46,079
Okay

1215
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:52,479
And as a consumer I sit here and I am looking at all of this and probably the number one concern I have with

1216
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:57,599
My Hardware devices is actually security and it's very similar in the Enterprise

1217
00:48:58,367 --> 00:49:01,951
What are you seeing I mean we hear a lot about like design with security in my

1218
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:05,535
We hear a lot about like the bare minimum should be no hard go to passwords in

1219
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:07,327
Encrypt everything

1220
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:12,703
And we got a lot of new standards coming out UL is working on a standard arm just announce something on the

1221
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:19,103
The device side I get lot of chatter about this so what are you advising your companies to do what are you

1222
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:20,127
Thinking isn't

1223
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:22,943
Security is

1224
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:24,223
Q

1225
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:27,551
Personally I'm glad to see that we're moving towards

1226
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:31,391
More and more legislation around that but

1227
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:35,487
First artist that I work with it's something that I like to stress

1228
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:37,535
Need attention from

1229
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:42,143
Day 1 like a cannot be an afterthought I mean it from the moment

1230
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:44,191
That you start architecture

1231
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:45,471
Your product

1232
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:48,031
You should be thinking about data usage

1233
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:49,311
Privacy

1234
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:55,711
You should understand the concept of pii like personally identifiable information you should understand what it is

1235
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:56,479
How you're going to have

1236
00:49:56,735 --> 00:49:58,015
Handle it and if you're building a

1237
00:49:58,271 --> 00:49:59,551
Consumer product you should

1238
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:02,879
Probably this load what type of sensors are inside of it

1239
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:06,463
When you think that you have all of your bases

1240
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:09,279
When you think you're in a really good place

1241
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:10,303
Don't shop there

1242
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:12,863
And bring in an expert

1243
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:15,167
Let them poke holes

1244
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:16,703
And how you're handling

1245
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:17,471
Ring security

1246
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:19,263
How you're handling user data

1247
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:21,055
Trust me like hiring

1248
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:22,079
Security consultant

1249
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:23,103
Now bikes

1250
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:26,175
Expensive especially if you're in early

1251
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:27,711
PlayStation startup but

1252
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:28,735
If it prevents

1253
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:31,039
Product returns or even worse if it prevents

1254
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:34,111
A walk through door really bad headline

1255
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:35,647
It's worth every

1256
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:38,719
All right and we talked

1257
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:42,559
How to briefly before the show about some of the cool things that you've done actually in your own home

1258
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:44,607
And so since we have all these crazy

1259
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:45,375
Consumers who

1260
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:49,215
Do I know what I know you guys out there listening to a lot of fun stuff so

1261
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:51,007
Tell me what's your favorite projects

1262
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:52,031
They've done so far in your

1263
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:55,103
Atrovent Rosier one of the earliest

1264
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:56,383
Ambassadors Inn

1265
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:58,175
Particle

1266
00:50:58,431 --> 00:51:00,479
Talk about article on your show before but

1267
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:01,759
The great thing about

1268
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:03,295
Particle is that as a

1269
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:05,599
Iot development platform

1270
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:09,439
They have they really nailed the integration

1271
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:10,463
Cloud

1272
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:11,999
Firmware

1273
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:13,535
Hardware

1274
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:15,327
Credibly easy-to-use

1275
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:17,119
Way I would never

1276
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:18,399
Seem to be

1277
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:20,191
A software developer

1278
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:21,983
But I've been able to get particles out

1279
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:23,007
All over me

1280
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:24,543
I think my

1281
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:25,823
Everett project

1282
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:29,151
Is that I use one to connect my

1283
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:30,175
Fireplace

1284
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:31,711
To the cloud

1285
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:32,735
So

1286
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:35,295
Now I can turn the fireplace on and off

1287
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:37,087
With Madame and I never

1288
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:39,391
Amazing

1289
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:40,671
I have to ask

1290
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:41,695
What is your command

1291
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:43,231
Place I really wanted to

1292
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:43,999
To get

1293
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:46,303
It's pretty boy

1294
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:49,887
Madam a

1295
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:50,911
Tiger the fire

1296
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:55,007
I feel like

1297
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:57,311
Madame a it's getting hot in here

1298
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:58,591
Excellent

1299
00:51:59,103 --> 00:51:59,615
All right

1300
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:02,943
I think I might have to go update it now

1301
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:07,039
Another one

1302
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:08,575
To the land of my

1303
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:10,111
Dog food container

1304
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:14,207
Show that now I get notifications anytime

1305
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:18,815
My husband feed the dogs because we were having problems where they were getting fed

1306
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:22,399
Wy'east I it it was happening more often than we'd like to admit

1307
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:26,495
Next time I should realize I want to go back in there

1308
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:28,799
And add a

1309
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:30,079
Notification

1310
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:31,359
In the event that the dog

1311
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:37,759
Don't get bad and we forget this but if you actually a little bit

1312
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:40,831
I don't think it would be the worst thing in the world if they skipped a meal or two

1313
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:44,415
So that your least favorite automation is what I meant

1314
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:46,463
We had it so good

1315
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:47,487
