Which is a Wi-Fi like that with

Multi-touch

18
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,592
But before we begin

19
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:52,992
Let's start with a word from our sponsor sizely

20
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:59,392
Around the world Spring to market the most successful is innovative iot products available today so I leave connect

Business at www.liveleak.com iot

25
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:24,224
After the show

26
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:28,064
So let's get started this week

27
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,600
You want to start with wearables

28
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:35,232
We can do that I was going to actually say something about traveling cuz I suspect you are traveling based on the

29
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:38,816
Audio feed coming from your side of conversation

30
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:39,840
You're right

31
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:41,376
So I am traveling

32
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:43,168
This week so apologies

33
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:45,216
Or weird sound quality

34
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:48,288
I promise I will be back in the studio next week

35
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:50,336
And I'm exploring different setup

36
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:52,128
Or making my travel

37
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:54,176
Rick a little bit more compact

38
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:56,224
So you really phoning it in this way

39
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,016
Literally literally phoning it in

40
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:00,320
Dunton

41
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:05,440
You can talk more this

42
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:09,536
I hope you got your coffee

43
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:12,352
Let's get started with

44
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:15,936
Phillips on

45
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:20,288
Is actually Monday or Sunday night introduced a bunch of new wearables

46
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,312
Which

47
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:24,384
Many of those are probably like really do I need a fitness tracker

48
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,408
Scale

49
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,456
Thermometer and blood pressure cuffs

50
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,224
Sam Phillips

51
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:29,760
The answer is

52
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:32,576
Yes if you wanted to be FDA-approved

53
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:38,976
Which is interesting because a lot of the wearables that are Health Focus

54
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:41,280
Typically not FDA-approved

55
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,352
She's not necessarily a bad thing but

56
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:48,192
It speaks to how accurate the devices may or may not be

57
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:50,752
So it's something to keep in mind when you're searching for

58
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:51,776
Health-related wearable

59
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:55,360
Exactly is really competing with wiping

60
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:56,896
Most of the devices

61
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,944
The same set of devices

62
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,992
Matheson Pocus witches

63
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:02,016
Actually getting

64
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:04,832
FDA approvals of doctors at Health Systems

65
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:06,112
Actually use them

66
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,392
In Phillips

67
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:10,976
Many of you may not be aware I don't know not only do they make Lee

68
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:13,280
Sonicare toothbrushes sales make list

69
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:16,864
Ultrasound machine veggies and other things that are actually

70
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,632
Hospital

71
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,264
Sophie devices are a little bit more expensive balance watches like $250 for

72
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:24,800
And

73
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:28,128
It's kind of a fitness band kind of a smartwatch

74
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,664
It does give you heart rate

75
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,200
I'm sleeping patterns

76
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:33,248
It goes down step-counting

77
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,528
Is basically offering like

78
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,296
Better actress

79
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:41,952
So it's not what I would call a smartwatch in the traditional sense of the term if there is the traditional sense

80
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:42,976
August

81
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:46,048
Definitely more of a health-focused and a higher grade

82
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,840
One more accurate

83
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:52,192
Device than what you would buy it in a typical Smartwatch that can do the same things

84
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:55,520
Working with

85
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,288
Hospital

86
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,568
And with

87
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:59,104
The insurance companies in

88
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,128
March

89
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:00,896
Squares

90
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,944
To try to get people to

91
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,992
I'm going to install these devices

92
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:07,040
Is that really you're just you're just wearing

93
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:09,088
I don't think they're going to try to

94
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,392
Branch out that way in

95
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:14,464
You know we talked to Michelle about having Fitness

96
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,488
Trackers

97
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:18,815
What wearables on your body provided by your employer insurance

98
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:19,583
Company

99
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:20,607
Until

100
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:21,887
Not I mean

101
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:24,191
Some people are fine with it some people are like

102
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,471
You know I really don't want

103
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:26,495
That day.

104
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,055
Those people

105
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,103
TT how this works out

106
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:34,175
It does have a really big potential impact

107
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,967
Precision Medicine Show

108
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:37,759
I'm really torn on how this

109
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:38,783
Should I play out

110
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:45,951
I think in general it's a pretty smart move I mean they're not just offering one product that's actually a suite of products as you mentioned there's a scale

111
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,743
Wearable

112
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:50,303
A thermometer at two different blood pressure

113
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,863
Coxswain for the upper arm on for the rest

114
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:56,703
So you have a whole Suite of products is I think more appealing to

115
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,751
People can just a one-off here and there

116
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:03,871
And also as you mention if they get in with employers or large companies

117
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:09,247
It's possible that could generate large sales quickly because those companies might be able to

118
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,527
I don't know if these are

119
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:16,159
Expensable type items because they're update approved their health-related and then there's there's a lot of different

120
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:19,231
Ways this could play out as opposed to the consumer Market

121
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,023
And I will let you guys know

122
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:23,327
Phyllis is sending me a

123
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,887
A bundle of them with everything except for the thermometer

124
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:28,703
Eventually I'll be able to let you know

125
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:35,359
I should say about Healthcare bundles I wanted to update you because I have been wearing the Under Armour

126
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,383
Under Armour Fitness box

127
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,991
Because I was going to ask I was going to ask about that

128
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,271
I don't love it

129
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,295
Okay

130
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:46,367
Pictures a box I got it for 300

131
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,903
This $300 cuz

132
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:51,231
But it's $400 it contains a

133
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:52,255
Scale

134
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,327
Weight body fat

135
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:58,143
It also contains a fitness band

136
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,935
Heart rate tracker

137
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:02,495
And then I get to use the Under Armour record app

138
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:04,799
Like it alot

139
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:09,151
Yeah I think this is where you being an avid Runner

140
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:13,247
And me being an avid let's do other things like coming to play so

141
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,807
AP we emphasizes

142
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:20,671
People who really want to get fit really tractor Fitness at a really high level

143
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,463
Is it really me

144
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:27,583
It's really kind of a little bit frustrating

145
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,887
Calibrate your stride

146
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:32,447
Toy that fitness tracker

147
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,471
If your butt

148
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:34,751
So it's like

149
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:38,079
No no calories

150
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:42,431
Right there's no GPS in the unit so that's very important thing

151
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:47,551
And then also they cream so much information on this band that I'm kind of like

152
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:52,415
Wow you have to go through a lot of menus to do things like set the alarm

153
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:56,767
I think that's three menu prices to set an alarm maybe even 5

154
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,327
And then

155
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,887
I can't get to some things on the band

156
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:02,911
But I want to

157
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:08,543
For like what I'm probably the biggest downside to me is that

158
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,335
It doesn't automatically

159
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,615
Register

160
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,151
What I'm doing for today

161
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:16,479
Maybe I'm spoiled because job

162
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,247
Batman

163
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:21,343
I forgot to track like half my workout

164
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:28,767
Yeah that's a fair point and there's a lot of devices that still don't do automatic tracking by sensing what exercise you're doing

165
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:30,815
That's one of the features that I actually

166
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:35,423
I love on my Fitbit Surge and that's exactly what's on my wrist right now and has been for

167
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:36,703
Two or three months

168
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,263
You know I've walked around New York City yesterday

169
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,287
To the office to the

170
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,823
Port Authority Bus Terminal

171
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:48,223
I didn't have to tell it I was walking it just later said hey you walk 24 minutes he was your heart rate he was your distance you or your steps

172
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:52,319
So that is a big bonus for people who are focused on on the health

173
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,599
Packing bits

174
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,135
As far as the

175
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,183
Getting two different things in the band yet

176
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,463
Like everything else

177
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:04,095
Mobiletech everything's a trade-off see fit a very small narrow screen on the band to keep the band

178
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,911
Abandonada giant watch or anything and

179
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:07,935
You can

180
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:14,335
You said so there's a lot of menu options just to get what you need because you have small a small screen to deal with so

181
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:16,639
Those are all very fair points and maybe it's

182
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,919
More Focus for

183
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,967
Somebody and I run everyday and that's

184
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:20,991
That's why I like that

185
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,015
It's Anza

186
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:22,783
Contrapoints

187
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,831
Yeah and I mean the scale is fine

188
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,647
T heart rate monitor works really well

189
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:30,463
It did take a little bit of time to get

190
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:35,327
Could you do a shift to actively track a workout

191
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,607
Heart rate monitor

192
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,679
Better

193
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:40,703
Right right

194
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:43,519
Not to add more to your budget but

195
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:49,663
If you want automatic tracking with that system they actually do offer it just not in the what's in the box

196
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:54,783
They do sell the Under Armour record shoes with a built-in sensor

197
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:57,087
You can use those for calibration

198
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:02,207
They're always on and always tracking so when you go for a walk it will actually

199
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:06,815
Track it for you when you go for a run it will do that for you cuz the shoes are already gathering information

200
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:12,959
So for what that's worth it's an option but it's another matter $240 or $150 to add so

201
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,751
That is a missing piece to the Box

202
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,823
Yes and a lot of my workouts are

203
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,615
Spin class

204
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:22,943
Pilates or things that do not involve

205
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:23,711
Joshua

206
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:26,783
Right I feel like this is great for runners

207
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:27,807
And

208
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:35,231
Experience since I've mentioned that a couple months ago and wanted to let you guys know

209
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,023
Moving back to wearables

210
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:37,791
I think

211
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,583
You was pulled on

212
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,351
Cooler

213
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,631
Using Android Wear

214
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:45,215
Yeah this is interesting your sister for the first

215
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:48,031
Long-time traditional GPS

216
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:50,079
Fitness companies

217
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,383
To actually adopt

218
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,431
Android they came out just

219
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:59,039
This week with their new Android Wear based m600 GPS sport watch

220
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,831
And

221
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:07,743
If anybody sees the polar device before they're actually pretty good for tracking running exercise and swimming and biking it's on

222
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:13,887
But if you want to know Smartwatch functions you were going to get that so what they did was they integrated

223
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:17,215
What builds their new watch around Android where week is Google's

224
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:19,263
Platform for wearables

225
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:20,543
And

226
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:27,455
That adds all the Smartwatch functions you may want if you do such as you know call notifications text

227
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:30,271
Google Now notifications app notifications

228
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:32,319
Music controls the whole shebang

229
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,599
Plus you can

230
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,903
You can add then Android Wear apps

231
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:41,279
To the polar m600 which is something you can't do with a traditional polar or Garmin or whatever

232
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:43,583
I know Garmin has their own app store and so on foot

233
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,631
How do you spell connect IQ

234
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:48,959
But regardless it is interesting to me because it's in a

235
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,239
Gps-enabled

236
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:56,127
Please music because it has Android Wear support which supports music playback directly on the on the wearable

237
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:58,943
6 LED heart rate monitor

238
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,991
Be curious to see how accurate that is

239
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,783
And

240
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:06,623
What's at the polar Flow app as well as all other Android Wear app so

241
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,439
It's an ice melting of of traditional

242
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:11,487
Exercise wearable with

243
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:16,607
Smartwatch functionality so it's literally just lost his new reviews out yet

244
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,911
It's 329 99 when it comes out

245
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:21,471
Next month I relieve gas September

246
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:25,823
So just interesting to see somebody else adopt Android where someone you wouldn't expect

247
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:26,591
To do so

248
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:30,175
But it's alright well that's useful shows consolidation

249
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,991
Is a little consolidation in this industry

250
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,271
Or maybe

251
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:40,671
All right and we already talked about

252
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,463
That's not funny has discovered

253
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:45,791
New Philips application at the SCC

254
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:48,607
And this one looks like it's for a motion sensor

255
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,655
Philips Hue

256
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,191
Ecosystem for life

257
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,471
And

258
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,751
This is actually

259
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:57,823
Really useful we talked about kind of Lights

260
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,895
Have motion sensors inside on the podcast so there's

261
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:01,919
Stock lights

262
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:06,527
Theater lighting company called comfilytes is also building dead

263
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,575
There's probably a lot more out there

264
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,367
Lights are everywhere

265
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:16,255
Philips Hue ecosystem means that you don't have to like

266
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:18,815
Do some sort of weird motion detection thing with a

267
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:19,839
Twitch

268
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,631
A lot of people who hate hugs

269
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,399
Appreciate

270
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:28,799
I just want multiple hubs and the fact that a hub is in one single spot

271
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:33,151
It's not going to really do anything when I'm not around it from a sensor standpoint so this

272
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:35,199
Looks to be like

273
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:38,271
Queen FCC submission that they found it a zigbee

274
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:40,831
Sensor. 2in Square

275
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:41,855
It actually sounds like

276
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:45,183
Person with my ecobee sensor which I'm looking at right now my office so

277
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:49,791
Obviously types of the ecobee thermostat keeps my office cool when I'm

278
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,839
Not near the ecobee thermostat sale

279
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:54,143
It may I have no idea what the

280
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,167
Inside the Phillips

281
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:57,215
Answer yet but if I were Phillips

282
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:58,751
I would say you know what

283
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:05,663
If I'm going to sell a standalone motion sensor I'm also going to put a temperature sensor in here I'm also going to put in ambient lights

284
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,199
Just because

285
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,479
That helps

286
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:13,343
And you already has a deal with

287
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,367
Yes and

288
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:17,183
These things are going to start working better at system

289
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:20,767
Studies is companies are thinking about Building Systems the system

290
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,071
And to do that

291
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:25,887
You're going to have to do some pretty deep integration

292
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,215
Especially like

293
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:29,983
Looks like

294
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:32,287
If this is how my sensor communicate

295
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,311
The following

296
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,383
Here's experiences intolerances

297
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,687
Nest would have to

298
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:42,527
Say OK based on that here's how I would use your sensor data

299
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:45,087
Suggested the temperature in

300
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:45,855
People's house

301
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:49,951
I agree and we don't know obviously what

302
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:56,351
Mary not be inside here at the FCC if anybody looks the FCC documents are not it's all for testing purposes.

303
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,631
You're not going to get the full

304
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:59,167
The full monty on what

305
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,959
Idevices capability is

306
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:01,727
But

307
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:04,799
I kind of agree I'd like to see them expand

308
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:05,823
Beyond lighting

309
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:09,407
But honestly I mean if it's just a motion sensor for lights to me and my

310
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:14,271
We can do so much more you know you don't need to put that much more in a little box 2

311
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,807
To get much more data

312
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,343
Create better Prada

313
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:20,415
Sprite for the long-term to

314
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:21,695
Right

315
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:23,999
I will say Trish one of my

316
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,535
This is super nerdy

317
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,327
Pictures of fun music

318
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:32,703
Cuz it's the most actually did because it got their medical grade wearables right and then they got their lighting stuff

319
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:34,239
Ski Safari parts list

320
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:36,031
People talking to each other

321
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,079
How awesome would it be

322
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,871
If you're trying to track your heart rate

323
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,407
If your lights

324
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,175
Titans

325
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,455
Fitness tracker

326
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:44,735
Hey

327
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,783
You're the fat burning zone right now

328
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,063
Maybe

329
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:52,671
You had a heart attack but there are all kinds of like

330
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:55,743
Fun things you can do or even highly utilitarian thing

331
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,535
You know I would love her

332
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,071
My heart rate tracker

333
00:14:59,327 --> 00:14:59,839
Not be

334
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,887
I would love for HP

335
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,935
Tell me a little bit more Ambien

336
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:08,031
Yeah I mean that's that's a perfect example of mean if you're doing

337
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:11,359
Riding a recumbent bike in your basement or something you got your lights on

338
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,639
You can look at your

339
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:17,503
Smartwatch perhaps and see what zone you're in a heart rate but what if you could have the

340
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:22,111
The information go to the lights and then maybe they turn orange when your

341
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:25,183
Getting close to puking Reddit Peak heart rate of someone so you can

342
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:27,487
You have to look anywhere else it's just

343
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,767
The information table round

344
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:29,535
Innocence

345
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:30,559
Yes

346
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:32,607
Also I would like party mode if I

347
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,911
On my scale

348
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:38,239
Full House was like yeah

349
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:40,799
Eat Mexican tonight just so we can have party mode again

350
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:44,383
So

351
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:48,223
You bring all these things into your life though and you've got to think about

352
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:49,503
Security

353
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,039
And we got cheese

354
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:52,319
Security stories this week

355
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:56,927
We're going to have a lot of it next week because this week is blackhat Defcon

356
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:59,743
And the iron is Hot Topic there

357
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:01,279
There are a lot

358
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,863
Companies and I think they said

359
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,703
50 companies

360
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,751
50 groups trying to hack

361
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,799
Iot devices

362
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,335
13 were accepted

363
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,895
Last year we had to hack

364
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:22,783
Jeep Cherokee I remember how they stopped in traffic

365
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:26,111
Is a big to-do I think it was wired that might have

366
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,647
Got in the car and

367
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:30,719
Patent like stall out or stop on the highway I remember

368
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:31,999
Yes

369
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:32,767
DPAC

370
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,559
And they're going to try to

371
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:35,583
Happy

372
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,631
Cheap end tables

373
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:39,935
And they want to do it

374
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,543
Apparently the last time they did it they told me stop the brakes on the car

375
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,591
Moving slower than 5 miles an hour

376
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:48,895
They're going to try to make a car go faster

377
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:49,663
Cancel

378
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:54,271
Really I do not want to be okay

379
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,039
No

380
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,831
I'm hoping there's a sun Trevor

381
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:57,855
Yeah

382
00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:01,183
There's a lot of money involved with this too I know that the

383
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:05,535
Defense Advanced research projects agency at the Pentagon

384
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:09,887
According to journal they're sponsoring a three-hour all machine hacking tournament

385
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:13,727
The winning team Pockets a 2 million-dollar prize

386
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:17,823
Yeah well it makes sense

387
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,103
Yeah you really do

388
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:26,527
I'm playing original Atari 2600 games on a Raspberry Pi I should be hacking stuff instead

389
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:27,295
There you go

390
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,575
We can arrange for that

391
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,623
I will say that

392
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,671
Poor people who are great

393
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:36,511
There are best practices out there that company should be following

394
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:40,095
Please do not always follow them as in last week

395
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,911
I saw that people's Wi-Fi passwords

396
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,191
In plain text

397
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:44,959
Witches

398
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:45,983
Just

399
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:48,031
Like me opening my front door in

400
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:51,871
How do you know if MacBook Air is just right by the entryway

401
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,151
Come on

402
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,943
If you see it come take it

403
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:56,479
2

404
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:57,759
That

405
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,039
Not a good thing

406
00:17:59,295 --> 00:17:59,807
But

407
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,599
Most of the Hawks year

408
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:03,135
Probably pretty

409
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:06,207
Vulnerability

410
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:08,511
The things that should be passed but

411
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:11,071
Hopefully most of them won't be as egregious

412
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:12,095
Things like that

413
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:14,399
That's the plan

414
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:16,703
And if you are worried

415
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:19,263
You should note that Georgia Tech just had a 9

416
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,055
Quick $4000000 krant

417
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:22,847
To study

418
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,639
How to monitor winsome

419
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:25,663
Compromised

420
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:26,687
The internet

421
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,479
They're actually

422
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:33,343
The research is based on the electromagnetic signals

423
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:34,623
Any device

424
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,927
Getting license when it's processing

425
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:39,231
What happens if they use machine learning

426
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:42,815
Check and see when something kind of goes out of whack

427
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:44,095
And if they

428
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:44,863
See that

429
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:47,423
Then they're like big investigate further to

430
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,447
Siesta devices

431
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:52,543
Yeah

432
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,311
Yeah

433
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:57,151
It's also interesting to me that that 9.4 million Grant guess where that came from

434
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,431
Chaka

435
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,479
DARPA

436
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:02,015
Clearly the government

437
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,551
The US government is

438
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:07,135
Trying to learn as much as possible in any way shape or form

439
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:07,903
About

440
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:09,951
Cyber-security hacking and so on

441
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:12,255
I think it's rather smarter than 2

442
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:17,119
Kind of put money out there for public and private companies and such to do so

443
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,399
There's a lot they can learn

444
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:19,679
By doing that

445
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:20,959
Yes

446
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:22,239
And we

447
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,007
Really

448
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:25,823
Really need this because we are connecting

449
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,103
So many things

450
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:27,871
And

451
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:30,687
It's stunning to me how much

452
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:36,831
I guess ambient information we're just about it everything that we're connecting gets off and how much

453
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:38,879
Now that we have a compute power you can in

454
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,951
Positively and negatively

455
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:44,767
Yay DARPA

456
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:45,535
Okay

457
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,815
Less broad topic

458
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,351
We can talk about

459
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:49,631
Water

460
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:50,655
Wonder

461
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,191
So I

462
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:53,215
Was sent

463
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:58,335
A Brita water pitcher something I haven't had since I last looked an apartment after college

464
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:02,431
But the cool thing about this one is it is part of the Amazon Dash

465
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,711
Metservice

466
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,247
And so

467
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:08,063
Basically it's got a wide side shift in the lid

468
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:08,831
And

469
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:11,391
I'm betting it's got an ultrasonic sensor in there too

470
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:13,183
Check water bottles and

471
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:14,975
At the end of

472
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:17,023
The useful Life Of The Brita filter

473
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:20,095
Another one is just going to automatically show up on my doorstep

474
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,935
I'll text the Amazon automatic

475
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:29,055
It's a kind of like that - built-in there's no button it just monitors

476
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,079
When that

477
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:32,639
Filter needs replacing I just ordered it for you

478
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:33,919
Info

479
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:38,271
I'm not at home right now so I can't split the plan is over the next week I'm going to

480
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:40,063
Basically water my plants

481
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:42,623
40 gallons of water just to see

482
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:45,439
Like how this process is I can tell you so far

483
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:47,999
There's two things that are worth noting

484
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:50,559
When this picture has a design

485
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:52,607
In that

486
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:59,007
It has a max fill line so you have to fill it every time to a certain level and you can't go about that level for it to cool

487
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:00,543
Against

488
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:02,079
I guess the gallons

489
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,199
Send a picture

490
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:08,991
So that line

491
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:11,039
Is black-on-black in the

492
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:13,087
Glossy finish in it

493
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:14,111
Artist

494
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:16,928
My first notice

495
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:17,952
Like I bake that easier

496
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:18,976
Import

497
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,024
Accuracy of the device

498
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:22,816
Menchu

499
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:29,728
This is a lot of fun this could be really fun to do and setting it up with a

500
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:30,752
We can freeze

501
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:32,544
You basically go through

502
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,312
You

503
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:35,104
Login for the picture which made

504
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,664
Really another app

505
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,944
I can't

506
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:40,736
But then it

507
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:41,760
You login

508
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,856
Automatically says do you want to connect it to your Amazon account

509
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:48,160
You log into your Amazon account

510
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:50,976
Amazon lets you choose what they replaced

511
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:52,000
Option is

512
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:54,048
There were multiple options in my case

513
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,328
And I chose

514
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:57,376
And then

515
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:01,216
I got an email from Amazon

516
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:02,496
And I'm done

517
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,056
Until I can't wait to see you like

518
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:07,104
Will this work but I actually liked

519
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,384
The fact that I could choose

520
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:10,688
Is that all the dash options that you chew

521
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:12,224
And then

522
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:14,272
I didn't like having another account

523
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:22,464
An Amazon process was super easy I mean I love with him that I was going through Amazon for anything because

524
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,232
It's just like

525
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:24,768
If we have everything

526
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,048
Just answer your

527
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:28,608
They do make that easy

528
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:33,216
You from a technical perspective I'm just actually looking at the system requirement says curious if you have to

529
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:35,776
Charge this thing I suspect. I suspect there's a

530
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:40,640
A battery inside a battery inside so it looks like a traditional

531
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:43,456
Filter if you flip up the lid up a picture

532
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:47,808
You'll see probably a 2 by 1 and a half inch square box

533
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:48,576
Underneath

534
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:52,672
And that box is where I'm assuming the Wi-Fi connection is

535
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:54,976
Ultrasonic sensor and

536
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:57,024
I'm assuming there's an ultrasonic sound

537
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:02,400
Sure I don't know

538
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,168
When you

539
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,192
Delta picture

540
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:07,776
So in the Wi-Fi cuz I was concerned about battery life

541
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:11,360
In my fridge so the wife I've actually always

542
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:14,176
It's going through basically a faraday cage

543
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:15,200
Can be hard on

544
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:16,224
Battery life

545
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:21,088
So

546
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,136
Monitoring but I don't know

547
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:28,256
Yeah I don't I don't think it'll be a problem and I'll tell you why because I look at the system requirements it

548
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,536
Says that you

549
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:35,936
Should activate the picture near the sink that you're refilling the picture and that your Wi-Fi router should not be more than 25 feet from

550
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:37,472
The saint that you're referring to picture

551
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:40,544
So I suspect it's only sending information

552
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,312
When it's

553
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:42,336
Being refilled

554
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:45,152
Yes

555
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,688
Yeah so it's not in the fridge

556
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:53,344
It certainly doesn't have a high-end Wi-Fi Radio based on the Range and they say it only works a 2.4 gigahertz network switch

557
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:56,160
I've been around for a long time so

558
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:58,208
So yeah I know I don't think it'll be a problem in your fridge

559
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:01,792
Did it say how much it is

560
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,352
$44.99

561
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:06,400
Time tracking heaven

562
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:08,192
How many gallons in putting through this thing

563
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:10,496
And we'll see if it's accurate and

564
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:12,800
CVS Pharmacy

Very fancy

577
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:47,616
Chokes we're talkin about

578
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,152

Baldwin who is the CEO of

610
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:29,504
Love

611
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:34,880
Andre Stacey thanks so much for having me

612
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:38,208
Super excited just a little note for everyone listening

613
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:41,024
I am recording this from Seattle

614
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:46,656
Make the sound of rain

615
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,496
Why don't you give us a little bit of your background

616
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:51,776
Because I think this is really important

617
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,312
Yeah that's

618
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:55,616
Connected home and

619
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:57,664
Electronic is really in my blood

620
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:00,224
I've been in the industry since it started

621
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,784
I called in a nice homes pulling wire when I was

622
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,552
School

623
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,344
Latest equipment racks

624
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:07,648
Call products into homes

625
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:09,696
Ultimately I owned and operated a

626
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:13,024
Systems integration business for about 15 years

627
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:14,816
I also served as the

628
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:17,632
The chairman and chief executive officer craspedia

629
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:22,752
Those who don't know that acronym it's a custom electronic design installation Association

630
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,872
It's the global trade organization that has represented the Connect Four

631
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:29,920
Over 27 years now

632
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:35,808
So why do people think that internet of things is in its infancy but I would argue it's more of a

633
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:39,136
Very awkward adolescent phase because there's so much change happen

634
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:43,744
This is great because your perspective

635
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:48,608
It's something that I feel like we miss a lot in the show because we focus a lot on the DIY

636
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:50,656
Solutions

637
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:52,448
The pro installers in their life

638
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:53,728
Stacy

639
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:57,056
Why aren't you talking about

640
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:59,872
And you know I've always been

641
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:01,152
Of the opinion that

642
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:03,968
That is a completely different business and its

643
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:06,016
It's reserved for kind of the upper echelon

644
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:10,624
You guys have designed the plum light switch this has been a song

645
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:12,416
We first talked about it

646
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:13,440
2013

647
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:19,840
As you guys were working on this perspective

648
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,144
Industry

649
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:26,496
The title of our story is the thrill and Agony of Hardware startups

650
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,056
With my background of a connected home

651
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:34,432
Obviously this I didn't have just an epiphany one night and a light bulb went off

652
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:35,456
In my head

653
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:36,480
Pardon the pun

654
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:39,552
After stepping on a Lego right my move into this

655
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:41,600
Venture was a bit more calculated

656
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:44,160
When I was running the Trade Organization

657
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,952
High commission several studies

658
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:48,512
To determine the size and scope of the

659
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:51,840
We'll call it the Legacy Market write professionally installed

660
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:54,144
Consumer electronic systems into

661
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,424
Three large estate homes

662
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:59,776
2013 numbers 14 billion dollar industry

663
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:02,848
As you mentioned it's for the upper echelon music

664
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:04,128
People living in very large

665
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:10,016
Is the third most popular sub system

666
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:11,552
In the connected home

667
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:15,648
Industry today behind your putting in a home theater media system

668
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:17,696
Or Distributing music for your home

669
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:21,792
And it has far greater utility than any other subsystem in your home

670
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:23,072
If you think about

671
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:28,704
How you interact at home the light switches be most used device write in a busy household

672
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:31,776
What interacts with it dozens if not hundreds of times a day

673
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:33,824
You have to really haven't been much

674
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,104
Innovation there

675
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,896
So our goal was to

676
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:37,920
Deliver all of the

677
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:39,712
Features and benefits of a

678
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:40,736
Traditional

679
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:42,784
System

680
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,064
Without all of them

681
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:44,832
Hardware

682
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:51,488
Without the complexity and obviously at a much lower cost and we looked at the current landscape of paw

683
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:55,072
Products that are out there and there are a couple of Cenote connected

684
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:57,376
Or smart light switches and dimmers

685
00:29:57,888 --> 00:30:00,192
There are a couple that are Wi-Fi

686
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:02,240
And of course they are smart light bulbs

687
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:07,360
And we've made the determination we believe that the intelligence belongs in the light switch

688
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:09,152
We wanted the relationship

689
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:10,688
Between the consumer

690
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,480
And a device that was

691
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:13,504
Familiar

692
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:16,576
Which is the switch in the second dearly

693
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:17,600
T-Mobile app

694
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:18,880
We believe strongly that

695
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:20,416
You walk in and out of your kitchen

696
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:22,976
But you don't want to pull out your smartphone to turn on your lights

697
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:24,512
We focused on the switch

698
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:25,536
And we spent

699
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:27,072
Couple of years in development

700
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:29,632
Built our beta product got it out to

701
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:30,400
Select

702
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:33,472
An audience and tested for a good nine months

703
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:35,008
Learn from that

704
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:36,544
And we made

705
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:39,360
The decision to make some pretty key changes

706
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:42,688
So before we go on to the sad Saga of manufacture

707
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,480
I'd love to actually get your

708
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:45,504
Your perspective as a

709
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,320
Professional installer because

710
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:50,624
Minecraft

711
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:52,672
Morso insteon actually

712
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:57,024
In Savannah especially are coming kind of will call it down Market

713
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,328
So I'm curious how you view

714
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:03,168
They're kind of transition and do you think they can

715
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:04,704
Orchid

716
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:07,008
Work with all these other systems

717
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:10,848
I do and I actually think it's very good for the industry but

718
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,640
Companies like

719
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:13,920
Savant

720
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:15,712
Lutron

721
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:16,992
They proved

722
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:18,272
Years ago.

723
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:21,088
The city of channel was a great channel for them

724
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,112
Vet

725
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:24,160
And test products and iterate

726
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:25,440
Before they went

727
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:26,464
Mainstream

728
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:28,512
Companies like Savannah now releasing

729
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:29,280
Ngannou

730
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:31,328
Remote control or Lutron

731
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:32,352
Bridge

732
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,424
Are not only helping the Legacy marketing

733
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,960
Panthera Market

734
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:39,008
Opportunity Market

735
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:42,592
But they also have a great deal of experience

736
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:44,640
And what works and what doesn't

737
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:45,920
So they're approached

738
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:46,688
2

739
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:47,968
Reliability

740
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:50,016
And user experience

741
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:50,784
AR

742
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,552
Improving

743
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:53,088
And these products

744
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:55,392
I believe will do very well

745
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:57,184
A transition to

746
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,512
I want to see cross the chasm but start to reach a broader audience

747
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,048
And help

748
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,328
Startups

749
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:05,888
Innovate on some of those Concepts and ideas

750
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:12,544
And what would your advice be professional installers

751
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,104
Sounds like 2 hours a week

752
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:16,896
Impossible for me

753
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:23,296
Should they look to installing kind of some of these more established

754
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:26,880
I have no idea I don't know what to tell people when they're like I just needed to

755
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:27,904
Works

756
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,464
Yeah I think so the market is obviously second

757
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:35,328
There's going to be a group of consumers you and I and other technology enthused

758
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:36,096
Stat

759
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:40,960
Love the idea of bleeding edge technology we are more patient and tolerant

760
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:44,032
Soggy things because we want to try them

761
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:48,384
And we are also more patient is as it relates to

762
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,968
Interoperability challenges or or limitations

763
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,272
There's another group of consumers

764
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:55,040
That

765
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:59,648
Have a certain amount of disposable income in might not be living in largest state home

766
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:00,672
But they are

767
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:01,696
Subject

768
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:04,256
To some of these new technologies right desserts

769
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:07,584
Consumers who purchase the nest thermostat or Sonos

770
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,608
Better now

771
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:11,424
Being exposed to a company like ours

772
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,192
Plum

773
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:13,984
And interested in these types of

774
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:15,776
New technologies

775
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:17,568
But there are still limitations

776
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:18,848
In this new

777
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,128
Era of

778
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:21,152
Connected home

779
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:23,456
Flash iot products in

780
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:24,992
As a release interoperability

781
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:28,576
Right there is not a killer app that controls everything buried

782
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:29,600
Very well

783
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:31,392
Interoperability

784
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:34,208
Is one of the the key challenges to

785
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:36,000
The connected home internet of Things

786
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:37,280
Moving forward

787
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:41,888
Rent-A-Center type of customer or those that are living in

788
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:45,216
Large estate homes they are typically being driven

789
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:46,496
To making

790
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:47,520
Purchases

791
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:49,824
Related to Connected home and consumer products

792
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:55,200
Through an influencer a building professional like the architect or designer or Builder

793
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:56,480
Those are the ones that

794
00:33:57,248 --> 00:34:01,344
95% of the time are being introduced to a systems integrator

795
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,416
Who handles everything from the design

796
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:08,256
The schematics the engineering the project management

797
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:11,072
And integrating to all of these other subsystems

798
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:12,608
A very large and

799
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:13,376
Sophisticated

800
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:16,448
I will be the first to admit that

801
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,544
If a homeowner is looking to integrate everything in their home

802
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:23,104
The most reliable

803
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:26,944
Way to get it done right to get a fully automated home today

804
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:28,480
I would still leave

805
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:29,248
Towards

806
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:33,600
A professional installer with a proven track record

807
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:34,624
That

808
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:39,232
Can deliver a full solution across-the-board otherwise there will be

809
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,280
Some limitations

810
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:44,352
14 points along the way in trying to

811
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:45,376
Piece together

812
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:46,400
A lot of disparity

813
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,192
No

814
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:49,472
The day is coming

815
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:50,752
Back pain point

816
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:51,520
Will disappear

817
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:53,568
Right week we know that the big players

818
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:55,872
Google Amazon Apple

819
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:57,152
Are all

820
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:57,920
Buying

821
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:58,688
So that position

822
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:00,992
Right and we will get to a point where

823
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:03,040
Devices will operate

824
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:05,088
Seamlessly in an ecosystem

825
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,648
And provisioning interoperability

826
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,440
Discussions will be a thing of

827
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,232
How far away

828
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:18,400
A question I don't think we're that far off honestly I think that within the next

829
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:19,680
5

830
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:23,520
The 10 years there will be much more ubiquity among

831
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:25,824
Connected devices and interoperability

832
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:27,360
I don't think it'll be

833
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:28,384
Completely liquid

834
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:31,456
Will certainly make a huge enrolled in the in the neck

835
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:40,672
So let's talk about you guys because

836
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:42,208
Speaking of an eternity

837
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:44,512
Actually

838
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:45,792
Released it

839
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,448
So you

840
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,496
That is completely different products

841
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:55,776
You definitely

842
00:35:57,568 --> 00:36:01,152
Tell us your story

843
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,688
Maybe hopefully

844
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:03,456
Store

845
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:09,856
Companies in also a lot of company. Out there without getting it the first time

846
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:10,880
Industry so

847
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:12,416
Let's talk about what you guys did

848
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:13,952
You're right you know

849
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:15,744
Minimum viable product

850
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,280
Works fine with soft

851
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:20,864
White with mobile apps you can get the product out of dust you can't

852
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:22,400
Launch

853
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:23,424
A consumer

854
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,960
Product is a minimum

855
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:28,288
But you can't retract your Hardware in and start over

856
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:29,312
Just doesn't work

857
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:30,336
Aplomb

858
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:31,616
From day one

859
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:35,200
We were driven every business decision every design decision

860
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:36,224
Was

861
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,784
Prioritized based on user experience

862
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:41,600
The time I spent in the industry

863
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:47,488
Designing systems and integrating things and and developing new user interfaces on touch screen

864
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:51,584
I obviously learned a great deal about how consumers want and

865
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,352
Expecting rain

866
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:54,400
And not only

867
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:57,216
You know that the guy riding the checkbook to his

868
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:57,984
His wife

869
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,288
Teenage kids to visiting mother-in-law

870
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:01,568
And everybody who interact

871
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:02,592
These Technologies

872
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:07,456
Unfortunately the Legacy Market I would say is a bit guilty of

873
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:08,480
Chord

874
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:09,760
User experience

875
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:12,576
An older touch panels are

876
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:14,880
They look like Star Trek in their cluttered

877
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:18,464
I'm a big believer in less is more in than keeping it very simple

878
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:19,744
And so

879
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,536
When we decided to

880
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:23,072
Go through this endeavor

881
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:26,400
Are we really looked at the feature sets that were important

882
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:27,936
Particula Lounge

883
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:30,752
User experience like provisioning right making

884
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:34,080
The setup as easy as sending or receiving a text message

885
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:38,176
The look and feel of a technology in the mobile app we didn't want it

886
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:39,968
Present technology we wanted to

887
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:42,016
Something that everybody in the household

888
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:46,624
And we put together our team and begin to engineer this thing and

889
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,440
When the first units came in we were quite

890
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:51,232
Thrilled they were working

891
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,768
We started shipping amount

892
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:53,536
The field

893
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:54,816
But we

894
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:55,584
Quickly

895
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,864
Realize that

896
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,168
You know there were things that were not ready

897
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:00,960
And we could have chosen

898
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:01,728
2

899
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,800
Send our beta unit through agency

900
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:06,080
I getting a CCN

901
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:07,360
Safety test

902
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:08,896
Start shipping products

903
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:11,456
But we made a business decision

904
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:12,736
To postpone it

905
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:13,760
Little Things

906
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:17,856
Like the glow ring we have an LED glow ring that wraps around

907
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:18,624
The button

908
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,904
But the court touchpad

909
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:21,440
And the glow wasn't

910
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:25,024
Particular

911
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,072
But we knew

912
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:28,096
Status

913
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:30,144
How you do anything is how you do everything

914
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:30,912
And

915
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:33,728
We may changes to both of our boards

916
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:37,824
I mean bored and our power board we may change it to every single mechanical piece

917
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:39,360
How to that redesign

918
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:44,480
So when you say when you're made a few minor changes that's very kind of you we did

919
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:48,064
Essentially scrap that beta unit and start it over

920
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,624
But we knew that that was the right decision to make

921
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:52,160
So what was the

922
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:56,512
And then what was the effect on the company itself

923
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:57,536
Because it's not like

924
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:58,560
That's an expense

925
00:38:58,816 --> 00:38:59,584
The proposition that you

926
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:01,376
Right

927
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,240
Did have a pretty significant impact on our timeline

928
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:07,008
And I believe

929
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,544
You covered us

930
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,896
When we won demo 7 Santa Clara and the fall of 2012

931
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:14,432
And had died

932
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:17,760
Touch base with us over the years as we went through development

933
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:23,136
And we are if not to one of the I think Z

934
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:24,416
Most delayed

935
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:25,696
Technology

936
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:28,256
Gadget Kickstarter project that's not something

937
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:29,024
Products

938
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:29,792
But

939
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:32,096
In hindsight we're very glad

940
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:35,424
That's the path we chose because the product that we've now delivered

941
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:40,288
As your business

942
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,872
So you you were stars

943
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:46,432
Because you

944
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:47,456
Starter

945
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:48,736
Without actually having

946
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:50,784
Physical product designer even on

947
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:53,088
Which I was like wow

948
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:55,392
Crazy no one would do that

949
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,696
So your Kickstarter ended when

950
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:00,000
April of 2013

951
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:00,768
Okay

952
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:02,560
Your first

953
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:09,472
It was signed in 2014. The summer of 2014

954
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:13,056
And then you pulled that back and now you shipped

955
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:14,592
People really seem to love

956
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:19,456
That's why we started shipping in December

957
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:20,992
So you know from

958
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:23,040
April 2013

959
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:26,368
To December of 2015

960
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:29,696
Was you know the challenges of a hardware startup

961
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:31,232
It's fascinating

962
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:33,792
Ear with the innovation

963
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:39,168
10 things like a development board Arduino and Raspberry Pi and beaglebone

964
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,960
3D printing technology

965
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:43,008
A startup is able to

966
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,312
Develop a proof-of-concept very quickly

967
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:49,664
Great Hardware startups and

968
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,944
Innovation in general

969
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,272
But there has been no major disruption in

970
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:56,576
Getting a product from a Prototype 2

971
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:57,856
Production it still takes

972
00:40:58,368 --> 00:41:00,160
Years of time and millions of dollars

973
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:02,976
Which is why many Hardware startups

974
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:06,048
Or simply fall short of meeting

975
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,352
The expectation of user experience

976
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:10,144
So we're fortunate enough

977
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,984
You would mention that we didn't have a product or a designer on staff and it's

978
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,776
That is hardly true we did have

979
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:19,616
Are we did have a prototype when we launched our Kickstarter we hired a

980
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:22,688
A major odm based out of Taiwan

981
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,480
How to spell Tino

982
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:25,248
Millions

983
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:28,576
Electronics

984
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:31,648
And we had to invest start on dollars

985
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:34,464
About 30 prototype

986
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,488
But they were

987
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:36,768
Ugly Betty

988
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:40,864
And we originally thought that we would

989
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,424
Can you to engage with an odm and

990
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:49,568
Is a contract manufacturer that can handle all of the design

991
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,104
Are you product as well

992
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,663
And we thought we would remain very lean

993
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:55,455
Start-up organization

994
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:57,247
Outsource the engineering

995
00:41:57,503 --> 00:41:58,527
Ana Manufacturing

996
00:41:58,783 --> 00:41:59,295
And

997
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:00,575
Really manage

998
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:02,111
The design process

999
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:05,695
But that didn't work out

1000
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:06,463
The way we planned

1001
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:10,559
We have two separate or sever ties with that odm and that's when

1002
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:12,607
We decided to begin raising

1003
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,143
Investment dollars

1004
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:16,191
Building our own engineering team

1005
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:18,239
And the rest is history we started

1006
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:19,775
Disability chronic in house

1007
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:25,919
And contracted with the in-home very reputable contract manufacturer to to build a production version

1008
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:28,479
Okay so you spent all this time develop

1009
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:29,503
Penis product in

1010
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:31,807
I'd love to hear

1011
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:33,599
What you guys decided on because

1012
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:37,951
You switched out the boards and this was all about providing more intelligence

1013
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:39,487
In the home

1014
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:41,535
And distribute around the home so it's

1015
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:42,815
What kind of talked about

1016
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:44,863
But you guys did there and

1017
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:46,911
A little bit

1018
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:51,263
We really started taking a look at the potential not only

1019
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:52,031
Score

1020
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:55,615
Penetrating the Home Depot Radcliffe reading Home Depot

1021
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:56,383
Are we really

1022
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:58,687
We really took a deep look at archived

1023
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:01,503
And we made the decision to

1024
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:03,295
Increase the processing power

1025
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:05,343
Essentially each one of these light pads

1026
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:07,903
Is a computer write its running at 400

1027
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:08,671
Megahertz

1028
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:09,951
Ar9

1029
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:14,303
I in the firmware we chose is only called her Lane

1030
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:16,095
Which is a distributed

1031
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:21,471
System even though the light pad looks and acts like a dimmer what we really created us to

1032
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:23,007
First distributed

1033
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:25,055
Computing cluster in the space

1034
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:27,359
Everyone iPad is

1035
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:30,943
Contextually and situationally aware of every other light pad

1036
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:32,479
Not to mention

1037
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:35,551
Any other it enable device in the home

1038
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:37,855
And they're sharing processing power

1039
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:39,647
Everything is propagated

1040
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:41,695
Down to every single device

1041
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:44,767
Which opens up a world of opportunities

1042
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:46,559
Wrong Turn 4

1043
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:48,607
The connected home and Internet of Things

1044
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:50,399
No question

1045
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:53,983
Serrapeptase and contacts for people early MS

1046
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:56,543
Distributed computing language that runs in

1047
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:58,591
Data centers its is kind of

1048
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:00,127
Very popular for

1049
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:01,919
For what we think of his cloud

1050
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:04,735
Picture so that bringing this into the home is just

1051
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:08,575
I was kind of stunned to discover that so can you talk about

1052
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:09,599
Why

1053
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:12,671
You want to make every basically all of these like

1054
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:15,487
A node in a distributed system

1055
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:19,839
Yeah there was something not too long ago

1056
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:20,607
About

1057
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:23,679
The internet of things and critically the connected home

1058
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:24,959
But it is not

1059
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:26,495
Platform but an

1060
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:28,543
And I couldn't agree with you more

1061
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:29,823
Most experts in the

1062
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:31,103
Field of iot

1063
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:33,151
Truly believe that

1064
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:37,503
Solution to iot asmongold fog computing

1065
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:40,319
Which is especially when I getting more computer power

1066
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:41,343
To the edge

1067
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:43,903
With the number of devices

1068
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:45,951
We believe we'll see in the home

1069
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:47,999
Moving to a distributor

1070
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:48,767
System

1071
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:49,791
I believe sets

1072
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:51,327
Stage 4 that Ubiquiti

1073
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:52,607
But we all hope for

1074
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:54,399
Meaning that there's

1075
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:57,471
There was more analytics happen

1076
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:58,495
Coming at the edge

1077
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:03,871
We sedated so to speak having to go up to servers because more can happen

1078
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:04,895
Locally

1079
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:05,919
Another benefit is

1080
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:07,967
Less dependency on the cloud

1081
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:11,295
If you lose your internet connection with Apple iPad

1082
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:12,319
It's still function

1083
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:14,367
Still control all of your lights

1084
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:15,903
Over your local

1085
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:16,927
Wi-Fi network

1086
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:17,951
We are

1087
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:20,511
Currently working on messaging are Bluetooth radio

1088
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:23,839
Before you know redundant radio mechanism as well beyond

1089
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:24,607
Wi-Fi

1090
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:26,655
A host of

1091
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:29,471
Advantages that moving to a distributed system

1092
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:32,543
Will provide including supporting

1093
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:33,823
Other Technologies

1094
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:36,127
Because any company can

1095
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:37,663
Run an application

1096
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:39,455
Across our secure

1097
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:42,015
Distributed Network in the home

1098
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:45,087
Okay so let's talk about that let's say I make

1099
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:50,975
Emotions

1100
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:54,047
Sensor to work in conjunction

1101
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:55,071
With your

1102
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:56,095
Light pad

1103
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:58,143
How would that work

1104
00:45:58,655 --> 00:45:59,423
In the future

1105
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:03,519
Your computer's what

1106
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:06,079
I mean we're talkin Bill Cloud to Cloud integration

1107
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:10,943
Walking through that ability is directly

1108
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:11,967
Device to device

1109
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:13,759
Rather than cloud-to-cloud or device

1110
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:14,783
Cloud etcetera

1111
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:16,831
A manufacturer of emotion

1112
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:19,903
Sensor or a moisture sensor

1113
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:21,439
Bluetooth

1114
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:24,255
Wouldn't necessarily have to create

1115
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:27,071
Club on Gateway

1116
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:28,351
They literally

1117
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:30,143
Write an application that can

1118
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:31,167
Run across our Network

1119
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:33,727
And that provides them

1120
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:35,263
The gateway to take

1121
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:38,079
Garage sale

1122
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:38,847
Locally

1123
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:39,871
I would provide them

1124
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:43,455
Autonomy or removing the dependency on

1125
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:44,479
Cloud

1126
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:45,503
I wish

1127
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:46,783
Ultimately increases

1128
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:50,111
The value to the user not user experience at

1129
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:51,647
How much more

1130
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:53,695
Security and privacy

1131
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:57,535
Host of advantages to working in Arkansas

1132
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:01,375
Distributed

1133
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:03,423
And isolation from the cloud

1134
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:04,447
Will when I say

1135
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:05,983
If it's a hybrid right

1136
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:09,311
Cloud and distributed systems I believe will will work

1137
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:10,079
Together

1138
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:11,359
To provide the most

1139
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:12,895
Most value and

1140
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:14,943
The highest degree of security and privacy

1141
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:16,735
Okay so instead of

1142
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:23,135
Worldview instead of doing an API

1143
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:24,159
This

1144
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:25,695
Instead is I'm building

1145
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:26,463
A full-on

1146
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:29,023
Does a lightweight up

1147
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:30,559
No API needed you just

1148
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:31,839
Loaded across our

1149
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:34,655
Secure system and you're off and running

1150
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:39,007
Really a viable proposition for a lot of these companies

1151
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:41,055
What we're going to need to see is

1152
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:43,359
Plum lightpads out there

1153
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:46,943
What's your strategy for Conquering the world

1154
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:47,967
Getting these

1155
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:49,503
If you can go to sleep.

1156
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:53,855
Bullet is about cobbossee critical mass but it doesn't just have to be

1157
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:54,623
I like that

1158
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:55,903
It's about the art

1159
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:59,231
And this can be applied to any technology

1160
00:47:59,487 --> 00:47:59,999
Any device

1161
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:01,535
It's really taking

1162
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:02,559
A

1163
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:03,839
New approach

1164
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:04,607
2

1165
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:06,143
The Internet of Things in the connected home

1166
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:07,935
Far too long

1167
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:10,239
The industry has been focused on

1168
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:11,775
Central controller

1169
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:13,055
Or hub

1170
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:15,103
And we simply believe that

1171
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:17,663
Bill Hobbs our solution for today's

1172
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:18,943
Problem

1173
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:19,711
And not

1174
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:21,247
Forward-thinking

1175
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:22,015
Enough

1176
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:25,599
Every device in the home will eventually have the type of

1177
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:26,879
Q Power

1178
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:28,415
Capabilities

1179
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:31,231
They will all simply be mashed

1180
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:33,023
Together we are simply

1181
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:34,047
First

1182
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:35,583
To prove that that's possible

1183
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:37,631
Wright real machine-to-machine communication

1184
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:40,959
It's what we set out to prove and that's exactly what we're doing

1185
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:43,519
And would you license is it

1186
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:45,567
NOS I'm trying to think about like

1187
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:46,847
Getting

1188
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:51,455
It's one thing to be like hey this is an architectural we like it's another to get paid

1189
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:52,479
People to adopt

1190
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:53,247
Your version

1191
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:54,783
Overall Market

1192
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:57,087
It's certainly a possibility

1193
00:48:57,343 --> 00:48:59,903
We just started shipping 6 months ago 7 months ago

1194
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:01,951
Our first priority is

1195
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:03,999
To demonstrate that

1196
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:07,327
That the feature-set and the user experience that we

1197
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:09,631
I believe consumers

1198
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:10,399
I would

1199
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:11,423
Appreciate

1200
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:13,471
He tried so hard

1201
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:15,519
The game critical mass over the course of the next

1202
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:17,567
12-24 months

1203
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:18,847
And allow us

1204
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:19,871
Learn

1205
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:20,895
I'm not

1206
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:24,479
Our device has a host of sensors in it and

1207
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:30,111
We can begin doing some behavioral modeling and have a better understanding of their

1208
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:32,415
Ihome's Network or

1209
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:33,439
How they interact

1210
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:34,207
Device

1211
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:35,487
And we can make business

1212
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:37,535
Decisions based off of what we learn

1213
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:39,327
Dorado AR device but

1214
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:40,351
Partnerships with

1215
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:42,911
Third party companies that we are integrated with

1216
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:45,471
Awesome

1217
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,519
I'm very eager to

1218
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:53,407
Try this out but also see how this distributed architecture works in the real world because you're right A lot of people seem to be

1219
00:49:53,919 --> 00:50:00,063
I'm trying to get to that direction which as a user I'm like yes please

1220
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:00,831
To like

1221
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:02,879
I guess have my lights rely on The Intern

1222
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:06,975
Alright thank you so much for coming on the show today
