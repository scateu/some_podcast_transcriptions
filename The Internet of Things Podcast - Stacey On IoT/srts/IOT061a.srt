00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:12,800
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast either host Stacey Higginbotham

2
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:14,336
If this is your co-host

3
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:15,360
Kevin tofel

4
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:20,992
And today we have a great show for you today we're going to talk about Google home Atari and iot

5
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:23,808
Possibly some new Wi-Fi low-power effort

6
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:26,112
A bit about

7
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:27,392
Smart home hubs

8
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:28,160
Plus

9
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:32,000
I have a great guest for you it's Chris Herbert who is the CEO of tracker

10
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:34,816
Who's going to talk about a brand new indoor positioning system

11
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:35,584
Which

12
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,352
I love

13
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:38,144
We love presents

14
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,568
Alright so let's get started with the Google home the information

15
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:48,896
Which man are they just like rocking it hard or what

16
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,528
They typically do they they have really good sources and they get some good scoops

17
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:55,552
They do so

18
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:57,344
They are reporting that

19
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:59,392
The chip inside

20
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:02,976
Google home and Google home is the Amazon Echo

21
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:04,000
Like product

22
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:06,048
That is not actually at the market

23
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:08,096
People are calling it

24
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:09,376
Air freshener

25
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:12,192
That you can look like an air freshener

26
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:15,520
So this has the same chip inside

27
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:16,800
As the

28
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:18,848
Kevin

29
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:23,968
Chromecast is what the information says they have a dispute with a person with direct knowledge of the plan

30
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,296
Notes I work for Google I have no direct knowledge of the plan

31
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:31,136
But this is what they were told that the guts of Home in the same as the Chromecast

32
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:34,208
I can't say that I'm surprised because

33
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:39,328
When the Google home personal assistant product was announced at the Google IO Keynote

34
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,424
They said it was built on Chromecast technology so that kind of

35
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:48,288
Let me to believe it be similar and I don't know that it's a bad thing cuz the Google Chromecast

36
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,056
Is

37
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:54,944
Relatively popular relatively inexpensive I think it's about 30-35 bucks you can usually find it on sale

38
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,480
Great to stream mirror

39
00:01:56,736 --> 00:02:02,880
Cast audio to video around the house and so on so I guess our people staycity thing people are getting talking about this

40
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:06,208
Because they're thinking the cost of Google home will be low like a Chromecast

41
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:10,304
I think people are just excited about Google home in any Speck of information

42
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,328
Gets them something

43
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:12,096
But

44
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,376
I will say

45
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:15,168
Having a wide

46
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,704
Birth of products

47
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,776
Use the same silicon means you can buy in Greater bulk

48
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,056
And every time you're buying

49
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:21,824
Chips

50
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,592
Focus better

51
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:24,384
Total or your ear

52
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,408
Your cost per unit

53
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:27,968
So can I looked at the

54
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:30,272
Purported ship inside

55
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,808
Amazon Echo

56
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,344
Which of these are based

57
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,648
Teardowns in the end of 2015

58
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,440
From ifixit.com

59
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,208
Yes

60
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,000
Lovely people

61
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,536
And so

62
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:46,144
So just give me a little chippy but bear with us we're getting chippy we are

63
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:49,472
The Amazon Echo for its brains

64
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:50,496
Uses

65
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:54,080
I was actually kind of surprised it's a lower power TI omap

66
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,360
DaVinci price

67
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,384
It's a DaVinci process

68
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,920
Correct correct

69
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:02,784
I think this particular chip debuted in 2010 its head berries variation since then

70
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,904
But this is not like a super high-end chip like you have in a high-end smartphone for example its

71
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,720
It does the job obviously cuz it's a good product

72
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:13,536
But this is not an expensive chip it's not a

73
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:14,816
Super powerful chip

74
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:19,424
I think we looked we dug around for cost and I think we found under thirty bucks for the chip

75
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,448
Write in

76
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:23,520
I can guarantee you that Amazon snot

77
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:27,616
Although you don't it doesn't have to drive a screen

78
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,664
Which means it can be

79
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:30,944
Lower performance

80
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,224
But with the

81
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,552
Google chip in there using the Marvell Armada

82
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:36,832
It looks like that

83
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:37,856
Mini Plus

84
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:38,880
SOC

85
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:41,696
And that actually it does have to dry the screen

86
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:42,464
Inure

87
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:43,744
Television

88
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:47,840
It cast output video content at 1080p s

89
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:50,400
So that's that's a little bit more

90
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:52,704
But that ship only costs what does that cause

91
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:57,056
That one I haven't seen a cost to be honest

92
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,848
So yeah I'm not sure how much.

93
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:00,128
Prospect

94
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:00,896
More than

95
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,688
The Amazon Echo

96
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,480
You know just for me

97
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,272
Performance perspective

98
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,600
Looking at this it looks like maybe

99
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:13,696
The Marvell Armada can deliver a little bit more gigahertz

100
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:14,464
Performance

101
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,815
It's also we're sourcing this from a non-tech

102
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,095
Because those guys

103
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:21,375
They're freaking out

104
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:23,167
They know their stuff absolutely

105
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,447
Yeah

106
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,983
The fountain actually went to work for Apple

107
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,567
I guess at the end of the day

108
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:30,335
You can't

109
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:36,735
Figure out what the cost of an item to be based solely on the bill of materials but it does give you a good indication of what

110
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:39,551
You know what it may cost them in the company could choose to

111
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,855
Pretty something at a loss and so on and so forth but

112
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,391
So I guess if

113
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:47,231
Again people probably trying to figure out how much Google home is going to cost we don't know

114
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,255
But you know I

115
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:50,559
Could it be as much as an Amazon Echo it could be

116
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:51,583
But

117
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:54,143
I don't think I'd be higher by any means

118
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:57,983
But it also gives you a sense of what these devices are designed to do

119
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:01,823
In a relatively low power processors

120
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,871
In there as the Braves

121
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,407
Shows how much of the

122
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,943
Computing brain power is actually

123
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,479
Cloud

124
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:13,087
Not a surprise but sometimes if you see like a crazy high power chip in there you'd be like

125
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:16,159
They're going to run some stuff inside

126
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:19,231
The reason this matters is things like smart home hubs

127
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:23,327
You want them to be able to actually do something still even when they're not connected

128
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,095
The internet

129
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:30,495
Very much so very much so and with these personal assistant products the natural language processing is actually done in the cloud

130
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:33,311
Finger point about where the processing is done

131
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:36,127
They don't need to know the latest and greatest

132
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,663
Mobile chip in these things

133
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,967
Bright and we don't see a lot of memory

134
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:46,111
I think there's four gig in the in the Echo Basin letter down for example

135
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:48,927
A conversion chips but nothing like

136
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:49,695
Super excited

137
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:52,511
Just keep that in mind guys

138
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:55,327
Little context for your day on the

139
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,375
The information's little story

140
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,167
I don't say little in a mean way

141
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,703
Just the story that wrote about this

142
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,751
Well they call that Google home Little secret

143
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,799
So that's where the little comes around

144
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:08,895
That's really little secret but I did click on my headliner

145
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:12,991
What is the great headline but I was kind of shook my head in life

146
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:20,415
All right so other chip news

147
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,439
Qualcomm

148
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:26,815
I was going to say comdex I'm just I'm not on my game today guys at computex

149
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:27,839
In Taipei

150
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:31,423
In Taipei introduced the Snapdragon wear 1100

151
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,447
SOC

152
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:34,495
Less smart wearables I like that

153
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:43,711
Well that was my head like that was actually my show noticed I called it less smart because they actually introduced the snap

154
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:46,527
Dragonwear 2100 back at Mobile World Congress

155
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:49,855
And that was going to you know get better battery life and

156
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:52,159
You bring more Smart Start device isn't someone

157
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,439
The 1100

158
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,719
As you can gather from the

159
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:56,255
Numerical naming

160
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,279
Is

161
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,559
Lower spec

162
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,607
Chip and it's basically for

163
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:03,679
Things like kid tracking and other

164
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:07,519
Type of wearables that don't require a ton of processing power so

165
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:09,823
We can still do everything and

166
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:12,639
It's just not going to be as a performer that would guess

167
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:16,991
Yeah it's got LTE built-in + 3G Bluetooth Wi-Fi

168
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,015
And

169
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:21,599
Haswell in application processor for linux-based applique

170
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:22,367
Patience so

171
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,391
That's

172
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,951
That's actually pretty good

173
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:29,535
I think it's really worth noting that as The Internet of Things

174
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:36,447
Expanse chip companies are really having to work their butts off to create these different skews

175
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:38,495
Which were seeing their good at that

176
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,775
But they're also

177
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:43,359
As they do this they're having to change their distribution model

178
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,383
To deal with

179
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,943
So many more potential customers

180
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,015
Beforehand a company like Qualcomm had baby

181
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,551
Maybe a couple dozen

182
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:55,391
Less than a hundred customers cuz they were just selling chips for phones right

183
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:56,927
So

184
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,207
This is a big

185
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:00,767
Not this individual thing but this is part of a whole

186
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,815
Pixie change for all these cuz

187
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,607
These chip makers who are like

188
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:11,007
Oh man now I got to support so many more customers they're turning to like distribution Distributors like arrow and others

189
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:16,127
And they're also like oh my God now I don't have something I can sell like a billion chips

190
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:19,967
Right it's a far broader distribution of

191
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:21,247
Taipan

192
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,527
Customers you said

193
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:26,623
And even their companies coming out of woodwork now just building phone building

194
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:31,487
Wearable devices virtual reality things I mean in Qualcomm

195
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:37,887
Did they have to know they got to focus on all these different form-factors where they didn't have to as much before they got to worry about chip size and

196
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,423
Brightmoor. Battery life

197
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,727
Not that they didn't before

198
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:42,495
But

199
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:48,639
The variance in all these is it's just you know it's good for them it's good business for them but it also is a challenge for them

200
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:49,663
Exactly

201
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,711
Other

202
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:52,735
What else what else

203
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:53,503
Should we talk about

204
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,039
We should talk about Jabo

205
00:08:55,807 --> 00:09:00,927
We should talk cuz everybody's talking about dry bone and everybody's saying lots of different things about you

206
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:03,743
So fun Friday Fortune reported

207
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:06,047
Jawbone with exiting the speaker business

208
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,071
Jawbone

209
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,863
You know you guys may not be aware of it

210
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:10,399
Probably are makes the

211
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:14,751
Chipmunks oh my God what is it called the marmara

212
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:18,591
Okay

213
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:22,687
Makes that so they were talking about exiting that

214
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:28,575
This week Tech Insider reported that jaw bone had halted there

215
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,855
Band Productions

216
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,159
And sold off their name trackers to a third party

217
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:32,927
Reseller

218
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:33,695
But

219
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:35,487
Payback in

220
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,511
Good night

221
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:37,791
So

222
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:40,351
What we do know is back in November they laid off

223
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,375
Chunk of their staff

224
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,143
There

225
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,983
Neck-and-neck with Fitbit or probably less neck-and-neck now which

226
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,263
Indicate something

227
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:52,127
And business is just getting super super complicated

228
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,407
In there

229
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,175
Statement

230
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:58,015
I'm saying that hey don't know we're still producing up Fitness bands

231
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:00,831
They did indicate that they were willing to go to

232
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,367
Clinical

233
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,647
Quality bands

234
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:06,463
I thought that was kind of

235
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:07,999
That's very telling

236
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:08,767
Fairy Tail

237
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,607
Yeah I could fit it really has been owning this wearable

238
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,887
Mail tracking Market

239
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:14,911
Of weight

240
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,959
Based on reports of

241
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:20,031
Market share sales etc mean we really don't know we don't have to

242
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,055
All the exact

243
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:21,823
Details but

244
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,615
That's what the reports have been

245
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,407
And we all know that

246
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:30,015
Okay the next step for wearables is not just consumer-grade but actual clinical grade

247
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:33,599
That requires you to get FDA approval that's a whole convoluted process

248
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:36,671
But that's what's next and I think

249
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:42,303
Again these are all these rumors but I suspect they are true in that job was trying to get ahead of the Curve

250
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,583
Build upon what it

251
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,399
Learn through the consumer wearable Market

252
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:50,495
And jump into the clinical Market as soon as possible it's kind of beat everybody to the punch

253
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:52,031
Except I can't be

254
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:52,799
Certain

255
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:57,407
That's a very good point there they're not the first to jump into that market

256
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:59,199
And this is probably why

257
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:02,015
Also recent news Nokia but why things

258
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,087
And I have to make a quick correction

259
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,879
Did not say that

260
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:07,647
It was doing the clinic

261
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,695
What's the verge

262
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:15,839
Reporting that jaw bone with still make wearable devices and it's creating quote a clinical grade health-tracking related

263
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:16,863
The heart monitor

264
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,423
So

265
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,447
Jawbone

266
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,983
Basically the only thing

267
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,263
You said officially here

268
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,287
Is that

269
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,335
The brand is not going to

270
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:28,895
So 30

271
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:32,479
So there's a lot of if he's as someone who wears a jaw bone

272
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,503
Tracker

273
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:37,087
I would be really sad to see

274
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:42,975
The software go away although I did notice that very recently my permissions changed drastically

275
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:46,559
And I was curious what that meant I thought maybe it meant that they were

276
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:47,583
Either going to add

277
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,399
About your new features or that they sold it or something

278
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:53,983
Can can you export your data out of the jaw bone

279
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:54,751
System

280
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:01,663
Yes vote has been very open job has been kind of fun because in the reason why I went with it is because it works with so many

281
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,687
Other connected

282
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,223
Home systems

283
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:05,503
So

284
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,551
An infant Deadspin

285
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:14,463
I hope that we could still have jaw bones although I'm a little concerned about

286
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:16,255
Buying another job phone so

287
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,815
Baby don't do that

288
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:22,399
Yeah I don't know that I would do that right now

289
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,679
I guess it's the best thing ever

290
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:24,959
Let's see what they do

291
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:25,727
Hold on

292
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:27,775
Alright other cool news

293
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:28,543
Is

294
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:33,151
I don't know this cool it's a cool cuz it's about it is cool it's cool for multiple days

295
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:38,527
So basically Atari has teamed up with sick Fox which is the low power

296
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:44,159
Wider in neck networking standard they use in France they're building at work at San Francisco

297
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:46,719
How to make iot devices for the Smart Home

298
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,279
And this kind of came out of left field

299
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:52,095
Yeah it came out of nowhere I'll other

300
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:54,399
I'm a little confused cuz there's a

301
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,703
House for lease on the Atari website that

302
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,799
Dated May 5th but this really didn't come out until May 29th

303
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:01,567
So

304
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:05,151
Yeah and the date in the Press phases May 31st

305
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,687
Yasso

306
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,967
I kind of was like

307
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:11,807
Think there might be a little bit of an issue there with the date so we're going to call this

308
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:16,415
I feel like we would have noticed it before now if it were

309
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,183
So

310
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,975
There's not a lot of information

311
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:19,743
In this world

312
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,327
It's it's basically like Hey we're going to make some

313
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,095
Connected

314
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,655
I will say sigfox

315
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,679
The standard

316
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:29,471
Super low data rate

317
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,519
We're talking like

318
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:38,943
This is this is this is the IRT Network that they say I

319
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,991
I think it has over 7 million devices on it

320
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,551
Yes but those devices are things like

321
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,319
Tyco smoke detector

322
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,111
Well that's okay

323
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:49,695
Yes it is I'm just I'm just trying it like so these are

324
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:51,231
Wicked awesome

325
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,511
Massive

326
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,327
Data consuming kind of things

327
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,351
Price likely

328
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:57,887
I'm thinking

329
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:58,911
Sensors

330
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:00,959
You know

331
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:03,775
Again we don't know maybe M2M types.

332
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,359
In the sigfox network requires

333
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,407
A separate infrastructure so

334
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:16,063
The other thing to think about what this is if they are working solely with cefoxitin and that may not be the case

335
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,343
They can always put Wi-Fi into the

336
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,927
If it was sick Fox

337
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:26,047
The devices will only work in a limited number of places where sick fox has it Network

338
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:28,351
18 countries right now I believe

339
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,143
I don't know

340
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,727
So not terrible just

341
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:34,751
Worth

342
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:38,335
They did a luta what they're going to bring with what Ataris going to be

343
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:42,431
Building and bring them to 6 Fox network and I'm just going to read this right out of the press release

344
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:46,271
The initial product line will include categories such as home pets

345
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:48,063
Lifestyle and safety

346
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:50,111
I know that's very nebulous but

347
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,415
It speaks to I think presents

348
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,951
Your pet tracking

349
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:56,255
Safety again maybe

350
00:14:56,767 --> 00:15:00,351
Yeah could be a pack my smoke detector I don't know

351
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,375
So

352
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:03,167
You will have to see what they're going to do but

353
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:05,215
Still kind of thought it was because it was Atari

354
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:06,239
Yes

355
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:12,895
Which of course ran to the website and yes yes yes they did

356
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:13,663
Sold

357
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:16,223
Few times since the video game crash

358
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,759
In the early 80s but yeah

359
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,039
Still around

360
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,343
That's that's

361
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,367
It will it will see what

362
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,391
What comes of that

363
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:27,999
Other bit of news also, super geeky but keep your eye on this because

364
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:30,815
I don't know I am excited by Wi-Fi

365
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:33,119
The IEEE is looking at

366
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:36,447
Proposing a wake-up receiver

367
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,775
Standard for 802. 11 which is the

368
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,055
The Wi-Fi stand

369
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,847
So what this is basically

370
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:45,151
Only low-power you let your

371
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:47,711
Wi-Fi stuff would actually go to sleep

372
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,271
When it needs to wake up

373
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,807
Data packet to the

374
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,343
The flow that says go

375
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,111
Wake up

376
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,391
And that it would wake up

377
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:57,439
And everything could be active

378
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:01,023
Send transmit whatever data needed and then come back

379
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:03,327
That's not how Wi-Fi works

380
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,399
I think that's actually how

381
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,167
Bluetooth

382
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:09,471
They have a

383
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:10,239
Wake up

384
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,031
But

385
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,311
Either way

386
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:16,895
This is something apparently that's been in the works for a long time

387
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:21,503
Sidelines by the Wi-Fi Halo effort

388
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,319
And those are basically in the

389
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,343
Those are in the

390
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:27,135
In a different Spectrum band

391
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:33,535
It's 900 megahertz and those efforts are all about giving you better coverage and places where the

392
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:36,863
Current 2.4 and 5 gigahertz radios just can't

393
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:37,887
Riesling

394
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:38,911
Checking stuff

395
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:39,679
In your basement

396
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,727
If they do say they are low power but

397
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:42,495
They don't have this

398
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:44,543
Yeah I know

399
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:50,943
The obvious benefit here is this would save power and actually I I have a device that I wish I'd had this now

400
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:51,711
One of my

401
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:52,479
Smart watches

402
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:56,063
Has Wi-Fi so that way when I'm out of Bluetooth range from my phone

403
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:59,647
I can still get notifications and open apps and do things

404
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:03,487
It just connects over Wi-Fi to do that so it's a very limited

405
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:09,119
Time them using Wi-Fi and if that Wi-Fi radio is on all the time and actively saying give me today to give me data

406
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,423
You know it's wasting juice so

407
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:14,495
Another place this would be great as a lot of the water

408
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:17,311
There's not a lot of leak sensors with Wi-Fi

409
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:22,943
Another's the battery life

410
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,247
But something like this where it wakes up

411
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,015
You know

412
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:28,319
Once a day

413
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:29,087
Am I wet

414
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:30,111
Okay

415
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,391
This would only work for

416
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:35,743
Like rushing it in your house you

417
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,023
I don't know how

418
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,887
Speaking of water leak

419
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,935
I should mention this because

420
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:47,519
It happened after we recorded the podcast but it's actually big news

421
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,287
Belkin

422
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,567
Has

423
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:54,431
Teamed up with open or which is a plumbing supply company to create a brand new company called

424
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,199
Spin

425
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:57,503
What is doing Leak Detection sensors

426
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:00,831
Spinlaunch last week with 40 million dollars in it

427
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,903
Phy in

428
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:10,559
I just thought I wrote about it the newsletter but I thought it was worth talking about of the podcast because the idea here is

429
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:15,679
Is not that you'd have sensors around your home but you'd install something like underneath your sink faucet

430
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:22,079
Or if you're a builder you can actually install it on the water main when you're building the house the line into the house and you could install

431
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,615
Automatic shut-off valve

432
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:24,639
And

433
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,175
Sensors with

434
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:33,087
Detect leaks based on the amount of water flowing through your house basically the same sort of thing they do

435
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:34,623
Do it on the electricity side with

436
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:35,903
Proteinuria

437
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:36,927
Curb

438
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:39,487
Monitoring of flow

439
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:44,351
This is kind of really promising because I've never had a leak in a place where it had a leak sensor

440
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,655
I was like yes please

441
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:50,239
Yeah I know it makes sense that it monitoring

442
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:52,543
The actual water as opposed to just

443
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,567
A specific

444
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:58,687
Spot where you might be looking for a week even though the league might be three feet away and the sensor doesn't see the lead so

445
00:18:58,943 --> 00:18:59,455
Make sense

446
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:00,991
Now this isn't out yet

447
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,527
Just creative company

448
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:04,319
It has 40 million in funding

449
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:06,879
I'm Keen to see what happen

450
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:08,927
Prince here I hope to try this out

451
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:09,695
Because again

452
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:11,743
Weeks super expensive

453
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:17,887
I love the fact that they're going after not just kind of consumers but also like insurance companies and

454
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:19,935
Know what are they called builders

455
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:23,007
Steelers

456
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,031
So

457
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:25,311
That's just

458
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:27,103
Kind of cool information

459
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:30,943
As long as I can turn it off when I fill my pool in the Memorial Day weekend

460
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:31,711
Wow

461
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:34,271
You don't have to turn it off it just would check that

462
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,039
Timothy Lake weather

463
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:37,087
And you be like no that is not a leak

464
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,623
That is not a week false alarm

465
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,671
Is it a little baby pool

466
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:50,399
It's only if it's 2500 gallons is not

467
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,423
Not like

468
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:52,703
30000 gallon

469
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:53,727
Trulia

470
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:59,871
Never get there.

471
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:00,895
Anyone

472
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:02,943
Though I can't imagine

473
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,087
Prof. Xs

474
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:12,159
I'm sorry

475
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,183
Okay

476
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:15,487
So final story for us this way

477
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,535
Which is The Wirecutter

478
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:19,583
This is actually we should have put it in last week

479
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,375
Ranking

480
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,679
Smart home hubs

481
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:27,263
And it shows as their number one pick

482
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:30,079
I'm cringing cuz I know people going to cringe when they hear it

483
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:33,151
Samsung SmartThings platform

484
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:34,943
Which

485
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,223
No

486
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:43,135
But you you're saying no I'm saying I don't know cuz I have not used it I've only use my wink and in terms of that and the wink was

487
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,671
Is there also great pic

488
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:46,975
I'm not as good but also great

489
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:52,607
But we've heard and we reported on some of the Samsung Smart Home issues in the past between security issues and

490
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:56,191
Developer mentality and mindset and so on and so forth

491
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,727
Love the mind

492
00:20:58,495 --> 00:20:59,263
Right now they're having

493
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:01,311
Problems even before they had their problems

494
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,591
They were having reliability

495
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:05,407
I would say if you want to follow this

496
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:06,431
And get one

497
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,223
You know I love playing with

498
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:09,503
I would never give this

499
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:12,319
To somebody who's not willing to put in the hours

500
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,087
Gotcha

501
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:17,952
It's gotten better like maybe 85% of the time it does what it's supposed to do when it's supposed to do it

502
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:22,816
But like they have this monitoring service with Scout that you actually pay for

503
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:24,608
Don't do that

504
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:26,912
No because you need more reliability

505
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:27,680
They're just not

506
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:36,128
They actually do cover a bunch of other devices that they tested and get pros and cons so it's probably well worth reading the article I think

507
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,664
Yes because they talked about the

508
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,712
The caseta smart home plug

509
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,504
And how you can try that with

510
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,528
Homekit

511
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:43,808
Then move it you know in.

512
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:44,832
Beyond lighting

513
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:46,624
What's a Barbie on lighting

514
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:48,928
There's insteon which is our favorite

515
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,976
Lowe's Iris Smart Home

516
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,512
Cuddelink staple

517
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:53,536
Disconnect hub

518
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:55,840
That was that was originally the runner-up pick

519
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,120
But

520
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:58,400
Since it's going to be

521
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:00,448
Possibly discontinuing that

522
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,984
Didn't choose it as a renter up

523
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:04,800
Which fits with what I thought I loved

524
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:09,152
I thought it was actually one of my favorites that's the one I would give to people

525
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:10,688
Who didn't

526
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,712
You know

527
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:12,736
I didn't want it

528
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,272
SmartThings

529
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,064
So yeah

530
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,088
That's that

531
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:23,488
Check it out with reading especially if you're like you do I want to do this date that should do a good job covering some of the pros and

532
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:24,256
Cons of

533
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,584
The home hub ecosystem as I'm home

534
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,120
Xanax an article

535
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:30,912
So that is that

536
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:32,448
And I think

537
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,008
If you guys stay tuned for our guest

538
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:36,544
It is Chris Herbert

539
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,336
Who is the CEO of tracker

540
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:42,688
Which is one of those mini mini bluetooth based tracking devices

541
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,224
We talked about

542
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:45,248
Trackers

543
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:48,832
We talked about presents and we even have a good conversation about

544
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:52,672
Chris talked about chips actually this whole show so chippy

545
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:53,696
So stay tuned

546
00:22:53,952 --> 00:23:00,096
For that but first break in with an ad hi this is Stacy and I'm here

547
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:06,496

And thank you for coming I am super excited because

561
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:50,784
I don't do a lot of things

562
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,320
My family loses a lot of things

563
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:56,672
And right now I have a product from one of your competitors actually

564
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:58,208
My water bottle

565
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,768
Because I had replaced the $12 water bottle

566
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:01,536
Like

567
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:03,584
Three times and I was like

568
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,144
I've reached the point where it

569
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,936
It cost more to like replace it

570
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,264
So let's talk about

571
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,032
Kind of

572
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,312
How you got

573
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:19,968
You guys have been doing this since 2009 and that's really long time

574
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:22,784
Christian after we die

575
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,856
Actually lost a cube on a surfing

576
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:26,624
Trap

577
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,440
And actually parked my car on the beach

578
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:30,720
Indiana

579
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:38,400
Reason to start

580
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:40,448
The ocean was by

581
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:41,728
Wall up my car

582
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,264
3 hours

583
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:52,736
Maya keys

584
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:57,600
Call me

585
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:59,136
New things

586
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:00,928
At least I don't think I'm

587
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:07,840
You have to manually memorize where

588
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:09,632
What if we could get the task

589
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:11,680
Where I can fire

590
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:13,984
So we don't have to

591
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:16,288
Right so that your

592
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,848
Derek knows where everything is in your house

593
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:19,616
Office

594
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:21,152
Your life is completely mad

595
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,992
Now that's nasty

596
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:29,344
Graduated

597
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:36,768
Which of the dongle that lasted about 1-day battery life

598
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:39,072
$70

599
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,424
And then in 2012

600
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,752
Release

601
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:51,104
And a tracking device

602
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,384
Not really

603
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:55,456
It help desk is mainstream Dan

604
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,992
Continue.

605
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:00,832
Bravo

606
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,464
And it also our new product

607
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:10,816
We are going to talk about that but

608
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:13,376
I'd like to think about cuz this is

609
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:15,168
This to me is a crazy stat

610
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:17,216
One that you started the so early

611
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:19,776
Into that your first iteration cost

612
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:24,128
60 to $70 and you had to charge it every night and people still wanted to buy it

613
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:26,176
That's nuts

614
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:30,016
Dykes in the in the process

615
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:33,600
From moving from that to where you are now

616
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:37,184
I'm assuming things like hey there's now Bluetooth low energy

617
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:38,976
There's also

618
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,512
Superchips

619
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:42,816
Let's think about how the world is changed

620
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:44,096
Made it easier for

621
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:46,400
Yeah I mean a lot

622
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:50,240
And continuous change dramatically

623
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:51,008
Is that

624
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,568
Bee Company

625
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:59,968
Watching a launch with a cheerful energy

626
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:02,272
I thought that was

627
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:04,832
And

628
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:10,464
And it was only able to talk

629
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,768
On BlackBerry and

630
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:16,096
So now

631
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:17,888
Eating with the adoption of

632
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:22,496
IOS enable

633
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:28,384
Really

634
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:30,176
And I think that's

635
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:35,296
People with it.

636
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:39,648
And iPhone 4S.

637
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:41,184
And

638
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,464
You are able to get

639
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,376
Smaller and cheaper because all the Silicon manufacturer

640
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:51,424
Everyone keeps on Staring.

641
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:58,080
And billion devices are 50 billion devices

642
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:02,432
Now going to be I believe 18 billion devices by 2020

643
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:07,552
18 billion / 25

644
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:11,392
Especially

645
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,416
Nordic really

646
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:14,720
Stop reaching out to

647
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:16,512
Startups in a plane

648
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:17,792
Get to Market quickly

649
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:20,608
Really bruh

650
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:22,912
Sheknives I think the entire

651
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:27,008
Industry for all these different years

652
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:29,056
Smart tracking devices

653
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:32,128
Panda

654
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,736
Adoption of

655
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,088
Mm

656
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:43,136
Xidan Fitbit started

657
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:44,160
Stopping 7

658
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:50,304
I'm trying to think I think the first one was another Market until like 20

659
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:54,912
I want to check that

660
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:59,264
Fact check

661
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:04,384
Turn around

662
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,176
Wednesday

663
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:11,552
There will be 28.

664
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,856
That's their latest and greatest forecast

665
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,392
And I think the

666
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:22,048
Tire industry

667
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:26,400
Dalian

668
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:27,424
And

669
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,960
What do you think about

670
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,312
We probably have a

671
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:34,080
Read

672
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,384
10 billion

673
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:41,760
That is super exciting I can't wait

674
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:42,784
And you guys

675
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:45,600
Can I taking it to the next level in

676
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:48,672
Cuz you got this project

677
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:51,744
Actually you got two things that all up tees for people

678
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:55,072
Listen to the whole thing because we're going to talk about

679
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:57,120
Everyone knows I love it

680
00:29:57,632 --> 00:30:00,448
Which is the Amazon Echo

681
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,472
And how

682
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:03,008
You guys are thinking about that

683
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:03,776
So

684
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:04,800
Let's take

685
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:06,848
Location in the home

686
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,640
You guys call it project Atlas

687
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:10,432
This is huge I

688
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:13,504
I'm constantly walking into rooms

689
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:16,832
Why doesn't my house know where I am if I'm not carrying my

690
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:20,160
So what are you guys kind of doing with project

691
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:23,744
Subway

692
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:28,864
Keeping organized

693
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:29,888
Keep track their items

694
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:34,240
So we looked at home location in Indore

695
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:41,408
One of the features of our product is that it shows you on a map of where

696
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,968
Okay

697
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:44,736
And

698
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,528
Your kids are

699
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:52,416
You didn't need it out sell you that you knew your keys were somewhere in the house

700
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:54,208
In the house right

701
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:57,536
Users

702
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:59,328
And after

703
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,096
And I'm

704
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,376
Definitely

705
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:04,192
Target user car products

706
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:05,472
Bang bang bang

707
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:08,288
Honey you know you seen my backpack

708
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:10,336
Luggage

709
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:15,712
It hurts me that the response is always right

710
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:18,784
Kitchen in the bedroom

711
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,088
Oh have you looked in the garage

712
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:21,856
The living room

713
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:23,648
And it's not

714
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:28,768
You know a lot of other people try to

715
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,144
Look at it think how can we just get

716
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:36,448
Locations for the home

717
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:39,264
And the smoke

718
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,800
In the Alex

719
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:42,848
Look like

720
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,152
Each makes a room in your house

721
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,432
And then

722
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:47,968
Is Wi-Fi

723
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:48,992
So it's

724
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:50,016
Anteroom

725
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:51,040
Items

726
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:53,088
And then it sends up their server

727
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:55,904
With the item and

728
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:59,232
The room until then on your app

729
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:02,304
You can actually see it

730
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:03,584
Items aren't

731
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,680
Inventory tracking

732
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,336
Idea

733
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:16,384
There's water app tracking

734
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:23,808
Already

735
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:27,392
I think that

736
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:28,928
We've really been able to

737
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:32,768
Consumers

738
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:33,792
So that

739
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:36,608
You don't need to remember where all your I'm sorry

740
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,240
Champion

741
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:44,032
To say how excited I am about this

742
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:45,056
Because

743
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:46,336
I don't have an attic

744
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:50,176
The way we've designed our house so I have a lot of storage closets

745
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:52,224
And I have the garage

746
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:57,600
My like holiday decorations are like summer the bedroom Summer of the guest room summary

747
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:58,624
Garage

748
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,928
And I would love to be able to say hey what's

749
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:01,696
Stick

750
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:03,744
You know lipstick plugs everywhere

751
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:05,024
Let's drop

752
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:05,792
Tag

753
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:07,072
Eye tracker in

754
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:13,216
This one's Christmas decorations are Christmas lights

755
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,520
So I can dance

756
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:16,288
Q juice

757
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:17,824
Speck case Beyond just

758
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:18,848
Hey

759
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:20,128
Let's put these are my keys

760
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,176
Absolutely anything

761
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:23,200
Because

762
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,016
You

763
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:29,856
Computers

764
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:31,392
And I believe that

765
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:32,416
All your items

766
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:33,184
Will be tracked

767
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:36,256
Brown Deer Christmas decorations

768
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:38,048
Tear your jacket

769
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:39,328
Backpacks

770
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,096
I mean

771
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,376
Everything will be

772
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:42,144
Chalkable

773
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:46,496
And so I think it's a really important Evolution for

774
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:48,032
Smart tracking

775
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:48,800
Space

776
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:50,848
To just go from

777
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:53,152
Hey let's find something after

778
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,528
2 + and you

779
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:01,344
You want to just keep track of your stuff for your family

780
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:06,464
A lot of families have one person in the family whose like knows where it is

781
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:11,840
My family is my wife she knows where everything is located

782
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:16,704
And so I was thinking.

783
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,472
Attractive

784
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:18,240
Everything

785
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:19,008
In the house

786
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,288
Ketchup

787
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:24,640
I am also that person and constantly like

788
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,408
I don't know

789
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,432
I really don't know

790
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:30,784
Backpack

791
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,064
And you really don't want

792
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:35,392
Let's think about that

793
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:39,232
The Trackers right now the trackr Bravo cost $30

794
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,536
How much is the Atlas plug

795
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:42,816
Concept

796
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:46,400
So we have for $99

797
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:51,008
Two-bedroom

798
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:52,032
Bedroom home

799
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:55,104
There's a big question here

800
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:56,896
There's other companies

801
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:58,176
What's the do this

802
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:01,248
Zulily is wine I've tried out there they

803
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,272
Garden outlet

804
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:03,552
It tracks

805
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:07,648
Miso its presence detection based on my phone is supposed to track

806
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:08,416
Nothing

807
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:15,328
When I think about building a service that are truly compelling service that fits with the iot

808
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:16,864
If I say

809
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,144
Hey this is tracker

810
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,680
They're building an indoor

811
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:21,216
You know inventory system

812
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:26,080
And is there a what have you thought about

813
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:31,200
Ways to open the supper create this platform and how would you kind of do it given

814
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:37,088
Hey there's a lot of competition just in the tracking Market but there's also kind of indoor location map

815
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,136
Petition

816
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:45,792
Probably want to open ASAP is that were costly looking for like

817
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:47,584
Each Creek Softball bags

818
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:50,400
Another company check

819
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:52,448
Theron traffic purses

820
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:54,240
And then I think

821
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:56,032
New Atlas device

822
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:57,312
Ennui

823
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:58,336
Started

824
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:00,128
Programs that we can have

825
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:01,408
It works

826
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,688
Future platform

827
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,504
Drum bearing stood in what SmartThings

828
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,576
I'm interested in to see the future

829
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:10,112
I don't think

830
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:12,160
Really really early days

831
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:15,488
A lot of these other

832
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:18,304
Smart home companies.

833
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:19,840
Everything that

834
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:24,704
You need to be we're going to do

835
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:27,264
Witchita inventory tracking it

836
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,800
One part of

837
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,128
Should know

838
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:34,944
Very basic

839
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,992
Yusuke sub for me

840
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:38,016
Okay

841
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:39,808
And you guys

842
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:44,928
Are teaming up with Amazon you actually took some money from the Amazon Alexa fund

843
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,744
Not in a Robert kind of way just did they invested in you

844
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,560
A phrase that strangely

845
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:57,984
If I team up the Amazon Echo and your

846
00:36:58,496 --> 00:36:59,264
Atlas project

847
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,568
That I have the ability to ask the echo

848
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:04,128
Hey where's my stuff and she'll say

849
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:05,664
It's in the kitchen

850
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,944
Entirely

851
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:07,712
Right

852
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:09,760
Sing your style

853
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:10,784
Entirely yet

854
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:18,464
You're looking at homes

855
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,512
She walked down at the time and

856
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:24,096
Echo integration

857
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:27,680
Katy release we were

858
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:33,568
Instantly integrated it

859
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:39,456
Because

860
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:42,016
I'm asking Echo where are my keys

861
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:43,296
And having the

862
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:46,368
In the kitchen so I bring them for you

863
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:52,000
I'm really sorry about that

864
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:55,072
One-point Lee

865
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,680
Find dress right

866
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:00,960
AR app

867
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:03,520
Look and then press the button

868
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:04,800
Safariland

869
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:09,664
Look around

870
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:14,528
If they don't find it there then they're going to open up

871
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:16,576
R&R tracwrap and then

872
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,464
I want to have to get you a point where

873
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,256
People are using

874
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:25,792
R software

875
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:29,120
Before they look for themselves

876
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:30,912
If that makes sense

877
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:32,960
Writing reliant on

878
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,848
Memorize phone numbers right

879
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:39,616
Now

880
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:40,896
You don't try to remember

881
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,200
Phone number

882
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:43,968
Your phone book

883
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:47,040
Some people would describe this is like the end of

884
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:48,064
Community

885
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:51,136
People song Let it Roll

886
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:53,184
I did want to ask you

887
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:54,208
Because

888
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:59,840
Tile which is one of your big competitors recently gave figures

889
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:01,888
About 40 million

890
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,752
For this day is selling $40 worth of tiles in the next year

891
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:09,312
Which is a lot of $25

892
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:10,336
Trackers

893
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:14,176
Okay see your Damien trackers really difficult for me

894
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:19,808
I'd love to

895
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:22,368
Where where do you stack up against

896
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:24,672
What does that say about the market for this thing

897
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,488
I think that is really starting

898
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:35,680
Any

899
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:37,984
Is

900
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,312
I mean

901
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,616
Contracted number

902
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:44,896
I mean I think

903
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:50,272
Over 1.5 million devices

904
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:51,296
Dan's

905
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:52,576
Yeah that's a lot

906
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:54,880
To the market

907
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:56,160
However

908
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:57,952
There's three

909
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:00,512
Do they have a whole lot of

910
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:01,536
Stop the track

911
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:06,400
Right so we're just scratching the surface

912
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:08,192
Next right now

913
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:11,776
Thanks what we're trying to do is

914
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:27,648
I think that you just see more of

915
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:28,416
Braiding

916
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:33,792
Yahoo

917
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:37,632
We have other software applications

918
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:42,752
Are tracking technology and siblings

919
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:43,776
I think that

920
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:47,104
To finish off

921
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,640
What are some of the

922
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:51,968
Most interesting or surprising use cases that you have

923
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:54,528
There I mean there's definitely

924
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:56,320
People that are trapped

925
00:40:56,576 --> 00:41:00,672
Weird things like that we have like peoples are tracking the bunch of

926
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:04,256
I didn't know this was a thing but

927
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:06,048
They actually hibernate

928
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:11,424
Table like going dinner corn and hibernate and not move

929
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:15,776
And that was kind of surprising for us

930
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:16,800
Another

931
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:26,016
Measurements over time

932
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,040
Dan

933
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:28,064
Would you

934
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:34,208
Take a note

935
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:35,488
I get moved

936
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:36,768
And then the Stars

937
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:43,936
Tracking devices underneath the ground to go next

938
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:47,008
And then where

939
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:48,544
Really excited about

940
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,336
Something stop

941
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:53,663
Like don't know there

942
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:59,807
And I get another entire city

943
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:00,831
Everything

944
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:06,207
I think we're seeing some cool use cases

945
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:08,511
Excited

946
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:09,279
Cases

947
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:17,727
Desert Sands

948
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:19,519
Coffee mug

949
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:21,311
Every single day in office

950
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:23,359
And I think

951
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:25,919
Smaller items

952
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:30,527
I'm really

953
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:33,855
What kind of change

954
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:35,647
Interact with other items

955
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:38,207
And try to remember

956
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:41,279
I'm thinking about it you stick one on each kid in the school

957
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:43,071
And then you know where they are

958
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:44,351
Related to the school

959
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:45,119
Which is

960
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:47,679
Actually done in a lot of places with like

961
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:48,447
Badging in

962
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:50,495
Schools have kids badge

963
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:52,031
It's also kind of a little

964
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:54,847
I don't know

965
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:03,295
Scary

966
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:04,063
Significant

967
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:09,183
Right now because we don't want

968
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:10,207
So unique

969
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:10,975

00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:25,311

00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:31,199
Live tracking

976
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:33,503
