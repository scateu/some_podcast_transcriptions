Kevin are you ready for

62
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:41,792
Disturbia

63
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:44,352
Dystopia and surveillance yes I am

64
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,120
Okay

65
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:45,888
Well

66
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,680
Get started we've got

67
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:51,008
A couple big stories happening this week first I'm going to

68
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,288
I'll start off with the

69
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,824
Hacking of the US

70
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,128
Customs and Border Patrol database

71
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,200
Partially because here I am in Canada this week

72
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:02,528
As I was walking through customs in Montreal I was like

73
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,344
I wonder if my photo

74
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,648
And it is

75
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:08,416
It is

76
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:10,464
In front of the little

77
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:12,000
Passport machine in it

78
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,328
So I guess we should start with the story

79
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,888
Do you want to tell us what's going on yes yes

80
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,936
Well you are a way out of the country

81
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,728
Apparently

82
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:24,800
The Customs and Border Protection Agency

83
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,336
Which had stored

84
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:29,920
Restoring images of Travelers in license plates

85
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:33,760
Nearest tens of thousands of those images I don't know exactly how many yet

86
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,808
Basically hacked

87
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:37,088
Us

88
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:40,672
Government reportedly says no more than a hundred thousand people had their

89
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:41,696
Compromise

90
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:42,976
The way this

91
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,512
Hackworth it wasn't

92
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:46,304
Customs and Border Protection

93
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:48,352
Self which has the data

94
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,936
Contractor subcontractor

95
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:52,704
That works

96
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:57,056
For the CDP transfer copies of images

97
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,080
And that Network

98
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:59,104
Was hacking

99
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,200
They're not supposed to be actually transferring was images

100
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:03,968
2

101
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:05,504
So that's the story

102
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,320
But it was too much larger questions about

103
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:09,600
Surveillance

104
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:10,624
But lots of things

105
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,672
So this is actually very similar Sony

106
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:16,768
The big Sony hack from a couple years ago happen the same way it was a third-party contractor

107
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,559
Which first off

108
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,863
Everybody who's Gathering anytime

109
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,191
Consumers

110
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:27,263
You should be evaluating your third-party contractors

111
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,031
Security practice

112
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,823
Like as much as your own

113
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,871
So we'll just get that out of the way

114
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,175
Now let's talk about the

115
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,199
The second aspect

116
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,223
Surveillance

117
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:36,991
Tissue

118
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:39,039
So this is disturbing for a cup

119
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:39,807
Couple of reasons

120
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,343
1

121
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:43,135
The US government has been

122
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,415
Using facial rash

123
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:46,207
Definition in pulling this data

124
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,743
Without really talking

125
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:48,767
People about

126
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:49,535
How is being

127
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,327
It even gives Airlines

128
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,607
Access to this data

129
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:53,887
If they want

130
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,679
So there's been a lot of

131
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,471
Controversy right now

132
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:58,239
About

133
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,775
How people are using

134
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:01,055
Image data

135
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,079
And facial

136
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:02,847
Recognition

137
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:05,151
Without talking to people about how they

138
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:09,503
I think the underscore your point it was only a few months ago

139
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:12,575
Everybody was up in arms when some people wore

140
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:15,903
Going to flights at US airports that was an artist

141
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,183
These little cameras

142
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,463
And there was no

143
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,999
Knowledge

144
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:23,327
Which is there and say What are you do at that point decide not to go on your flight

145
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,119
Because you want to review

146
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:28,447
The terms and conditions

147
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,751
First you check and make sure it's not a

148
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:36,383
Boeing Max 770 or whatever that was a butt second yeah you check and see if

149
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,943
Your picture there

150
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:44,575
It's very quiet that's a thing I guess you said this not being discussed at least

151
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:47,135
In China we know this is all happening at maybe

152
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,671
I would imagine the Chinese

153
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,743
And they're Building Services on it

154
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:54,047
Their advertising services

155
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,327
Right here it is

156
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,119
It's a little bit more clandestine

157
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:00,703
There's also no consent happening

158
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:04,287
The frustrating thing is what happens when it says haxo now

159
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:05,567
People have

160
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:07,615
Picture

161
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:09,919
Disassociated very accurate

162
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:10,943
What's my name

163
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:11,967
So accurately enough for

164
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:16,319
I used Tabitha expression is good enough

165
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,415
Which usually means it's not

166
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,719
I I don't know if I should rethink that

167
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:24,511
Particular era

168
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,583
So they have access to this

169
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:32,447
I don't know it talks about license plate government also has a lot of biomass

170
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:35,007
Didn't they have my fingerprint data for example is part of

171
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,543
Customs and Border

172
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:39,359
Protection agency has my fingerprint data is part of the

173
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:41,151
Nexus global entry program

174
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:45,503
Is that kind of information gets hacked and suddenly people have a way to

175
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,039
Possibly

176
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:49,599
Access things that it in the physical

177
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,951
And as we start moving to biometric

178
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:54,975
Authenticators

179
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:55,743
That's a given

180
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:59,071
Strangers easy access to ways to

181
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,351
Get into

182
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,143
Any number of other people

183
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,679
Tails or

184
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,215
Homes or that's what

185
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,263
I hate to ask this question

186
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:10,079
Cuz I only want to think about the answer but

187
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:12,895
Longer here in the US do you think it will be

188
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,943
Before it's more like what China does

189
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,479
Today in terms of

190
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,015
Surveillance

191
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,551
The newsletter

192
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:20,831
A week or two ago

193
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:25,439
There was a great video about being in China what it's like to be there if you're not a citizen maybe you're

194
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:27,487
Startup company Oregon Shenzhen

195
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:31,839
And one of the guys who's from Australia for some companies building

196
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,631
Digital ski coach

197
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,399
Products

198
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,423
DJ walkzz

199
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:36,959
The camera caught him

200
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:39,263
In 20 seconds he got his ticket

201
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:40,799
Over WeChat

202
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:42,335
And because I have funds in WeChat

203
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:44,895
The ticket was safe for me to take it out

204
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,687
He's not even a Chinese citizen

205
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:47,455
Lesbian China

206
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,503
How long before we get there

207
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,295
Because I think we're going to

208
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:53,855
I want to be

209
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,647
Especially about that

210
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,439
Is

211
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:59,487
I think we could be there very cool

212
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:02,047
I think we won't get there

213
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:04,607
From a practical standpoint because there would be less

214
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:06,399
Lawsuit over things like that

215
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,423
But the

216
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,447
Larger issue

217
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,983
In one that's inherently about

218
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,263
Fairness is

219
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,543
If you have

220
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,847
This automated Eye in the Sky the

221
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,639
Can enforce every law

222
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,687
Right so see if someone's jaywalker

223
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,223
And then enforce them

224
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:23,807
If it's automated it creates a much more fair

225
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,087
Society

226
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,111
In the sense that

227
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:28,927
Right now predominantly African-American

228
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,999
Please. Them as opposed

229
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,047
And

230
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,327
The question that makes

231
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:38,911
What laws does a society decide to add

232
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:39,679
X-Force

233
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:40,959
If you're going to have it

234
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:42,239
Art by autumn

235
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:44,799
Right where it applies to everybody regardless

236
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:45,567
Yes

237
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,359
You know it's true

238
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:49,919
There's pros and cons of ultimately

239
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,967
Knee-jerk reaction is woke that is

240
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:57,855
We also then took a hard look at the laws that we want

241
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,135
Force or the out

242
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:01,439
Comes we would like to see from those laws

243
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,231
We might actually be able to

244
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,023
Make a more fair Society

245
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:12,447
Alright Lizzie and speaking of

246
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:13,727
Enforcement

247
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:14,751
And facial

248
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:15,519
Rescue Mission

249
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,567
You came across the pretty

250
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:18,591
Creepy story

251
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:24,223
I did and it's about a new set of smart glasses

252
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,503
American company

253
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,783
Music switch

254
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:29,855
Almost every year at CVS I see some new

255
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:32,671
Products from them in this space but I've never really

256
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:34,719
Bible come to Market

257
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:37,535
And I'm really hoping this one doesn't but unfortunately

258
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:38,559
Looks like it is

259
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,095
They are making

260
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,119
Smart glasses

261
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:43,167
That works on

262
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:46,495
Basic software and services from a dubai-based firm

263
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:47,775
Call nntc

264
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,823
INTC

265
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:52,127
Facial recognition algorithms

266
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:55,711
Megapixel camera and glasses

267
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:57,759
Where these and scan faces

268
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:58,527
Krowd

269
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,575
Data is compared against

270
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:04,671
A database of 1 million images and literally

271
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:07,999
These things can detect 15 pieces per frame

272
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:08,767
Second

273
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,047
Dirty Clippers

274
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:12,863
Yeah so you can you can scan through

275
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,423
A crowd to find maybe a suspect.

276
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,215
Something safe your police which it is

277
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:19,007
What I think they are starting to

278
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,287
Target PS4

279
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:23,103
And I know that in China going back to that they do have some

280
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:23,871
Something similar

281
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:27,711
To these we don't hear in the US but I think we might soon

282
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:28,735
I don't know yet

283
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,783
50 pairs produce

284
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:31,551
So

285
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,599
It's not like these are mass-produced

286
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,927
I could see some places

287
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,975
Imagine the scene you said like a

288
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:39,999
Protest

289
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,791
That would be Beyond Scared

290
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:44,607
It's just in your lawn

291
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,375
Is right now

292
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,447
People's Facebook pages

293
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,215
To see where they are

294
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:54,591
And there are a lot of places like I remember me now going through London a couple years back there's cameras everywhere

295
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:56,127
So there are tons of like

296
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,663
Closed-circuit cameras

297
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,431
Various

298
00:10:58,943 --> 00:10:59,967
Countries and regions

299
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:00,991
Where is

300
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:04,831
They can apply facial recognition algorithms to the date of there so it's not like

301
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,879
This is new what's new about it

302
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,415
Right

303
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,183
Yes

304
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:11,999
And imagine being able to hack into

305
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,535
Biometric data

306
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,303
For example

307
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:17,631
Imagine being able to not just hack into it but maybe

308
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:19,423
Hack into the system in

309
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,447
Change that data

310
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,727
Suddenly

311
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:22,495
You have this

312
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:24,031
Hey

313

If you're Criminal

314
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:28,383
Change your own face or maybe

315
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:32,735
If your friend somebody not to make them not to make a pun with glasses

316
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,319
Alright dictionary

317
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,087
Entering

Scary

322
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:45,791
Spotify

323
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,863
Create a playlist based on

Oceans

325
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,679
We've been doing that for a while

326

Which I use that picture all the time but now I'm like

327
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,799
I don't know if I want to use that anymore because now

328
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:59,359
Was just found out they're selling

329
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,639
The data

330
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,175
About your moods

331
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,967
Advertising purposes

332
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,319
Wow I mean that's a whole different set of advertising data

333
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:10,623
Yeah cuz I got often

334
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:13,183
You know I look at Spotify and I go in and in

00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:19,071
Tweaked my privacy settings I actually everytime I buy a new device or new subscription I go to the privacy setting first and I

336
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,863
Make sure everything is

338
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:22,911

Yeah exactly yet

346
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:41,087
The story that we listen to work

347
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,623
You know there's likely to be

348
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,159
Feeling pressure and stress

349
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,183
So

350
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:48,255
You know you you start advertising something at work distressing

351
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,351
Candle or whatever it is

352
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,655
Yeah and

353
00:12:54,911 --> 00:13:00,031
Tighten a couple weeks ago Amazon the news came out

354
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:02,591
Just playing around

355
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:04,383
Wrist-worn wearable that would track

356
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,407
People's moods

357
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,687
Impossibly

358
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,991
Some of the theories were like oh yeah

359
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,783
Maybe we could help people interact

360
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:11,807
With other people

361
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,343
More social

362
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:15,135
I think I should like this idea

363
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,927
Discover that what they do with it

364
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:19,487
I would be thrilled if my digital assistant

365
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,791
Read my moon that way cuz

366
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:25,119
DOT cameras it's not that invasive if you know

367
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:28,191
What if your mood was

368
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,031
Well

369
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,567
They would know what music you're playing

370
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,895
I would know to do the lights

371
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,175
That I'm like

372
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:41,759
Pair

373
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,039
There's a lot of movies like

374
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:46,623
Sometimes when I'm in a bad mood I don't even tell my family cuz I'm like

375
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:49,439
Sometimes you know when you're like pouting or really salty

376
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,719
You like I know I should not

377
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:59,167
Don't talk to Mom anime says she's in a bad mood I don't really want people to know I'm having a temper tantrum

378
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,191
Cuz that is not cool

379
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:02,495
Close to my family does know anyway but

380
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:03,519
But still

381
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:08,127
So I don't trust any of these companies enough to give them that

382
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:10,943
Kind of level data even if it does make my home

383
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:11,711
A better place

384
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:14,271
I think I'm willing to draw the line

385
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,295
Emotional survey

386
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,087
I don't know where Kevin Skinner

387
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,879
Maybe we'll hit it maybe we will

388
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:22,463
I don't have many rides that I won't cry so

389
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:29,119
Just cuz I like to try things and learn about vacations of upsetting what the value is for the cost song

390
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,679
If they said that we do have this product

391
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,287
Thatcher open

392
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:39,103
So which beta the new Facebook portal

393
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:43,711
I didn't even pay the old ones cuz I won't touch those

394
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:46,783
This is this is curious so did

395
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:47,551
Did you draw the line

396
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:49,599
Facebook did you drive

397
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:56,255
No it's result video chat I mean I video chat with my son almost everyday

398
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,279
We video chat

399
00:14:57,535 --> 00:15:00,607
You and I do video chat sometimes

400
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,423
I am always wonderful

401
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:07,263
Okay

402
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,103
No I get utility out of video chatting without a doubt

403
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:11,871
But

404
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:14,431
I don't need to use Facebook's platforms

405
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,455
Do so and

406
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:17,247
Get what I need

407
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,015
From them

408
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:21,599
If I use their platform so why bother is my taken

409
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:26,975
I know there's people that bought this thing I've never seen them

410
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:29,023
There's a there's a market for it

411
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,071
Certain people I'm just not one of them

412
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,351
Bring in another

413
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,119
Stories

414
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,399
There is a story

415
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,167
About

416
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,191
AI

417
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:38,751
Recognizing Common Place household objects

418
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:39,775
Looks like soapstone

419
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:40,799
Vision

420
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:45,407
And I was thinking about old Facebook would love to know like the products in my

421
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:50,527
Amazon Echo Show has lots of products

422
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:53,087
Yeah I don't know if it's pulling that data

423
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:53,855
So

424
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:56,415
This particular story was about how

425
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:59,999
They are much better at recognizing

426
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,279
Things from

427
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:04,607
First World countries basically so if you're in a poor country with

428
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,143
Generic for people soap

429
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:08,959
Bransford

430
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:10,495
African country

431
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:14,591
Heyde Eye doesn't recognize those because the engineers usually

432
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,479
Yeah they need to expand the model

433
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:22,271
With these other products that teach it

434
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:26,623
So it's going to be there

435
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,159
The Blind Side

436
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:31,999
You know it's at I don't think I don't think that are

437
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:34,047
They're trying to get the most bang for buck here

438
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:34,815
So

439
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:35,839
All right they don't

440
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,631
I asked my opinion

441
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:38,655
I care but

442
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:42,239
Figure model it is some more the better

443
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:45,823
You know I don't think we said you mentioned beta test these Facebook portal

444
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,103
Apparently

445
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:49,407
CNBC Facebook has said that they have

446
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:51,967
New versions of their portal video chat

447
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:55,295
This fall different form-factors perhaps

448
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,063
We

449
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:59,647
Before the show try to guess what this form factors would be and you don't even want

450
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:02,719
Think about what we thought about cuz I have no idea what it was like to be doing

451
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,743
What about it

452
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,023
You talk to your wife

453
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:08,863
You do not care what I do talk to you on your way

454
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:14,751
Right place

455
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:17,823
Because video chat for me tends to be a long

456
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,615
So I'm kind of thing well I'll spend

457
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:22,943
510 30 minutes whatever depending on the person in the

458
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:23,711
Ana purpose

459
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:27,551
Whereas talking to my watch is there any micro transactional send a text

460
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:28,831
Reply to somebody

461
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:29,855
Etc

462
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:31,647
9 that's it

463
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:33,183
Legendary chest

464
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,207
Tend to be very

465
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,231
Transactional

466
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:37,791
It's like let me show you this place that I'm at

467
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:40,095
Check this out and then we switch to

468
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:44,191
Different

469
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:45,471
Holy cow

470
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:48,031
Alrighty let's talk about 5G

471
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:48,799
Man

472
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:52,639
Because we haven't we haven't

473
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:53,663
Yasso

474
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:55,967
Couple exciting things about the story

475
00:17:56,223 --> 00:18:01,087
She is actually that would it be more exciting things but AT&T is working with Uber's elevate

476
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,367
To test out

477
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,671
Basically how do you bring cell service

478
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,439
Into

479
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,207
Your taxi

480
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:06,975
Syndromes

481
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,767
YG is really just throwing in here

482
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:11,583
Market purpose because right now luberon 80

483
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:12,351
AT&T reusing

484
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,375
BL2 E network

485
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,911
To see how to connect

486
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,447
The Ubers

487
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:19,007
Potential are taxis

488
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:22,335
The interesting thing about this press release was that they were saying that

489
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:25,663
Expects Elevate to launch its first taxis

490
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,223
In 2023 which is only 4 years

491
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:32,831
Well that's something else I would beta test although not a very tall height

492
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:35,903
Like you said the 5G biddestone here because of marketing

493
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:40,255
Even question why it's in there at all because we talked about millimeter wave and

494
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,279
Line of sight

495
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,863
Why you do that with an air taxi

496
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:47,167
Without spending billions and billions are there

497
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:53,311
Line of sight I mean if you're going up your orienting your antennas up there's not actually as much stuff

498
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:55,103
You know there's no buildings

499
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:58,175
The latency

500
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,199
Elements are

501
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:00,479
Compelling

502
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:04,063
Just think the power management though I mean a lot of

503
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,855
5G what it's going to look like

504
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,647
Actually talk to somebody from Annex

505
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:08,927
Speed recently about

506
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,207
Managing

507
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,743
The radios

508
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:16,863
And what's going to happen is a lot of these companies are going to deploy

509
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,471
GE service

510
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:24,799
If that millimeter-wave isn't available or it's just

511
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:29,407
That processing that's going to happen

512
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,503
That has to happen like on the Drone and at the base station level

513
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:35,039
And that's going to

514
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,319
Gobs of

515
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,343
Just suck up

516
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,623
Types of power saws

517
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:39,391
Museum

518
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:41,695
Yeah that becomes important when

519
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:43,487
If you run out of power

520
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:44,511
In the air

521
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:49,887
No millimeter-wave is going to help you

522
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:51,679
Is a bigger battery

523
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:56,799
We'll see

524
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:58,591
I guess that really sums up my

525
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:00,127
I think it's going to have to be like

526
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:03,711
Coruscant Star Wars I apologize for the reference but they're just going to have space Lane

527
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:07,039
Driving there

528
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,319
I'm not even asked

529
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:10,623
I think people who know Star Wars

530
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:11,903
They'll understand

531
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:12,927
All right

532
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:13,695
Trust me

533
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:14,975
Hey did you buy the

534
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:15,999
Amazon blink

535
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,535
Xt2 video camera

536
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,327
I know we talked about doing it but

537
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,607
I never did

538
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:24,959
We we did I did not get $1 / 150 battery power

539
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:29,311
Yeah in the blink cameras have been around for a while Amazon

540
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:34,175
This one was around for

541
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:37,247
How long has this been around

542
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:39,039
2 weeks

543
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:43,135
It was just back in May that they started taking orders and

544
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,159
Marshalls products

545
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:45,695
Already

546
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:52,607
Yeah Amazon has temporarily stop taking orders for this camera

547
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:53,631
They did it because

548
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:54,911
Cuz it was getting

549
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,215
Mapreduce with some buyers

550
00:20:57,471 --> 00:21:00,287
Saying that it had poor range between their camera in the router

551
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:03,103
Bad software bad movement detection

552
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,127
And so am

553
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,407
Sunset

554
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:06,687
Let's take a closer look

555
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,735
I don't know if this is true but

556
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:12,319
Reportedly a Amazon reviewer for the product

557
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,087
Rote

558
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:14,367
Amazon review

559
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:17,696
I got an email from the founder of blank letting you know they are working out

560
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:19,232
Unexpected issues with

561
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,512
Does expand on

562
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:23,840
Enter very willing to work with me to get this figured out

563
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:25,632
There's issues

564
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:27,424
And this is hard and

565
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,472
How hard is it is so hard that

566
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:31,264
I don't know if you guys remember wechat

567
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,288
August

568
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,312
View doorbell

569
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:36,384
Vegetable that like 3 weeks after it's lost

570
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,920
Lunch in this was a battery power

571
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:39,712
Are just like the blink camera battery power

572
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:41,248
Video doorbell

573
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,272
And

574
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,808
This was also

575
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:44,576
Because it

576
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:46,368
Behaving inconsistent

577
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:49,440
What can we say it's hard to do battery-powered video tube

578
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:52,256
Especially because they have to use Wi-Fi so that's

579
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:53,024
Powersox

580
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,304
They've got to figure something out there

581
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:56,096
You got to have this

582
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:59,936
Sleeping awake mozyr very difficult on this because you basically

583
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:03,520
You know if it's movement detection you're after the second

584
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:07,104
It detects movement he wanted to start recording are you want to already

585
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:07,872
I've been

586
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:09,664
And just like

587
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,456
Delete recordings continuously

588
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:13,248
So this is really

589
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,784
Is really a struggle

590
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,552
Four companies

591
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:17,088
I suspect this is why we don't

592
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:19,136
Battery power

593
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:19,904
Camera

594
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,208
Yeah I mean Arnold's done a good job here

595
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:24,512
Even Arlo actually gets

596
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:26,304
Get yelled at sometimes for

597
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:28,096
Basically sucking up battery

598
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:31,936
And they've actually got their own Wireless in their early cameras

599
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:33,472
They had a hug that

600
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:34,496
Work with a cam

601
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:35,776
Which I assume is a

602
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:36,800
More robust

603
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:38,080
Wireless protocol

604
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,616
To handle things like lag

605
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:46,016
What about Google and their environmental sensors and iot

606
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:51,392
Yeah this is cool for the tinkerers out there if you have a Raspberry Pi

607
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:56,000
You can now buy for $25 and add on board on board

608
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:57,024
That's

609
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,560
Is 4

610
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,328
Google

611
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,096
Coral

612
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:03,168
Mental boards the coral Dev board

613
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,472
It has

614
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:06,752
Machine learning board with

615
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:07,520
How to use yes

616
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:11,104
So the TPU is a separate USB plugin

617
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:15,456
And what that does is that let you do machine learning without the cloud you kind of

618
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:20,832
Bring it down to the edge connect connect this board to that

619
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:22,880
Daisy chain

620
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:25,952
Daisy chain

621
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:32,352
You can get tensorflow on the edge TPU to work with a python and SQL

622
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:36,960
Scott a humidity and temperature sensor ambient light sensor

623
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:37,984
Pressure

624
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:48,224
You know it's like I said it's something for like iot development it's not something

625
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,016
Consumers are going to go by but I thought was kind of

626
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:53,088
Could you use it to make our our fabled washer

627
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,112
Hair dryers

628
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:59,232
The infamous washer dryer sensor I think you could I don't see why

629
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,000
Not

630
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,792
I wish I had vibration

631
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:03,328
He doesn't have that

632
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,424
Humidity

633
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:11,008
Maybe when the washer is going

634
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,032
Politely

635
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,128
All right there's a lot of ways we can skin that cat

636
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:16,896
We just have

637
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:17,664
I figured it out yet

638
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,944
Okay well

639
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,784
I think that's enough for this week especially since I'm traveling and just coming out the movie

640
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:28,672
Guys I cannot wait for the move to be finished we're so close now so maybe in the next week or two

641
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:33,536
Actually know the first thing I'm going to do and it relates to this week's voicemail question

642
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:34,816
Witches from Lynn

643
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:38,144
Before we hear it the iot podcast hotline is sponsored

644
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,728
This month by a pharaoh with the fifth largest iot patent

645
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:43,264
Portfolio in the world

646
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:47,616
A pharaoh provides a proven iot platform that doesn't risk your brand

647
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:52,480
Affero customers have experienced as much as an 80% reduction in time to mark

648
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,528
M10x higher activation rates

649
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,576
Learn more at a pharaoh

650
00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,136
All right

651
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:00,160
And now

652
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,440
To the voicemail

653
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:02,976
Stacy and Kevin

654
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:04,512
When's the Maryland

655
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,864
Your most underrated

656
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:10,656
Picture of your smart home

657
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:12,448
That you would tell a new

658
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:15,264
Thanks

659
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:16,800
Lynn

660
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:18,336
It's such a good question

661
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:19,104
And

662
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,920
I will tell you the first thing I'm going to do when I get back

663
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:24,224
Since I now have internet access in my house

664
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:26,784
And my smart devices unpacked

665
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,320
Actually get a setup

666
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:33,696
Motion sensor in my hue light bulbs motion sensor the Hue bulbs so that you can do it with

667
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:34,720
Thompson Center

668
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:35,744
SmartThings

669
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:37,280
Who said that

670
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,048
Lighting thing

671
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:39,328
Did my laundry

672
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:42,400
I cannot get over how much

673
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:44,704
I miss walking into my laundry room with

674
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:47,520
Purse full of laundry and having the lights turn on automatically

675
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:49,056
Then turn off

676
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:50,336
You have 2 minutes after

677
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:51,872
No motion has been detected

678
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,664
It's such a small thing but

679
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,432
I love it

680
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:56,736
And not having it is driving me absolutely crazy

681
00:25:57,504 --> 00:26:03,648
And I haven't wish I had because I would love that perspectives like what I miss the most will be

682
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,976
The very first thing I have to put back in place

683
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,000
I'm just turn the internet off

684
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,072
Could do that just make

685
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:12,352
The family will love that

686
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:13,120
Yes

687
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:15,424
No YouTube TV for you come back one year

688
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,472
But I have to say the most

689
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:19,520
Unexpected

690
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:21,568
Expected as well as underrated

691
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,104
Value that I've gotten

692
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:27,456
From my smart home and I've mentioned this probably a year ago cuz I think it's going to happen

693
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:28,736
Was having

694
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:30,016
A webcam

695
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:32,832
Inside my house looking out the front window

696
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:36,928
Where my driveway and the road as whatever townhouse communities

697
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:38,720
We sometimes park on the road

698
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:40,256
Sometimes have cars in the driveway

699
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:44,352
But I did put it out there for that I put out there to see who's walking up there

700
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:46,912
Pass to come around to the front door Etc

701
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,192
And yet

702
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,496
A $20 wyze cam

703
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:54,336
Whichever it is now it was a mess when I had a pack and play for this particular

704
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,104
Instance

705
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:59,200
Save me $1,500 because it captured

706
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:00,480
A neighbor

707
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:02,016
Eating my Park

708
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:03,552
Car on the street

709
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:07,392
And that was used as evidence for the insurance claim because the neighbor claims

710
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:08,160
She did not have

711
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:08,928
The car

712
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:11,232
I never thought I would use it for that

713
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:13,792
I need the money back on that webcam

714
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:18,400
Many many times over and I would never get rid of it for that very reason because

715
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:19,680
You never know when

716
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:21,216
You're going to have fuse for like that

717
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,520
Slightly more expensive

718
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:26,848
Camera similar use case I would recommend

719
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,640
The Logitech Circle 2

720
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:30,432
It's not as cheap as the wise cam

721
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:31,200
But

722
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:32,736
It has discrete filtering

723
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:34,528
That makes it so when you

724
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:35,296
Use it

725
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:36,576
In these specific I am

726
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:38,368
Cricket inside and outside

727
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,440
It doesn't get the glare off the window at night

728
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:47,072
It's also homekit certified and it will be one of the first cameras that work with

729
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:49,120
Apple secure video

730
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:51,424
API that Apple talked about last week

731
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,960
WWDC

732
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:56,800
And I'm in Canada right now so I'm looking at prices and seeing Canada prices

733
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,848
Kevin how much is that in the US

734
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:05,760
Here in the US that looks like it retails for about $180 at Amazon

735
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:08,576
Does have it for $12 less

736
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:10,624
Excellent so it's more expensive

737
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:14,208
But if you're trying to catch like things happening at night in your house

738
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,768
And you have money you'd like to birds

739
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:18,560
That is another option

740
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:21,888
Okay I realized we didn't talk about any of apples

741
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:24,704
You did mention the video

742
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:26,752
Camera API and

743
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:29,056
Set real quick to say what it is I basically

744
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:30,592
Really clever

745
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:34,432
Continue to double down on privacy as a way to stand out from the crowd here

746
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,480
Homekit cameras

747
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:39,040
Better enabled with this API

748
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:41,600
The video streams won't be sent

749
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:43,136
To the

750
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:45,696
Cloud of the hardware manufacturer

751
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:48,512
Which could often be a third-party cloud provider

752
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,584
Dean's dad will be encrypted and then sent

753
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,352
2

754
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,376
ICloud

755
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:55,680
And you will not pay for the

756
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:56,448
Storage

757
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,008
10 days

758
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:04,896
And even app will not be able to see what's been captured on video so therefore there's no

759
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:06,432
Privacy implications

760
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:10,016
It's new advertising location Etc

761
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:12,320
Erodditys Hardware makers

762
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:13,856
Basically from the

763
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:18,208
Bobby's camera monitoring services

764
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,048
Yeah and they also actually Apple also addressed another big question

765
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:23,072
We Care a Lot

766
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:23,840
At the

767
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:24,608
Podcast

768
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,192
Which is how do you secure your home network for your iot device

769
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,984
Ww.w

770
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:30,752
BGC

771
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:32,288
Apple did say

772
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,592
They're working with a few router maker

773
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,128
Spectrum

774
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:37,152
Linksys

775
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:38,176
And Gyro

776
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:39,712
Which ironically

777
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:41,248
Brazilian by Amazon

778
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:45,856
But what they're going to be doing is homekit certified routers and these are going to have

779
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:47,648
Three different layers of

780
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:48,416
Troll

781
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:51,488
So all of your homekit devices on the network

782
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,352
You'll be able to select the device and then you'll be able to say hey restrict this only to the home

783
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:57,632
Which means

784
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:58,656
Only talk to things

785
00:29:58,912 --> 00:29:59,424
In the home

786
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,192
Homekit devices

787
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,240
Automatic which is

788
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:03,264
Restricted

789
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,568
I'm talking to the outside weird websites but

790
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:07,872
Its own website and a few others are fine

791
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:09,664
And then no restrictions

792
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:12,224
Let it do whatever I want

793
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:15,552
Which is open up your front door and walk away from your house

794
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:16,832
So that's

795
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:21,952
Really interesting and I can't wait to hear about people's experiences on this cuz it does seem like

796
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:23,488
One is an extra layer of

797
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:24,256
Complexity

798
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,024
2

799
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:28,096
People I think are going to be like most secure restricted home

800
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:30,656
But then they're going to be pissed when things like Amazon

801
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,192
Echo Cloud Integrations

802
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,616
It's kind of the big news from Apple will talk about more of that as we see iOS 30

803
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:41,152
Because they're so cool

804
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:42,432
Homekit related short

805
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,456
That's that'll be happening

806
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:45,504
But wait till we can

807
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,272
You play with it

808
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,576
That's all the news for this week

809
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:50,880
Let's stay tuned for our guest

810
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:51,648
Dominique

811
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:52,416
Getting out

812
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:54,464
Who is the CTO of

813
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,232
Everything

814
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,096
We are going to be talking about what it means we have a trillion connected devices

815
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:02,400
Either NFC Bluetooth bass tags

816
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:03,936
Even our can of Campbell's Soup

817
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:05,472
Might one day have a little

818
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:07,776
What does that mean for the rest of

819
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:12,128
But before we get into that let's hear from this week sponsor

820
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:18,528
Hey everyone we're taking a quick break from this week's Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor this week

821
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:19,296
Sponsor is

822
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:20,576
Dell Technologies

823
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:22,880
And I'm here today with John Curtis

824
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:23,904
Or JD

825
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:28,000
The sales VP of solutions for Dell Technologies

826
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:31,328
Your team is talking about becoming datafirst

827
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,608
What does that mean

828
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:39,008
That's a great question and given just a sheer quantity of data has been created nowadays remember

829
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,032
Ice cream gigabytes

830
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:41,568
By the year 2025

831
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:46,176
Cloud first point of view

832
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:49,760
Everything should be pushed to the Public's cloud

833
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:51,040
It's just not practical

834
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:55,136
Directions to cut generating from the edge

835
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:57,440
Interpret all of it into the cloud is just

836
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:58,208
Impractical

837
00:31:58,464 --> 00:31:59,488
We need to think today

838
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:00,768
The cloud first

839
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:03,328
Delaware

840
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:04,608
Rather than starting to

841
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:05,376
Determine what they do

842
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,912
Testicular clog can do for you

843
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:09,216
Thinking of it more from what is your data

844
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:10,496
And what can your data do

845
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,080
So that means an increasing focus on the edge

846
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:18,944
And why is Edge Computing essential for success and Industrial scale iot

847
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:22,016
Yeah energy the first world

848
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:24,320
Removing the data

849
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:27,648
In performing actions closer to the edge is going to be critical

850
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,184
There are three main reasons

851
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,208
We feel

852
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:31,232
You need to look at that

853
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:32,256
1

854
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:33,280
Overall volume

855
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:36,096
The sheer volume of data generated at the edge today

856
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:36,864
Is Mass

857
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:38,656
And it's grown exponentially

858
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:39,680
Thunder prediction

859
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:46,336
Stitched it up Spotify 75% of the Enterprise data by the year 2022 and it's up 10% today

860
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:50,432
Active again based on the amount of data

861
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,200
It is just

862
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:56,832
Too expensive to move everything to the cloud more activities and analytics needs to be done at the edge

863
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:58,368
And then Speed most important

864
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,416
The ability to make a decision

865
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:01,952
Right there at the edges

866
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:02,720
Critical

867
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,024
This is autonomous car

868
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:08,096
If a destron suddenly walks in front of the car

869
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:15,008
For the until the car hit the brakes

870
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,032
Too late

871
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:18,336
That decision needs to be done FBI

872
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:19,616
Aside from

873
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,920
Cars what are customers doing it is

874
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:22,944
What are you seeing

875
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:28,576
He actually seemed quite a bit of work done but just recently finished up some research with Forester

876
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:33,184
They basically took and looked at some of the iot enabled use cases

877
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,976
In ones where we're ready to go

878
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:37,792
Security surveillance

879
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:40,352
No doubt number one in the highest General use case

880
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:43,936
They're also starting to see a big traction and in track and Trace

881
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:45,472
NV Energy Management

882
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:46,752
Awesome

883
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:49,312
So what does Dell Technologies offer

884
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:50,336
For those looking

885
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:54,176
We've come to the market with very specific purpose

886
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,968
Stilt Edge devices for iot

887
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,040
In the form of an iot embedded PC

888
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:00,576
As well as in a Gateway product

889
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:02,880
We also have an incredible range of

890
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:04,160
A servers

891
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:05,440
Hyper-converged solution

892
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:09,024
Scale Computing I can meet a wide range of needs

893
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:10,304
Axilla

894
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,840
So where can boats go

895
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:12,608
To learn more

896
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:17,472
If I know more information your listeners can come to Dell Technologies. Com

00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:24,128
Teresa Forrester report I mention as well as find out about their growing portfolio of edge Prada

899
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:32,064
Everyone

900
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,624
Welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is

901
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:37,184
And today's guest

902
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,464
Is Dominique

903
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,232
Do you know

904
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:41,536
Who is CTO at

905
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:42,560
Everything

906
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,352
How are you

907
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:48,448
Thanks for having me on the show

908
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:55,616
I'm super glad you're here and we should probably take it off

909
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:56,640
What

910
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:57,664
Everything is

911
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:00,480
Sure everything is in identity

912
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:02,528
See provider for old Kansas

913
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:05,600
But in particular CPT apparel

914
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:06,624
Luxury goods

915
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:08,416
Food products

916
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:11,488
Essentially provide a unique web identity

917
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:13,024
For each of these products

918
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:19,424
These identities can be used for all kinds of applications consumer-facing applications

919
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:20,448
Related app

920
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:25,312
Applications product authenticity and Analytics

921
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:31,968
We are going to get into that and I should tell everybody

922
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:34,528
Campbell Soup

923
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:35,296
So

924
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:36,576
I have been

925
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:38,880
Operating or aware of everything

926
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,464
I feel like you were

927
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,024
You guys were very early in the

928
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:48,096
Cuz I think there's a lot of

929
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,632
So what have you learned

930
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:50,656
The past

931
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:51,680
2 years of doing this

932
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:59,360
After we started

933
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:01,408
Indeed will change quite a bit

934
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,176
Since then

935
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:06,272
We started in the space we're in today so we started really

936
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:12,672
Sinking of connecting absolutely everything

937
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:13,696
The company ever

938
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:14,720
And then

939
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:18,560
The markets that we are targeting we're not quite ready back then

940
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:21,632
We already targeting cpg

941
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:23,936
To Market Square

942
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:28,032
Interface Technologies serialization smart tax with no

943
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:29,312
Lights at the cost

944
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:30,848
But that they needed to be

945
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:33,664
4

946
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,432
So

947
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:36,224
12 the evolution of everything

948
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:36,992
We went

949
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:40,064
Two more I'd say traditional iot

950
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:46,720
Although the root Society are very matching RFID tagging items but when I say

951
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:50,304
People assume Azure iot today which is

952
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,840
Smart home connect

953
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:52,608
Cities

954
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:53,888
So we did that

955
00:36:55,936 --> 00:37:00,288
But then it was a lot of competition in this Payson and as we were

956
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,616
Exploring

957
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:04,640
Let's connect

958
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,688
Tag sayings

959
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:07,456
Started

960
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:10,528
Cost of tags

961
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:13,600
Cost of circulation

962
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:20,000
Nosal generating consumer demands for more transparency more information about the brand stats

963
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:21,024
We're working with

964
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,560
And so all of that actually

965
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:26,656
Made it possible for us to rely on our initial objective

966
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:31,776
Okay tender questions here

967
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:33,056
You guys are

968
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:33,824
Using

969
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:35,360
RFID tags

970
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:38,432
And let's talk about how the cost of changed over

971
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,480
Because

972
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:43,808
100% up to date on where things used to be in where they are now

973
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:47,136
Yeah so we don't only use RFID

974
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:49,440
Agnostic

975
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:55,840
The technology song

976
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:59,168
Or even LT1 devices

977
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:04,544
For your question specifically about RFID tags there was always this Holy Grail

978
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,312
$0.05

979
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:06,848
Fertagyl or less

980
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:09,408
Many analysts promise

981
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:15,040
This actually didn't materialise for real until

982
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:16,576
Probably one

983
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:18,112
One and a half year ago

984
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:19,648
4 hours ID

985
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:22,464
Where the prices when actually Dlow

986
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,768
5 Stanton and even even

987
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:27,584
Close to 1:17 in Massapequa

988
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:33,984
For other transponder technology such as the NFC for instance took a little bit longer

989
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,784
4 North massive volumes

990
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,600
It's about 10003 order to reach $0.05

991
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:50,880
Which really unlock

992
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:53,696
Launch number

993
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,512
It sure does I remember when

994
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:58,560
50 Cent

995
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:01,120
And then you were like value items

996
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:02,656
So it sounds like

997
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,704
Better standard

998
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,472
Switch deals

999
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:06,496
Obvious

1000
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:07,264
What's happening

1001
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:10,336
Absolutely standardization

1002
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:14,432
For my scale adoption and for really reaching the trillions and that

1003
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:16,224
Darren I'm really excited

1004
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:22,880
Part of the standard that didn't make much noise yet but I think we make a lot of noise in the future you probably know the one

1005
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:28,512
This one's a barcode is actually not accessible to

1006
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:33,376
Consumers are not accessible on the internet and the web

1007
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:37,728
With the gs1 digital link standard that was released last August

1008
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:40,544
You know have a way of sterilizing

1009
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,824
Product identities

1010
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,104
Open urls

1011
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,640
Dtrl sardana

1012
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:45,408
Crates

1013
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:48,736
To put into charcoals NFC tags are old Kansas

1014
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:50,528
Two dimensional data carriers

1015
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:54,880
So that standard is basically turning the good old one barcode

1016
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,840
Talk about before this year

1017
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:06,144
Digital scale

1018
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,168
Market

1019
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:09,984
And lots of Pilots are happening would be friends now

1020
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:13,056
Behind you digitally standard

1021
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:15,872
What is a diplomat look like

1022
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:16,640
Chevrolet

1023
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:18,944
Network agnostic

1024
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,224
Pakistan

1025
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:21,760
How does this work in

1026
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:26,624
The first thing you want to reach is sterilization because

1027
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,976
Look up the CPD markets are appearing more cats or or food market

1028
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,608
We haven't reached their ization at my scale with serialization come

1029
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:38,400
Large number

1030
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:41,728
When you're at the genetic level

1031
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:43,008
Did you pick up a product

1032
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,288
CBD products

1033
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:46,592
You have an identification of this product

1034
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:49,152
It's usually taking the phone with the 1D barcode

1035
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:50,944
UPC or Ean

1036
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,784
Kittens as their cold today

1037
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,344
Do you have in your hand

1038
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,880
The salad

1039
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:01,440
Identify the class of product

1040
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:02,720
Sol de Janeiro

1041
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:04,000
Identifiers

1042
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:05,280
Civilization

1043
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:08,608
To be able to identify dicm you have in your hands

1044
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:12,960
Each item has a different number has a different address

1045
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:18,080
Because it enables a large number of before

1046
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:21,152
We're talking

1047
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:24,480
Trillium

1048
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,272
Yeah

1049
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:28,320
To reach 1 trillion

1050
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:31,392
Slightly ambitious goal is to reach 1 trillion

1051
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:39,072
Depends who you ask why did you have to CT or tomorrow

1052
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:45,728
The CTO would like to reach it as soon as possible but I also know that one trillion date

1053
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:46,496
The point is this

1054
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:47,776
Is a very very hard

1055
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:51,104
Manage and I also know it's not going to happen overnight

1056
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:55,967
This could be possible

1057
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,087
Exactly

1058
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:01,855
Okay

1059
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:03,135
Look at that

1060
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:06,975
Cuz I am curious what kind of technology and what kind of resources you're going to need

1061
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:08,255
Support battalion

1062
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:10,047
But in the meantime

1063
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:11,071
Let's go back

1064
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:12,863
How this works oh no

1065
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:18,239
How does that work

1066
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:21,823
Put the tag on

1067
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,359
Packaging to it is

1068
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:24,895
Coming out of the store

1069
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:37,183
No seriously she is not entirely new you during your has mass Concerta sational on expensive items

1070
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:44,607
Swiss watches are certain dictionary items had certification for a 4-1 ready and I think a break

1071
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:45,887
Two in the past few years

1072
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:48,703
Ization truly accessible

1073
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:51,519
Two-way Biden

1074
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:58,175
So what to do with everything is that every item gets a URL you need your else know what that means is that true

1075
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:05,087
You can interact with the API of this thing so every single thing religious an API

1076
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:08,415
Applications much more easy

1077
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:10,207
This identity was not

1078
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:12,255
Also means that we can

1079
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:14,559
Put this web identity into

1080
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:16,351
Tags or data carriers

1081
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:22,239
You can put this identity

1082
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:23,263
Very easy

1083
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:25,567
QR codes are NFC tags

1084
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:32,223
Which allow consumers to scan them very very easy

1085
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:37,599
Same thing with your culture

1086
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:38,623
IOS camera

1087
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:41,695
Charcoals with your ass out of the box

1088
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:43,487
So just by changing this

1089
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:46,303
Identigene to sterilize identity

1090
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:52,959
API integration

1091
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:57,567
From Beyond the supply chain

1092
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:02,431
All right so let's talk about what that means

1093
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:04,479
I think you have one with a

1094
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:10,879
Yeah that's at the princess in one week

1095
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:12,159
Leaders India

1096
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:16,511
And they have

1097
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:22,911
Cruising demand from consumers

1098
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:25,727
Just like fresh food into

1099
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:28,543
Is really under pressure from consumers

1100
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:32,639
To provide full transparency so

1101
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:33,919
Star Trek

1102
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:36,479
Daisy being able to identify

1103
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:38,271
Solomon

1104
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:39,807
Kiss at The Bachelor

1105
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:41,855
And to provide information

1106
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:44,927
The consumers in a way that's really fairly accessible

1107
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:47,487
So that they can read you know where the silo

1108
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:48,255
Comes from

1109
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:50,047
Teach anywhere

1110
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:52,863
Was first put in water

1111
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:55,679
When does Siloam was moved from the river

1112
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:59,007
When the song was harvested

1113
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:02,335
Exactly which way the silent hiding in the Junior

1114
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:05,919
To the store so you can learn alot about it

1115
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:20,255
Do consumers actually scan their items

1116
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:26,399
I don't know if I'm going to scan every single item

1117
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:27,423
That's what

1118
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:29,215
Trying to figure out what the consumer

1119
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:32,031
Into

1120
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:33,567
How can this help Beyond

1121
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:37,407
Yes I'm in your urine marking

1122
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:42,527
Is there any interesting cuz I would tend to rewrite I'm not going to go to the store and scan every single item

1123
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:46,367
I think I'm certain items We Care a lot more than others

1124
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:47,391
Princes

1125

Fresh food spacer

1126
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:53,791
Just kidding. Seafood space where much more inclined to

1127
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:55,583
You want to know what we're eating

1128
00:45:56,095 --> 00:46:02,239
There are several studies that that show that people are

1129
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:04,543
Honda brands

1130
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:10,431
Lodi public staff that was

1131
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:15,807
The customers would switch to a brand that is more transparent

1132
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:17,087
Then another brand

1133
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:22,719
Story story but it's a big party

1134
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:28,351
I don't think we would

1135
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:30,911
Ashley

1136
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:32,703
Can of Coke for incense

1137
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:33,727
However

1138
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:34,495
Kolkata

1139
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:36,031
Is one of our customers in

1140
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:43,967
News can you would be surprised

1141
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:45,247
Cruising

1142
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:46,783
In Europe in the US

1143
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:48,063
Nathan Marcus

1144
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:49,855
Sorry you very very present

1145
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:54,975
Every transaction Millet days on a mobile phone goes through a door key or code

1146
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:58,047
You should also now changing the US in Europe

1147
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:00,095
Beyond marketing

1148
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:03,423
I feel like it would be really interesting

1149
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:05,727
Lettuce for example

1150
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:14,175
So that seems like a place where we might see something like this have benefits outside of

1151
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:16,223
Gamification War chest

1152
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:18,783
Making me feel good about where my stuff came from

1153
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:20,063
Absolutely

1154
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:21,343
SKS

1155
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:24,671
Bacterial rash

1156
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:29,791
The same kind of problem setting these food safety

1157
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:33,631
Food recalls field marketing are are great examples

1158
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:37,215
Today when we were a food out the trash

1159
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:49,247
Much more effective

1160
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:51,295
Ic1 brands we worked with

1161
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:54,367
Angry calls and icons mentioned their names.

1162
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:56,415
Stop that was saying

1163
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:00,255
Before

1164
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:04,351
Truservice ation and to the use of online services you like everything

1165
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:06,399
So that's that's one thing

1166
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:08,703
Safety in Germany products safety

1167
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:11,519
I think it was a lot of internal use cases

1168
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:14,335
Luxury items

1169
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:16,383
Luxury brands have

1170
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:17,919
3 big problems

1171
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:19,455
Two big ones are

1172
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:20,479
Counterfeit

1173
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:26,367
The concert is I think we all know damn those are the items that are being copied by

1174
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:30,719
Play sakhi sterilizing the products and

1175
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:31,743
Tracing

1176
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:32,767
Food near life

1177
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:33,535
Psycho

1178
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:36,351
3D helps fighting counterfeit products

1179
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:37,375
Bactrim

1180
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:40,191
Are Goods that are actually

1181
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:41,471
But produced

1182
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:46,079
Illegally in the Factories at the luxury brand store or employee

1183
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:48,383
Usually at night

1184
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:56,063
So having a unique identity web-enabled

1185
00:48:58,111 --> 00:49:00,415
And let's go back to that the broader Trend here

1186
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:02,207
So take me to the world

1187
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:03,487
Where I have

1188
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:08,095
Every single items

1189
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:10,399
Sweaters

1190
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:11,167
Can of soup

1191
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:12,191
What is this mean

1192
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:17,311
Krumdieck tissue level is means

1193
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:19,615
You'll be able to see me

1194
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:23,711
They appear

1195
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:25,759
Here and there usually with

1196
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:27,039
Message apps

1197
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:28,319
Teaching two steps

1198
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:30,111
Where is here you be able

1199
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:34,975
How to trace them much more accurately to know where they are to know who is

1200
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:36,255
Using products

1201
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:37,279
And also

1202
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:45,215
I think obviously we need to

1203
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:48,543
Interaction mechanism

1204
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:52,383
I don't think you when I would like the world where we have to scan

1205
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:54,175
Every single item we buy

1206
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:02,623
Cpg

1207
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:07,743
I think we will see some very interesting evolutions

1208
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:12,863
Is that you see with Frontier between

1209
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:14,911
Uni connect

1210
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:15,679
Products

1211
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:20,031
Erasing step-by-step you have today things like printed Electronics

1212
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:21,823
Prince

1213
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:23,103
NFC tags

1214
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:24,127
Scale

1215
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:25,407
Slayer Inc

1216
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:27,455
You can actually in bed

1217
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:31,295
These layers of things into a product label

1218
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:32,575
Becomes an NFC tag

1219
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:35,391
You also have things like that tree free Bluetooth

1220
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:41,535
Partner we work with you capable of doing see my printed battery

1221
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:43,839
Stag's head very low cost

1222
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:47,167
So you can read Emagine today luxury products having

1223
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:50,239
Tomorrow probably

1224
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:52,031
Different kind of CPU processor

1225
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:58,175
So I actually have

1226
00:50:58,431 --> 00:51:01,503
And I don't know

1227
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:02,783
It's pretty awesome

1228
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:07,647
Right now the world seems to be very focused on

1229
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:12,767
Market to me

1230
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:13,791
It doesn't

1231
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:16,095
If I had a Bluetooth

1232
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:18,143
I would want it to be

1233
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:19,935
Let me know if

1234
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:28,383
At best go to website but usually it's asking me to download

1235
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:29,151
Apps

1236
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:30,943
Marketing

1237
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:33,247
And to me this just seems like

1238
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:34,527
Colossal waste

1239
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:36,319
Really good Technologies

1240
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:41,183
Curious if we just have to get through this marketing first step

1241
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:48,095
I totally agree with you and I think this is the first step in the water capable

1242
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:52,959
Quitting today in disguising his printed Electronics tax or identities

1243
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:58,591
Interaction between

1244
00:51:58,847 --> 00:51:59,359
Fencing

1245
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:00,639
Yep

1246
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:03,455
Coming very quickly when we can do that

1247
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:06,783
I think you've become a lot more compelling

1248
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:08,063
Consumer standpoint

1249
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:11,903
Imagine when you were with your hands

1250
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:15,487
Temperature Wisconsin

1251
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:18,047
Alerting you when when you're actually walking

1252
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:22,655
For too long in the polluted area

1253
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:24,703
That's far away anymore ice

1254
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:28,543
Racino printed Electronics combined with

1255
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:30,079
I was sensing

1256
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:31,871
Rosie battery-free

1257
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:40,063
Consumer standpoint is largely marketing

1258
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:41,343
Provenance

1259
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:44,159
Critical condition

1260
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:47,231
I think tomorrow is much more exciting YouTube

1261
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:50,559
What is my thing have this type of identity

1262
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:52,351
I wonder about

1263
00:52:54,399 --> 00:52:55,935
Is there a point

1264
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:59,007
Which we should be communicating with people who buy this stuff

1265
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:02,335
There's information that can be cleaned

1266
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:04,895
Possibly about them or from them from

1267
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:06,175
Everyday products

1268
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:10,015
I think we'll have to explain that there is a active

1269
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:11,295
Tagging deer

1270
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:15,135
Semi-active tags

1271
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:20,511
Explain that only for from an interaction standpoint

1272
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:25,119
If it's not the visual tag then how do you know where you can interact with your with your back

1273
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:26,655
And I think Dan yes

1274
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:33,055
Define a language to be able to explain to Consumers the type of information that

1275
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:35,103
Deer items are gathering

1276
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:36,383
Russian golden mask

1277
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:38,175
Challenge

1278
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:43,039
Make it accessible truly developing language that people can understand

1279
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:47,647
No cost to their privacy versus benefits

1280
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:51,743
For that to happen we really need to understand

1281
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:55,327
Sort of answered a lot of the questions I have around

1282
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:57,631
This big macro question which is

1283
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:04,287
A trillion sensors

1284
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:07,359
What are some of the things we need to think about

1285
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:09,919
1D sing that I

1286
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:11,967
Promoted throughout my career is

1287
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:18,367
How to connect these things into decreasing networks things that are happening

1288
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:19,135
Intranet

1289
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:22,719
I'm dedicating my research career

1290
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:25,023
Might my business

1291
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:29,375
Ensuring that is not the case and that things are really connected to the internet

1292
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:31,423
Things are really connected to the web

1293
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:38,079
As if we want things to happen at large-scale this is what needs to happen we don't we shouldn't think of coyotes

1294
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:38,847
Cynthia's

1295
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:40,127
One phone

1296
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:41,663
1iota

1297
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:43,455
We really have to sync up

1298
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:47,039
Interconnecting two different things over the internet in order to web

1299
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:49,087
More down-to-earth Sweeney

1300
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:51,903
Technology sweet rolls in particular

1301
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:53,183
If we consider

1302
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:55,487
Banks that don't have access to

1303
00:54:55,743 --> 00:54:57,279
Normal source of power

1304
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:00,863
Battery free technology

1305
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:03,679
Harvesting energy

1306
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:09,823
Completely unprecedented

1307
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:11,103
Just one trillion

1308
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:16,479
Unique something already very very hard to handle for a database

1309
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:17,503
Yet alone

1310
