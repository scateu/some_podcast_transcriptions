1
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:12,544
Later on the show we talked about Phillips and a decision it made two

2
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,848
Take away some of the functionality

3
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:19,200
Its hub had that enabled it to work with some 3rd party lights

4
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:20,736
Well

5
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:24,832
Since the show was recorded Phillips actually reverse the decision that it made

6
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:28,672
It has recently upgraded the software so Philips Hue Lights

7
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:30,720
Didn't work with 3rd party lights

8
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:32,768
When we did the show

9
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,840
That still remain the case but on Wednesday

10
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:38,400
It actually reversed that

11
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:40,704
Because so many of its customers complained

12
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:43,264
So what is going to do

13
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:44,544
It's going to

14
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:51,200
Reverse the software upgrade so lights from other brands will continue to work as they did before with the Philips Hue system

15
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:52,480
So

16
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:58,880
In a statement the Phillips provided to me it says they will work on the reversal at the upgrade and they will shortly confirm when it will be available

17
00:00:59,392 --> 00:00:59,904
So

18
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:02,720
When you guys here Kevin and I talked about this

19
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:03,744
Know that

20
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:05,280
While our discussion

21
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:06,816
Is still relevant

22
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:09,632
Phillips has decided that it will not

23
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:10,656
Kill off

24
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:11,424
Third party

25
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,192
Functionality

26
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:15,008
Hey everyone welcome back to the iot

27
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:15,776
Play podcast

28
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:17,824
This week we've got a great show for you

29
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,848
I am your host

30
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:21,408
Stacey Higginbotham and Azure co-host

31
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,432
Kevin tofel

32
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:24,480
So we're here to talk about

33
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:26,272
Canoes for hue

34
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:28,576
Great news from IBM and

35
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:29,344
And Watson

36
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:30,368
Cabins

37
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:31,648
Crazy do

38
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:33,952
I will call it mining operation and

39
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:35,488
In his office

40
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:37,024
And updates

41
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,840
And our guest is

42
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:41,120
Going to talk about

43
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:43,424
The connected kitchen and also

44
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,960
What to do

45
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:48,800
Decommissioning a connected device when your company gets sold

46
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:49,824
Sam

47
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:51,360
Exciting times

48
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:53,664
Alright so let's start with

49
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,968
What everyone's talking about this week which is

50
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,504
The hue

51
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:58,784
The hughleys

52
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:04,672
It's funny they have a new program a new certification program called friends with you and right now

53
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:07,232
I don't think anybody wants to be friends with you

54
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:10,048
They're cutting support for 3rd party bulbs

55
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:11,840
Yeah it is

56
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:14,656
It's brutal out there for a third party light bulb

57
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:16,704
Hand for a customer review

58
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,056
We first started getting reports of this when people were updating their Hue Lights

59
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:21,824
End

60
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,224
All the sudden there Cree there Ostrom there GE link bulbs

61
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,064
He had previously worked under the hue

62
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:33,600
Hug

63
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,672
We're certified under the zigbee light Link profile

64
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:38,208
Just suddenly stopped working

65
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:41,024
So if you weren't a hue light bulb you no longer worked with you

66
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:45,632
So just to be clear for people if they did not yet update

67
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:49,984
They're Philips Hue operating software to version 1.11 I know you can

68
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,520
Check that in the app

69
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:55,104
Man they still have the 3rd party compatibility

70
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,640
Mine still work

71
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,664
And I have not done the

72
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,456
There you go so

73
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:01,760
Word to the wise if you don't want to lose this

74
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:02,784
Boys for now

75
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,576
Maybe I love

76
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:05,344
You know

77
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,672
Maybe now it could be that he does a forced update

78
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:09,440
At some point in time

79
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:10,464
True

80
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,232
True

81
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:17,632
Let's talk about what's going on here because I'm very much open platform kind of guy so the fact that

82
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:21,216
The Hue Bridge already work with zigbee wireless particles was was

83
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:21,984
Plus

84
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,544
Is that not pretty standard that particle

85
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,080
It is it is

86
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:32,224
Okay I mean I think I know the answer I'm trying to give you the

87
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,528
Benefit of the doubt here by playing a little dumb

88
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,624
So basically they're they're closing things down a little bit more well okay

89
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,392
So here's that

90
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:42,208
It snows it be is a it's a radio

91
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,512
Now leichtling is actually a

92
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:48,608
Profile so that's software that runs on top of zigbee that zigbee assertive

93
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,752
Now zigbee is you guys may remember is kind of in a little bit of turmoil because of the up-and-coming

94
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:55,520
Red

95
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:58,336
All comes back to thread and we Haven

96
00:03:58,848 --> 00:03:59,872
So with

97
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:03,200
Thread which is the nest Samsung

98
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,992
Freescale

99
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,784
Silicon labs

100
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,808
Kind of a couple other

101
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:08,576
Companies

102
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,136
And let's let's go see is Philip Sousa Porter of

103
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:13,184
Because that may answer some

104
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:17,791
Some of what may be coming out here may just be kind of some

105
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:24,191
Protocol confusion as they're trying to move to kind of support more modern standards like thread

106
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,983
It's it's kind of unclear like

107
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:26,751
What

108
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:27,519
Is happening here

109
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,567
Yeah and just as you were

110
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:32,895
Talking about this I looked up on thread group chat Oregon Phillips is a can

111
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:34,431
Contributing member to

112
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,199
The threat group

113
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,223
So maybe that

114
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,063
Maybe

115
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:40,831
It just

116
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:44,159
And even if it is happening and I'm okay with that but it's B

117
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:49,023
The manner that it's happening it's just pretty much somebody flipping a switch here in a software update

118
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,071
I don't think this was very well communicate

119
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,095
Headed to the users

120
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,375
It may not have

121
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:56,447
In-N-Out Phillips has always said though that

122
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:59,263
The support for these other

123
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,031
Bulbs

124
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:00,799
His

125
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,079
Always been

126
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,103
Kind of

127
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,639
Just support for this

128
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,407
Profile

129
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,223
So they have never been proactively

130
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:11,551
Testing or doing anything with these bulbs in

131
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,855
In their conversation with Cena

132
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:16,671
About this change what has happened is

133
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:19,743
Customers have been coming to them when these

134
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:23,839
Light bulbs have had issues or problems and it sounds like Phillips is like

135
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:29,215
This is become kind of a pain people are coming to us about bulbs not working

136
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:31,007
And we don't know what to do with it

137
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:36,383
And I get it and in fact they are actually going to deal with it because they do have this new friends of hue program

138
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,151
Wish hope

139
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,687
Let them certified

140
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:45,087
Designee bulbs bulbs that are no longer working after the software update may actually work in the future

141
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,135
If they go through the friends of hue program

142
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:51,231
And yes and so the question then becomes will Bosch how hard is it to

143
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,255
Become

144
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:54,559
You know interoperable with the friends of hue program

145
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:57,119
This is where

146
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,167
Something like

147
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:01,215
Alljoyn or

148
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:02,239
Some

149
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:08,127
Sort of real interoperable HTTP style standard for The Internet of Things

150
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,407
Would be

151
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,431
Freaking

152
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:11,455
Amazing

153
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:13,247
Because what is happen

154
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:19,391
Is instead of some sort of universal again HTTP is a wonderful example

155
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,207
Some sort of universal

156
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:23,487
Standard

157
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:25,791
We have interoperability

158
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:26,815
Programs

159
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:27,839
And

160
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:28,607
That means

161
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:31,679
Everybody has to work that much harder

162
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,471
To get things to work together

163
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,751
And it's kind of pain

164
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,031
For the consumer

165
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,567
For the startups for

166
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:40,895
For the big companies that have to set up these programs and then certified

167
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:41,919
Test everything

168
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,711
It's just really frustrating

169
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:46,015
Cuz I think about how cool it could be if

170
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:49,855
Your light bulbs just kind of talk to each other because you inserted like

171
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,647
One or two lines of code that said

172
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:52,415
Hey

173
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:54,719
Here's the code that says I'm a light bulb

174
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:56,255
We already work this out

175
00:06:56,511 --> 00:07:02,143
And you know what I'm going to go back on Sunday cuz I gave incorrect information as I look something over here now that's on my screen

176
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:03,935
Apparently

177
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:04,959
Your light bulbs

178
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:06,495
If they're already added

179
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:08,287
Prior to the software update built

180
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,311
Continue to work

181
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,871
There may be problems but they will continue to work

182
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:17,759
The issue here or what would fill up the saying is they're stopping users from adding new third-party bulbs to setups

183
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:23,391
Oh so that's not as bad as originally thought which is a good thing

184
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:26,207
Seeing either Kevin or I have actually changed

185
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:29,279
Neither of us have updated because we're both like

186
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:33,887
We both have 3rd party light bulbs as part of our systems we don't want to break our home

187
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,167
Yeah

188
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:41,567
So now I don't feel so bad and it what I said about not getting a software update obviously it's a personal choice you guys on your device is not me but

189
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:43,103
Now I don't feel like

190
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:45,151
I need to hold off on that update

191
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,199
Will you let us know how it turns

192
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:53,343
What you know I don't have no plans to add any new third-party bulbs currently that could change in a week but

193
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,903
For now I'm comfortable saying yeah I'm okay with this now

194
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:59,743
See I kind of feel bad about this because I'm still waiting for my

195
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,023
White dimmer

196
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,047
BR30

197
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,583
From anyone

198
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:04,863
Except for you

199
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:06,911
Sex

200
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:07,935
Okay

201
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:08,959
So that the work

202
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:09,983
I can tell you that

203
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,287
I don't actually think you has the white

204
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,311
BR30

205
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:16,639
Don't know have not shot for any in awhile

206
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:18,175
No they don't they don't have

207
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,199
The white Bea Arthur

208
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:19,967
That was my

209
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:26,623
The only thing which case you need a third-party I need a third-party cuz all they have the $60 color

210
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:27,903
Send

211
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,439
So expensive

212
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:32,511
It is well don't update your tub

213
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:36,095
Well I was going to say I'm still not updating my light bulbs

214
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:36,863
I'm very sad about

215
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,911
Okay

216
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:41,727
So that is the Hue situation

217
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:45,823
That is Stacy's rant on interoperability for the day

218
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,359
Maybe we'll come back

219
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:48,383
Who knows

220
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,407
So

221
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:52,479
Little bit more we're going to move to some Enterprise news

222
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:53,759
IBM

223
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,295
Xi'an Tuesday

224
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:56,575
Igloo

225
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:57,855
Big blue

226
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:02,719
We don't talk a lot about Enterprise but it's a big deal in IBM

227
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:07,071
Back in March announced a 3 billion dollar iot initiative

228
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:13,471
And in September they appointed a woman named Harriet green to be the general manager of their internet-of-things practice

229
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:16,543
She's actually also the general manager at their education practice

230
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:17,823
I know random

231
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:20,127
I asked her about it and she's like yeah basically stuck

232
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,151
Kind of new business

233
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,431
Stuff that's me

234
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:23,967
Education iot

235
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:24,991
Sure

236
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,039
I spoke with her

237
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:27,807
Last week

238
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,343
And we talked about

239
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:32,671
IBM's initiatives in iot couple things worth mentioning

240
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:37,023
The announcement this week was about IBM throwing Watson at iot

241
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,351
Ye Ye Big Data Big Data

242
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,631
Intelligent learning

243
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:42,911
Intelligent learning

244
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,959
Use machine learning

245
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,751
I think I can just come

246
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,031
So Watson

247
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,055
You may know him

248
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,079
As hey

249
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:52,895
Computer that plays Jeopardy +

250
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:55,455
You actually play Jeopardy against Watson once

251
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,735
I did I lost

252
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,271
Well most people do

253
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:01,855
Interesting

254
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:06,719
I don't know if Peregrine told us or somebody else at IBM but I'm looking at your story now and I'm

255
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:09,791
Just flabbergasted about the amount of data

256
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:12,351
That they say connected devices are generating

257
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,655
Oh yeah it's a big number what was that number

258
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:15,679
Well

259
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:16,959
I'm going to Restasis

260
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:23,359
What are the square and given that IBM says there more than 9 billion connection devices operate today and those devices

261
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:29,759
Will generate 2.5 quintillion bytes of new data every day or the next 15

262
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,831
That's a lot of data

263
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,367
Angela Watson

264
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,647
Exactly and

265
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,183
Through

266
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:42,047
They say that most of that day. I think 90% of it is unstructured so it's in the form of

267
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:45,375
Words and structure tax social media things that

268
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,423
Normal computers can't read

269
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:48,959
Did you fight Watson

270
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,495
Watson is literate Bealls

271
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,031
It can take in that data

272
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:52,799
In processing

273
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:57,663
I don't mean to cut you off that's really interesting to me because I think of how much

274
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:02,783
Structured data like that we work with on a daily basis as writers and consumers and so on

275
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,855
I'm surprised that there's been no standardization

276
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:11,743
For this data maybe pick up the breadth of devices and that type of data but you know why can't they use XML or

277
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,791
Where are Json or something

278
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:16,351
Trinetx the data structure

279
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,887
Have you seen like

280
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:20,191
That will this is things like doctor's note

281
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,471
Consider just scanned in

282
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:27,359
Right right yeah it's it's such a range of data I mean a light bulbs going to generate different bigger than a doctor

283
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:33,247
Is Kendall Jenner a different data than my Raspberry Pi and sunset where I get it I get it sorry diverse

284
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,295
It's just an interesting problem

285
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:38,367
And it's important to know that when you're dealing with IBM

286
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,903
IBM's Best Inn

287
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,695
Biggest hammer in their toolbox

288
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,463
Is Watson

289
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,487
So

290
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:44,767
When you have Watson

291
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:45,791
Every

292
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:51,679
Have you read your stinking structure problem looks like a nail that Watts

293
00:11:54,495 --> 00:12:00,639
There are some really cool things so what they've done is they have on top of IBM has a product called the iot

294
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,663
Foundation cloud

295
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:04,991
Which is their Cloud for The Internet of Things they've got

296
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:08,063
It's basically if you want to build a connected product they've got

297
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:10,367
I'm a partnership with arm

298
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,647
And so

299
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:14,207
Certain arm-based chips

300
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:18,303
Will send their data automatically up to IBM's Cloud if you want to

301
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,839
Appropriate code

302
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:22,655
It doesn't automatically happen if you write the code

303
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:25,983
And then you can start sending your data up there where it's at

304
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,287
Organized and Cooling

305
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,079
Infinitely scalable

306
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,103
And

307
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:33,919
Now you have access to it basically like a

308
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:36,991
For API calls for Watson services

309
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,015
It's in those are

310
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:40,831
Add API for voice recognition so

311
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:43,647
And a Predictive Analytics service

312
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:47,743
A video and image recognition service and a textual analysis

313
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:50,559
That's actually really cool so like

314
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:53,375
You know about the unstructured data

315
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,655
You got access to that

316
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,423
If.

317
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:58,239
Voice recognition natural language processing service

318
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:02,079
The Predictive Analytics that GE always talks about that's in there too

319
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:06,943
And then the video and image recognition kind of stuff that you know Facebook and Google all talk about

320
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:11,807
Actually use in their products you can actually get access to some of that from Watson

321
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,343
In IBM's iot

322
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:16,927
So those are the big things that IBM launch today

323
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,719
And it's actually pretty sweet

324
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,767
And today by today I mean this week

325
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,607
Cuz today happens to be Tuesday the recording this but you will not hear it until 3

326
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:28,959
Gobots

327
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:32,287
Show the one other notable thing for you guys out there

328
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:35,103
Is IBM's taking a very vertical strategy

329
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:40,991
With the internet of things as opposed to kind of what I think of is a horizontal strategy that the Silicon Valley

330
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,015
Folks are taking

331
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:45,343
And that is worth noting because

332
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:47,903
It seems to be very bifurcated based on

333
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:50,975
Where you're coming from so a lot of the old school Industries

334
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,535
Like Cisco GE IBM they're like

335
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,815
Cricket at this like

336
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:56,607
Here's my solution

337
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:57,887
I even sat Solutions

338
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:00,191
Like I'm some sort of corporate

339
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:03,007
But here is a set of products for the retail industry

340
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:03,775
Here's some for the

341
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,823
Automotive industry

342
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:07,615
Aerospace

343
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,199
Where is a lot of the start of some companies I talk to

344
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,735
Cancel is Bali there like

345
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:17,855
You know what here's a sensor platform you guys do with it what you will so I'm really interested to see how that

346
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:18,879
Pans out because

347
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,415
They're very different

348
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:23,231
Ways of looking at kind of the Industrial iot

349
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,303
Throwing that out there you guys

350
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:27,839
Shall we take it back

351
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:28,607
2

352
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,167
Sure

353
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,191
All right

354
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:34,751
You want to talk about what we should do a quick messed up

355
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:37,055
The last we talked about my Nest trying to

356
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:37,823
To laugh roast

357
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:41,663
At 4 a.m. when the garage door open even though it didn't

358
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,431
Right

359
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:46,271
Dennis told me at the time that it was my MyQ that was doing

360
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:47,551
Well

361
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,087
We turn off the MyQ

362
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,367
And it didn't stop

363
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,415
I called Napa

364
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,183
I know

365
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,719
We're like no we call that one

366
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,487
We did

367
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:56,511
So

368
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:59,327
Ness was like oh you know what we read the logs wrong

369
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,607
We think it's your job

370
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:04,959
A Jawbone

371
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,239
So

372
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:10,335
I did set up my Jawbone to work with my Nest but I have a jaw bone

373
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:13,919
It's the Jawbone move it it's the El Cheapo Jawbone as I like to

374
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:15,199
To think of it

375
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,479
Because I lose them

376
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:19,807
I've lost every Fitness monitor no matter how fancy it is

377
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:20,575
And so

378
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,855
50 bucks

379
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:22,623
So

380
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:25,951
I connected it but when I was connecting and I realized this

381
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:30,815
One actually doesn't talk to my house because it doesn't have what it needs to do to actually connect

382
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:34,143
With my house it only works on the up to and Beyond

383
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,423
So

384
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,215
This one doesn't talk to my house

385
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:41,823
If it was connected and so that's what they said was causing the problem so I disconnected that

386
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,871
And it hasn't tried to roast

387
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:44,639
Xiaomi since

388
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,199
I don't know if that was

389
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:47,967
The problem

390
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:49,247
I can't really

391
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:52,575
Say with much confidence because we actually had a heat wave in Austin

392
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:54,623
And I ended up turning my air conditioning back on

393
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,159
Gotcha so

394
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,439
We're going to stay tuned

395
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:59,231
I'm not sure if the problem is solved

396
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:00,255
Maybe

397
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:01,279
Maybe.

398
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:05,119
I'd still be surprised if that's what it was but okay let's see what happens

399
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,399
So there is the

400
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,703
Yes I do or maybe not on

401
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,799
So that's the update there so Kevin

402
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,079
You want to talk about your

403
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,359
Your latest purchase

404
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:18,943
Yeah, it was a waste of money I'll say that right up front but

405
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,479
I learned so much

406
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:22,783
Never waste of money to learn

407
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:29,695
Don't know I agree I agree and when we were talking before the show you know I kept thinking I have to justify this purchase to you because it believed

408
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:30,975
Doesn't a lot of

409
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:34,303
Value for the cost and talking about a $35

410
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:38,399
USB Asic or application specific integrated circuit

411
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:40,703
I'm using the solar USB dongle

412
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,287
In a Raspberry Pi for very low energy Bitcoin mining

413
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:46,079
Right of the bat

414
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:49,919
I'm not going to get rich I've been doing this for three days and I barely heard a penny

415
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:50,687
Okay

416
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,455
But

417
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:53,759
And this is where I get into the hotel location bit

418
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:54,783
I had to learn

419
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:58,623
Didn't have to I enjoyed learning so much about how Bitcoin works

420
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,415
How do you say

421
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:01,951
Specific

422
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:03,743
Pieces of Hardware actually work

423
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:06,815
I have never ever surprisingly never built

424
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:11,679
An application from source code in Linux and I got to do that so that was cool

425
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:17,055
And I'm just having so much fun looking at the little grass so this thing turning out hashes for Bitcoin

426
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,615
It's actually got me interested in buying

427
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:22,175
More robust hardware for Bitcoin mining

428
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:26,015
And the big advantage of that I have over many other people that do this

429
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:30,623
I don't pay for electricity because I've got 41 solar panels on the roof for the house so

430
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:31,647
Most

431
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:34,463
Months of the year we have no bill actually

432
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:36,767
Over producing in Wipro

433
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:40,863
Balance of power hurdle up a bank account of power in with our electric pump

434
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:45,215
That's the big thing is Bitcoin mining people I got to pay for electricity

435
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:47,263
I don't have to say I think I might actually

436
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,799
Take us away further

437
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,079
If you're going to do that

438
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,103
I don't recommend

439
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,895
Doing it on Raspberry Pi with

440
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,687
I bought the Avalon

441
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,479
Nano USB

442
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:59,807
Asic for this again $35 that cost me

443
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:03,647
It was a lot of fun it was challenging to I'm just getting the

444
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:06,207
The pie to recognize the USB port

445
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:08,255
For some reason was was a struggle that

446
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:11,839
You don't have to couple hours at anchor and I had a lot of fun doing it and I learned a lot

447
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:14,143
All right and so

448
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,167
We're talkin

449
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,495
Is it is it the $20 pie the $35 pie

450
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:24,127
I've had it for a while so I don't think the $35 one is probably one step down

451
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:29,247
The beauty is the pie can actually still be used as a regular pie was going on because

452
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:31,551
All of the processing for Bitcoin

453
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:32,319
Mining

454
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:34,879
Is offload to this USB dongle

455
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:37,951
It's to the point now where Bitcoin mining is so

456
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:38,975
Challenging

457
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:40,767
Intensive about Computing process

458
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:44,607
Irregular CPU or even most gpus it be a waste

459
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:48,191
She have to buy these very specific Bitcoin mining pieces

460
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:49,727
Is hard work I do at this point

461
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:50,751
So

462
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:52,543
Soledad is also did say

463
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,567
Did the pie

464
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:55,871
Utilization of the CP on the pies like 1%

465
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:56,895
I'm doing all this

466
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,711
I was going to say so I can't like offload

467
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,759
Sekrit like a city from my home

468
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,807
Call the computers in my home network

469
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:10,207
It's somebody it's funny you say that because I was doing crunches numbers for Saturday while I still can on another computer and

470
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,487
And before that

471
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:14,047
And I got to thinking why isn't anybody built

472
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:15,071
Those typos

473
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,351
Number crunching

474
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:18,655
Bits for for specific Hardware

475
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:22,239
You know it's probably just too expensive like a study program to do that but

476
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:26,335
It would be really interesting because they're so they're very application-specific

477
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:28,895
No you can't like uses for seti or something like that

478
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:32,223
It doesn't know how to do that

479
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:34,015
Candy with one thing and one thing on it

480
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:38,111
The funny thing

481
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,647
Lake Mead

482
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:40,927
4 senses

483
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:42,975
Month for $35

484
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,303
Yeah

485
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,351
Why can several years that thing

486
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,119
Payforit

487
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,423
Yeah sure

488
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,727
And and you wrap the ice pack around it

489
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:54,751
FeFe

490
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:55,519
Don't go

491
00:19:56,287 --> 00:20:00,895
All right well I sent you a picture of an ice pack extra that was my heatsink yes

492
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:03,711
I got to figure something out getting hot

493
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,247
Like I'm being sued that

494
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,551
Picture in the show notes Here

495
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:08,575
Just for fun

496
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:16,255
Yes that they're doing mining bitcoins on a Raspberry Pi door for pennies per month and we're using an ice pack

497
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:17,535
Turn the freezer as a heat sink

498
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:20,351
Adjust. It does not get any better than that

499
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:21,631
Nice

500
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:23,935
The talent this is how we're paying for the pike

501
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:25,983
All right

502
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:28,543
Let's see also this week we had some

503
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:29,567
Some sad news

504
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:31,103
Happy news I don't know what to call

505
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:32,127
I will call it in

506
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:32,895
Determinate news

507
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:36,991
The orange Chef Co which made I don't know if you remember this Kevin but

508
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,271
We got all excited about it

509
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:40,319
The prep pad was

510
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,599
Connected scale

511
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:43,391
You may have actually purchased one

512
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:49,535
I have the drop scale kind of

513
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,839
It's slightly different market segments but

514
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:56,703
The prep had was $150 scale it was connected sold at Williams-Sonoma

515
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:58,495
And another retailers

516
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,311
And it you know when you wave stuff

517
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:05,407
When you put stuff on the scale it would weigh the ingredients you would tell

518
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,479
App what it was and it would

519
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:12,063
Tell you the nutritional information in what you are making

520
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,855
And I thought it was a great idea

521
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:16,159
30000 people bought it but it wasn't enough

522
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:18,464
And so last week

523
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,024
The orange Chef Co sold to yummly

524
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,608
Front undisclosed amount 60% of the staff went to

525
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:26,144
Yummly which is a recipe app

526
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:27,424
So our guest

527
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,728
Up next is Santiago Maria

528
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:33,568
Who is now the chief Revenue officer at yummly and he's going to talk about

529
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:34,592
What comes next

530
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:35,616
4

531
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:38,432
Gimli after it has acquired this company

532
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:41,760
And he's going to talk about kind of the lessons he learned building

533
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:44,832
A hardware device that ultimately didn't succeed

534
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:47,648
Why it's important to kind of

535
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,952
Create and build a device

536
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,256
For iot with failure in mind

537
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:54,560
It's

538
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:59,936
It is I feel good topic but it's actually really important one in in Santiago is great

539
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:03,776
Ensuring Lessons Learned so stay tuned

540
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:14,528
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast did I have as our guest

541
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:15,808
Santiago mobile

542
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,392
Who is the chief Revenue officer now at Jung Lee

543
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:20,928
Santiago

544
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:22,464
Welcome back to the show

545
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:27,840
And since the last time we talked you have had a title change in a company change

546
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,120
Oh my goodness

547
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:29,888
What happened

548
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:33,472

00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:13,568
Brings to the table in Sons of Anarchy

741
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:19,200
A sample that is very very

742
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:21,248
It's a consonant generating

743
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,040
EmazingLights

744
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:24,064
Food data

745
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:24,832
Site

746
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:30,720
Only Starlight you know looking at information as a whole

747
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:37,376
Trends looking at trends of a people are eating what kind of food you like abortions combined with what

748
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:39,936
Amazing Frog

749
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:42,240
So someone that has a

750
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:45,056
An interest in understanding these trends

751
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:48,128
Might be able to keep the experience alive

752
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:49,920
Just2good

753
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,480
Trident 3 Tucson

754
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:55,552
Sheetrock screws

755
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:58,112
I think there's a couple kind of interesting things

756
00:32:58,624 --> 00:32:59,392
In

757
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:00,416
About

758
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:02,720
What you guys have just gone through

759
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,328
Then you actually managed to sell your company which is

760
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:08,096
Great

761
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:09,376
MCU

762
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:13,472
Men should take 60% of your Workforce you're still supporting your product

763
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:19,616
In many cases what has happened here is probably not the ideal scenario that you were hoping for it going

764
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:22,432
And I think

765
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,736
In in Silicon Valley there's this

766
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:26,528
This kind of fail fast kind of

767
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:27,552
Ethos end

768
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,136
I think with software that's really great but with

769
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:32,416
Connected products

770
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:36,512
In kind of the internet of things that may not be the right mentality

771
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:39,840
So specific to iot

772
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:46,496
What are kind of the lessons you have learned in building the orange Chef that you would like to share

773
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:47,520

774
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:51,616
Yeah

775
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:53,920
Baby pink

776
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:02,112

777
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:05,440
Elisa company what year it is

778
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:11,328
What I mean by that is not just a direct communication with them but I also like I just explain like

779
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:15,168
A very well put-together strategy

780
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:19,008
So it's okay to try

781
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:23,360
Out there that I'm not

782
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:26,176
Iot weather like

783
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,736

785
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:33,344
Discontinued all the time

786
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:35,648
For whatever reason we sing.

787
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,280
It'll probably be when you forever

788
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:50,496
What is a banana

789
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:51,520

791
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:02,528
And hopefully that will never

792
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:07,136
Of course

793
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:09,440
You put somebody down there

794
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:14,048

Christian stopping supporting

796
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:16,608
After

797
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,144
A very short period of time

798
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:25,568
What happens next what happens if you take too much

799
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:29,664
It's very very very important and you have to have that

800
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:38,624
Wrok

801
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:50,912

You can do it

803
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:57,568

804
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:01,664

Make sure that

806
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:22,400
An expectation that should be like

807
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:23,680
People shouldn't take

808
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:28,544

809
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:30,592
Do you think they

00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:41,344

813
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,976
Anywhere between two and three years

814
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:50,560
Just kidding.

Vertical

816
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:56,704
A shorter lifespan

817
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:59,008
Okay that was good advice

818
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:01,056
Any other

819
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:02,592
Okay that was still the first one

820
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:06,688
Be mindful of

821
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:11,040
All that kind of stuff

822
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,768
Fundraising list

823
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:22,560

Like I kind is wrong

826
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:27,168
I underestimated

827
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:29,472
How much money in the beginning

828
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:34,080
I just turned everything like

829
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:36,128
On the present and the future

830
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:41,504
Because even though you used to justify your future

831
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:45,600
Information on the rain today

832
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:47,136

So

839
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:01,472
In general

840
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,520
Company

841
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:05,312
Should have

842
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:07,616
Lower margins for

843
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:10,432
What I mean by this is like you can expect to

844
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:12,736

845
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:14,272

00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:47,808

855
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:12,128

868
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:54,368
