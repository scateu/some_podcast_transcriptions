Tell you what those mean in the consumers about Wi-Fi Pumas offering a Wi-Fi subscription

11
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:42,752
We'll talk about that

12
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:44,800
I have a very controversial opinion

13
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:45,568
Plus

14
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:46,848
We are going to talk some

15
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:48,896
Stuff about security

16
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:51,456
It looks like we're getting some price wars in the

17
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:52,992
DIY security Market

18
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:53,760
What about that

19
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:57,600
Verizon's new CEO and what that means for iot

20
00:00:58,112 --> 00:01:01,184
Plus I got my wyze pan Cam and we're going to

21
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,488
Do a quick little review of that

22
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:07,840
I guess this week is Garrett Miller Chief digital officer of current

23
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:10,912
He's going to talk about how GE shifted its

24
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:12,192
Current business

25
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:13,216
From

26
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:16,800
Selling power generation kind of electricity on demand

27
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:19,360
That's a lighting because that is where the market is at

28
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:20,640
And much more

29
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:25,248
Are podcast today is sponsored by praetorian so you'll hear it from them

30
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,528
But first

31
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:28,576
A message from one of our other sponsors

Dicom for more information

40
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,256
Okay Kevin

41
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:10,048
Let's kick it off with

42
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,424
We're kicking it off with industrial news you guys which I know some of yall might be like I don't know

43
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,960
But it's a big deal

44
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:18,240
Rockwell Automation

45
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:22,080
They have entered into the Strategic partnership with

46
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,616
PTC

47
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:25,664
For industrial in a

48
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,432
Station

49
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:30,528
Mptc you may remember they are a company that used to do

50
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:36,928
Design and Manufacturing software and then they started buying up iot companies like thing works actually Bots Lively witch

51
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:37,952
Clock me in

52
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,256
Mommy and Dively and then sold that but they

53
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:46,400
Are doing really cool stuff with things like AR & VR I talk to the CEO Jim heppelmann a couple times

54
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:51,008
As part of this partnership Rockwell Automation is making a billion-dollar Equity investor

55
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,056
And there's

56
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:55,104
CEO and chairman will join the board of pt

57
00:02:55,616 --> 00:03:00,992
This is going to be a really deep partnership they're going to integrate their smart Factory Technologies they're going

58
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:05,856
PTC has thingworx kepware all of that's going to go in with Rockwell Automation

59
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:06,624
Factory song

60
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,696
So my question about this is

61
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:10,720
Where does that leave

62
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:12,512
Other companies like Johnson

63
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:13,280
Controls

64
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,048
Cement

65
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:14,816
Compete with raw

66
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:15,584
Rockwell Automation

67
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,864
And I don't know how exclusive

68
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,400
Pussy

69
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:25,056
I think to answer your question but I don't know the exact answer but to answer your question I think it's going to depend on pricing because

70
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:28,384
Where is subscriptions

71
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,408
It is

72
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:34,272
In which case it's going to come down to like in any Enterprise

73
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:40,672
It area how much is it going to cost me so if those other competitors can still provide similar services

74
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:45,024
At a lower subscription price that may help those little guys

75
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:48,352
It might it actually I'm talking to Jim heppelmann

76
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:50,400
Later on this week so you'll see more about the

77
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:51,168
Send the newsletter

78
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,192
But it's

79
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,984
Pretty big freaking deal so

80
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,264
We're talking about here

81
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,032
Arm

82
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,568
The semiconductor license

83
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,360
Company that you all know and love

84
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,896
They make the designs that

85
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,432
Make yourself own chips

86
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,712
Other chip

87
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,504
Like the tiny little chips

88
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,528
Surrender SmartWatches

89
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:09,088
They have bought a company called stream

90
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,368
Technology

91
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:11,648
And

92
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,184
Their goal here

93
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,208
Is

94
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:17,280
Extreme Technologies does device management and

95
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,815
Iot connectivity

96
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:22,911
This is a little weird because arm is a

97
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:23,679
Chip design

98
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:26,495
But what's happening is they really focused

99
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:30,079
Hard on their mbed OS and they launched

100
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,895
Probably a year-and-a-half ago I feel

101
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:35,199
Cloud offering for iot so

102
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,991
They're actually trying to

103
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:37,759
To build

104
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:40,063
The same sort of cloud offering that

105
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,343
Amazon

106
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,111
And others have

107
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:45,439
To help their customers basically offer

108
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:47,487
God I hate saying these words end to end

109
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:51,839
Cloud iot offering so basically

110
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:56,959
They need a lot more though they can't they can't compete with like an Azure and AWS

111
00:04:57,215 --> 00:05:01,055
It got the basics down which is getting your devices online and then managing

112
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:10,783
No I don't think it is I don't think it is because our magic says they chip designer they don't manufacture

113
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,855
Nitro chips instead they license their designs to

114
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,903
Apple Samsung

115
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,695
Mediatek

116
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,231
Qualcomm etcetera

117
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:24,095
And there's only so much more growth left in the mobile devices that

118
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:29,215
Run on those chips that yes there are newer types of devices and some iot devices will need these

119
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:30,751
Smart as well but

120
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:33,823
They can't rely on the big growth

121
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:34,847
From their biggest

122
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:39,967
Revenue generator these days they have to do something more than just be a chip designer that

123
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,783
Puts out intel processors basically

124
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,063
So I don't think it's all that

125
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,087
That weird

126
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:50,975
Okay I know that this is like I get it and I know that they're in this position

127
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:52,511
But I think it's

128
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:54,303
Crazy for them to think they can come

129
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,143
I guess is where I'm going

130
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,167
SA

131
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,447
I get why they're doing it

132
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:01,727
But

133
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:08,895
I just want to be successful either I'm not saying that at all but

134
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:11,711
At least they're giving themselves a chance in a new market

135
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:15,039
Is right now without this and I think they made one other

136
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:20,415
What was the reason I thought was weird acquisition last year I don't recall what it was but

137
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,207
Really why are they doing that now

138
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:23,231
They have to

139
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:26,559
They just have to otherwise where's the growth going to come

140
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:29,119
So I I get this in

141
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,399
You know arm

142
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,447
Has done a lot actually

143
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,215
Advance fee

144
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:36,031
Try to advance the overall iot Market

145
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,311
Easier

146
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:41,919
So a couple years ago they launched in bed which is their OS for it's their real time

147
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:47,039
And they did that because everybody else had their own OS is it part of

148
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,575
I called the chip fenders

149
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:49,855
License

150
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:50,623
Iris designs

151
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:51,903
They had their own

152
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:52,671
Operating

153
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:54,719
And it was terrible because you

154
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:58,047
As a developer if you wanted to build an iot device

155
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,583
You had to learn like

156
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:02,143
A variety of embedded operating so

157
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:08,031
It's basically so they were like hey let's have them all learn mbed OS and that'll be easier and then that'll work on

158
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:08,799
Rochester

159
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:12,639
That hasn't embed has not the adoption curve has not

160
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:13,919
Gone the way we thought it

161
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,223
Doubtful but

162
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,527
Only according to an eclipse

163
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:21,343
Iot developer survey that came out in April

164
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:22,367
48.8

165
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,135
8% of

166
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,415
Developer survey

167
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:26,719
Actually use mbed OS

168
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,255
Compared to

169
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,559
I'm a 72% using Linux

170
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:31,583
And then

171
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,887
About 20.4% using

172
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:34,655
Free artist

173
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:35,679
Just be

174
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:36,447
Most pop

175
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:37,727
Artaste

176
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,263
Set Linux

177
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,031
Too fat for life

178
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:46,687
And Amazon bought free art Osso Amazon right now has that same

179
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,223
And they didn't buy free

180
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:49,247
Asset open source

181
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:54,623
I don't know how to phrase that properly

182
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,671
Anyway so now they've got this

183
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:59,743
End-to-end kind of system

184
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:02,815
Really interested to see what Amazon does

185
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:03,839
Too deep in that

186
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:06,399
Meanwhile arm just feels like it's really far behind

187
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,703
So there's there's art

188
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:10,751
In other

189
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:14,079
Is it industrial it's just kind of catching up with p

190
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:14,847
People V

191
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:15,871
Red group

192
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,151
I remember them

193
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,711
The thread group they're using

194
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:23,295
Iot standard for

195
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,575
The radio

196
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:28,671
It's mesh Network base it uses 802. 15. 4

197
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,439
And

198
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,463
The same thing is it

199
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:32,511
Same radio underneath

200
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,559
And then they connect directly to IP

201
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,327
IPv6 switch

202
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:38,399
Unique about it so they did a milestone release

203
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,423
This week

204
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,215
It's worth mentioning that

205
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:44,799
Nordic joined which they actually announced way back in

206
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:45,567
February

207
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:50,687
Zeidman's also joined which means thread could actually find some

208
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:52,735
Some credibility in the industrial space

209
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:53,503
Face which I thought was

210
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:54,783
Worth mentioning

211
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,087
Thread still does have

212
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:57,855
Definition

213
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,903
The issue is with

214
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:03,999
Google and Nest they actually were one of the founding members of

215
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:10,399
They built a version of it that is not actually certified by the thread of life

216
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,935
So they have there

217
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,471
Own

218
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,239
Thread

219
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,519
Lamentation

220
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:24,479
The group that's in or the companies that are part of thread group right now I'm in with all the Heavy Hitters are in there if Samsung are

221
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:27,295
We just talked about Qualcomm nxp

222
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,831
Somfy osram

223
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:29,855
Evendale

224
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,135
Even yeah

225
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:37,535
Even you got out a lot company and don't forget

226
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:41,375
Say it the big butt Fan Company

227
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,703
So that's that's kind of the thread stuff there's

228
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:46,239
Lots happening there

229
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:47,519
Yay

230
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:54,431
I'm actually might my goal is in the next week or two to take a look at

231
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,455
Both red

232
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:57,759
The open connectivity Foundation

233
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,295
Because

234
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,319
It feels like

235
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,855
There's a lot of nothing happening in

236
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:06,719
If I remember correctly The Nest connect when it came out

237
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:11,327
Was there was a mention of thread and this kind of gets to that dichotomy of

238
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:17,983
Using full thread and knot thread in fact I remember we asked a grant Erickson president of the thread group about this

239
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:23,103
And I said I was quote right for me nasty text relies on threads low-power architecture

240
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:27,711
Place for long periods of time A-1 Battery Nest connect is a thread router

241
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,759
Which seamlessly extends

242
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,807
Bo3 cheat activate a thread Network

243
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:36,415
I think we later found out that it doesn't use the full

244
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,695
Angered

245
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,975
It uses what

246
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:40,511
They call thread

247
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,279
Ready

248
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,047
In what

249
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,839
Google has open source

250
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:44,863
Has open

251
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,983
Yes and that is exactly

252
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:52,543
A challenge that the thread group faces which is that

253
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,591
They basically let Google

254
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,615
Google nest

255
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,383
Use

256
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,687
The version of thread that they built in the very big

257
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,223
Beginning for all of their stuff

258
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:02,015
Right is not actually

259
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:02,783
Compatible

260
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,319
With the thread certify

261
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,855
It's just thread ready

262
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,647
It's a little bit of a

263
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:11,487
And that could be why we have

264
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,279
Not heard much lately

265
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,559
Indeed

266
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:15,327
All right

267
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,351
So Kevin

268
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,631
Hard question for you

269
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,959
Do you pay for a Wi-Fi subscription

270
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,751
Or an add-on to your

271
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:25,055
Listing of a service on top of your Wi-Fi

272
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:29,407
I do not my family pays me because I am the IT service guy for the network

273
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,431
Okay

274
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:34,527
So plume which we talked about in the past there the company that has the

275
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,319
Plume pods they're little

276
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,087
Hexagon shape

277
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:37,855
Pods that you can

278
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:38,623
Just plug in

279
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:39,903
And they actually

280
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,951
Dynamically control

281
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:42,719
Your network

282
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:43,999
In the cloud

283
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:47,583
So you plug these in wherever you need in your house and then they start to

284
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,911
Understand what's happening on your network and then

285
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:51,679
They

286
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:52,959
Kelly

287
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:53,727
Pod what to

288
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:56,543
Describe that

289
00:11:57,055 --> 00:12:02,431
It's kind of like Mesh networking yet all the intelligence is done the cloud as opposed to local

290
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,199
Right

291
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:03,967
So

292
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,015
They now are charging

293
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,831
When you buy a plume pods they're going to charge you

294
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,367
60 bucks a year

295
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,391
4

296
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:14,207
Wi-Fi service

297
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,231
Literally

298
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,279
Or $200 for a lifetime membership

299
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:18,815
So

300
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,887
Where do you buy this though you get reduced pricing on plume sweater

301
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,679
And a warranty for each year that

302
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,471
Sew in

303
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,751
The lifetime is 5 years

304
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:29,311
With a subscription you get a 3-pack

305
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,591
For $40

306
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,383
You can't buy them without us

307
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:36,735
Used to be it was $180 for the bathroom

308
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,015
So

309
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,551
179

310
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:41,599
If you

311
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,391
Don't have the subscription

312
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:45,183
You can't use them

313
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,463
Right

314
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:49,279
And said they accept if you already had

315
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:52,351
If you have already bought your plume pods previously

316
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:54,399
You can still yeah you're fine

317
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,679
Flights going forward

318
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:58,495
But going forward you're going to have to pay 60 bucks a year

319
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,615
I am actually okay with this they offer the discount on Hardware

320
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,455
You also get parental controls security stuff

321
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,503
The collective management

322
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,039
Describe what the

323
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:14,367
What does is basically saying

324
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:16,159
Hey Wi-Fi in your home

325
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,207
Is no longer going to be

326
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:18,975
Hardware base

327
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:19,999
This is going to be a service

328
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:26,143
I'm kind of okay with that given how much drama I have over my Wi-Fi network

329
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:26,911
In my house

330
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,703
It was all of my connect

331
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:32,287
If that gives the company accountability

332
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,079
For actually

333
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,639
Solving some of the problems I have with my devices

334
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,687
And it makes them update

335
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:39,711
Things that

336
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:40,735
Might like

337
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,271
Any issues with my router

338
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:43,295
You know

339
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,575
That's kind of worth it

340
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:49,695
I think for some people yes it is I'm not going to dispute that

341
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:56,095
For me personally I have all those features

342
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:58,399
In my current router setup

343
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:01,983
Parental controls guest networking

344
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:08,639
You know being forming at the right place and time so that the signals going to the right devices I can prioritize devices

345
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,663
Search for Wi-Fi

346
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:12,479
I'm not I'm not paying for that

347
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:15,039
Unless unless I have no choice in which case

348
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:17,599
That would mean all of the vendors in this space to do this

349
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:24,255
And that's going to be the big question so what it what we do see in the space right now is companies like Eero offer

350
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,327
A subscription option

351
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,095
So

352
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:30,399
I could pay 04

353
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,447
Additional parental management

354
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,215
Additional

355
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:33,983
Security

356
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:37,823
A VPN password manager all attached to the

357
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,591
In a security office

358
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:43,199
I have not paid for it yet even though I was actually like thinking about it I just

359
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,479
Justin get to it in time before it

360
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,247
Expired

361
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,527
So

362
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:50,111
I don't know I and I really

363
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:56,511
I also question how many people buy their routers at retail so plumes big business is actually still going to

364
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:57,535
To be through

365
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:02,399
Isps so things like the Comcast deal and Comcast is not charging people

366
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:04,447
11 bucks a month for a router

367
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,727
Which is said to be insane

368
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:08,031
Here's the thing

369
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:11,871
I don't have a problem with subscription for

370
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,407
Extra services

371
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:18,783
But I don't even have the option with this one the option is to not buy this one and buy a different

372
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,063
Router brand

373
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:23,391
Yes I'd rather see it as an add-on option

374
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:26,463
Look at it this way this is hardware this is

375
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,231
Just a little bit

376
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:31,583
And I'd rather be part of the hardware

377
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:36,191
Because that's at least a sustainable business model like you

378
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,727
I mean again

379
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:40,031
If this was the only choice out there I'd be like

380
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:46,175
And I know a lot of people very much a lot of our audience is probably like Stacy you're so crazy

381
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,711
I can do this myself

382
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:51,295
They're going to be people like you Kevin and I respect that but

383
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:53,855
I think this will be interesting to watch to see if

384
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:54,879
Accompany

385
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:55,903
Actually

386
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:59,487
Move from a product model to a Services model

387
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:01,535
Keep an eye on it

388
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:03,583
Okay

389
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,631
Google home has a new skill

390
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:09,215
Where does it where does it

391
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:14,079
Yeah so remember I wasn't but a couple

392
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:16,383
How to say we should probably months ago

393
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,199
They enabled the ability to use a Google home with

394
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,735
Multiple commands in

395
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:25,087
In one sentence speak one sentence and have two things happen

396
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:28,159
Apparently now you can do it with

397
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,439
Three things

398
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:30,463
Google

399
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:32,255
It tweeted something about this

400
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:34,303
And then pulled the tweet

401
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:39,167
And if I go to the support page at they've linked to in the poultry it's still just shows two things

402
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:42,751
However some people are saying that it still works at 3

403
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:47,615
So we've actually tested this booth on our respective Google

404
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:53,503
Devices and has not yet work for us so I don't know if it was a rolling kind of thing where it's coming

405
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,087
We just don't have it yet or maybe Google pull the toys because

406
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,135
It's just not ready for anybody yet don't know yet

407
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:02,207
The mystery will not be solved today

408
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:09,119
Okay let's work at home security there are two notable stories here the first is the nest security system is

409
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:12,959
399 so $400 this is

410
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:15,263
This is a reduction in price by a hundred

411
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,287
Box so

412
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:19,103
Annie's get YouTube

413
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,639
Presence fobs

414
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:24,479
Security sensors that are multi-purpose sensors and

415
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,783
Round thing that you

416
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,135
And the keep

417
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,159
Is there a

418
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:35,487
You know it's built into the Top of the Hub

419
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,023
A little funky design

420
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,351
Right

421
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:42,399
Your father over it to arm and disarm it it's

422
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:45,471
When is it still thread ready

423
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:47,263
So

424
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,287
That is

425
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,311
Notable

426
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:52,895
Because people liked the security system they hated the fact that it

427
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:53,663
Cost so much

428
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:54,943
But

429
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,223
Perhaps

430
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,503
There's a reason to this

431
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,271
Which is

432
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:01,599
Rings home security system is going to launch

433
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:03,135
Next month

434
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:05,951
And when it launches

435
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:08,255
It's going to be

436
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,047
The 99.

437
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:14,143
Remember ring was purchased by Amazon

438
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,423
December

439
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,191
So

440
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,215
This is

441
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:18,751
Ring / Amazon

442
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:21,823
And it will include

443
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,615
A single motion sensor

444
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:25,919
Single door window sensor

445
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,455
+ 8

446
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,223
Keypad

447
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:32,319
And this this one you should melt to a wall I would think

448
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:33,599
I guess you can have it

449
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:35,647
On a table but I don't know

450
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,439
And it's got this weird iPod

451
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,463
Click wheel looking device

452
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:42,815
Yeah

453
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:47,167
I don't know about that either but that's okay I mean it's sticking out $200 less

454
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,447
$200 list

455
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:51,519
I'm in the centers are relatively cheap you buy a motion sensor

456
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,055
Next door windows

457
00:18:55,103 --> 00:19:01,247
Are you surprised I mean we knew this was coming because of something else last year but then they were lawsuits until when I think this was

458
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:04,319
Back in October was supposed to be out for was announced back then

459
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:10,463
Are you surprised because since then Amazon has purchased ring that there's no Amazon branding no

460
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,231
No

461
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:14,303
Bundling with a Amazon camera ring like that

462
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,351
No I'm not actually surprised because

463
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:18,399
Does Amazon has

464
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,167
They fought

465
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:20,191
Plenty of companies in

466
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:21,471
Twitch

467
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,263
Zappos

468
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:25,567
Some of their bigger Acquisitions that kept alone

469
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:27,615
And bring has a great brand record

470
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:28,383
Ignition in in

471
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:29,919
So

472
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:31,711
It makes total sense to me

473
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:34,015
That people might buy ring

474
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:35,039
Not realizing

475
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,111
I would like to see

476
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:39,391
You know

477
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:42,207
Ring has the doorbell camera that have outdoor cameras

478
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:45,023
I would like to see a package that includes some of that be

479
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:45,791
Because I think it

480
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,071
You know

481
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,095
It will take

482
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:50,399
But I wonder if we are not seeing it be

483
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,167
Because

484
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,215
Amazon also bought a company called

485
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:55,519
Link and they have some really good video Pro

486
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:57,311
Processing technology very low power

487
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:00,383
So I'm wondering if we'll see a new camera soon

488
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:01,919
That goes with

489
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:04,223
The Amazon key system or the

490
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:06,015
Ties into this that uses

491
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,295
That hard

492
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:08,319
That

493
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:13,439
That's a good point and possibly need doorbell cuz I believe the blink doorbell

494
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:15,487
Yes they're still planning to make that

495
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:16,511
Right

496
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:17,535
Right

497
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:19,583
So you don't maybe they'll have a

498
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:22,655
A higher antenna Lauren like amazonbasics

499
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:25,471
I don't know

500
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:27,775
Okay

501
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:31,103
Other final two little stories worth mentioning

502
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:31,871
1

503
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,407
Microsoft hololens

504
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:34,687
Is coming next

505
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:35,967
Your whole inspiration

506
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:36,735
2

507
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:39,039
And I put this in here because

508
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:44,671
The Holland is really interesting for a R&B are in industrial settings there's a couple companies

509
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:45,695
Already using it

510
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,279
I know it's a little weird

511
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:51,071
I'll be honest you know that's not

512
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:52,863
For us but I have it

513
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:53,631
Several

514
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,423
Industrial

515
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,727
Iot events I've actually done some

516
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:00,031
Repairs in VR

517
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:02,591
For like industrial process control systems

518
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:03,871
Guided by you know

519
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:06,687
I put on the hololens and they would guide me through the steps

520
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:10,271
I can see how this would be really useful

521
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:11,551
And that sort of setting

522
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:15,903
For that for emergency services all kinds of

523
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,464
On the field types of activities yes

524
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,232
So

525
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:21,024
I know and you know

526
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,376
It's a beauty good experience the hololens is actually.

527
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:27,168
Cool

528
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:27,936
There we go

529
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:29,472
And then finally

530
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:34,336
Hans vestberg is now Verizon's new CEO replacing Lowell McAdam

531
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:37,920
And I brought this up because I have known Hans

532
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:41,760
For years because he was the CEO of Ericsson

533
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,296
After being

534
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:46,624
Kicked out of his CEO role at Ericsson in 26

535
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,392
16

536
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:50,720
He popped up last year as a CTO at Verizon

537
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:51,744
So

538
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:57,376
This was a surprise to Wall Street this was a surprise to pretty much everyone when Verizon announced him it is

539
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:59,168
In this role a couple analyst for like

540
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:02,240
Yeah it wasn't that great over at Ericsson

541
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:03,264
However

542
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,544
I will say

543
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,616
But he was very Visionary about the Internet of Things

544
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:11,968
Turning Erikson's product-based business into a Services business

545
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:12,992
And

546
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,784
He knows a lot about 5.

547
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:15,808
So

548
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:18,624
I think those are really good reasons to put him in

549
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:20,416
A Verizon I think

550
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:25,280
With Erickson originally he was trying to turn around a company

551
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:29,120
When the Telco equipment Market just

552
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:29,888
It was

553
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,168
Killer it was

554
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:33,216
Broken

555
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:36,800
And he was really pushing 5G a little too early

556
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:37,824
In

557
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,104
That the market

558
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,640
Fertel, equipment hits

559
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:41,408
Consolidated

560
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,176
Tremendously

561
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,200
Martinsville

562
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:43,968
West End

563
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:44,736
And he just

564
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:47,296
It's a little too early on iot and 5G

565
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:52,672
That's that's my take on his tenure there so having him at Verizon

566
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:56,000
We're there already investing in 5G

567
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:59,840
They need that Visionary plan for how to build services around it

568
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:01,632
I think he's actually a good

569
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:06,240
That's that's my take on that I wish him the best of

570
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:07,520
If you want to hear

571
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:09,056
Vim Hans

572
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:11,104
Hans was on the podcast in

573
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:14,944
2016 before he was kicked out of his job at Eric's

574
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,712
Senso

575
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:19,552
What episode number 56 you can actually hear him talk about iot and

576
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:20,320
And what matters

577
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:22,112
And that

578
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:26,976
No that doesn't include our show today

579
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:31,072
I was I was all excited but know we're going to talk about the wyze pan cam

580
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:32,096
Which is

581
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:33,376
My new toy

582
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:37,216
This is a

583
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:39,008
2999

584
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:39,776
Camera

585
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:41,824
You do pay shipping and handling

586
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,592
Think so

587
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,920
But cheap camera

588
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,224
Lot of fun

589
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:51,040
All the functions of the wise to camso it

590
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,576
7 sorry

591
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:54,112
720 or

592
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,672
1080 HD

593
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,464
And it moves

594
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:03,584
It moves 93° up and down and it moves 360 degrees on the horizontal

595
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:05,888
It doesn't go around in a full circle it goes

596
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,424
Around all the way and then

597
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:08,704
Comes back the other way

598
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:10,240
And

599
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:13,056
The daytime video is about 15 frames per second

600
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:13,824
So it's

601
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,360
It's a little choppy but

602
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,896
Night vision

603
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:17,920
10 frames per second

604
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:18,944
Awesome night

605
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:20,736
And two way

606
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:21,504
Audio

607
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,040
Plus

608
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,320
14 days

609
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:25,344
Alert videos

610
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:27,136
So that's 14 days for free

611
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:28,672
Yay

612
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:30,208
And

613
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:31,488
The stuff is

614
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,512
Independent

615
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:33,280
Caption

616
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:34,816
They do use AES when

617
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:37,376
So it's not quite Bankrate

618
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:38,656
But pretty good

619
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:45,312
And there was question about where the data is stored where it goes I remember some

620
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:47,616
Listeners asking about that

621
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:51,456
And I think originally wise was working with a sum

622
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:53,248
Vendors in China but now

623
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:59,648
From a cloud perspective the date is all kept in the US the cameras are manufactured in China

624
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,440
And the

625
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:04,768
Why is people are really focused on the software experience their use

626
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,304
Razor thin margin

627
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:09,376
My stuff in the cloud stuff is hosted in

628
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:10,912
Aw

629
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:13,216
So these guys are former Amazon

630
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,264
Some software is built here

631
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:16,544
Stuff is hosted here

632
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:17,568
Karim rashid

633
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:19,360
So

634
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:21,152
That is

635
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,688
Really I mean

636
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,224
The overall

637
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:26,016
Experience with this is

638
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:27,040
Really good

639
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,576
But you can set it to track

640
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:30,880
Motion so

641
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:33,696
The camera will like pan wherever it sees motion which

642
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:34,464
Just totally

643
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,232
Be creepy

644
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:37,024
Just walk around your house

645
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:41,376
I'm some people did ask how loud the motor is

646
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:42,144
It is not that

647
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:43,680
And

648
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:47,008
The downside is this only works with wise and if

649
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:48,544
Services

650
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,568
So

651
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:52,128
This is not like a homekit thing this is

652
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,688
With anything else it's just those things right now

653
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:55,712
So

654
00:25:56,992 --> 00:26:02,624
Yeah and then the same applies to the non pan-and-tilt version which is $10 less expensive

655
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,160
Which is the one I bought so

656
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:06,720
Very similar just you're getting

657
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:10,048
That creepy but cool tracking with the pinto

658
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,376
Yes and you can also set it up so it'll actually go through

659
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:14,144
Through

660
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:16,704
Traumatologist like

661
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:19,264
Goes around hits all four points

662
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:20,288
Of the circle

663
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:22,592
And you can actually set custom point

664
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:23,616
So

665
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:26,944
If there's something like in the way like a pillar if you can actually set your point

666
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:28,224
To not stop at the

667
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:28,992
Pellerin stop

668
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:35,648
So with a battery pack and a Roomba I could actually make a little robot that

669
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:36,928
Scans around the house

670
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:38,976
Yes this is wired so you plug it in

671
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,000
And

672
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,536
It can take an SD card

673
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:43,584
So you can store your stuff

674
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:45,376
On an SD card should you

675
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:47,680
And

676
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:51,776
That's the product I like it if you're in the market for a camera

677
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:53,312
I would say

678
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:58,432
This is really cheap it's really easy it doesn't do facial recognition or anything fancy but

679
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:02,784
30 minutes

680
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:05,344
So or 20 if you want the smaller one

681
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:06,624
Are the non moving

682
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,160
The non-motorized one

683
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:09,952
All right and now

684
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:10,976
Let's take a moment

685
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:14,304
To visit with the iot podcast listener hotline

686
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:18,144

All in their own right out of the box

689
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,336
So you don't have to have a smart home system

690
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:27,104
To benefit

691
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:29,920

So before Friday the night

00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,888
You'll be entered to win my old ecobee SI thermostat

700
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,680
It is a lovely thermostat

701
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:54,496
It talks to everybody he wanted to talk to

702
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,032
And

703
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:57,568
Apna TV

704
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,592
Does not talk to

705
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:00,896
Just Google and Madam a

706
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:01,664
But

707
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,200
I like it

708
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:07,296
That will go out to you if you send us your question

709
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:08,832
Before midnight on Friday

710
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:14,976
This week's question comes from a nameless individual and covers for alarm system panel from quality

711
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:18,048
Hey want to know what you guys think of the

712
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:20,096
Qolsys IQ panel

713
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:21,120
They both

714
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,400
A lot of

715
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,192
Z-Wave and

716
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:27,776
Security compatibility yunnan compatibility for things like

717
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:29,312
Blood Centers in

718
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:31,104
Security sensors in

719
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,896
You know everything in addition to

720
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:37,504
Email to connect with alarm.com to do cameras and doorbell video cameras and

721
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:42,368
CCD getting a lot of attention but wanted to know your thoughts on it

722
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,904
Okay

723
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:44,672
Heaven

724
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:45,696
So

725
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:47,744
Should we talk about her suspicions first

726
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,608
Well I do find it interesting that there's no caller name and the

727
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:58,752
Phone area code comes from the same area code where qolsys is marketing department is it

728
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:05,408
Yeah it's still a good question and I learned a little bit about this panel which I have not heard about before you have though this is the IQ

729
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:06,176
IQ panel 2

730
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:11,808
Yes so there's two qolsys panels there's the first generation IQ panel and then there's the IQ panel

731
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,600
It's a good product

732
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:15,648
I'm I'm not going to say that it is not

733
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:16,672
A good product

734
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:17,952
There's a lot of caveat

735
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:21,024
But let's talk about some of the cool things about it the software looks

736
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,560
Really good it works with

737
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:23,584
Z-Wave stuff

738
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,376
And it also works with it

739
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:26,912
Proprietary line of sight

740
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:28,448
Take their

741
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:30,240
Has cellular backup

742
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:31,520
So yay

743
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:34,336
And it has Bluetooth disarming so

744
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:36,384
You can leave your phone in your pocket and

745
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:37,408
Disarm

746
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,200
So you don't have to enter your code

747
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:41,504
That sounds like a camera so you can see pictures

748
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,528
The people who try to

749
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,856
These are really nice feature

750
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:47,392
But

751
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:48,160
There's some

752
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:48,928
There's something

753
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:49,952
We don't love them

754
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:50,976
Such as

755
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:57,632
Will you have to choose your wireless service provider for the LTE backup in advance

756
00:29:57,888 --> 00:30:01,728
I'm so if you ever change providers that's obviously an issue

757
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,800
So you can go three or four models one that works with Verizon

758
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:07,360
One that works with AT&T and one with Telus

759
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:13,248
Also you can install this as a DIY but you're going to need a service contract

760
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,272
For this to work

761
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:17,344
There's no actual app for this that we could find

762
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,624
So you

763
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,416
Send you actually to the alarm.com app

764
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:21,184
Which makes

765
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:22,464
Because alarm.com

766
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:23,744
Large.

767
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:25,280
Of

768
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:26,048
Monitor dolar

769
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:27,328
So

770
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:28,864
Probably your ideal forever

771
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:33,984
Can I get the business model they work with Distributors and dealers in

772
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,312
Service providers such as alarm.com and I'm so

773
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:40,384
My first thought of my always feels on Android

774
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:45,248
It's got Z-Wave it's got LCD Wi-Fi Bluetooth on like this could be My Hub

775
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:49,600
I went that's when we went searching for the app and found there's really no app for it you have to

776
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:50,880
UC

777
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:54,976
You know an alarm.com app and I have a subscription to that and so on so forth so

778
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:56,000
This is

779
00:30:56,512 --> 00:31:00,096
I wouldn't self-install at this point because I can't do anything once I install it

780
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,680
It's a good Hub I have actually

781
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:04,704
The two

782
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,240
It's a it's a similar

783
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:07,264
Panel hub

784
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,032
Called

785
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:09,312
2gig

786
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:10,592
So

787
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:11,360
And I never used

788
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:12,128
Is it at all because

789
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:12,896
Cuz I don't have

790
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:13,664
Amana turtle

791
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:15,968
There's another tub

792
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:18,528
Called the zipatile by zapato

793
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:21,088
In a couple people have asked me about this this is

794
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:23,392
Z-Wave zigbee

795
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:24,928
Home control system

796
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,488
And that actually has its own app

797
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:30,304
It's about three hundred and eighty bucks

798
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:31,328
And

799
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,888
You know that might be a better option if

800
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:38,240
Keep that

801
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:39,008
Invite

802
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:43,360
Remember if you have a question for us we are happy to answer it at 5 1/2

803
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:44,896

805
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:51,808
And for the next day or two you will be entered to win an ecobee SI thermostat

806
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:54,368
Okay

807
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,136
Hey

An Enterprise iot and

812
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:09,728
What works in

813
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:16,128
Maybe what still needs a little bit more time to develop

814
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:20,480

Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things

839
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:18,080
Podcast this is your house Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest

840
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:19,360
Is Garrett Miller

841
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:20,640
The chief digital officer

842
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:21,408
Officer

843
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:22,688
Buy GE

844
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,480
Hello Garrett are you doing

845
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,296
I'm even while Stacy how are you

846
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:31,904
Super great thank you so much for coming on the show I remember the

847
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:32,928
The formation of

848
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:34,464
Current way back

849
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:35,488
My gosh was it

850
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:42,144
That's right yeah we're we're coming up on three years here

851
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:45,728
Okay so before we get started let's tell everybody

852
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:46,496
What it is

853
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:47,776
Set current

854
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:55,968
Show current is a the business within GE we're born of our lighting businesses

855
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:58,528
Transition to an LED business

856
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:04,672
I so we use LEDs as an opportunity to lead into our customers

857
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:11,072
And follow that very quickly with a digital offering to create what we call and intelligent environment

858
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:13,120
Okay that sounds super exciting

859
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:14,656
Let's drive a little bit deeper in

860
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:17,216
When you guys formed

861
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:17,984
Current

862
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:18,752
It was a

863
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:21,056
Understanding that both lighting

864
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:22,592
Easy way to get into

865
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:23,616
Businesses

866
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:24,384
Because everyone was

867
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,408
Transitioning over to

868
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,712
But also

869
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,272
Opportunities

870
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:31,040
Not just

871
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:32,320
Lighting

872
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:34,880
Power generation

873
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:35,904
And other services

874
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:36,928
SoCal

875
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:39,488
How all of that works

876
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,256
Together is part of

877
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:42,560
Absolutely

878
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:44,352
So we find

879
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:48,704
Our conversations with our customers often times most the time I would say

880
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,008
Really start with LEDs

881
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:54,592
Which is a great way to get in and save about

882
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:56,384
Your electricity cost

883
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,920
As it relates to lighting

884
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:04,576
So that is a really good starting point for conversation with a customer around energy energy

885
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:10,208
Efficiency Energy savings the carbon emissions associated with that and what we do very quickly from there

886
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:14,304
Transition the conversation from one Focus solely on lighting

887
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,376
The one that's looking really more holistically at

888
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:23,776
Complete building envelope so being able to access monitor and improve the efficiency of the

889
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:29,408
Operations of all building subsistence are going from lighting and hcac to plug load

890
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:30,432
And so forth

891
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:37,600
So we do that in a really interesting way so we'll go in and as I said we lead with lighting from there

892
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:42,976
People then get pretty interested in managing the rest of their building subsystem

893
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:45,792
And so what we do is put in place

894
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:51,424
Edge technology that allows us to tap into the different assets that exist

895
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,496
Ennis in a particular customers environment

896
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:56,800
Or to go in and augment

897
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:57,824
That environment

898
00:35:58,336 --> 00:36:01,920
And so often times a place that people start is with lighting controls

899
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:06,528
We need use a monitor describe our architecture

900
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:10,112
Call that we refer to as open on the top and open on the bottom

901
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:16,768
And if we really start with that open on the bottom concept the key word there is really interoperability

902
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:23,424
So we can go in and leverage whatever type of edge infrastructure investment our customers have made

903
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:27,520
If they have existing sensors or controllers and place

904
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:29,568
We can reuse those

905
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:34,944
If they don't have existing infrastructure we can certainly put that in as as part of the

906
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:35,712
Appointments

907
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:42,112
Sweet hurry holistically sense and control does building environments to drive energy

908
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:44,160
Efficiency musing are all Sites

909
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:48,256
Application is a cloud-based application

910
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:53,120
Idolizes to not only gain insights but to develop

911
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:54,656
Optimization

912
00:36:54,912 --> 00:37:01,056
Strategies as well as been pushed control back to the edge across an entire Enterprise portfolio

913
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:03,104
And it seems like this came along

914
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:04,640
Just the right time

915
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:06,688
Using

916
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:07,456
Lightning is away

917
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:08,992
Control

918
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,528
Thanks and I say this

919
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:13,088
Because LEDs are so efficient

920
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:15,136
Any company that was making lights

921
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:16,416
Suddenly had this

922
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:17,440
Moment of life

923
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:21,792
Holy cow we're selling these bulbs that are going to last forever and now we've got a

924
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,584
Switch our business model.

925
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:25,632
Cuz selling light bulbs that died

926
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:26,656
Every

927
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:27,424
20 years

928
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,264
It's very different

929
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,104
Was partially a response to turning

930
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:36,128
Product business

931
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:36,896
Listen to a service

932
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:44,576
Yeah that's right and I think you're exactly right LEDs have really turned

933
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:50,976
It really changed the the industry so they're really great for people like you and I infer for our customer

934
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:53,024
What are there cities or building

935
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:59,424
Have you said they use 50% less energy but they do tend to last quite a bit longer which is a big part of the volume

936
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:05,824
Position in addition to the Energy savings that did put us down the path of trying to reimagine what can we

937
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:12,224
Now I think LED is is in a good spot you know when we talk about the LED conversion process that's happening

938
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,504
Out there the industry today

939
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:18,880
We like to say we're somewhere in the second inning so I think there's still a lot of Runway left

940
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:25,280
As it relates to getting in there and helping customers have better Energy Efficiency better lighting solutions through LED

941
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:29,376
It's certainly as we start to look at the evolution of our business model

942
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:35,008
Digital is played a big role in that so we talked a bit about the Energy Efficiency components

943
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:37,312
That are part of the business model

944
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:43,712
What we're now doing the same that's a really good place to start but there's a lot more that we can do to add value

945
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:44,736
Due to our customers

946
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:46,272
If we think about using

947
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:52,416
That digital infrastructure that I described earlier as a way to deliver energy-efficiency

948
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:56,256
You can also flip that into live there other types of business

949
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:57,792
Productivity outcomes

950
00:38:58,304 --> 00:39:01,376
For our customers using that same infrastructure

951
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:03,680
The way that we do that

952
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:09,568
Insta take all of that data all those insights that were capturing in generating created

953
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:13,152
Stream those out to a 3rd party ecosystem

954
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:19,552
So we've recognized our customers of recognize the value of that data coming back to that idea

955
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:25,440
Open on the top and look on the bottom is open on the top really means that the data that were capturing

956
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,208
Is

957
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:30,560
Readily accessible by our ecosystem or directly by our customers

958
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:36,960
And that opens up tremendous opportunity for customers to go and do things like space utilisation or

959
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:38,752
Retail Analytics

960
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:44,640
Or workflow management in industrial environment really a preamble set of opportunities

961
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:46,432
I know it's so cool

962
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,272
So when your customers start understanding

963
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:52,064
What they can do with this

964
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,344
Are they doing it

965
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:55,648
You guys are they doing it is a

966
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:56,416
Pull from

967
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:57,696
Other platform

968
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:58,464
Azar software

969
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:00,512
Cuz this gets into this

970
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:02,048
Iot is an ecosystem

971
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,328
And I feel like

972
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:05,632
It's such a vast ecosystem right now.

973
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,680
People are unaware of the

974
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:08,448
Potential of some

975
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:09,984
The things they can

976
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:11,520
What they can do

977
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:13,312
So how do you guys cut

978
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:14,336
Market

979
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:15,104
To that

980
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:16,384
With your partner's out

981
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:25,344
Yeah so we approach it with our partners absolutely hand-in-hand and I think you hit on a couple of different trends

982
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:30,208
Are happening out there that people are really starting to wrap their heads around about what they do about it

983
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:35,072
So one of the really wonderful statistics out there in the world of Statistics is this

984
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:41,216
By 2020 you'll have about seven and a half billion connected business in points

985
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:46,592
In this whole iot world and that's growing at about a 33% kegger from today

986
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:50,176
Which means there's a tremendous amount of intelligence

987
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:54,528
It's being created and I think our customers are starting to realize

988
00:40:54,784 --> 00:41:00,928
Hey this all of this data out there is really great but we actually have to be able to do something with it and so what we've

989
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:03,488
Recognizing what we readily admit is this

990
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:09,888
We look at all of that data where we do a really good job of capturing it of transforming it of making it avail

991
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:13,472
Edible and using it ourselves to our own software applications

992
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:15,264
To deliver Energy Efficiency

993
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:21,664
We recognize though that the opportunity so that data to deliver other types of outcome is is real

994
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,712
Satan bound

995
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:30,112
We go hand-in-hand with our partners in our ecosystem to go to our customers to help highlight

996
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:32,160
Like the opportunity of leveraging

997
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:37,024
A single digital backbone to create not on the Energy Efficiency opportunities

998
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,328
It also business productivity opportune

999
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:43,424
And the way that I see the market evolving right now is that

1000
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:47,776
You have customers who understand that value proposition that this whole

1001
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:54,431
Connected in points the the growing iot space is going to create lots of opportunities for the

1002
00:41:54,943 --> 00:42:00,575
Historically for customers that have been forward-looking and and and identify that opportunity

1003
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:03,135
They really put in place Point Solutions

1004
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:07,999
The cast of the data to power the individual applications at their interest in pursuing

1005
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:11,327
What we do though is something that's quite a bit different

1006
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:13,375
So think of it almost feels like

1007
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:20,031
The mobile phone for your building or the mobile phone for your city and you've got a single set of Interest

1008
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:22,079
Structure that can be leveraged the power

1009
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:23,871
Any number of

1010
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:29,759
Actual software applications to deliver different types of outcomes to our customers and so

1011
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:36,415
We absolutely do that hand in hand with the with our partners that leverage that data to deliver those other types of business

1012
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:37,439
Productivity outcomes

1013
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:40,511
Okay and you mentioned that you got you think that

1014
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:41,279
That lighting

1015
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:42,559
Is it second in

1016
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:44,607
So I'm very curious

1017
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,143
Where you see

1018
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:47,423
This going

1019
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:48,959
And how far baby

1020
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:51,263
A part of this

1021
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:52,031
Throw in there

1022
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:53,823
Some of your competitors in

1023
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:54,591
Lighting space

1024
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:55,615
Also

1025
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:56,895
Just made some

1026
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:57,663
Acquisition

1027
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:00,991
Osram body

1028
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:02,527
Lumens

1029
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:03,551
Siemens jobs

1030
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:05,087
Enlighted

1031
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:06,111
Both of these

1032
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:10,463
They seem to be catching on to this trend and so

1033
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:11,999
Where do you see it

1034
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:12,767
It going

1035
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:14,815
Where We Are

1036
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:23,263
Yeah so I think the market is really going to evolve pretty rapidly I think it's in the next couple of years where we

1037
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:28,383
Reduce the other people identifying this opportunity which would take it as a great compliment

1038
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:34,783
We did our own acquisition of daintree which was at its core a

1039
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:39,391
Serves as the foundation for our intelligent building

1040
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:42,719
Portfolio particularly to the edge technology

1041
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:46,303
It was really born out of a lighting controls play

1042
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:50,655
But it allows you to tap into hundreds and hundreds

1043
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:57,055
Literally thousands of types of devices out there to deliver whatever type of outcome someone's interested in whether that's like

1044
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:59,871
Controls HD AC controls or

1045
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:00,895
People counting

1046
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:07,295
And I think we start to see more of our competitors going in that direction as well

1047
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:12,159
Well I think one of the really important parts as this industry evolved

1048
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:14,719
Other people are going to identify as

1049
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:17,535
It needs to be an interoperable

1050
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:23,935
Open system to be able to take advantage of all of the new innovation all the new technology

1051
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:26,751
Whether that's a new sensor type whether that's a

1052
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:28,543
A new software application

1053
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:32,127
The making sure that from an in customer perspective

1054
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:33,663
They have a single

1055
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:40,319
Digital backbone that they'll be able to leverage into whatever type of business outcome they ultimately wanted to cheat with

1056
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:42,367
Whether that's something they want to do today

1057
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:47,231
Next year or five years from now they've got to make sure that they've got a system

1058
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:52,095
To allow them to flex and grow as we all discover what the future brings

1059
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:53,119
Okay

1060
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:54,655
Let's talk about

1061
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:55,679
How you guys

1062
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:56,959
Pair for that

1063
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:57,727
On the business side

1064
00:44:58,239 --> 00:44:59,519
You are a chief digital officer

1065
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:00,799
When current

1066
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:01,823
First came out

1067
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:03,359
It was a slightly different

1068
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:04,383
Opposition

1069
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:05,919
There's talk about price

1070
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:06,943
Things based on

1071
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:08,735
The Energy savings off

1072
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:10,527
And I feel like it's

1073
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:11,295
It shifted

1074
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:16,927
Bearden ever-changing world so that makes sense so where are you guys

1075
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:18,207
Today when it come

1076
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:19,231
Pricing

1077
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:20,767
Where do you think

1078
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:21,791
Could want

1079
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:28,959
Yasso current has been a story of evolution and transformation absolutely when we

1080
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:35,359
Said the company was really very much focused almost exclusively around the energy play

1081
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:41,759
Which was really interesting and you started to think about some really far Out Concepts as it relates to Birch

1082
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:42,783
Power plants

1083
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:49,183
Peer-to-peer energy trading and how do you pull in things like that how do you price those types of offerings

1084
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:51,999
Switch because not a lot of time talking about that

1085
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:56,351
By itself I think we're wheelsamillion landed was that those types of markets

1086
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:58,143
Are going to be a little bit

1087
00:45:58,399 --> 00:46:00,447
Farther Along before they fully mature

1088
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:06,335
Which is fine I think we're positioning ourselves really nicely to be the behind-the-meter in points

1089
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:11,455
To play in those types of business models in this hexoskin does Market opportunities

1090
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:13,247
When they come to fruition

1091
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:19,647
But in the interim we're running the are intelligent environments play which is also an interesting time

1092
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:26,047
Business modeling and pricing scheme so are we mentioned that you have a mobile phone as

1093
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:30,911
It is an analogy for how our model works and I come back to that n**** just

1094
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:32,447
I'm break it down a little bit more

1095
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:38,847
Where if you think of the mobile phone is as your Edge Hardware that's something that people are used to consume and then

1096
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:45,247
Game 4 and they buy it they own it it's it's their phone or in our case it's it's our sensors controls Gateway

1097
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:51,647
So far the service is pisto that sits on top of that I think is where it starts to become really interesting and

1098
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:55,487
You know if you would step back and just look at technology Evolution over the last

1099
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:57,791
And yours are so I think we're not in a spot where

1100
00:46:58,047 --> 00:47:04,191
People are very comfortable with with service offerings in particular software-as-a-service so when we think about the business

1101
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:07,263
It's fine that we now all the sudden have

1102
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:09,823
A recurring annuity that gets put in place

1103
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:16,223
I'm with the different applications that are being purchased for those are things that we built ourselves like also

1104
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:21,343
Whether there's a partner applications that our customers are going to ultimately be consuming

1105
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:23,647
In this model I'm going to test how far we can take

1106
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:24,415
Take this analogy

1107
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:26,975
If I am a building owner and I buy

1108
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:28,255
Relating to Center

1109
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:29,023
Where's the Gateway

1110
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:31,071
In many cases this is technology

1111
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:31,839
It's going to be bought

1112
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:36,191
Two maybe three

1113
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:39,263
So think about it from that in

1114
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:42,079
There is some replacement Happening Here

1115
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:43,871
But it becomes much more

1116
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:45,151
For you to also have

1117
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:47,199
Something on the services side

1118
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:48,991
The business

1119
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:56,671
Yeah that's right I think swing back to that the hardware piece of then we can go Services next

1120
00:47:57,183 --> 00:48:03,327
I think I'm Hardware side the nice thing about it is that you're not just buying a single iPhone and stick in your building

1121
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:09,727
Replace it when the next iPhone comes out what's really nice about having the open architecture is that you can

1122
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:10,495
Upgrade

1123
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:16,895
Your Edge hardware for the building you can upgrade the quote-unquote mobile phone for your building as new techno

1124
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:23,295
Knology comes online so you're essentially future proofing your Edge architecture by putting in place.

1125
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:24,319
Interoperable

1126
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:25,343
Capabilities

1127
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:27,391
In-N-Out on the services side

1128
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:33,791
There's going to be continued Innovation as it relates to the different types of applications that come

1129
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:39,167
I'm online and leverage. Data whether that's the date of this being created and generated today

1130
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:42,751
Or if you look forward you know couple years down the road when

1131
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:47,359
The new whiz-bang sensor comes online that nobody's even thought of today

1132
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:53,759
I ain't coming back to you if you've got an interoperable open Edge platform that can take that in

1133
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:57,599
Consume it now all the sudden you can access that new type of data

1134
00:48:58,623 --> 00:49:00,159
Let's go into this

1135
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:02,463
The idea of increasing size

1136
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:03,231
Occasionally

1137
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:05,023
What kind of flight current started out

1138
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:06,559
Because

1139
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:08,095
I loved it cuz I'm a journal

1140
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:10,655
I love that it was so forward

1141
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:14,239
Cool and like all my God is amazing I can see the future

1142
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:16,543
I can see why people were like

1143
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:18,335
So how do you

1144
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:19,103
Get the market

1145
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:19,871
Get ready for that

1146
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:21,151
How do you know

1147
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:23,199
Time and do you have a

1148
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:25,247
Evolve what you sell

1149
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:26,527
Into some

1150
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:28,063
Like that

1151
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:29,599
That's a lot of questions of

1152
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:31,135
But it's basically how do we get for

1153
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:32,415
From here which is in a

1154
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:33,951
2

1155
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:35,743
Crazier in

1156
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:43,679
So I'm glad you agree I think we're crazy cool what's happening now and I think

1157
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:47,263
Even brighter

1158
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:53,663
Is simply Market preparedness and bringing customers along with the journey and

1159
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:56,223
Evolution

1160
00:49:56,479 --> 00:50:00,063
A couple years ago if you were to go into a customer and you'd say

1161
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:06,463
Okay are we going to do an LED retrofit you know half the time the customer would say well I'm not so sure

1162
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:12,863
And now when you go in everybody recognizes hey doing LED is no brainer and saves 50% of my

1163
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:16,191
My lighting energy it's got a tutu for your payback

1164
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:18,751
And it makes a ton of sense to go do

1165
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:23,615
I would say we're in a similar point where the LED Market was a couple years ago

1166
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:27,711
Today as a relates to the digital adoption cycle where

1167
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:34,367
Not every customer is convinced it's something that they need to do that said I think we'll give this a bit of an advantage and

1168
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:37,439
Co-op from a market adoption perspective is it

1169
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:39,999
Number of the types

1170
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:44,607
Solutions as a relates to the software applications that we want to enable

1171
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:47,679
Are out there today and people are consuming them

1172
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:54,079
What we're doing is giving them the real-time data that makes those Solutions even more powerful even more

1173
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:55,871
More valuable to our customers

1174
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:57,919
And do you think you'll ever

1175
00:50:58,175 --> 00:50:58,687
Reach that

1176
00:50:58,943 --> 00:50:59,455
Partnership

1177
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:00,223
What kind of role

1178
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:01,247
Where you're sharing

1179
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:04,831
Swear you're actually really moving the needle

1180
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:07,647
Consumption

1181
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:17,375
Yeah you know I think the other all of these ideas around as a service models that will pop up

1182
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:23,775
Which I think fits into a little bit what you're talking about there but do you think about energy as a service or space suit

1183
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:25,055
Realization of the service

1184
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:31,199
There's a lot of really interesting models that are coming up and is part of those new models are coming online

1185
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:38,111
Customers are looking at shared-risk models to go along with it so you know as an example of

1186
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:40,159
Are there a lot of s goes out there

1187
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:42,207
Energy Services companies

1188
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:48,607
It will go in and and their business model is to take a portion of the savings energy saver

1189
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:50,911
The day enable for their customers

1190
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:53,983
Not today that's not a model that we are are

1191
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:58,591
Lighting you're pursuing it's really something that we've taken a look at and I think

1192
00:51:58,847 --> 00:52:03,967
And we'll have to see how the market evolves in terms of where is that right balance

1193
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:07,039
Perspective simply

1194
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:13,695
Giving the tools and enabling the capabilities but ultimately up to the customer to achieve their own outcome

1195
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:16,767
I or will it evolve into something where

1196
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:20,095
Your service is really starts take over and it's

1197
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:25,471
The outcome that's being delivered as opposed to the tools to do it it's going to be interesting to see how eyeballs

1198
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:27,519
Man is it I am excited to see

1199
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:28,543
IFit app

1200
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:31,103
You and me both

1201
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:33,151
I would be remiss if I did not ask you

1202
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:34,943
Cuz GE right now

1203
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:36,479
Is in the headlines

1204
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:38,015
With all kinds of

1205
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:40,063
Selling assets left and right

1206
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:43,647
Kinds of drama and a lot of that seems associated with it

1207
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:44,927
Digital transformation

1208
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:45,951
And so

1209
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:47,743
GE lighting and

1210
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:49,023
Current are both

1211
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:49,791
For sale

1212
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:51,327
So I just wanted to find out

1213
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:52,351
From you

1214
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:54,143
Where that process is

1215
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:55,935
And understand

1216
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:57,983
Did ge's transformation is that

1217
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:01,055
Formation of

1218
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:06,687
Well I'd say a couple of things no one right now GE is really needing to

1219
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:09,759
To go through eye refocusing exercise

1220
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:16,415
And where they've landed is to say there are going to be three core businesses for GE going for lb 80

1221
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:17,951
Jason Aldean

1222
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:23,071
Healthcare in OB power and current today doesn't fit into that

1223
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:24,863
Inside configuration

1224
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:31,263
So we're going out on our own as it works income will be finding new home over the next couple of court

1225
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:33,567
Which were excited about

1226
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:39,967
I think she is got to focus right now they don't have time and effort and resources to focus on current so will be

1227
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:40,991
Going to a place

1228
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:47,391
It does have that capability and capacity in uniform it from a digital transformation perspective I think

1229
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:51,999
Is really led the way for GE we are the first

1230
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:58,399
Truly digital industrial business with Angie's portfolio where we are enabling new types of

1231
00:53:58,655 --> 00:54:00,703
Outcomes by combining both

1232
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:07,103
The historic Hardware business in this case lighting and augmenting that to create new types of business model

1233
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:13,503
Those with the digital capabilities that we've been discussing their so we're really a first in that regard and we're really excited about

1234
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:15,551
Stop taking that Ford in a new device

1235
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:19,647
Alright thanks so much for coming on the show to talk about all this

1236
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:26,559
My pleasure thank you for having me

1237
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:32,959
And remember if you'd like more iot news sign up for my newsletter at Stacey on iot

1238
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:39,359
Will see you next week
