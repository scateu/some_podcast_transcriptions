IO

40
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:04,160
Alright Kevin the big news this week comes I'm going to save for the Enterprise and Industrial side which is the Wall Street

41
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,696
Journal reported that GE

42
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:09,024
He was considering selling off some of its a digital businesses

43
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:09,792
V

44
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:16,192
Proposals here are at servicemax business which helps get service Personnel in installers in people to fix stuff

45
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:16,960
Out into

46
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:19,008
To the field managers those employees

47
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,288
Therapeutics

48
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,056
Business

49
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,336
Might also be on

50
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:28,736
That's a time-series database analytics and all sorts of good stuff that they've been marketing for a really long

51
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,272
The industrial average

52
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:33,088
And a couple other Acquisitions they made

53
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,112
Radium

54
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:34,880
Which was a

55
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,416
Audio Analytics

56
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:38,976
Company that does Predictive Analytics

57
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:42,304
Prediction machine's fail so there's a lot Happening Here

58
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,656
We haven't talked much about it but GE for the last year or so is really been

59
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:49,728
Oh struggling is not the right word

60
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,312
Coming to grips with a new reality might be a good way of putting it

61
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:56,384
Basically they're like all of that marketing dollars

62
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,408
Can I spend a lot on

63
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,200
Digital transformation

64
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:01,248
It was just too rich for their blood

65
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:03,296
And basically there

66
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:05,856
Slimming down there selling off all kinds of division

67
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:09,184
And it's not a huge surprise but it is a sad thing

68
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:09,952
Because

69
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:14,816
GE really created the industrial iot that in actuality but in terms of Market

70
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:15,840
Probably

71
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:18,144
4 years ago there like a virgin spend billions on

72
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,192
Send by God they did

73
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:23,264
They didn't think was like 2015 so maybe

74
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,800
3x years ago put

75
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:27,360
They said they want to be like a top 10 software

76
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:33,248
And even closed but that didn't get close to being a top 10 software company but they

77
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,784
Had a huge software

78
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:35,808
Right

79
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:42,208
It's right but the thing is in this is interesting at the eclipse Foundation had a little study for cloud services do you

80
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:47,584
Use planning use or any of the following cloud service offerings for implementing your it solution was the question

81
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,144
Of course AWS docker azure

82
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,680
Private on-premises cloud

83
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:52,960
Google Cloud the top

84
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:55,264
4 and like my own vast majority

85
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,080
The very last one with a 2.1%

86
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:59,616
Choice was GE fridge

87
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:00,896
That was probably in

88
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:01,920
LGE custom

89
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:06,016
They learn a lot of things

90
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:10,880
The hard way like they started building their own data centers to host the products analytics stuff and

91
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:11,904
Everybody was like

92
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,440
G I don't want to talk to you

93
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,464
Amazon

94
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,536
It's a reinvention of the wheel at this point as well

95
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:20,607
And then they also were very ambitious in terms

96
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:21,631
Is hiring people to

97
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:24,447
Sell this so like I don't think it was a mistake

98
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:27,007
Because I think there's a lot of there there

99
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:29,311
But I do think it was a bit early

100
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,359
And they spent a lot of money

101
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:33,407
On the marketing side

102
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:35,455
Did they couldn't necessarily backup

103
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,735
On the other side

104
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:37,759
I mean

105
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,807
The really interesting thing

106
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,087
If they sell this

107
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:45,695
And still they're not we're not sure they're just said they were selling digital assets and it's not clear which one

108
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:46,463
One second a cell

109
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:49,535
But if they sold something like products I think of you

110
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,071
Who the heck's going to buy products

111
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,863
You know that's it's a

112
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:57,215
So would it be would you want to see like a Microsoft or someone

113
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:58,239
Come in.

114
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:00,287
I don't think they want to but

115
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,591
This is what I think I'm going to explore this weekend

116
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:04,895
Epicurious cuz

117
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:06,175
The people that come to mind

118
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,991
There will be some overlap there but I'll be curious what you

119
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,271
Did you

120
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:11,807
My deductions

121
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,391
In other sad news

122
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,415
Is for the internet

123
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,207
Oh man it's like

124
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,743
Everything's coming home to roost

125
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,791
Way back in 2014

126
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:24,863
I read about a company that I just loved it was called

127
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,655
Well the device was called mother

128
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,447
The company was called cents

129
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,727
Send that essien

130
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,263
Dot SE

131
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,311
Azusa French design company

132
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:37,151
And they put out a smart home hub called the mother and then they

133
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:39,455
About little sensors called peanuts

134
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:42,527
That you basically program to be like asleep detect

135
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,807
Motion detector

136
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,599
Or any number of things

137
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:46,367
And

138
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,391
I loved this is

139
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:51,231
I thought it was it didn't give me the programmability cuz I was super nerdy on

140
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:53,279
Yeah I was like the smart thing

141
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,559
Person back then

142
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:59,679
I was like I love spending time tweaking these things making these weird recipes to do weird stuff in my house

143
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,959
Before everybody else

144
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:04,031
This was a really well-designed pretty in

145
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:04,799
Cute

146
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:05,823
Cute cute

147
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:06,847
Cute device

148
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,127
And sadly this company

149
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,151
Apparent

150
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,687
Yeah the little

151
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:12,223
Mother Unit looks like a little

152
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,295
Squash bowling pin videos remind me the current Google home

153
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,343
In some regard it was a cute product

154
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,111
Yeah

155
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:20,159
I mean and I love the fact that he

156
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:22,207
These things where you can buy these peanuts in

157
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:22,975
Program them

158
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:23,743
Basically the

159
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:24,511
You flash them

160
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:26,303
So they have the algorithms they need to

161
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,327
To do like

162
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,863
Truck sleeper truck stop

163
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,167
Really well I even

164
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,191
Remember putting

165
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:32,959
Through the wash

166
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,543
Yeah so if you have that product

167
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,079
Tell you

168
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:40,127
You might not have it working for me

169
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,943
What is that cost back in the day I'm trying to think

170
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:44,735
Cost

171
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,015
300

172
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,831
It cost 200

173
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,111
$99

174
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:53,183
And I should tell you that the creator of this system

175
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:53,951
Was it

176
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:57,023
We're going back in iot history he's the guy who found the

177
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,047
Now that's

178
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,071
Stacked I don't know how to

179
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,631
It was a connected rabbit and it just

180
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,679
Glow different colors and people loved it

181
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,959
So yeah

182
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:06,751
Bye-bye mother

183
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:07,519
Bye-bye

184
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:12,127
There we go and I still to this day would like just a sensor that I could

185
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:15,967
Stick on top of like my dog food container and just have it be like

186
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,503
Has anyone fed the dog

187
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,295
I wanted to tie into metal made

188
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,087
Okay

189
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:23,135
So that was our sad news segment

190
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:25,183
Of the show let's talk about

191
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:30,047
We don't talk about homepod that much why is that

192
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,327
Because it's not good

193
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,095
Okay then

194
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,119
That settles that

195
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,423
There just hasn't been much in the way of

196
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:38,495
Development lately I mean week through AirPlay 2

197
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:41,311
Was announced maybe a month ago

198
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:44,639
The latest IOS 12 beta beta version

199
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:48,223
5 which I have not upgraded to yet however it includes

200
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:54,623
The ability or at least the setup ability to use the homepod to make phone calls so this

201
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,415
Has to do with the way Apple

202
00:07:56,671 --> 00:08:02,559
Uses continuity that's the function where you can spread data and activities around on different iOS devices so

203
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,375
You can pick up a phone call on pretty much any iOS device is it

204
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,911
It's tidy your iPhone and so on

205
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:10,495
So that will come in homepod with probably I was 12 I think it's a fair

206
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:11,263
After Beth

207
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,055
Really it's kind of table Stakes to

208
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:15,871
Do this kind of stuff that I think you're a little late here but

209
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:20,991
It's coming so that's good nothing else to talk about though cuz nothing else has happened with homepod

210
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,807
And

211
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,111
I only talk about it

212
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:29,695
Ann's Apple just had their quarterly investor

213
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:30,719
Chicagoland

214
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,255
No reports this week

215
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:35,839
And homepod is lumped in with their other category which also includes

216
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,887
They're your phone's there

217
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,447
Watches Etc that's a growing segment

218
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,727
They did talk about

219
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:45,311
How strong those products are for the other category

220
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,335
Not a peep

221
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,103
Of homepod

222
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:50,687
Not it's growing not its meeting expectations

223
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,711
Zippo

224
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,783
Read into that

225
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:55,551
What you will

226
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,343
Okay guys

227
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:59,647
We're here there's going to be like a hundred of you

228
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:00,927
Maybe more I don't know

229
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,207
We're going to find a center

230
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:08,607
But it is heavy duty heavy duty but very specific in its there is a

231
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,423
Okay it's either

232
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,191
Mackinaw

233
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,215
Moschino

234
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:15,263
Or, do you want to go with the pronunciation

235
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:18,079
No I'm going to go with one of those two I'll say

236
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:18,847
Mackinaw

237
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:19,615
Mackinaw

238
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:23,199
This is a device that has

239
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,223
Mini input

240
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:27,039
And you pop it into a pie and you can control

241
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,319
Your smart home

242
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,879
These are four devices that you actually

243
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:33,183
I can wire them into it so

244
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,207
Like maybe you want to

245
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:35,999
Create like a special breaker box

246
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:40,095
Used to measure electricity consumption your house or even Italian to some

247
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,375
Appliance somewhere

248
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:43,167
This is too hardcore for either of us

249
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,215
But I would agree

250
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:48,543
If you are a doubly or just really into this stuff

251
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:49,567
Baby

252
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,359
Perfect for you and

253
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,383
Is it out yet

254
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:59,295
I don't believe it is out yet what you can do is you can sign up to say you're interested on the the website

255
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:04,159
Which is makinen., she puts on the show notes cuz I don't want to have people type it based on a pronunciations

256
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:06,463
What could be wrong though it's not available yet

257
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:07,743
Yeah it's

258
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:10,047
Built on a lot of Open Source

259
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:13,887
Raspberry Pi read E46 input outputs

260
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,935
You're right that you're going to be hard wiring a lot of stuff

261
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,983
But if you're that kind of guy

262
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,799
This might be a great product for you so

263
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:23,615
Check it out if so far if we haven't scared you out feel like

264
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,407
We'll do it live

265
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:31,807
You know I'm thinking about you wouldn't have to hardwire a lot of things because your pies going to have Wi-Fi and Bluetooth

266
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:37,183
And I'm only saying that because now that I look at the web interface for the switch axe looks very pretty

267
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:39,999
In terms of controlling things you know they've got a light

268
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:42,559
Is one of the switches and their temperature sensors

269
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:45,887
You're not going to hardwire everything in your house this one little box

270
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,703
So there should be Wireless connectivity through the pie

271
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,263
Okay but there is the option

272
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,287
Control wire should you

273
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:55,615
Oh yes there is I mean you can

274
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:57,663
Home and there's analog inputs that

275
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:02,015
You can configure for all kinds of currents and resolutions oh my yeah

276
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,295
So

277
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:06,111
Check it out if you're interested sign up and

278
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:06,879
If you get it

279
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,159
Tell us know what you think

280
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,183
Yeah

281
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,207
All right

282
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:12,255
This is for the industrial people out there

283
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:14,559
Your cellular modems are now Gateway

284
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:17,119
Sierra Wireless just introduced

285
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,167
The airlink lx40

286
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:19,935
And

287
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:21,471
You don't need to remember that

288
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:23,519
Specifically but the idea behind

289
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:27,871
This line of products from Sierra is that you get the cellular modem

290
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:29,407
And you also get

291
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,175
A gateway

292
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,199
Weight is part of this

293
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:34,527
And that will handle things like analytics of

294
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:39,647
The information coming in so basically you don't have to send every piece of data up to the cloud

295
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:43,999
Which is important when you're at a cellular connection because by God that band with this

296
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,535
Pensive

297
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:49,375
So I know that we talked about this in the home like why aren't our routers

298
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,143
Also

299
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,959
UPS on the case of the Enterprise world

300
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:56,031
Your router's are indeed at home hubs but

301
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:58,079
Enterprise Hobbs that can do some

302
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,615
Fairly reasonable computer

303
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,407
Seems good to me

304
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:07,807
Yeah I'm going to Pick n Save on van with costs on a cellular connection that can be a lot of money depending on how many devices you have implemented in

305
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:08,575
And so on so forth

306
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,623
Seeing it supports LTE

307
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:13,183
Em&m dirt both

308
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,719
So that's good

309
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:16,255
Power over ethernet

310
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:17,791
Battery Master

311
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,071
Pretty nice

312
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,095
Okay

313
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:20,863
And

314
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:21,887
This is in the

315
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:22,911
What the heck

316
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,703
Category Kevin

317
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:25,727
In his

318
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:29,567
Search his regular perusal of the FCC database found

319
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:30,847
Wait a second

320
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,639
No no

321
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:35,967
You make it sound like nobody else check the FCC database two or three times a day

322
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:36,991
Oh well

323
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:40,831
Sorry I meant

324
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,391
Surely there are other people who

325
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:47,999
Check it more than I do but you're right and then you were going to say I found a Lenovo smart bulb

326
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,535
And when I found it I'm like

327
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,303
Who

328
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,583
Emmanuel Lenovo

329
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,143
They make phones computers and so on so forth

330
00:12:54,399 --> 00:13:00,543
But a smart bulb and I checked I could not find a single Lenovo iot product maybe I just didn't look hard enough but this

331
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,567
This appears to be there first

332
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:02,847
Foot in the door

333
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:07,199
I guess it was smart home if a wifi-enabled smart home and I only know that because they have

334
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:11,551
CC tested the 802. 11bgn end

335
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,343
Make it particles on it so

336
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:16,159
I guess it's exciting for Lenovo but

337
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:18,207
Not really for the rest of us is it

338
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:18,975
I saw the sign

339
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:20,255
Miss Marple

340
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,279
Yeah

341
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,303
Why

342
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:26,911
I don't know why this is everyone's intro product if I were doing an intro product for the io

343
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:27,679
31

344
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,471
I probably would do something highly Spa

345
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:31,007
Pacific just because

346
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,335
Try to integrate with others because we're so far into the

347
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:36,383
But if I were going to be like a giant

348
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:42,527
Smart outlet because they're so much more versatile and because

349
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:50,207
I mean I'll keep looking maybe they have a suite of products that are coming I don't know I mean this has not been announced yet

350
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:53,279
Clear on that maybe two days for results

351
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,303
Indicate that

352
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:56,607
Tickets an outlet and a hub in

353
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:57,887
Lord only knows what else

354
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,679
I don't know but I will keep looking

355
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:01,471
There we go we have

356
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:03,519
This is not DIY but in the world of coke

357
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:06,079
Control4 which is kind of Defense here hiring

358
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,615
Connected home stuff

359
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:08,639
We have

360
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:11,199
Suntrup Hyundai introduced an intercom feature

361
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:11,967
End

362
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:15,807
I thought this was interesting because it basically turns your control 4 system

363
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:19,135
If you have it any touch panel that you have turns into a

364
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,695
Prudential screen that you can talk to from your smart

365
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:25,535
Which and you can also to see video clips like from your connect

366
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,303
Doorbell

367
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:28,863
So I thought this was interesting for anyone who has these

368
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:29,631
Systems

369
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:32,703
And I also went to a dealer to actually check out the

370
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,239
Control4 system because they

371
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,263
Launched

372
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,079
With their dealers a very comprehensive

373
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:38,847
Smart Home

374
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:39,871
Showroom

375
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:42,431
So if you have one of those fancy high-end

376
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,967
Home automation

377
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:44,991
Dealerships

378
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,271
Pop in and check out

379
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,807
The control for stuff cuz they

380
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,343
Created a really compelling

381
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:50,623
System

382
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:52,159
It's actually cheaper than I thought it would

383
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,695
Sol cerveza

384
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:54,719
And

385
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:56,511
Yes this is difference when Elsa

386
00:14:56,767 --> 00:15:00,095
You're buying it all at once and someone's going to install it and then

387
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:03,935
You know there's I think for the intercom it's part of like a $100 a year

388
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:08,031
Service fee but if you're like many people in your like I do not want to

389
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:10,847
Program a smart home I do not want to install all this stuff

390
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,895
It's not an unreasonable thing to do

391
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,175
So

392
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:16,991
I'm taking a guess here that this intercom

393
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:20,575
You said be thinknear use your phone and communicate to one of the panels

394
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:22,111
I guess I'm going to be on the same Wi-Fi

395
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:27,999
Don't you can actually do it from your phone when your remote that's what I was going to ask me what vehicle feature

396
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,791
So you could actually I could be

397
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:32,607
You know at work somewhere and

398
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:34,911
Intercom back to my house and talk to my wife

399
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:40,287
It's basically the same way I have used the Echo Show with my daughter when I'm traveling and

400
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:42,079
The way you might use

401
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:42,847
Google

402
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:46,943
Duo program

403
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:48,223
What's Duo

404
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,295
Sorry sorry sorry

405
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:55,391
So actually this gives us a choice

406
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:58,975
I like your new product that you just bought

407
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:01,535
Or should we talk about these silliest iot product

408
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,839
Tricky Bowman suspense a little longer

409
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,631
It'll keep them in suspense

410
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,655
Alrighty

411
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:10,751
Let's talk about your first impressions of the Lenovo smart display

412
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:16,383
All right so I ordered the Lenovo smart display the 10in Honda del Sol at 8 in Persian

413
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:19,967
Late last week when I was first available and I'm going to say

414
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:22,783
If you haven't ordered one yet and you're a Costco member

415
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:28,415
Take a look at Costco because I paid 199 for the larger one which everywhere else that's the price

416
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:30,719
For the smaller one normally it's 249

417
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:36,095
$50 savings are there a derived about 36 hours ago so I got some more

418
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:40,191
Testing to do my first impressions remember Stacy when you when I saw this

419
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:43,263
Sexy yes in January and like we pretty much fell in love with it right away

420
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:46,079
All those feelings came back

421
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:49,151
Right away you didn't regret your field

422
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,687
Not at all

423
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:54,271
Not at all I am super impressed so far with it

424
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:57,599
They're easy to set up you do all the setup with your phone

425
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:59,647
Through the Google home app

426
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:02,719
Get off that your Wi-Fi password is just a code here or there

427
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:04,255
Very very easy to set up

428
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:07,583
Display is fantastic it's a full h

429
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:13,471
Pictures of full HD display the larger one but it's a 720p display on the smaller one so you get a better resolution on the large one

430
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:16,287
The speaker as I know a lot of people are going to want to know

431
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,823
I'd say it's better than the

432
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:23,455
Stand-alone Google home but he's not going to compete with a homepod or Sonos it gets loud

433
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:28,831
Like those but the face is just not going to be there it's more scooters that the higher end of the sound

434
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:32,671
I don't see any microphones on this thing but obviously it's got a microphone array

435
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:33,951
One thing I've noticed

436
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:40,351
This is really meant to be facing in towards the center of a room so to speak Lee I put this on the nightstand in the

437
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:42,399
Bedroom we'll talk about that in a minute

438
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:45,471
Most people would not put a product like this there but I'll explain while you can

439
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:51,871
You know it's the screen it's not something I can sit in the middle of the room because you can't see it then from the other side

440
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:53,151
It's the same issue we have with the echo

441
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,943
We just going to turn it around with

442
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:59,039
But I will say though I mean I got a tangled

443
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:03,391
On the corner of the nightstand facing into the center of the room and it's been pretty good

444
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,159
About listening

445
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:06,207
But obviously I'm not behind it so

446
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:07,231
That helps

447
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,767
ABC's built-in with

448
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:11,327
Google Assistant some of the features

449
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,351
Are cool

450
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:15,423
Wake Netflix is actually built in so I can just say

451
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,727
AG play such-and-such on Netflix

452
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:19,519
And boom it just starts playing on the

453
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:22,079
Awesome 4K videos on YouTube

454
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,103
Actually

455
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:25,663
YouTube is also built in

456
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:26,943
So that would work

457
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:29,503
What's not till 10 but still works

458
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:36,159
Is YouTube TV which is I switch my service providers now from PlayStation Vue to YouTube TV however

459
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:42,047
Smart display is a cast Chromecast basically it's a receiver so anything you can Chromecast

460
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:47,167
To the Chromecast you could send to that so I did that with my phone Chromecast and YouTube TV

461
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:53,567
I was watching the news and then I put huh I wonder if I can voice control it so I said Haji change to channel

462
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:54,335
10

463
00:18:54,591 --> 00:19:00,735
On YouTube TV it sure enough it did it so even though YouTube TV is not built-in and other services are not yet built in

464
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:04,063
Is casting you can voice-control it just like it was made over there

465
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,111
That's awesome down here this is

466
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,391
Really nice but I'm

467
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,159
I'm very curious

468
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:10,463
I have too many photos on Google photos

469
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:12,767
Is it possible for me to set that up

470
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:15,327
In spare time when it's not being used

471
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:17,375
Corgi videos in my house

472
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:19,167
Could I actually just have it run

473
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:20,191
My Google photos

474
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:25,311
You absolutely could because there are three options for the display when you're not using it

475
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:29,407
When's the next standby mode I'm just using the base clock display because

476
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:31,455
At night in the middle of night I want to see the clock

477
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:35,295
You know I want to see anything else but another one is Google photos

478
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:39,647
And then I think the third one is just kind of like what you have on a Chromecast like a backdrop future worth

479
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:41,183
Google just provides photos

480
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,207
Nice

481
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:42,975
Okay

482
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:43,743
Now

483
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:45,023
Let's talk about

484
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:45,791
The nest

485
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:48,863
Let's talk about that so

486
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:53,215
I've been tested everything but I would say anything that integrates today with Google home

487
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:59,615
Should certainly work with this display and that includes video streaming I know somebody on Facebook asked us if

488
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:01,407
Pekin Stream ring

489
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:03,711
And wyze cameras to this

490
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:07,039
You can't because you can't they don't agree with Google home today

491
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:08,831
Is problem with a platform not with this

492
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:10,111
If that makes sense

493
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,391
It's on sand

494
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:12,671
It's possible.

495
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:18,047
I did test messed my Nest hello doorbell camera and

496
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,887
Just you know it's a Haji show my front door that's the name of the camera

497
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:27,519
And what did you say about 6 7 Seconds of latency from the time I asked it to the time and actually showed it

498
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:28,543
Yes we got

499
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:31,103
Few seconds like maybe two seconds of like

500
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:33,151
After you ask where it's like sending it to the cloud

501
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:33,919
Thinking about it

502
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:36,223
Okay and then you get before second Subs

503
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,759
Spinning Wheel pulls up

504
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:40,063
And that's on the same Wi-Fi

505
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:41,599
It is

506
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:43,903
I mean it's not instant

507
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:50,303
It's probably the same performance as I see with my Nvidia Shield TV when I'm watching TV and I can just voice command because that's a crime

508
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:52,607
You can also pull up

509
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:53,631
Was that your nest

510
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:55,935
That was the nest doorbell

511
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:58,495
I have another nest camera

512
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:00,031
But I didn't test that

513
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,591
I just presumed it would work because one did

514
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:03,615
Never assume in

515
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,455
She part of my testing

516
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:08,991
Challenge now is

517
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:11,551
I got to go home we can so dependent on

518
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:17,184
Amazon for controlling the harm that I really never set up the rooms and devices in Google home very well

519
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,464
So now I need to do that

520
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,744
So part 2

521
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,024
Will be

522
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,072
More in-depth on how the Google home

523
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:23,840
Works with the

524
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,632
Which is

525
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:26,400
Today

526
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:27,424
Bye

527
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,448
Not by who

528
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:34,592
Let's wear this way if you are already into the Google platform for your voice user interface

529
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:35,616
With your smart home

530
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,920
I think this is great if you have a

531
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:40,736
Play sport I mean yes could be in the kitchen where you can do

532
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:44,320
Recipes and other things you want to watch YouTube or TV in the kitchen

533
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:46,368
We put on the nightstand and as I said

534
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:48,160
We normally don't put things like this

535
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:51,232
In the bedroom and I say things like this meaning it has a camera

536
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,024
Yes I was going to tell people I'm like

537
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,560
Yeah I know it does have a camera

538
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:57,632
Does Kevin actually now with this I could call

539
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:58,656
Kevin on Duo

540
00:21:59,168 --> 00:21:59,680
And it just like

541
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:00,448
Pops up

542
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:04,288
Write in fact I said Haji call Stacy and it says

543
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:10,688
Video call or voice call and I just say video and it called you on Duo the devices typically best in lands

544
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:13,248
The only thing that works in portrait mode because you can switch

545
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:17,600
This device is kind like a dual stand the only thing that works in portrait mode is Duo

546
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:18,880
Can't have it set up

547
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:20,416
Fuse in portrait all the time

548
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:23,488
And when I did do that you said my video got a lot better I wasn't

549
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:24,256
Extract

550
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,024
For a little while

551
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:30,656
Yeah which may be a good thing but anyways going back to the camera itself

552
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:33,472
There's a hardware built in switch

553
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:34,240
Shutter

554
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:37,824
Hover built into this device you just flip it down and it a little

555
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,152
Red indicator on that says hey I've covered up the camera right now and

556
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:44,736
And also an impact the device itself will say the camera is now off

557
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:47,808
Just like you if you muted the microphone it will say the microphone is now

558
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:50,368
All right

559
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:54,208
Real quick it's touchscreen to even talk about all the voice stuff but

560
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:56,000
You can navigate through touch

561
00:22:56,256 --> 00:23:01,120
Like when it said you want to call video voice I could have tapped the screen so there's a lot to his prerogative

562
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:02,656
So far I am loving it

563
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:05,216
Okay well I can't wait to get mine

564
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:06,240
And

565
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:11,104
Will come back to you in a week or two and check in on the home performance

566
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,408
Aspects of this and I'm sure you'll rights

567
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:14,176
Something up at some point

568
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:15,968
That was an assignment

569
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:16,736
That wasn't

570
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:21,088
Okay

571
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:22,624
And let's see

572
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,648
Kevin

573
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:26,464
Good Pro tip from you and then we'll get into a crazy idea

574
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:27,488
All right

575
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:33,888
So it's funny because it's before the show Stacy you're not at your home your way right now and you would said my hug at

576
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:35,168
Home is not responding

577
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:38,496
It's so funny brought that up because I was going to share this pro-tip

578
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:40,544
What do you do if you can't

579
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:44,896
Access your hubs in remotely maybe need to be rebooted etcetera etcetera and on the wink

580
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,176
Facebook page

581
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:47,200
People have

582
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:50,016
Talk about this and that first thing people said was

583
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:52,832
Plug your Hub into a WiFi smart

584
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:55,136
Outlet and I never thought of that but it's

585
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:55,904
Brilliant

586
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,696
Because you can remotely access

587
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:58,720
Bat Outlet

588
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:00,000
To reboot the Hub

589
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,024
Yes

590
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:01,792
And

591
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:06,912
I talked to people who actually have their routers plug into a smart outlet and they actually schedule so it just

592
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:08,960
Power Cycles through at like 2 a.m.

593
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,264
So hey

594
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:12,288
Good idea

595
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:15,104
Okay let's talk about I'm calling this

596
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,664
My silly iot product

597
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,456
Haven't you actually it do this

598
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:23,040
I am are you ready let's get naked

599
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:26,112
Not you not you and me not I'm not listeners

600
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:29,440
The product is called The Naked home body scanner

601
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:30,720
It's not what you think

602
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:35,584
You don't get naked on this you still can wear clothes although it's probably best to wear

603
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,608
Minimal clothes

604
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:39,168
Maybe underwear whatever it is a

605
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:40,960
Scale that you step on

606
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:42,240
As well as

607
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:43,520
A mirror

608
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:46,080
That has the top of it one of Intel's

609
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:47,616
Prosense sensors

610
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:51,200
Sensors for 3D Jap and

611
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:57,344
Descale actually rotates you 360° wireless sensor checks you out

612
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:58,368
Yeah

613
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:00,928
You have to howl

614
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:03,488
How else would it get your 3D body composition

615
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:06,048
I mean I guess the mirror could go around you but no

616
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:09,120
It's okay

617
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:11,680
Okay so I'm on this turntable in my

618
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:12,704
Skivvies and it's

619
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:19,872
And it basically uses the infrared sensor to scan you and

620
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:21,664
Attend will create

621
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,432
3D

622
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,480
Map remodel in a Connected app

623
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:26,272
To show you what you look like

624
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:28,832
And it does body fat composition weight

625
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:30,368
Azure sizing

626
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,392
Body parts

627
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:33,952
Well

628
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:40,608
I don't know what to tell you I mean if that's the whole point is to measure and then the idea is it's for Healthy Living and as you transform your

629
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:44,192
Body by living healthier you get a better sense of your progress

630
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:46,240
And I think that's actually great

631
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:49,056
I don't know if I would pay $1,400 for it

632
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:52,896
But whatever you actually raise a good point before the show with this

633
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:54,176
Isn't used for but

634
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:55,968
Should be used for an I love this life

635
00:25:56,736 --> 00:26:00,064
Yes this is the only reason I would ever shame myself into getting on 80

636
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,088
Table that would

637
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,368
My body fat composition

638
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,392
Which is

639
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:04,672
If you could use this

640
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:07,744
Actually send those measurements to like a shopping

641
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,120
Excursion select Amazon or to Nordstrom's and then they be like oh well in the following Brands you're a size

642
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:15,680
And then the other bands are a size 8

643
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:17,984
And that would be amazing cuz then you could like

644
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,336
Buy things online in Ashley try it on virtually and it would actually be

645
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:23,616
Supposed to

646
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:27,712
Now what you're just like all by two in different sizes and send one or both back

647
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:32,576
I wonder if that infrared scanner could actually do that could it detect

648
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:35,904
I measure you so to speak actual converted into inches and so on

649
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:36,672
Converse sizing

650
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:37,440
Oh yeah

651
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,464
Judging by the

652
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:41,024
Judging by what it offers now I think

653
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:45,888
I guess I just because you're going to stand on this little turntable

654
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:49,216
And you may place it further away each and every time and it's going to have to

655
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:51,776
I mean I can measure the depth I guess so yeah I guess I could work

656
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:56,384
Yeah even if it's going to tell me that because it says it offers you measurements of like your biceps

657
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:57,408
Waste India

658
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,712
Hips and all of those other body parts

659
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:02,528
Play tabs but I only have one I have an app

660
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,552
You mad

661
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:05,344
You got it

662
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:06,368
But yeah

663
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,672
So that is our crazy product of the week

664
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:12,768
If you have $1,400 and no dignity you go right ahead Just Like Heaven

00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:16,096
And let us let us know I'd be curious to see how it works

666
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:19,936

667
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:26,336
Pictures of model where I don't blame you but they're not pictures it's kind of like bringing the TSA security scans

668
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:27,360
Oyster House bad for health

669
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,128

671
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:29,664

00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,520
Question that we actually

703
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,592
Hi Stacy and Kevin

00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:32,384
This is Dan from North Carolina

705
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,968
I'm hoping you can help me with an idea I have for using my wyze cam

706
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:38,528
I'm pretty mainstream on the smart home I use

707
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:40,064
SmartThings to control lights

708
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,856
A few other things in my house

709
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:42,880

00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:50,816
There is not a wyzecam the SmartThings integration yet but both of those system

713
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:52,352
Do you have if immigration

Answer on the wyze cam

716
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:58,752

Turn on

718
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:01,568
But I can't figure out how to do it and I don't

719
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:02,336
CNS

720
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:03,360

00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:08,992
And as a side note

723
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:13,088
Assuming that there is a way to do it I wonder if there's a way for the light to then turn

724
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:14,368
Turn off after few minutes

725
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,904
Thanks again guys love yourself

726
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:17,952
K Den

727
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:18,720
I have good news

728
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:20,000
I have mostly canoes

729
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:22,048
Which is we can actually do this

730
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,840
So the way you would do this

731
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,632
Is you go to f

732
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:26,656
I went to

733
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:28,960
Austin sauce look up why

734
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:31,520
So the wise motion is a trigger

735
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:33,824
So when it senses motion we can trigger something

736
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:35,360
And in this case

737
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:38,688
We can trigger a SmartThings device to turn on

738
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:39,456
So

739
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:41,504
This is very easy for you to make yourself

740
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,272
And

741
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:46,368
If you were having troubles just email us and I'll make an applet for you and send it to you

742
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:48,160
You basically

743
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:48,928
Turn on

744
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:49,696
Your

745
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:50,464
Light

746
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,488
We can't

747
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:52,256
Get it

748
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:53,792
Ted turn off after

749
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:55,584
So

750
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,608
That is the

751
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:57,632
Imitation

752
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:58,400
A vest

753
00:29:59,424 --> 00:29:59,936
Which

754
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:03,264
It would be nice if you could say you know after no motion detected

755
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:04,800
Per 5 minutes Etc

756
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:07,360
Can you turn it off but I don't see any trigger done for that

757
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:11,456
So you could try and I went into SmartThings to see if there was

758
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,224
They have app

759
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:13,248
And SmartThings

760
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:16,320
But you could use since wise is not supported yet by smart

761
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:18,880
Now it's

762
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:19,904
Possible

763
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:23,744
That you could create an app in smart things for the state your porch light

764
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:27,328
Turn on if the porch light has been on for more than

765
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:28,096
10 minutes

766
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:30,400
After a certain time

767
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:32,704
You could create a SmartThings app that would turn the

768
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:35,520
So then you're looking at creating an if tablet

769
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:36,800
And then a

770
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:37,568
SmartThings

771
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,848
Automation

772
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:39,872
So

773
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:45,248
You know what this is an interesting use of the wyze camera any camera that has motion detection

774
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:46,272
And I guess

775
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:50,880
The dance trying to do is innocent because the why is cancer so darn cheap I mean is 20 bucks

776
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:52,416
Because what you could do

777
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,464
Throw another alternative out there

778
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,768
Buy a motion detector

779
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:58,560
Motion sensor that works with

780
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:01,120
SmartThings and what are you say they would cost

781
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:02,912
40 bucks

782
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:04,704
Yes it probably like a Z-Wave

783
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:11,104
And just use that because then you could actually have not just light turn on but you could probably set it to turn off as well

784
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:13,664
That's pretty typical fare for a motion set

785
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:14,688
Yes

786
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:16,736
But it is

787
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:18,784
Because basically everything

788
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:21,344
Cups of coffee and tea

789
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:25,440
So bad

790
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:26,720
Is our answer for you

791
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:27,488

Smarter homes

810
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:02,304
Start with c

811
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:06,912
And that concludes this portion of the show stay tuned for a message

812
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:08,448
Shemar sponsored Netgear

813
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:09,216
And

814
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:10,496
An interview with

815
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:12,544
Chris Smith from Otis Elevator

816
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:17,664
You sure is there story about building a predictive algorithm for the elevator what went wrong

817
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,200
Eventually went right

818
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,224
Annie tells us

819
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,016
If the door close button

820
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:24,064
Actually works on these things

821
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:25,344
Stay tuned for that

822
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:31,744
Everyone we are taking a break from this week's Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor this week

823
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,328
Sponsor is Netgear and I have John McHugh who is

824
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:37,888
A senior vice president of commercial

825
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:38,912
Parking at

826
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:41,472
Most of us know what is but

827
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:45,056
Do you want to give us a short summary a lot of people do no nut here

828
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:48,640
But they don't know that they actually we have a very important

829
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:52,480
Strategic role in commercial networking for small businesses

830
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:54,272
Especially for kind of do-it-yourself

831
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:56,064
Business owners and small office

832
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,344
Is home office business

833
00:32:57,856 --> 00:33:02,976
And before this we were talking and you said the networking needs to change for the internet

834
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:04,256
You talk about

835
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:05,024
What you mean by that

836
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:07,328
Yeah you know it's so funny because

837
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:08,096
The internet

838
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:10,400
Saints runs over networking

839
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:14,752
And the ironic part of this whole thing is networking hasn't changed

840
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:18,848
In the last 10-15 years and it's not taking advantage

841
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:20,384
Of all the power

842
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:24,736
Potential that is brought with good Internet of Things implementation

843
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:28,832
What is that mean for Netgear and how you guys design your product

844
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:29,856
Like I said

845
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:31,392
All networking devices

846
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:34,208
By definition are connected to the network

847
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:38,304
They can be connected to the internet as won't be iot

848
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:43,168
But nobody designed them to do that thing back there two things that really I think make

849
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:44,448
An Internet of Things

850
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:45,984
Things to buy one is

851
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,776
Did user interface

852
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:49,568
Hilton connected to the cloud

853
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:53,408
And it's remotely accessible a drawers on the internet to do

854
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:56,736
Really much more advanced user experience capabilities

855
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:57,760
And the other thing is

856
00:33:58,016 --> 00:34:00,064
Did it immediately can find the cloud

857
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,368
And get connected to the cloud NFC

858
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:06,720
Cure in a reliable Manner and those two things haven't really been address

859
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:10,304
Networking product until today

860
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,096
Designing your products

861
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:16,960
How did you implement a better user experience and this idea finding the cloud

862
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:17,728
And that was

863
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:19,264
Exactly what we start out to

864
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,032
To do cuz we

865
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:26,432
Other people that were kind of doing internet-of-things networking sort of connected and where they made

866
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,736
Things that jumped off a

867
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:29,504
The page to us

868
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,528
One was

869
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:32,832
A bunch of cloud connected network devices

870
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:35,136
Don't work at all without

871
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:36,672
Cloud will guess what

872
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:38,720
People's internet goes up and down

873
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:40,768
And especially small business owners

874
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:41,792
There's a lot of

875
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:45,120
Complexity of getting something up and rounding that doesn't just

876
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,912
Turn on and run for you

877
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,960
So the first thing about our inside

878
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:49,728
Cloudconnect

879
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:51,776
Is when you turn them on

880
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:52,544
State-run

881
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,848
Exactly the way existing products

882
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,408
The other thing that we wanted to make

883
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,784
Extremely easy was for this thing to automatically home to the cloud and get Uconnect

884
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,064
Without local

885
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,880
Servers are Cloud keys or

886
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:08,672
Weird things you have to put on your network

887
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:11,744
You just discovered the device with an app on your phone

888
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,512
And boom

889
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:14,560
You're connected to the cloud you're connected

890
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:15,328
Sebastian Vice

891
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:17,376
Those were the two things we really

892
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:18,656
Wanted to do differently

893
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:22,752
Okay sounds good where can we go to find out more about netgear's

894
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:28,128
At www.netgear.com inside

895
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:42,720
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest

896
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:44,000
Is Christmas

897
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:46,304
Who is VP of service Innovation that

898
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:47,328
Otis

899
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:48,096
Are they turkey

900
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:49,888
Hi Chris how are you doing today

901
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,168
I'm doing great steaks

902
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,192
Thanks for having me on

903
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:53,984
Man I am super excited

904
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,264
Because

905
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,800
They're like the thing that allowed

906
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:58,080
Skyscrapers actually

907
00:35:58,336 --> 00:35:59,872
Steel with that but then we also need Adele

908
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:01,408
Water jet

909
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,176
You guys

910
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:03,968
So you guys are now doing

911
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:05,504
Connected elevator

912
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,832
And you are very clear.

913
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:11,136
So tell me a little bit about the role of

914
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:12,160
Communication

915
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,768
Sure so you know it's 30 years ago when we transition

916
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:19,328
From older relays called relay logic Tech

917
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,608
The microprocessor

918
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,424
It was a big change for our mechanics

919
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:24,704
And the mechanics

920
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,776
Needed some help literally instead of tracing wiring diagram

921
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:31,360
GrandStay had to there's this black box a PC board that had all the in

922
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:34,432
So our engineers said you know what

923
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:36,992
Let's come up with a way

924
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:39,808
How to remotely Connect into an elevator using a

925
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:44,416
Dietary homegrown REM system we called it Ram remote elevator Bonner

926
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:45,952
And analog phone

927
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:49,792
So we would dial in and help troubleshoot the information

928
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:53,632
It was designed to be read by a very senior experience

929
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:54,656
Engineer and

930
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:56,960
Was for them to help and kind of thin translate back to me

931
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:59,264
Pentagon hey this is what the issue is

932
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:02,336
So for 30 years we've been doing that

933
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:03,104
And evolving.

934
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:07,200
Technology and then of course the new technologies came along called The Internet of Things and

935
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:10,272
Industry 4.0 and we said we need to do this a

936
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:11,808
And that's where we are today

937
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:14,368
Is product called Otis one

938
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:16,416
And you still use microphone

939
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:18,464
So what exactly is changed

940
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,256
You're swapping out your analog phone lines

941
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,816
Borgia cellular initially

942
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:24,096
You know we'd eventually

943
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:26,912
The landline or buy firewood

944
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:31,008
Comfortable with just yet in their buildings we will

945
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:33,056
Use that but initially our initial product

946
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:35,616
Cellular and we're not building this ourselves

947
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:36,640
Parking without a cup

948
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,688
Tell you about another's work

949
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:39,712
I can't right now but

950
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:43,808
We didn't take the data off the elevator put it through a gateway

951
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:45,088
Do some Edge computing

952
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:49,952
With some of the data those that which we need to process and then we send it to the Azure cloud

953
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:50,720
One of our Park

954
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:54,048
Is Microsoft and Course once it's in the cloud that's where you

955
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:59,680
Do all your big data analytics and get all these different Insight switch before it was for that engineer

956
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:02,752
But now it's insights that we can give it directly to a customer

957
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:04,544
Biba directly to our mechanics

958
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:07,360
In it to anyone else

959
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:09,664
Reporting. End-user the passenger

960
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,944
You can even start connecting

961
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,224
The elevator in ways I can say

962
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:15,552
So it's done in a very different way with partners

963
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:17,856
Okay

964
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:19,136
We're going to dig into all of that

965
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:21,440
Temptations project to do but

966
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:23,744
What does enable your customers to do

967
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,048
What are they excited about when you offer

968
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:30,400
Yeah tour customers actually have no we done extensive

969
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,168
Research over the

970
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:32,448
Jerry cancel

971
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,240
Customers tell us they want

972
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:35,008
Predictive

973
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:36,288
Proactive and Tran

974
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:38,080
Predictive text

975
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:41,664
The first thing is everyone's heard about it hey I don't want things to break

976
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,480
I want my elevators to be up and running we call that up.

977
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:46,272
So that's the first thing we do

978
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:47,040
You can do with that

979
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:50,112
So elevators are the outside doors with

980
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:51,392
Proceed actually

981
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:52,672
70%

982
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:53,696
All shutdown

983
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:55,744
So one of the advantages of doing this

984
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,280
For 30 years connecting elevators

985
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:58,816
We have a lot of data

986
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:00,352
Elevator shutdown

987
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:03,424
And so we did the Pareto chart and says okay if you're going to come

988
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,448
What are you

989
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:07,264
First and we said okay let's go after these door calls

990
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:13,152
How do we prevent door calls and so we took all this data and working with vendors and we have a research center

991
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:14,944
Because United Technologies Research Center

992
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,992
Bunch of really smart phds

993
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:19,808
We came up with an algorithm that helps us

994
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:21,856
Predict when the elevator maintenance should be

995
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:24,416
It actually was an interesting Journey when we started

996
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:25,952
Predictive Solutions

997
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:27,232
We were trying to figure out a

998
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:28,768
Exactly when the elevator was shut down

999
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:30,816
In quite frankly it wasn't very sick

1000
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:35,936
What we were able to then do is when we went to our Research Center they said you know you're looking at the problem

1001
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:37,728
Wrong way you really can't predict

1002
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,544
Like your doctor can't predict you know you have 27

1003
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,080
Years and 3 months to live

1004
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:43,872
The doctor can predict your health

1005
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:49,760
I can't your health your numbers are going up or down and keep doing this change this and that's what we are able to do

1006
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:50,528
Squishies

1007
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:52,576
We were predicting now we predict

1008
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:54,880
And therefore

1009
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:58,720
Time when to send a mechanic to get there to do the preventive maintenance

1010
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:04,864
So instead of saying when is

1011
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:05,888
It's not feasible

1012
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:07,424
Is it not feasible

1013
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:11,776
Well at least four doors we went through successfully shifted that mindset

1014
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:13,568
Again I don't want to say we can't get there

1015
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:15,360
Someday but you know now it's within range

1016
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:17,152
We know below a certain

1017
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:18,176
Score week

1018
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:21,760
Score at we say that's now in the yellow category and we should get out there within

1019
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:23,040
21 days

1020
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:25,088
And when it goes red we like oh no now we need

1021
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:25,856
To get out there with something

1022
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,648
So it's not as

1023
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:29,184
We were trying to get it really precise

1024
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:31,744
But when we

1025
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,512
Talk to health

1026
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:33,792
And trending health

1027
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:35,072
That's when we started

1028
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:36,096
Great results

1029
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,168
Just help me out here how many factors

1030
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:41,216
Are there in an elevator door close

1031
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:42,496
Closing play into the

1032
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:44,800
Well dozens and dozens

1033
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:47,872
Because the elevator doors ride on a sill you mites

1034
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:49,408
See that when you walk cross news

1035
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:50,944
Ridges in it and so there's

1036
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,528
Call Gibbs that keep the elevator in the seal and that still can get dirt in

1037
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:56,064
Which has nothing to do with the elevator

1038
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,112
How to do how much dirt is being tracked

1039
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:59,648
The building was there contractor

1040
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,184
Building the elevator

1041
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,464
Doors run on roller

1042
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,768
And the rollers you know again in

1043
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:05,536
That's on a track

1044
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:06,304
Back in the game

1045
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,096
Dirt and debris in Elevator Shaft

1046
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:11,936
Similar to a chimney so everything is where's the building located

1047
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:13,472
What time of year is it where's the

1048
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:18,592
The front door when the front door is opened is all this wind coming in and going up the chimney so

1049
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:20,384
Different job site conditions are

1050
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:26,784
A critical time of year is critical what's going on the building so we will see you don't see a nice smooth trend

1051
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:28,576
Building a

1052
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:33,440
Office building three stories we should see the same Trends know it's all

1053
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:34,720
Mothers of Aries facts

1054
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:36,256
Geography

1055
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:38,816
So now let's we talked about for your custom

1056
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:41,120
What is connecting your elevators

1057
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:42,144
In this fashion

1058
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:43,424
Do for you guys

1059
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:48,800
Oh so ultimately if I can when the customer say I want predictive I want pract

1060
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:50,848
Xidan transparent obviously if we can

1061
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:51,872
Keep our customers

1062
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:54,431
Inform and give them all those three things they don't want to leave

1063
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:56,479
Sprint so they want to stay with us

1064
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:58,783
Notice you're giving doing a great job

1065
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:01,087
I will continue with under a maintenance agreement

1066
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:02,879
Can you having a service you

1067
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:04,159
Competitive industry

1068
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:05,439
We have anyone wants

1069
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:08,255
Product with a good reputation

1070
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:09,535
Competitors would love to have our

1071
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:11,839
So then you start getting into a price game

1072
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:12,607
Yes you can

1073
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,655
Chilton like why would I leave for

1074
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:15,935
A few dollars cuz Otis's

1075
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:16,703
Lighting X

1076
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:19,519
And we should point out for people that

1077
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:22,079
You might buy an Otis Elevator

1078
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:23,615
And put it in your building

1079
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:25,663
Over the years you also have two choices

1080
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:26,943
Choosing contractors

1081
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:30,015
It's not right

1082
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:31,551
Some people might think

1083
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:32,575
Clearly

1084
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:33,599
If you don't work out your own

1085
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:36,159
Duct a c if I had a nickel for everytime

1086
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:39,743
Someone said to me you don't have any competition do you you're the only elevator come

1087
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:40,511
I'd be very

1088
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:42,047
Now we have plenty of

1089
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:43,839
Listening people do on their elevator

1090
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:49,215
Okay so continuing on

1091
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:49,983
With your

1092
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:50,751
Benefits to you

1093
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:53,823
So the other key benefit to us

1094
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,615
Is we can start scheduling

1095
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:56,639
More practice

1096
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:58,687
So in my example earlier

1097
00:42:59,199 --> 00:42:59,967
We now

1098
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:00,991
Return day

1099
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:02,015
Reactive

1100
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:03,039
Murphy's Law

1101
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:04,831
Situation where is Murphy's Law

1102
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:07,391
For a mechanic I was just in the middle of doing it

1103
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:08,415
Detailed maintenance

1104
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:10,463
Routine at this one building and then I got a service

1105
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:13,023
And now I have to leave pack up my tools and

1106
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:13,791
Drive

1107
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:16,351
And driving is the most unproductive timing

1108
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:18,399
And get to the next building inmate

1109
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:21,215
So obviously now when we can say no

1110
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:22,239
We think in the next

1111
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:23,519
5/7 days

1112
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:24,543
21 days

1113
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:26,079
Elevator a

1114
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:27,615
In this building is going to shut down

1115
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:28,383
The doors

1116
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:29,663
We can now schedule that

1117
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:31,199
Put it into his maintenance

1118
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:38,111
When he's going to still be there so think about it the customer was going to have a shutdown they were going to have someone come and look at

1119
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:39,391
Shutdown ended

1120
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,695
The doors but it's going to be after a very

1121
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:42,719
Tinsel events

1122
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:44,767
Now we are still getting that same service

1123
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:45,791
Beginning a corrective

1124
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:47,583
And we can put into an ice maker

1125
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:49,631
Schedule as opposed to being reactive

1126
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:50,911
Totus more efficient

1127
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:53,215
What metrics are you implementing

1128
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:54,751
To account for

1129
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:56,031
Things that don't

1130
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:57,823
Because it's really hard

1131
00:43:58,335 --> 00:44:00,127
As we start making things more efficient

1132
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:05,247
It's harder to say hey this terrible thing didn't happen and it was because of us

1133
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:09,855
Exactly until that's where the transparency comes in place

1134
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:11,647
What we're doing is for sharing with

1135
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:12,671
Sonic custom

1136
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:15,487
Portal for sharing with them their health scores available

1137
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:18,303
Lyrics to show them and then when we do do a proactive

1138
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:22,143
Close to react if we also showing them that as well hey

1139
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:23,167
We came and did maintenance

1140
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:24,959
Because your elevator door health

1141
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:27,263
Sending negative and therefore your main

1142
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:28,031
This is being done

1143
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:32,127
Before we only shared with them hey we did a call back and we only shared kind of the bad

1144
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:33,919
So now we're sharing

1145
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:34,943
The bad news in the good

1146
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:36,735
And so that hopefully of the

1147
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:38,271
Scentsy while you guys are

1148
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:40,831
I do have 99.9% uptime which

1149
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:42,111
But there's a reason

1150
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:43,647
Write instead of just

1151
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:44,415
Just unlocked

1152
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:47,743
Because I can see the maintenance you're doing in the timing that you're doing it

1153
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:49,023
And my building is in the

1154
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:50,815
Our customers tell us if

1155
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:53,119
If you could delimited one thing for us

1156
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:54,143
Illumination

1157
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:56,703
Shut down

1158
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:59,007
Okay this overarching trend

1159
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:02,335
You know I see it in my connected devices I see it

1160
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:03,359
Industrial

1161
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:04,895
If we leave Eliza

1162
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:05,663
A lot

1163
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:06,943
People having trust with

1164
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:10,271
Because I can see a lot of people being like

1165
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:12,063
What is this

1166
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:15,391
Came out did this right

1167
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:16,415
Feeling like

1168
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:17,439
Padding your numbers

1169
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:18,719
Does people wear

1170
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:21,279
Playwright

1171
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:25,119
Transparency is key but how do you think other companies trying

1172
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:25,887
How to do this

1173
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:28,191
Create that trust

1174
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:33,567
Have their bills or insert some sort of

1175
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:36,127
Yeah yeah

1176
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:37,663
You know I think the other keys

1177
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:39,711
You saying is to share with the cuss

1178
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:41,247
Tomorrow at the line of sight

1179
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:42,271
Where they will have to

1180
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:43,551
Most mechanic

1181
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:46,623
Trevor Wright elevators will not last

1182
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:49,695
The building is now a hundred years old original elevator

1183
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:50,719
It needs to be upgrade

1184
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:57,119
Great there's new needs in the building they need to move people faster in the building so they can have to upgrade the machines and make it faster in the

1185
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:58,911
Brains to make it move faster

1186
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,959
So when you can give

1187
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:03,007
And it's all good

1188
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:04,543
Apparently but give that customer

1189
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:06,335
Because of the data you're getting

1190
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:07,615
Usage information

1191
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:09,663
Like your car hate my tires are going to last

1192
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:11,199
So many miles between an oil change

1193
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:13,759
That's the same thing you have to start giving that customer

1194
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:15,295
That line of sight that

1195
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:17,855
Customers understand hate I know eventually

1196
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:19,391
I know we got to change my

1197
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:21,695
So here

1198
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:25,791
With data you know what you're going to get another hundred thousand trips out of that door

1199
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:27,583
Operator before scot-free upgrade

1200
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:29,119
Cricket in this is going to cost

1201
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:29,887
This much

1202
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:32,447
And it's three years out to want you start putting away some

1203
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:38,079
Any of the next thing that's going to go is your machine but that can last a million trip

1204
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:39,871
And you're so many trips out from that

1205
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:40,895
Start investing

1206
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:42,175
You're putting this song

1207
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:44,991
I think that's where then you're truly are

1208
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:46,783
Kiss I hate surprises

1209
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:48,063
It's right no one wants to hear

1210
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:51,391
Hey I guess what you have to spend $20,000 on this system

1211
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:52,927
And just like we didn't budget.

1212
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:54,207
Well feel sorry

1213
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:55,487
But you need to do it

1214
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:59,327
That's true okay that's a good point I like that okay and finally

1215
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:01,119
What is his offer to

1216
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:04,191
The people who ride in the elevator

1217
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:05,727
The people who are waiting for

1218
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:07,519
Is there anything that

1219
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:08,799
You can build off of

1220
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:10,335
You're one platform to

1221
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:13,663
Yeah so you know what you're saying and that's

1222
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:17,503
Passenger experience we are talking a lot about it in our customers are talking

1223
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:18,783
How do we improve

1224
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:21,087
Audi can you make it seem

1225
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:22,623
I don't have to

1226
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:23,391
Presents

1227
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:26,463
Security badge and then go up in

1228
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:29,023
Identify myself Uniden pick which elevator

1229
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:31,583
So I can check myself into

1230
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:34,143
To the building using my phone which 10 knows that it's

1231
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:35,423
8 in the morning

1232
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:36,959
And I work on the 12th floor

1233
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:40,799
And if therefore seamlessly assigns me the elevator to get on

1234
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:42,847
So that kind of seamless pastor

1235
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:44,895
Elevators are knock

1236
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:47,455
Straight people don't know where to look

1237
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:50,271
Where to turn should I talk to somebody who I know but they're

1238
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:52,063
Three other people in the elevator

1239
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:54,367
It's so giving them some infotainment

1240
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:55,391
In the elevator cab

1241
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:57,951
Your music different things like that we actually Alex

1242
00:47:58,207 --> 00:48:00,255
Recalling a talking elevator

1243
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:02,047
Integrating Alexa

1244
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:03,071
And Cortana

1245
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:04,095
And when we

1246
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:06,911
Put this at a trade show recently the amount of excitement

1247
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:08,447
Star Trek

1248
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:11,519
4 Captain Kirk would get on and say you know Bridge

1249
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:14,079
And the elevator were just taking to the bridge and you know

1250
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:17,151
The idea of going into an elevator and say take me to mister Smith's off

1251
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:18,687
Instead of having to remember

1252
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:25,343
On the 12th floor so it's things like that that you start making the ride a little more fun and more

1253
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:29,695
Have you actually tried out mattimeo

1254
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:30,975
China Inn

1255
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:34,559
I just feel like it would be super awkward to be shouting out

1256
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:36,095
Take me here take me there

1257
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:37,375
Take me to my divorce lawyer

1258
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:39,167
I don't know

1259
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:41,983
So we've done it demonstration

1260
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:43,263
Big trade show

1261
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:45,823
They got a lot of interest you're right they're developing

1262
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:47,103
Believe It or Not developers of the

1263
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:48,127
Most interested but

1264
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:51,711
Particularly they saw an initial application and let's say in a residential

1265
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:55,039
We're in the Residential Building typically there's not too many

1266
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:55,807
People riding elk

1267
00:48:56,575 --> 00:49:00,671
So that could be very helpful in a commercial building where there's any

1268
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:01,439
5

1269
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:06,559
12 people on the elevator one time you're right I think we have a ways to go but the only certain applications

1270
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:07,327
They can see this

1271
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:08,095
Speed working out

1272
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:09,631
Okay cool

1273
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:11,167
So let's not talk about

1274
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:12,191
My goodness

1275
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:13,471
How have you are

1276
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:18,591
I thought it's a little nerdy but you know we talked about Edge Computing and

1277
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:22,175
Predictive Analytics I don't know what you're doing

1278
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:24,735
What is this look like from

1279
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:25,503
Physical

1280
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:26,271
Technology

1281
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:27,039
Perspective

1282
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:31,647
So you know for Otis elevators obviously we know the language right

1283
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:33,695
With the brain and how it talks so

1284
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:36,767
Those elevators we can pull information directly off

1285
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:42,655
The controller and we like I said we put it to an edge Computing device where some information is just in from

1286
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:44,959
Usage things like that you don't have to say

1287
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:47,775
Send that up every elevator

1288
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:50,079
Is it for a bank of elevators

1289
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:53,151
Yeah that the Gateway can be shared between monks

1290
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:55,967
There's a limit but the Gateway can be shared

1291
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:58,015
But every elevator itself would have

1292
00:49:58,783 --> 00:50:01,855
I so wanted to buy spur elevator but then the Gateway can be shared

1293
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:03,903
Okay so

1294
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:06,463
You're sending it to the Gateway some of it goes to the cloud

1295
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:08,255
So we send it

1296
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:09,279
And in the cloud

1297
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:10,559
That's where we

1298
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:11,583
How to State a witch

1299
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:14,655
We can share with whatever information we need if it's an immediate shutdown

1300
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:16,703
Elevator

1301
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:17,983
We know it's a meter

1302
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:20,543
Right that'll make this meaning this isn't going to

1303
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:21,311
Self heal

1304
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:22,591
Do we have things that at

1305
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:23,615
Kind of grocery

1306
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:26,943
And that we meet Lee

1307
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:28,223
Send notification

1308
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:31,807
And we've actually been now informed the customer that you know

1309
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:33,087
Instead of you calling us

1310
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:34,111
This is where practice

1311
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:35,647
Which by the way

1312
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:38,719
In the old way 99.9% of our customers

1313
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:39,487
Call this a couple

1314
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:40,255
Use an app

1315
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:42,559
Say hey Malibu

1316
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:43,327
Shut down

1317
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:45,119
You say really who are you where are you

1318
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:46,655
Okay we'll send a mechanic

1319
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:52,543
DayQuil with this now we know when the certain fault codes are it's a hard shutdown in the only thing it's going to fit

1320
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:53,823
The sound of a cat

1321
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:55,871
So instead of waiting

1322
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:57,407
You can imagine in the building

1323
00:50:57,919 --> 00:50:59,199
Sometimes hours we work

1324
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:01,759
Say we just found out her elevator is down for 3 days

1325
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:03,039
We now know me

1326
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:04,831
Be much more proactive

1327
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:07,391
We send the info so we kind of

1328
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:08,159
That

1329
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:10,719
Computing says none of this is really important data

1330
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:13,023
Information I need to send this up immediately and it's

1331
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:14,815
Straight the eyes we didn't notify differ

1332
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:16,607
Systems and say this is a shutdown

1333
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:18,143
Send a trigger to the customer

1334
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:19,423
Senator going to mechanic

1335
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:20,703
Everyone know that

1336
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:23,775
We need to get out there and fix it and then other information is just

1337
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:25,055
More like I said

1338
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:25,823
It was more kind of

1339
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:30,175
Useful information how many trips did it make on Tuesday afternoon what's the most

1340
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:31,455
Know how many trips

1341
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:33,247
Did it make in a day and that's it

1342
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:34,271
Information now

1343
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:36,831
Help us with predictions it will help us with

1344
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:37,855
Estimating how long

1345
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:40,415
What is not critical information

1346
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:44,511
And like I said earlier we use cellular technology to

1347
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:47,327
So how much data does

1348
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:48,351
Elevator generator

1349
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:49,375
How much data

1350
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:52,703
It's less than you think and then month

1351
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:53,727
Probably about

1352
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:55,263
When is less than 20 megabytes

1353
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:57,823
Really it's not that much now it depends on if

1354
00:51:58,335 --> 00:52:00,895
If you move into voice and video and things like that

1355
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:01,919
The date is

1356
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:03,711
When it's just

1357
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:07,295
Regular data just deleted off an elevator is not a lot of data

1358
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:10,111
Okay and that you're sending

1359
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:13,439
Powdered is 28 overall

1360
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:15,487
Yeah that's much less data than

1361
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:17,279
Yes small packets

1362
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:20,607
I've been conditioned by the GE airplane

1363
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:21,631
Tangent example

1364
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:24,703
So what other

1365
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:26,751
Technology iot initiative

1366
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:27,519
Are you guys in

1367
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:35,455
Stacy was a pleasure you know we were part of a society or this one is bigger part of a bigger service transfer

1368
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:37,759
Cremation and we started with giving all of

1369
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:39,039
IPhone screen

1370
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:41,343
So

1371
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:42,623
That is a plastic

1372
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:44,159
Which stem weed adult apps

1373
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:46,207
So now that we have this

1374
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:48,511
Common platform we can share information with the

1375
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:49,279
Mechanics

1376
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:52,351
Much easier but I'll give you an example of one app that are mechanics really low

1377
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:53,375
It's a party

1378
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:54,399
So 106

1379
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:55,167
55 years

1380
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:57,471
You can imagine there's a lot of different elevator

1381
00:52:57,983 --> 00:52:59,519
Anatomy course all the competitors

1382
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:01,311
So imagine the parts list

1383
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:03,615
And it literally would take

1384
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:04,895
Hours for

1385
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:07,967
So we built an app where

1386
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:08,735
Steak and

1387
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:10,271
If I start typing in

1388
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:11,551
Product you working on

1389
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:13,599
Name it I know it's I know that

1390
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:14,623
It's a relay

1391
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:17,951
And I know it's on this type of elevator and then it starts shorting it

1392
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:19,999
4 man mechanics are saying it's saving them

1393
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:21,535
In the field

1394
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:23,071
Which means our customers elders

1395
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:25,119
So the oldest

1396
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:26,911
One in the iot is just

1397
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:28,191
Is part of a much bigger

1398
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:30,239
Transformation with your by the way also

1399
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:31,263
Involves the culture

1400
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:32,031
You know that's

1401
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:33,567
Animation

1402
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:34,335
Begins and ends

1403
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:35,103
Culture

1404
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:35,871
And although

1405
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:37,407
Digitalization that we do

1406
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:38,431
It's just the support

1407
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:40,223
So that was 51

1408
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:43,807
And my final question

1409
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:46,367
Are you close by

1410
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:47,647
On the elevator

1411
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:48,415
Actually

1412
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:50,463
So the answer is it.

1413
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:51,487
And it does

1414
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:54,559
Some buildings that doesn't in others it does so it really does

1415
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:58,911
And sometimes buildings can turn it off there some code issues about how long an elevator door shoe

1416
00:53:59,167 --> 00:53:59,679
Be open

1417
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:02,751
And then some people just choose to say no if it's going to be open for 10 seconds

1418
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:04,543
I want to hear it and other times they

1419
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:05,823
Allow it in this way

1420
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:08,639
So I guess the answer

1421
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:10,431
It depends

1422
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:11,199
It's okay

1423
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:13,759
I've always wondered I'd like I've actually never

1424
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:15,039
Can make it to the door opener

1425
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:18,367
People outfit

1426
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:19,647
I have no idea

1427
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:20,415
Put your hand out

1428
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:22,463
You stick your hand out

1429
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:25,791
Good elevator

1430
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:26,559
Exactly

1431
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:28,351
Thank you so much

1432
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:29,375
For coming on the show

1433
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:33,727
I really appreciate it that's it for this week thanks so much for listening

1434
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:40,127
