00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:09,984
Hey everyone welcome to the internet

2
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:11,008
Podcast

3
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:13,568
This is your house Stacey Higginbotham

4
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:15,360
Kevin tofel

5
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:19,712
On this week's show we're going to be talking about Verizon's new network for The Internet of Things

6
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:22,784
We're going to give you an update on last week's Nest story

7
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:25,600
And we're also going to talk about some new devices from the

8
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:31,488
Capri plus we're going to do a review of the wink relay that Kevin has in

9
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:35,840
Stalled in the middle of all this we're going to have a message from our sponsor macadamia

10
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:37,888
And after that we're talking to our guests this week

11
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:40,704
Corey Reed of John Deere about Precision agriculture

12
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:42,752
It's going to be a great show

13
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,312
Alright let's kick it off with

14
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:47,104
A new iot network

15
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:48,640
Verizon has

16
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:49,408
Teamed up with

17
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:50,176
Welcome

18
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:52,480
And last week launched

19
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:54,016
Okay here we go Cabin

20
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:55,552
LGE

21
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:57,088
Cat M1

22
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:57,856
Network

23
00:00:58,112 --> 00:01:04,256
Cat M1 number and we got

24
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:05,536
So actually

25
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:06,560
It's not that red

26
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:08,096
I figured it wasn't

27
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:10,656
I was just going to

28
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:13,984
With the Telco standards

29
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,288
It's that the GSM organization has its

30
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,360
CPT 3 piece

31
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:20,640
3gpp

32
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:22,688
1 G 3 and 3 piece

33
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:23,456
Got it

34
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:25,760
They actually for all their LT

35
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:26,528
Twohey's

36
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:27,552
And other version

37
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:30,368
Stop they have categories

38
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,392
So

39
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:32,160
Cat and

40
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:33,952
1 stands for

41
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:34,720
It's the it's the

42
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:36,000
Machine category

43
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:41,376
Unlike those Telco

44
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:43,168
Stages

45
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:44,448
You're so clever

46
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,496
Alright so you guys don't have to

47
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:49,056
I care about this what you do need to care about is

48
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,848
This is a cellular modem

49
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:51,872
That has

50
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:52,640
10 years

51
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:53,920
Battery life

52
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:57,504
And deliver speeds of

53
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,576
Between 200 kilobits per second and 400

54
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,368
So

55
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,160
Not crazy.

56
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:05,696
You actually do something

57
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,280
Especially if you're just sending random bits of data like

58
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:10,304
Temperature in time

59
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:14,912
Probably perfect for a M2M type

60
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:15,680
Transmission

61
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:17,472
Yes and

62
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,008
Am I thinking

63
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:22,592
Is that this is going to be kind of bad news first

64
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:23,616
Samantha Laura

65
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:25,920
Boats the Sig foxes of the world

66
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,968
Ingenue although

67
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:30,528
And I'm

68
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,064
These are all the folks

69
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,856
We're trying to create their own iot network

70
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:35,904
Yes there are actually have greater

71
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:36,928
Yes

72
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:37,952
And so

73
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,000
AT&T is testing

74
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:40,768
Cat

75
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:41,792
And1 net worth

76
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:42,560
In San Francisco

77
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:45,120
Verizon says there's is going to be out by the

78
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,912
Beginning of next year

79
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:47,936
Which is

80
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,216
Crazy fast

81
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,008
Basically putting this on their existing

82
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:52,544
Is justice

83
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:54,848
And I think

84
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,384
We'll see a lot of

85
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,152
Companies that

86
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,432
Leica Fleet Management

87
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,712
Those kind of Apple

88
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:00,480
Applications

89
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:01,760
Choose

90
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:04,064
A carrier because they're trusted

91
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:06,624
They know what they're doing presumably

92
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,928
Over some of these upstart net

93
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,464
I do think

94
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:13,280
That Laura and maybe sick Fox

95
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,072
Still have an opportunity

96
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:16,864
If you're like

97
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,936
Trying to build a service on your own like so if you're like

98
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:21,984
I'm trying to pick up

99
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:24,544
The big mining company whose Name Escapes Me

100
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:26,592
Rio Tinto

101
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:33,248
If you are Rio Tinto if you want to build a low-power wireless area network it may make sense for you just to build your own cuz you've got

102
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,808
So much you want to monitor in a limited area

103
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:36,832
But

104
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:37,856
Brother people

105
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:38,880
I'm thinking they're probably going to

106
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:42,464
I suspect you are correct

107
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,768
So the early first-mover type

108
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:48,352
Networks I mean I applaud what they've done but I I kind of

109
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,888
The same as you on this one

110
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,264
It's interesting to me that Verizon is also integrating its thing space

111
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,080
Platform-as-a-service within the modem

112
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:58,848
So they are

113
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:00,384
Cut a deal here with Qualcomm

114
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:03,200
Just before the show you and I were talking like this is that

115
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,736
Does that mean this modem looks

116
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:08,576
Exclusively use thingspace platform I don't think so

117
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:09,856
I think it's just a

118
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,136
Option in there

119
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,440
I think you're probably right it makes sense

120
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:15,488
This is great though because

121
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,024
For people who

122
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,559
Are not going to

123
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:23,935
Like you don't want to spend the time at building their own platform I just want to put a chip in it and have a cigarette sending data

124
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,727
This makes a lot of sense

125
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,007
That's great for Verizon

126
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:30,847
And it's good for actually think space

127
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:31,871
And

128
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:35,967
One of my my favorite little company's bug Labs is actually one of the

129
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:37,247
Core pieces of inertia

130
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,015
Traction things

131
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:39,295
Farm sale

132
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,575
Shout out to them

133
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,599
Good Vibes

134
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:42,367
Yeah

135
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:44,671
Set Verizon actually already has a

136
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:46,975
Customer for their new cat one

137
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:48,255
Cat M1

138
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,279
Iot solution

139
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:51,327
Because they also announced that

140
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,119
I said what's going on right now the

141
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,679
Ctia super Mobility

142
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:57,215
Super Mobility 2016

143
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:57,983
16 show

144
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:01,311
Verizon announced that it is working with a water metering

145
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,079
Company

146
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,871
Neptune Technology Group

147
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:07,711
And actually there are two other modems also Qualcomm modem

148
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,991
LTE modems

149
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,015
B

150
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,039
First one is

151
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:13,087
Pacifically for electrical

152
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:13,855
Utilities

153
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,903
Also has a 10-year battery life

154
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,439
And connectivity

155
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:19,487
10 megabits per second which really

156
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:22,559
It seems like Overkill to me but it is what it is

157
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:25,631
And then for water and gas companies will you get a

158
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:30,495
I guess someone call it a dumb down modem but you get one that goes up to 1 megabits per second

159
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:35,615
More than plenty both of these are I think Carly 2017 as well

160
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:36,895
Yes

161
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:37,919
And

162
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:44,575
The 10 megabits could be interesting for sending video I know that AT&T is also doing some work with Qualcomm

163
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:47,647
On their drone platform to send video from neutrons

164
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:48,671
Excel

165
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,463
Going to be really interesting now that the

166
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,231
Carrier

167
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:51,999
Like oh

168
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,279
We've really got to do this

169
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,071
So let's make it happen

170
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,375
Moving on to net

171
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,679
Last week we told you that nests

172
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,727
Are software Developers

173
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:04,031
We're going over to Google

174
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:07,359
And we were asking lots of questions about what that meant

175
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:08,895
Well I talked to Miss This

176
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:11,711
This weekend they said that it's not all of their software.

177
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:14,015
It is just those working with the work

178
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:14,783
Nest

179
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,343
So

180
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:19,903
The thought here is it there going to be

181
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,183
Creating this like

182
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:25,023
Singleplatform

183
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,047
PetSmart

184
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,327
But yes

185
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,631
They're going to create a single platform for

186
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:30,655
Nest

187
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:31,679
Google products

188
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:33,471
They work well together

189
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,775
I'm not a hundred percent sure

190
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:39,359
What that means for some of the Sanders that we seem like you don't believe that

191
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,127
There are two of them

192
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:43,711
But I think it's a really good sign because Google is clearly

193
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,503
With Google home

194
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,551
That hopefully we'll hear more about on October

195
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,111
Is a big play in the Smart Home

196
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:53,183
And it makes sense that they would want to integrate that with nest

197
00:06:53,951 --> 00:07:00,095
Yeah that's my hope is that if they're both there will be a Google home announcer cuz the product is supposed to launch this year

198
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:03,167
Google set an IO back in May

199
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:09,823
I don't know if I'm stages are going to talk about this aspect of it the whole works with nest and what they're doing with nests and how it

200
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,615
What size in a Google home if it does

201
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,407
But I suspect that follow up

202
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,711
Recording will hopefully give us answers

203
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:17,503
Indeed

204
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,271
And

205
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,551
We should also say that

206
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:27,743
It was this week or last week right after the show last week with the one-year anniversary of the on

207
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:28,767
Onhub router baidu

208
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:29,791
Have one about 1

209
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:32,095
As a consumer before I start working for Google

210
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:34,399
The one-year anniversary celebration

211
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,191
Added support for

212
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:36,959
Phillips

213
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:38,495
Hue light controls

214
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,287
Through your onhub witches

215
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:44,383
Sort of misleading in a sense because you still need the

216
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,919
Hue Bridge

217
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:50,783
And you access your lighting through the web

218
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,319
Can you go to

219
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:55,391
Oh shoot is it on me let me get it right

220
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,415
Let me get right

221
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:58,207
On. Here

222
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,487
In a browser

223
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,255
And once you

224
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,535
Go to on. Here

225
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,351
On your local network free web page will show you

226
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:07,423
The Philips Hue devices as well as any Chromecast

227
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,191
So that's

228
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,727
That's not exactly new their butt

229
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:10,495
So

230
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,287
It's kind of just taking the place of the

231
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:14,079
Hue app I guess

232
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:16,639
Really awkward way

233
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,455
What I would imagine is

234
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:22,015
Once you start building these Integrations

235
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,295
Between these two devices

236
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,319
For example

237
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:27,903
Maybe we're going to see more war Integrations on Beyond

238
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,951
I don't know again this Miss

239
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:35,583
This ties into like oh Google and Nest coming together and maybe works with Nest becomes the Google platform

240
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,863
Integrated Smart Home

241
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,143
Much like

242
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,191
Homekit is for apple

243
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:43,263
Speaking of homekit we should acknowledge that

244
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,311
Apple event

245
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,847
Set to happen this afternoon

246
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:47,871
Sarah

247
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:50,687
We're not talking about anything you have to wait till next week

248
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:52,735
To get our Impressions thoughts

249
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,783
If their impression / thoughts

250
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,319
Oh I'm sure there

251
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,439
We were never short of an opinion

252
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,207
True

253
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,487
Okay so

254
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,255
The other thing

255
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,279
Nest has

256
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,303
Hangout

257
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,071
I just

258
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:07,839
I can't

259
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:10,143
Having

260
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,935
That's just in the middle of

261
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,471
Let's just call it a crime

262
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:19,103
It's like the media is just beating up on it at lost its founder co-founding CEO after but

263
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,383
How much people like this guy is

264
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,919
Really micromanaging and kind of

265
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:25,247
There's a lot of questions like Google you spent

266
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:27,295
3.2 billion on this thing

267
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,319
And

268
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,599
Basically

269
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,391
No new hardware

270
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,183
So

271
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,719
Nest has

272
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:35,743
Decided to

273
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,535
Release new hardware

274
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:42,655
Actually there is actual physical Hardware

275
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:43,679
Today

276
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,447
Basically

277
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:46,495
It is launching the outdoor camera

278
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:47,775
You guys about

279
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,311
So that is happening and you

280
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,079
You can buy that

281
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,615
It is adding

282
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:53,151
3DO colors

283
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,943
To The Nest Thermostat

284
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:58,527
Which I kind of like wow you're in a lot of drama

285
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,295
A lot of pain

286
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:02,111
And you updated your thermostat

287
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:02,879
3D colors

288
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,671
Those colors are copper White

289
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:06,207
In a carbon steel

290
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:06,975
Black

291
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:11,583
That already has

292
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,655
That already exist everything will be available starting

293
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:15,935
For September 8th

294
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,983
With the exception of the white thermostat

295
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,263
Which will be available set

296
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:20,287
20

297
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,311
And

298
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:24,639
Then is also launching a new service

299
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,431
Called sightline

300
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:30,271
This is actually really interesting this is for the outdoor camera

301
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,063
Internet scams

302
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:35,647
And it's basically a way to comb through the

303
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,951
Hours of video that you guys are going

304
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:41,535
Cameras always on always recording

305
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,863
Basically recognize this when something significant happens

306
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,911
And then creates a thumbnail

307
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:47,935
Around that

308
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:50,239
I can send you that from now is it

309
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,007
Acacia

310
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,287
So

311
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:54,335
It's actually a really nice

312
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,127
So that's

313
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:59,967
Interesting to me because I'm seeing a big push for

314
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:03,039
The application of machine learning in Google products

315
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:06,111
Example would be if he's the inbox app

316
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,391
The smart replies

317
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:10,207
Machine learning is used to generate a smart replies and

318
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:12,767
That's kind of interesting so

319
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:16,863
That sounds like that's what they're doing cuz I also know that machine learning is what they've used

320
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:17,631
Photos

321
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,399
2

322
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:21,727
Help with identification of things and searches and so on.

323
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:24,543
Good I know I sent a lot of pictures of

324
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,567
My dog Norman

325
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:30,943
I was just showing somebody in photos like a let me show you know when I just type dog and boom every single dog picture showed up

326
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,223
It's not just search

327
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:32,991
It's also

328
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,783
Machine learning from what I understand

329
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,831
It sounds like that's what they're doing here

330
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:37,599
It is

331
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:40,159
I'm in it's important to note that the Dropcam

332
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:40,927
19 habits

333
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:44,255
Mission and vision as well

334
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:46,047
Write before Google bought them

335
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:49,375
And I assume that were continued when they got the influx

336
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,655
Scrum

337
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,471
Yeah so what this does is

338
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:56,287
Like what's a the UPS man is coming up to your door

339
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,079
The outdoor camera

340
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,615
Will just be like

341
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:02,175
I saw it in action like

342
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,735
Leaves blowing did not register ism

343
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:05,759
Bread at all

344
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,063
But a squirrel passing

345
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:08,831
See through

346
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,367
I'm passing through

347
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,391
Did

348
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:14,207
And you basically get this cool

349
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:16,767
Timeline view that has like

350
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,303
Thumbnails where something

351
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,095
Interesting changed

352
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,375
That I love because

353
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:24,959
Separates the signal of under noise really adds a lot of value

354
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:27,775
I like that

355
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:28,543
Who is the fastest

356
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:31,103
When it sends notification it will

357
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:33,919
Not it will say we think we saw a person

358
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:34,943
Or

359
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:36,223
We saw a person

360
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:37,503
Or

361
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,271
There is act

362
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,831
So there is activity is the lowest level

363
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,111
And that you get when

364
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,903
You don't like the Squirrel Run

365
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,183
Crossword

366
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,463
A car passes by

367
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,511
And then you'll get a thumbnail

368
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,047
When you click on that notification

369
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,071
That shows you the

370
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,375
So you can see

371
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,143
It's a raccoon

372
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,679
It'd be nice if you could

373
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:57,983
Kind of sum up or thumb down this

374
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:00,543
Can you teach it was important to you in a few

375
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,079
So you can't do that

376
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,359
I did ask about facial

377
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:06,431
Position in Africa

378
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,735
That doesn't seem to be

379
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,015
Priority

380
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,295
For them

381
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,063
Yeah

382
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,087
Maybe it will be

383
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,111
Overtime

384
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:17,183
It seems really good

385
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,975
And you can ignore

386
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,279
A lot of the notifications if you're like a

387
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:24,351
I don't really care if the car pass by I only lyrics

388
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,399
There is definitively a person here

389
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,191
So

390
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:32,799
That isn't that also helps at work and say it has a doorbell camera

391
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:33,567
To be honest

392
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,615
Schedule you should get your notification.

393
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,151
And then you can talk to the person

394
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:37,919
Outside your door

395
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,199
Sounds good

396
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:41,247
Sounds good we'll see

397
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:47,135
Daddy's out of trees how that works on the battery life and how many notifications you get depending on how many cameras you have

398
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:48,927
The Killer

399
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:51,999
But having had a camera facing outdoors I have

400
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:55,583
Welcome Cameron I had a facing outdoors and I was getting notifications

401
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:56,607
All the time

402
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:57,631
Because like

403
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:08,127
I was just going to say at some point it becomes so annoying that you stopped using the product you might as well just sit on the front doorstep and just watch for yourself

404
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,151
Exactly

405
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,431
Yeah so

406
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:14,015
That's the new Nest news out in that site line is going to become part of

407
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,039
Of the nest aware

408
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,063
Service

409
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:18,111
So you only get syteline

410
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,391
With the nest aware service

411
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:21,695
Otherwise normal users will get

412
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,975
3 hour

413
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:23,999
Window

414
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:27,583
If you don't pay for the subscription you get a 3-hour window of what's Happening

415
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,447
They're really upping the ante they're on the sea

416
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,983
Services

417
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,775
How to make money

418
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,311
Airport all that

419
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,103
Streaming video they're sitting in a

420
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:43,967
Okay that is the best news what else do we

421
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:44,991
We have we have

422
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,015
Oh

423
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,623
You out yet because you're going to use the

424
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,391
I will say it

425
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,927
De ligt wink

426
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,207
Hub 2

427
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:58,047
Cuz it before on the show we were saying the winkley Cub to inactive

428
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,839
Working on self

429
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,631
Dave's ass

430
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:06,239
Sue right there that's not funny, I'm also a good friend of mine that I saw this weekend

431
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:11,615
He shot me an email this morning said hey you might want to take a look at this on Reddit and sure enough

432
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:15,199
Somebody went to a Home Depot and was using a

433
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:17,759
Computer inventory system which

434
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,551
Why the ban on Reddit if that's

435
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,575
Publicly available.

436
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:24,159
People like I use it all the time I go and only one disease that I've never done that

437
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,975
But in case somebody did it they found

438
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:31,327
For $99 in the Home Depot inventory

439
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,607
Coming soon

440
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:33,631
Wink hub

441
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,167
2 499

442
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,703
Lux and then

443
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:39,007
There's also a link to Amazon

444
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:42,335
And if you go to Amazon you can find the wink Hub 2

445
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:45,151
Temporarily out of stock of course cuz I haven't been announced yet

446
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:48,223
I also she has a price of $99 so

447
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:50,015
We don't have much

448
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:54,879
Information on this because it's like I love my when Colin like what else would I want with it but

449
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:57,439
According to Amazon it says that they have a

450
00:15:57,695 --> 00:16:00,511
More powerful wifi radio in the wink Hub 2

451
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:03,583
And many people will be happy in Ethernet port

452
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,631
I don't want to

453
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,959
That's just me

454
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:11,007
I also a stronger processor

455
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,799
Not faster stronger

456
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,359
And more memory to make your smartphone faster

457
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:17,151
As if your smart home move switch it doesn't

458
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,199
They say that on Amazon that

459
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,991
Original wink Hub owners

460
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:24,831
Upgrading can easily transfer your ecosystem connected products in under a minute

461
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,623
And it's sleek

462
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:31,231
Modern industrial design makes it worthy of standing alone on your coffee table or bookshelf

463
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:34,303
Which you better hook your router is nearby if it hasn't even at ports

464
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,375
I'm still happy with the wink Hub so

465
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,935
There wasn't much missing but I think people will be happy with

466
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,239
You don't have to

467
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:45,311
No one's going to try your way no one's going to make you sweat

468
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:47,615
Having stronger

469
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:52,479
Given the timing.

470
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,807
And it clearly has a new Wi-Fi

471
00:16:57,343 --> 00:17:00,159
And I just saw this buried in the product

472
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:03,999
Prescription not in the bullet points it says hubba 2 is compatible

473
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:06,047
With more smart home technology

474
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:10,911
That lends a little Credence to your thought they're on homekit

475
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:11,679
It's possible

476
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:12,703
So

477
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:13,471
Maybe

478
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,775
We don't know when we're going to see

479
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,335
It is exciting

480
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,871
I would probably switch

481
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:20,639
Because

482
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:21,919
I actually

483
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:23,711
Want to put my wink hub

484
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:26,271
Not in the middle of my house

485
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:28,319
Would like to be hanging off my router

486
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:30,623
Cuz I have a lovely Little Shelter

487
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:35,487
On the floor in the hallway so I can point well taken

488
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:42,399
So I love this idea

489
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:43,423
I love

490
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,959
The idea that they're going to Knicks

491
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:46,239
The transition easy

492
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:48,031
This is kind of become

493
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,823
Table Stakes for

494
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,359
Upgrading your hub

495
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:55,967
SmartThings had an easy kind of upgrade pattern so did the Staples

496
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:57,503
Hub when it existed

497
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:00,063
And the Philips Hue also

498
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,087
What software

499
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,367
That's hard stuff

500
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:04,159
To transition your step

501
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:04,927
Easily

502
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,463
And best of all

503
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,487
We have to share this

504
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,023
It's a footswitch

505
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:12,607
Amazon list

506
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,911
Yes

507
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:20,031
Yeah you this will be hard to find if you didn't know you were looking for a look inside

508
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:21,567
Industrial electrical

509
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:23,871
Devices controls and indicators

510
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:27,199
Then industrial switches and finally the last subcategory

511
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,223
Foot switches

512
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:29,247
That's just

513
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:32,063
Things like I have a foot pedal for operating a sewing machine

514
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:36,671
So want to turn your lights on just kick the Hub 2

515
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:37,439
There you go

516
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,463
So yeah

517
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,487
And the price

518
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,279
Is a little bit more than the kuragin

519
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,303
Wink

520
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,839
Which I believe is going

521
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:45,887
At a high-end for like about a TB

522
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:49,727
But it's in line with the SmartThings second gen product

523
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:50,495
Rich

524
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:53,055
Okay and it's cheaper than Amazon Echo

525
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,847
Which insect has to make some money

526
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:59,199
Yeah I think they make money at all the other devices they make

527
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,551
Wheel of the wink hub

528
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:05,343
Well wait until you what

529
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,623
Think about this version

530
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,159
And this

531
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:11,743
Talk about perfect able to talk about the wink relay

532
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:16,607
Yes I only have one I don't know if you said earlier in the show relays but I only have one

533
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:17,887
Review unit

534
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:18,911
And it is installed

535
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:23,263
Kind of wish I had to because I could have tested that cool intercom feature

536
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:27,359
Where you just press a button and talk from one wink relay in your house to another

537
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:29,407
But that's okay I will just shouting

538
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:34,015
I guess I've had it installed for about a week and a half now

539
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:35,551
Generally pretty happy

540
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,343
It's larger than I expected

541
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:40,415
It's it's at least 6 inch by 6 inch I would say

542
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:43,231
So it's it's pretty big I mean

543
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:45,535
In my house and took the place of one rocker switch

544
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,327
So it's a big difference

545
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,095
To have

546
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:48,863
A larger

547
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,143
Device there on the wall but

548
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,423
Put in the bedroom

549
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,959
Liquid took me 20 minutes

550
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:59,103
Install not difficult very good instructions include all the tools little screwdriver with both Phillips head and

551
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,383
Flathead so

552
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:04,223
Literally simple to install just make sure you turn off your breaker first

553
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:06,527
It's very important for any installation

554
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:10,623
It's neat meaning for people who have not seen it is a

555
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:12,159
Small touch screen

556
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:16,255
Along with two buttons on the right hand side of it and those buttons

557
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:17,535
One takes the place

558
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:20,607
Can take the place of the switch that you replacing so to speak

559
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:21,375
So

560
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:23,679
This is Eric our closet

561
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:24,959
Switch and I just

562
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:26,239
Press the hardware button

563
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:29,311
It's just like I used to have the talk about in there now just

564
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:34,687
And then you can assign the other button to anything you'd like I would

565
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,223
To turn on the air-conditioning for sale

566
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:38,271
Touchscreen itself

567
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:43,903
It's interesting and I didn't know this and maybe you did I don't know if you did did you know this thing runs Android o

568
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:44,927
I think I did

569
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,207
I didn't say it because

570
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:47,231
Cuz I didn't think it was that big

571
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:51,071
Will know it was just interesting to me and and what what clued me

572
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:53,887
Into this was the first time after I installed it

573
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:59,263
It said upgrading applications one of 43. Just like an Android phone would after an Android update

574
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,543
Sorry I actually asked that

575
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:02,591
Wink.

576
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:06,943
When was the touchscreen replicates The Wing Cap to a large

577
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,223
Degree that you would put on your

578
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,759
IPhone your Android device

579
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:13,599
All of your shortcuts that you previously set up for your wink hub

580
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,135
Just automatically appear

581
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:17,696
Only shows 2 shortcuts at a time that you can just

582
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:19,744
Swipe over and see the rest of them so

583
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,304
You can reorder them and so on so it's kind of nice

584
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,376
And then have witches as well and has widgets that show

585
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:30,496
Whatever you like such as the time temperature the weather and so on so

586
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:32,032
How do you put your Fitbit on there

587
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:38,432
You you could connect and Link a Fitbit and then therefore see your steps and Daily Progress and such

588
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:41,760
I did not and the only reason I did not is because

589
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:43,296
Bad timing

590
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:46,112
I literally just left the Fitbit ecosystem

591
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:49,440
Because I'm using the polar m600 Android Wear watch

592
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,208
Which

593
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,232
Is

594
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:55,584
Exercise activity focus and has Android Wear so it's kind of The Best of Both Worlds tomato

595
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,632
I stopped using Fitbit right at the time

596
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:58,656
That I got to read

597
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,960
Kevin ru

598
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:05,568
I'm so so sorry and besides I don't think I want like my weight showing up on the wall

599
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,592
Everyday

600
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:12,224
Yes they'll be motivated for the kids make fun of their dad

601
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:16,064
It's an interesting product not to use a pun here but

602
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,600
There's been one little quirk

603
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:18,880
For some reason

604
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:23,744
The touchscreen you can set it too hot to go on automatically with the proximity sensor

605
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,768
Or you can

606
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:28,096
Disable the proximity sensor and tap the screen to wake it up

607
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:31,680
What a headset for the proximity sensor for some reason in the middle of the night

608
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:32,704
The screen keep coming on

609
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:33,728
Anna

610
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:36,032
And on and we're just sleeping just laying around

611
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,568
Any kind of brighten the room

612
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:38,592
Psycho that's got to stop

613
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:41,152
My wife complains about it so I went to the touch

614
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:43,456
Based only and when you have the touch option

615
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:45,504
Obviously touch the screen comes on for

616
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,296
Set amount of time but there's also wait

617
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,832
Tap to turn off so you

618
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:50,112
You can turn it off so it's not on

619
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:53,184
Too long the strange thing is at least twice now

620
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:56,000
In that mode when I tap the screen nothing is happening

621
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:57,280
And

622
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:02,144
Frustrated and finally there's a very small hidden button at the bottom of the wink relay

623
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,496
To reboot it and I've done that and that seems to get it working again for a couple days so

624
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:11,360
I don't know if my wiring I don't know what it is but every once in awhile it just doesn't respond

625
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:14,944
Does it not respond for a while

626
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,272
No it just does not respond for a while

627
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:29,024
Weird thing is not so weird but the annoying thing is when you're rebooting or when the touch screen isn't working

628
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,352
Even that Hardware button to turn the actual light on the physical button

629
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:33,120
Doesn't work

630
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:35,680
Yeah so that's where it gets really

631
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:37,472
You like all I can't see my closet

632
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:39,264
You're like I'm standing in the dark

633
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:41,056
Yeah

634
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,664
Could be again could be a corker

635
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:48,736
You're my wiring or something like that I don't know

636
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,016
I thought I mentioned

637
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:51,040
No that's good

638
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,088
Right on

639
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,904
Until I wish two things I wish

640
00:23:56,416 --> 00:24:00,256
It could act as a remote sensor for my ecobee3 because it really

641
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:03,328
Is gathering information to sensors are there

642
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:05,120
Or temperature and humidity inside

643
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:09,472
But I can't and that's fine that's that's an integration bit it's not a problem with the product itself

644
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,008
Elsa related

645
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:12,800
I can't really use it

646
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:15,104
With my ecobee that much because

647
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:18,176
You can't set a wink shortcut for

648
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:20,224
Temperature setting

649
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:20,992
With the ecobee

650
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:22,528
Like you could I

651
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:23,552
I thought you could wait

652
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:25,088
I don't recall it's been awhile

653
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:27,136
So really I can't do anything with my

654
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:27,904
Thermostat

655
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:28,672
This

656
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:29,440
Palmer

657
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:30,464
Okay

658
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:34,048
Create like a robot in the actual app

659
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:34,816
And then have it

660
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:35,840
From there

661
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:37,120
Haven't found a way to do it

662
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:38,656
Perhaps there's a way and I

663
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:39,936
Just didn't find it yet

664
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,472
No one

665
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,824
Yeah like what in the Wink app you can actually set your

666
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:48,640
Your temperature because you have a little rotary-dial

667
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:50,432
You know and you just type whatever you want

668
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:52,736
I haven't seen where to do a shortcut reset

669
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:53,504
Temperature

670
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:54,528
Got it

671
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:58,112
Yeah so if you can't do in the Wing Cap you can't do it on wink realize what I'm gathering

672
00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,648
You can do it

673
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,672
With the echo

674
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,560
Stop

675
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:10,912
Although when you do that

676
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:11,936
I've noticed that

677
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:13,216
It doesn't resume

678
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:16,288
Like your schedule it keeps that temp

679
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:20,128
I'm sure the settler ever forever so you have to be careful when you do that

680
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:21,152
Yeah

681
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:23,200
Okay

682
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:24,480
So we

683
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:25,760
Are pretty much out of time

684
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:27,296
History

685
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,064
What about next week

686
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,952
Stay tuned for

687
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:35,744
A message from our sponsor

688
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,512
And then

689
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,280
After that

690
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,304
Argos

691
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,376
Text Corey read a John Deere used

692
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:43,680
Culture and how to build a business

693
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:46,496
Based on connected services

694
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:52,896
Hey everyone this is Stacy I am breaking into the Internet of Things podcast with a quick word from our sponsor this week Spa

695
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:56,992
Cancer is macadamia and they are an iot user experience

696
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:58,016
Zen design firm

697
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:00,832
And this week's product that we're going to talk about is a Kinect

698
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:01,600
Conference room

699
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:03,392
So first we have

700
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:05,440
Scott Lewis here to talk about

701
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:07,744
Their work with a company called built IO

702
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:10,304
Scott what exactly did you guys built

703
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:13,120
What does in general is just allow

704
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,144
Organizations

705
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:14,912
To manage them

706
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:16,960
For a user

707
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:19,264
What you see depends on

708
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,056
The different scenarios

709
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:22,848
So I might want to

710
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:26,688
You know all the sudden just have an impromptu meeting I look up

711
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,016
And see the green light outside my meeting room

712
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:33,088
I know now is open I can go in

713
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:35,136
Another scenario that

714
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:37,440
Perhaps Love got a meeting running long

715
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:40,256
Can I stay in there or do I need

716
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:42,560
The late again tells me

717
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:43,584
So

718
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:44,864
That type

719
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,656
Love scenario is what makes

720
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:47,424
Super youth

721
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,216
And I can do that be

722
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:51,264
Because it understands underlined

723
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,336
Technology understand how people book things on the calendar

724
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:56,384
And it will even tell people friends

725
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,664
Hey

726
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,456
Looks like you're not using the meeting

727
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:03,808
Cuz it can sense other people are in there is it okay if I just freeze it up

728
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:05,344
It's really about the

729
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,392
Solution being non-intrusive

730
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:10,976
So rather than you have the technology yelling at you that you need to

731
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:12,000
Cynosure

732
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:12,768
Conference

733
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:15,072
Instead of kind of gives you a gentle nudge

734
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:17,632
You're not there for the technology you're there for the meeting

735
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:19,680
Are the Technologies actually helping

736
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:21,216
I'd love to under

737
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:21,984
1st and

738
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,264
Why you picked that for

739
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:24,288
Killer problems

740
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:25,056
Mount Scott

741
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:29,408
So what coyotes really about is solving practical

742
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:30,176
Problems

743
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:36,576
The distances are people have day today using technology and simple elegant way and this was a perfect exam

744
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:38,624
Clojure problems that come up all the time

745
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,928
Meeting room scheduling is a nightmare

746
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:41,696
And

747
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:42,720
If you can

748
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:43,744
Solve that problem

749
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,024
Simple technology

750
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:46,048
Why not

751
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:48,864
Is there anything you

752
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:51,936
Thomas The Internet of Things

753
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:54,496
The thing that we've been looking for in technology ever since

754
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:55,520
Started

755
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:56,544
Building spaceship

756
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:59,360
We want to move towards

757
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:02,944
The future but we want to do it in such a way where technology enables Our Lives

758
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,248
But it's not in your face

759
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,784
And today

760
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,856
Starting with iot we actually finally have something

761
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:10,880
Platform

762
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:11,904
Several

763
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:14,976
That allows technology of Truliant

764
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,024
And Scott

765
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,560
How can we find you

766
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,864
You can find us at

767
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,144
Macadamia

768
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,424
Dot-com

769
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,448
Flash built

770
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:31,104
Now back to the show

771
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:33,408
Hey everyone welcome back to the internet

772
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:34,944
This is your house

773
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:41,856
And this week's guest is Corey read a senior vice president of the intelligent solutions group at John Deere

774
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:44,416
Corey thanks for coming on the show today

775
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:47,232
Hey Stacy it's good to be here

776
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:48,768
You guys started your Journey 2

777
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:50,560
Businesses and products

778
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:53,632
A long time ago I feel like I've been reading about your Kinect

779
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:54,656
Contractors for

780
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:56,448
With five or six years at least

781
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,240
So can you let a talk about

782
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:00,288
How John Deere started

783
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:01,824
The king about connectivity in there

784
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:04,128
Yeah absolutely soaked

785
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:07,968
You're really the Precision AG business started for us nearly 20 years ago

786
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:14,624
Started in the precise positioning business the guidance based business and we acquire small company to do that and

787
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,416
We've been building on it ever since

788
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:17,696
And what are those

789
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,488
Precision-guided

790
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:20,512
Is that

791
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:21,792
Your Corrin

792
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:22,816
Primary product

793
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:25,888
Or how should I think of that is that just an enabler for all your

794
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:31,776
It's one of the critical enablers of precision agriculture overall so

795
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:37,920
Technically it's about bouncing low-watt signals off of satellites that are moving through space at

796
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:38,944
Very rapid

797
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,480
Speed and being able to

798
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:45,344
Use a position receiver so an antenna that sits on a a tractor

799
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:51,232
Understand exactly where that tractor is and then being able to use correction signals to help

800
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:56,352
Automated drive those vehicles to really tied accuracy on the ground so within an inch

801
00:29:56,864 --> 00:30:01,472
Of actress in many cases that allows those machines to position themselves appropriately

802
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:05,824
Know where they are and then know what seeds chemicals in products they put in the ground

803
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:09,152
Okay and what has changed in the last

804
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:10,176
5 years

805
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:12,224
We're all talking about the internet

806
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:14,016
What did you guys

807
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:18,112
From your position of having had this system in place and then building it

808
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:18,880
Two decades

809
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:20,672
What are you thinking of adding her

810
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:29,120
Yeah I can tell you what's changed as you add on top of that precise positioning so the ability to know where you are

811
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:30,400
Lauren guided vehicle

812
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:34,752
To real-time communication so our vehicles are going out the door

813
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:36,288
At the end of this year with

814
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:41,408
4G LTE Wi-Fi Bluetooth enabled communication devices

815
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,200
Take the combination

816
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:48,576
A precise positioning in the ability for real-time communication on and off those vehicles

817
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:54,720
They become a real platform for unlocking the next generation of products and services in Precision AG

818
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:55,744
And

819
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,536
What about the role of artificial

820
00:30:58,816 --> 00:30:59,328
Because

821
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,864
When I look at the Internet of Things

822
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:05,984
The next big thing is

823
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:08,032
Actually having computers help me

824
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:09,824
Decision so I'm curious where

825
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,872
You guys think that might go and precision

826
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:18,784
Absolutely if you take automated driving a vehicle she had to that on and off board Communications

827
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:21,344
You can start to think about how

828
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,368
Whether it's

829
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:26,464
Intelligence that sits off border machine is data is being communicated

830
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:31,072
Into service providers like a John Deere dealer who may be able to provide

831
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:35,424
Uptime services or to an input provider or egg retailer

832
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:39,008
Who can make a recommendation on the type of seed or the type of

833
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:41,312
Crop protection product to be used

834
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:43,360
On a sealed now all of a sudden that

835
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:46,688
Connectivity enables the best intelligence the best

836
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:51,040
Processing that can be done anywhere to be moved quickly on and off of a vehicle

837
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:53,600
A lot of people think of farmers is not being

838
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:54,880
TekSavvy

839
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:57,696
And I wash Eternal actually tested a story

840
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:58,464
On this

841
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,488
Talking about a

842
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:00,512
Case IH

843
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:03,584
Cabless tractor that basically is a self-driving tractor

844
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,120
Ashanti the farm show

845
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:08,192
And their headline was Farm Show visitors marble

846
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:09,472
Scott

847
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:11,776
Contractor and I thought it was kind of funny

848
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:18,432
Because this is very much what it feels like Precision agriculture is moving towards this idea of machines doing

849
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:21,504
So I'm curious in your

850
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,808
Experience with your customers

851
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:26,880
Are they tech-savvy are they worried about

852
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:33,536
Are they stopping at self driving tractors probably one of the most

853
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:39,936
Analogically Savvy groups of of most of of industrial Industries if you will if you think about

854
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:41,216
Farming it is

855
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:46,336
The production of a crop in an open biological system so you have weather

856
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:49,152
Do you have a lot of things that can happen with pests

857
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:50,176
She have a lot of

858
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:52,224
Characteristics of soil

859
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,272
Nutrients that all come out

860
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:58,368
At the same time to help either produce a crop for profit or not

861
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:05,024
What a lot of producers have done is they've invested a lot in technologies that help them understand how to get the most

862
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:09,376
Out of the primary tools that use their operation starts with their land

863
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:16,032
Every piece of land is different across North America the characteristics of it is different they've had to invest in a lot of Technology

864
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:19,104
Jesus help them understand what is the potential of that land

865
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:22,432
And then this Technologies helping them understand how do I unlock

866
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:24,480
How do I select the right

867
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:26,528
Seed chemical fertilizer

868
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:30,112
But in addition what can I use in terms of the best

869
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:32,160
Agricultural Equipment Technology

870
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:38,560
Be able to ensure that everything I do is done consistently with maximizing the profitability

871
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:40,096
On that land so

872
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:43,424
Able to grow more and in many cases do it with less

873
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:47,008
How long is it good for the bottom line it's also good for the environment so

874
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:51,616
Technology has been a big part of the generational change in their culture in the last

875
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:52,640
20 years

876
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:55,712
The automation silent one of the things that's happened

877
00:33:56,224 --> 00:34:02,368
Agriculture largely the labor required to produce a crop has been reduced dramatically over the last

878
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:04,672
50 here so automation is interesting

879
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:06,720
It's more interesting in terms of

880
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:07,488
Troll

881
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:09,536
How do you actually plant better

882
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,072
Spray better

883
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:13,120
Harvest better not

884
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:19,008
How do you reduce labor most of the laborers already out of the crop now certainly labor variability is important

885
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:23,872
And producers are interested in how you control for the variable of different operators in the field

886
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:26,432
That's why I'm automation is exciting so

887
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:29,248
I don't think they scoff it automation

888
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:32,064
So to speak but how it's used I think it's most important

889
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:34,624
Do you guys have plans for a self-driving tractor

890
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:39,488
We've actually introduced a self-driving tractor over 10 years ago we had them running

891
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:46,144
In fields in the Southeast running in areas like Orchards and Vineyards where there's they're spraying chemicals and fertile

892
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:46,912
Weiser stats

893
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,728
That you don't want people exposed to in the environment so it's

894
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:56,384
It's not about the availability of the technology it's about what's the highest value use of the technology certainly one

895
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,456
One of the things we can do with that and have done in the past

896
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:02,528
Is creative fully autonomous systems

897
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:09,184
A lot of producers actually like to be involved in the system they like to be in the seat they like to be able to maybe to do other things

898
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:15,584
Thanks from the cab so use that communication technology to communicate on and off to their technical advisers or maybe Market there

899
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:20,960
I think a lot of the commentary here is when our people ready for that system to be the predominant system

900
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:22,240
When do you think that might be

901
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:29,152
I'm not sure I think we're prepared for it if they wanted to go there in a couple years we would be there right now

902
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:32,480
If you think about what's happening I'll use an example for you

903
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:33,504
In the last

904
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,320
50 years and certainly in the last

905
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:37,600
100 years

906
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:44,256
There's less than 1% of the labor required than what they're used to be to create a ton of wheat or a hundred

907
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:45,280
Bushels of corn

908
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:51,168
Actually a lot of the labor is out of the production of the crop what's change though

909
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:57,568
Is the value of the inputs that flow through the hour in the field that someone has with a p

910
00:35:57,824 --> 00:36:00,128
Equipment weather to tractor combine

911
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:04,736
A springer is increased by a hundredfold over that same period of time

912
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:05,760
Actually

913
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:11,136
The use of technology for Automation and control over the execution in the field

914
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:12,928
Of the jobs that are getting done

915
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:15,744
Is far more valuable to a producer

916
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,560
Then to be able to take that last one percent of Labor

917
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:19,584
Out of the equation

918
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,352
Got it

919
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:22,144
So later is not the issue

920
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,168
Making them

921
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:24,960
Biggest best bang for your buck

922
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:27,264
For your fertilizer for your water

923
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:33,920
Absolutely in labor isn't where I don't want to leave you with the impression that labor is not important it certainly is because

924
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:36,736
Variability of Labor from one operator to the next

925
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:43,392
It doesn't necessarily take so long Tommy to do that it takes control systems to be able to do that Metairie see a lot of

926
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,928
In the industry going

927
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:48,512
Is in two control systems that help manage the variability

928
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:53,120
The ultimate in that is to reduce the variable of Labor altogether and reduce the person

929
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:55,168
We see that as an opportunity

930
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:56,960
Potentially but not as the priority

931
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:58,496
Okay

932
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:01,056
So let's talk about how this plays out in your business

933
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:02,080
Because

934
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:02,848
You guys

935
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:04,128
Spell actual

936
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,152
Trackers

937
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:06,176
And combines

938
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:07,968
You are so

939
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:10,272
Data and then I believe you sell

940
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:12,064
Advisorservices to Armour

941
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,088
As well so

942
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,624
Walk me through

943
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:16,416
Kind of the role that connect

944
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:19,488
Activity the dimensions that is added to John Deere

945
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:23,840
Can certainly Precision AG technology overall

946
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:27,936
The role is to both help differentiate the underlined product the track

947
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:28,704
Combine

948
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,472
Sprayer

949
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:30,240
Planter

950
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:31,264
That we sell

951
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,312
And it does to that it helps those products

952
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:35,104
Work even better and helps

953
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:39,200
Them execute in a way that maximizes yield manage cost

954
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:42,016
It's also expected to be a good business

955
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:47,136
Like any other business within John Deere in for our shareholders and for a customers

956
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:50,208
Obviously we sell products like tractors and combines

957
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:51,232
We sell

958
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:53,792
Hardware in the position hbase like

959
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:57,376
Position receivers telematics devices displays

960
00:37:57,888 --> 00:38:04,032
Who sells software things like activations for autotrakk or correction signals for guidance systems

961
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:06,080
Sell software that helps

962
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:12,480
Turn automatically machines on and off when they come to a point row if you think about control systems for sprayer nozzle

963
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:14,016
Score for planners

964
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:16,576
We also work with our dealers to sell services

965
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:18,112
Uptime services

966
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:19,648
Proactive maintenance

967
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:20,416
Services

968
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:23,488
And then we connect a lot of economic advisers

969
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:26,048
A lot of people who have core expertise in

970
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,096
Putting the right seat on the right

971
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:31,680
Acre putting the right nutrient at the right time in the ground

972
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:38,080
And we connect them through this Precision AG system to give Growers access to the best in the industry

973
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:40,128
So each of those represents

974
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,968
Not only profit opportunity for the the grower the producer

975
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:48,320
But also up a place where were John Deere can deliver value and

976
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,600
And collect value

977
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:52,160
What have you learned about pricing based on the diff

978
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:53,696
Products that you sell

979
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:57,024
One of the things that I think is really fascinating about

980
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:58,304
The products is

981
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:01,376
You have to account somewhere

982
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:02,912
For the cost of

983
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:04,448
Supporting a product in the long term

984
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:07,776
I'm so you guys might have rental fees for the Precision tracking

985
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:10,336
There's a cloud back-end fees for

986
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:11,616
Various things so

987
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:13,920
What if you guys kind of thought about

988
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:15,200
But how have you come to manage that

989
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:17,760
Obviously

990
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:22,624
Any pricing strategy starts with a firm understanding of how you're creating value

991
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:24,160
We look first

992
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:25,440
For which of the

993
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,488
Products whether it's a heart I am product

994
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:30,048
Software-as-a-service we can deliver

995
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:35,936
What are the things that we can do that point of the value being created in that space that's the starting point

996
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,752
And then we at we look across the

997
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:43,872
The chain of people involved in delivering it so if it's with us and our dealer and a customer

998
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:45,152
Shasta Creek

999
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:49,760
Value for the customer first and then there has to be enough margin that can be shared

1000
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:53,600
Between those three components us are dealer in the producer

1001
00:39:53,856 --> 00:40:00,000
Ultimately that's a primary sort for how we think about which products actually make it to our portfolio process

1002
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:02,048
If they create enough value

1003
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:04,864
The available margin associated with the product

1004
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:05,888
Can be shared

1005
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,728
Across those in the still good marching in it for the customer

1006
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:11,776
Value received versus what it cost

1007
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:14,080
Then we'll move the clock forward

1008
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:16,128
NM price it appropriately

1009
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:17,152
If there isn't

1010
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:21,248
Then it off and won't be at the front of our portfolio process to be worked on

1011
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,808
Do you have any examples you can give us things

1012
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:24,576
Maybe didn't

1013
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:26,880
Give enough value caffe

1014
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:28,416
I look at a lot of companies

1015
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:29,696
I feel like they are

1016
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:32,512
If this mentality of a put a chip in it

1017
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:33,792
Put some analytics on it

1018
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:36,864
And I don't know how far ahead they're thinking

1019
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:37,888
4

1020
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:43,008
Thought their pricing strategies and like the number of people who might have dropped it that they have to support over

1021
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:44,544
So

1022
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:46,080
Any more color you have there

1023
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:46,848
Would be wonderful

1024
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:52,992
We've done some of the automation space I use one itec pro as an automated turn back to the automation

1025
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:54,272
Conversation

1026
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:57,344
Some producers really like it either say hey

1027
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:01,696
I'm willing to actually turn on the End of the Roll myself so we can almost fully

1028
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:02,720
Automate

1029
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:05,280
In field operations of a tractor today

1030
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:06,816
For some producers

1031
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:12,704
They just rather turn on the end I know my operators involved in responding and being aware

1032
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:17,568
I would rather have them do that on their own so that's product while we're offering it today

1033
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:20,896
It doesn't have the same kind of take rate to some of the high value products

1034
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:27,552
I like section control or the ability from a row by row perspective to turn your planner on and off or you

1035
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:28,832
Your nozzles on your sprayer

1036
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:32,160
Specialty Products it at both ends of that Spectrum

1037
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:36,000
We'll just wait till in a couple years when nobody else knows how to drive because

1038
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:38,304
Autonomous cars are all the rage in the

1039
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:44,960
No one knows how to turn at the end of his rope

1040
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:51,616
Seeing and understanding the developments in the autonomous car industry in the fact that we kind of chuckled early because we've been

1041
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:54,943
Drive down i80 between our headquarters in moline and des moines

1042
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:59,551
Probably 70-plus percent of the tractors running on either side of Interstate 80

1043
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:03,903
Already driving themselves and then we're talking about when will the day come when a car does that

1044
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:05,183
Ultimately it's

1045
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:06,463
It's an interesting

1046
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:07,999
Challenge though because

1047
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:11,839
While you can drive down I-80 or if you drive down I-75 I'll use

1048
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:15,679
I use the Auto industry is a good example from Detroit to Miami

1049
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:22,335
I will that highways fairly similar in the Technologies can be fairly consistent the farming that goes on either side of that Highway North

1050
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:23,871
South is incredibly

1051
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:26,687
Every Farm is different every field every crop

1052
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:29,759
The complexity hbase is actually much higher

1053
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:36,159
In the complexity in the automotive space now this steaks can be higher in the on-road environment have people's lives in

1054
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:38,975
Obstacles in in those things involved in

1055
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:40,767
That has a different dynamic

1056
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:42,815
But actually the complexity of growing

1057
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:49,471
Dozens of different crops and dozens of different soil types in different environments create a very complex

1058
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:51,775
World and one that the egg industry has been out

1059
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:54,335
Son of most other Industries in the area of automation

1060
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:59,711
It has do you have anything you guys can teach your offer to the self-driving car manufacturer

1061
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:06,879
I don't know how we can teach him we spent a lot of time talking to him allowed to Precision Technologies what we've learned is there's no

1062
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:09,951
Single technology rely on exclusively

1063
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:13,023
If you're going to be in the space you need to think about how to use

1064
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:17,119
The best of all of the Technologies one of the areas we focused on

1065
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:17,887
Isn't

1066
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:19,679
And being able to merge

1067
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:22,751
The different sensing type Technologies from

1068
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:25,823
Visual to tactile to GPS

1069
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:27,615
You get better Solutions

1070
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:30,687
The more solutions you can pull together so what

1071
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:36,063
Technology are you most looking forward to or what technology do you look at right now and you're like

1072
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:38,367
Oh we in a Precision Adventist

1073
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:39,647
Space we gotta get some of that

1074
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:40,415
The awesome

1075
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:43,999
We spent a lot of time in the

1076
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:46,815
In the positioning area and and that's exciting

1077
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:51,679
I think we're learning is how a lot of the technologies that have been around can be used

1078
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:52,959
To do even more

1079
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:55,519
Once you know where you are an example

1080
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:59,871
We initially said the hey that was about yield then we said it's about driving a vehicle

1081
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:03,967
Now the interplay between different Vehicles what are you using

1082
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:09,343
GPS is your primary input or visual or a feeler system a tactile system

1083
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:15,487
The ability to now manage between primary applications in a field

1084
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:18,559
The ability to think about positioning of

1085
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:19,327
Fleets

1086
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:21,119
Differently and

1087
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:23,935
Processing that goes along with that what's happened is

1088
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:29,567
The ability to both process massive amounts of data in this is one thing Rado is helping us a lot

1089
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:35,967
Because a lot of the processing power required is bringing down the cost of processing any of the use of cloud-based

1090
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:41,599
System that allows to move data to where it's needed to be processed and then move it cleanly back on

1091
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:45,695
Actually there's a limitless potential as to what you can do in the field

1092
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:49,535
Strip challenge for industry not just of John Deere but our industry

1093
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:53,631
Taking all those capabilities and boil it into products and services

1094
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:57,983
That's fit the needs and the evolution of where customers are

1095
00:44:58,239 --> 00:44:59,007
Wanting to go

1096
