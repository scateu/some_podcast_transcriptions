. com for more information

33
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:40,608
Already Kevin did you watch the

34
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:41,376
Apple

35
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:45,984
Chino products lunch newsreels / press conference

36
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:52,896
The Extravaganza yes I did a whole two hours of it which we're not going to discuss in detail a lot

37
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:53,920
What they talk about

38
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:56,736
Partly because they didn't talk at all about

39
00:01:56,992 --> 00:02:01,088
Homekit not much about Siri the dimensional homepod that's coming out

40
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:03,648
Is there assistant with speaker so there isn't

41
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:05,952
With a lot of iron T stuff I came out of that

42
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:07,232
True I'm wondering

43
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:08,256
Do you think

44
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,024
So you've watched

45
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,048
Long time

46
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,072
Longer than

47
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:13,120
So do you think the lack of

48
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:19,520
Any message in your own home kit or homepod is indicative of any like lateness for the product which is supposed to be

49
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:20,288
December

50
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:22,848
I personally think they've had a continued

51
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:25,408
Lateness for a lot of their

52
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:26,944
Homekit + Smart Home

53
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,760
Efforts quite honestly this is so I'm not surprised

54
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:31,040
I really did it

55
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:35,136
Specs that serious selfie would show off how much better it's gotten

56
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,160
That was what I was

57
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:45,120
Exactly exactly so they didn't do that

58
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:47,168
Instead it focused on the traditional products app

59
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:49,984
Apple TV iPhones and Apple watch

60
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,032
So yeah maybe the

61
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,312
Apple homepod event

62
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:57,920
Later in the year and that's when I say look how great Siri is for this device and all your other devices

63
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:58,688
I don't know

64
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:00,736
We'll wait and see

65
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:01,760
We don't have anything today

66
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:02,784
But I was surprised

67
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,344
We talked about whereabouts

68
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,112
Especially

69
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:09,440
With Kevin tofel Runner extraordinaire on the show so

70
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:11,488
Let's talk about the Apple watch

71
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,512
Which ticket

72
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:13,536
Big

73
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:18,912
Did did basically the biggest feature that they're adding is

74
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,960
As rumored in LTE radio

75
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,496
And

76
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:26,080
I'm actually considering on this is crazy cuz I'm not

77
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,872
Big I'm paying for additional

78
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:30,176
Pictures and such that they don't use that much but

79
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:34,528
I'm actually think about buying or upgrading my Apple Watch 2 to an Apple Watch 3 with cellular

80
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,904
I believe it has about $79 to the cost just for that radio edition and then of course it's the service

81
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:44,512
That's really got me kind of hung up because I was hoping to be like five bucks a month at most

82
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:48,352
Unfortunately it looks like all the carriers are going to at least in the US are going to

83
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,120
Offer

84
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:52,960
Three months of free service to try it and then it will be $10 per month

85
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,496
Going forward

86
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:59,360
And the thing is if we use the same phone number as you were Apple phone which is convenient

87
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:02,688
That's great but there's color issues with battery life

88
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:03,712
We can talk about that in a second

89
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:05,248
+ 2

90
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:11,648
Is it really worth adding an LTE option for $10 a month on someone's going to use such little data and

91
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:16,512
They charge $10 a month at a tablet where with the big screen you can use gobs of data

92
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:18,303
Disparity that I'm not

93
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,327
Comfortable with self

94
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,351
That's cuz you

95
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,911
Now most people in this is what

96
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:23,679
Cellular carrier

97
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:24,703
Counting on

98
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,727
These look like

99
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:26,751
Oh

100
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:30,079
Look I have always-on access to music and whatever on my watch

101
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:31,359
I have Wi-Fi

102
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,895
But I don't have my phone with

103
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:34,431
Right at work

104
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,199
$10

105
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,759
Most people say no

106
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,039
I really do

107
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,855
I don't know we'll have to see it meaning

108
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:43,391
It's a personal choice obviously

109
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:46,207
Because the question is are you doing something that

110
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:50,303
You need your phone with you or you can leave it behind in my particular use case I run everyday

111
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:57,215
And I also now I write out small scooter motorcycle type device and having my phone with me of course in emergencies important

112
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,007
But

113
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:02,079
If I can have the added convenience of leaving the pain behind if

114
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,871
I'm in an emergency situation and

115
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,151
Make a call from iWatch

116
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:07,967
That's handy I'm out by myself in all of these cases

117
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:08,991
So

118
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,015
Well that's a good

119
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:12,319
Until what we should talk about battery life cuz I

120
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:14,111
I think that's a big issue but I've also

121
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:16,415
Thinking about let's take it a little bit further

122
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:18,207
Imagine like a nearpod world

123
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:22,303
Phone is essentially on your wrist not need your phone then

124
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,327
For very

125
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,119
All when you're just going out

126
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,167
Casually not mean right if you're going to be out

127
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:27,935
For a while

128
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,239
Browse the internet but if you're just

129
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:33,311
Suddenly becomes kind of like this is the next version

130
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,871
At the computer in your hand maybe it's a computer and

131
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:36,639
Tristan

132
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:38,175
It's kind of compelling

133
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:40,991
Yeah it is kind of compelling they also in this

134
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,271
Kind of coincides

135
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,807
Because you now have connectivity

136
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:44,831
You can

137
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:48,671
And I'm surprised you're doing this because of battery life you can stream songs

138
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,463
Directly from Apple music

139
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:56,863
So they're saying hey you got 49 songs on your wrist now you can obviously take and receive calls and messages get notifications

140
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,143
Is that I don't care about what I'm running

141
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,167
But interesting

142
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,191
Siri will work

143
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,215
End

144
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:02,495
She can now talk

145
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:05,567
As opposed to today's Apple watches you have to look at the screen

146
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:08,127
So with the connectivity and the boosted speaker

147
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:10,943
You can actually interact with Siri to ask questions get directions

148
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,735
And so on without having your phone

149
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,015
So $10 a month

150
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:17,087
I don't know I'm actually thinking about it that prefer it was five

151
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,111
Included

152
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,903
There's a lot of these cases

153
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,975
I know

154
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:23,743
Stock. The battery

155
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,327
How far can you

156
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,095
You running

157
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,911
Well I'll be okay so

158
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:31,935
Overall

159
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:35,007
Annapolis testing they say you can pretty much get 18 hours

160
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:41,407
On a charge and they base that on 4 hours of an LTE Connection in 14 hours connect to your phone via Bluetooth

161
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:47,807
They even say it's you know it works out to like 90 notifications 90 time checks 45 minutes of Athens in a 30-minute

162
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:48,831
Workout with music

163
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,879
I Ran 2 hours on Sunday morning

164
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,927
Just a GPS and my heart rate

165
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:53,951
So I need

166
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,999
Battery life and I usually listen to music

167
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:56,767
So again

168
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:57,791
I need battery life

169
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:00,095
I think 18 hours in combination

170
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,119
It's fine

171
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,399
You're gonna have to charge it every night

172
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,423
That's fine

173
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,983
Using the LTE connection to tok

174
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:09,823
You can do that for about one hour on the watch and then your battery is dead

175
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,615
Which I mean

176
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,639
No one's going to have

177
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:13,919
Like a heartfelt conversation

178
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:18,783
I could be

179
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:24,415
It's a secondary phone device in my opinion so I agree with you you know that I have to make a phone call

180
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:30,815
My family is call me in an emergency when I'm out on the roads it's going to be less than a five-minute call so I'm fine with that I just want to

181
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,607
Should be aware

182
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:36,191
If you think you just leave it from behind all day or leave it at home and use this

183
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,727
Watch as your phone all day

184
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,007
Probably not going to work

185
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,055
All right

186
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:45,919
Well so we don't know if Kevin's going to buy an Apple Watch but he seems to be leaning towards it

187
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,735
I assume you sell your old one on eBay

188
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:51,295
Not eBay but you also assure

189
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:53,087
Alright let's talk about

190
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:55,391
Nasty new security vulnerability

191
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,415
Discovered

192
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,439
This week actually

193
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,463
I think was it this week

194
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,999
Last week I believe it was this week

195
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:04,095
Okay Blue Barn not to be confused with Bluebeard the murderous pirate

196
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,119
I believe

197
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,959
Automatic this is a security flaw that

198
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:12,031
Books at people's Bluetooth connections and if

199
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:17,663
Can connect to it it will take over your device in some cases or it will use it for

200
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,199
A man-in-the-middle attack

201
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,247
No

202
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,271
Bueno

203
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,039
And

204
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,087
A lot of devices are still four more

205
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:27,135
Going to talk to us about how many

206
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:30,975
Yeah actually to just put this in perspective because this

207
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:33,279
Effects Bluetooth devices

208
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,559
This is not just like

209
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,327
A one-off

210
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,375
Device type where we talk

211
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:41,983
Before about light connected DVRs and security cameras this is like anything with Bluetooth

212
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:42,751
Which is

213
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:45,055
Mind when you think of the scope of devices

214
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,079
Spell potentially

215
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:52,991
So we should say this was found that April and released to various companies so that they can patch it and some have his

216
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,015
We were just going to say

217
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:59,135
Several Android devices iPhones already been patched Windows devices Linux devices

218
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:01,439
But we have to keep in mind that

219
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:07,839
Not all of those devices when I think of these as when your phones and tablets are running Android not all them are going to get up to

220
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:14,495
Because there's a lot of older phones anymore but

221
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,519
.0 and up

222
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:18,591
So that's good if you're an older phone there could be issue

223
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:24,223
Samsung Galaxy LG watch pumpkin car audio on Android

224
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,247
These are all Impact

225
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,015
Active devices

226
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,295
Apple's not immune to this

227
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,831
They have patched it

228
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:31,391
And the nice thing is with Apple

229
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:34,207
Roughly 89% of those devices

230
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:37,535
Consumers upgrade the software when they get a security update notes

231
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,327
Much less fragmented

232
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,863
There's not as many device types

233
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:45,471
So that examples in a better spot here then say OK Google or another device maker

234
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:48,031
Question is what happens to

235
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,847
Iot devices in the house like Bluetooth locks and such

236
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:56,479
Where we typically don't update the software or it's not made available to us these updates from the manufacturer

237
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:57,759
Well I was going to say

238
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,039
Here's yes

239
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:05,439
I imagine that if your Bluetooth lock maker you were going to be on this at least at the public release maybe you didn't get a call back in a

240
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,207
April because

241
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,743
That's another thing if you're sick

242
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:08,511
Security firm

243
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,047
You know you can't notify

244
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:13,887
Right if you're going to try to do something behind the scenes in

245
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:14,655
Proactively

246
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:17,983
You can get the big guys but you can't call every Bluetooth

247
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:25,151
April distinctly I agree with you but all of those devices should be registered through the Bluetooth Sig and I wonder if they should have coordinate

248
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,687
Maybe they do I do not know

249
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,455
That's an interesting

250
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:30,527
So I was going to say that Linux is also a

251
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,295
Assassins

252
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,575
And they

253
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:34,879
Talk about the most commercial and super int

254
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:35,647
Two platforms

255
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:38,463
Linux is tizen Samsung operating system

256
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:41,023
This is going to affect your Samsung

257
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,815
The gear S3 smartwatch

258
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:45,887
You're smart TVs and your smart refrigerator

259
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:48,959
And this is where it gets interesting to me

260
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:49,983
Because

261
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:50,751
Samsung

262
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,031
Will probably push out

263
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:57,407
But is anyone who sat there and wanted to watch TV turns on their television and

264
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,967
Update now or later you're like

265
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:01,247
I got my popcorn ready

266
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,783
Later

267
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,087
Later becomes never

268
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:11,231
Exactly what I wanted even think about a fridge because like I have had fridges in my home that I've owned for 10

269
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:14,303
Even 11 years and I don't know if Samsung

270
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:15,327
Patch field

271
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,911
Apollo information to maybe

272
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,703
Give an indication if they will

273
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:26,079
Hi I just noticed in the report that are missed the company that actually found this

274
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:29,151
They share details on who they contacted

275
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,431
And what the response was

276
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:33,503
So good was contacting April and

277
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,575
They have updated as of September 4th

278
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:39,391
Microsoft also in April and

279
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:41,695
Updates are made in July so that's good

280
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:48,095
Apple was contacted in August and I'm going to just clarify something as I thought that ability affected them Apple had no longer doing in his

281
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:51,679
Current version so they may have pre patch that may have done something before August

282
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,215
But here's the interesting relevant

283
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:53,983
Samsung

284
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,519
I'm just going to read this out loud

285
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:59,103
Contact on three separate occasions in April May and June

286
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:01,663
No response was received from any Outreach

287
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:02,943
Alright Samsung

288
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:03,967
I know their pee

289
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,831
You guys if you want to be a credible iot

290
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:13,439
Vendor to Consumers and businesses because we're going to talk about later that's

291
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:14,975
That is unacceptable

292
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:18,047
You should have if you don't already

293
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:20,351
And maybe they couldn't find it a bug Bounty program

294
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:23,679
And you should have a way for security people

295
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,447
Contact you

296
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,519
Because that's how a lot of things are being found out

297
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:30,079
Vulnerabilities are really nasty

298
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:32,127
Yeah and it's even better to

299
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,151
Have a response

300
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:33,919
Weather

301
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:40,319
Affects you or not because at least explain to people that you're looking into it your way the situation and you're doing something or you don't need to

302
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,087
Do something about it

303
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,367
Write a message with

304
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,415
Bingo

305
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:48,255
Cuz guess if people know that you have policies and you should advertise

306
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,535
Because let's say

307
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,559
You say hey

308
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:52,095
If we get your vulnerability

309
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:54,143
We will acknowledge its receipt

310
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,703
Meet people if they don't get the acknowledgement

311
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,471
They will

312
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:58,751
Look for other ways to

313
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,799
Otherwise they're just like

314
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,335
Recordable Teddy

315
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:03,871
So you send out

316
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,919
Enquiries Into The Ether and then suddenly

317
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:08,223
If you don't get anything back after awhile you just stop

318
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:10,527
So

319
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,063
Samsung

320
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,855
Not cool man

321
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:15,903
All right

322
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:16,671
They're coming up later

323
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,207
Let's talk now

324
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,999
About something not as scary

325
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,535
Superstar.

326
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:22,559
Please buy this

327
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:24,095
So what this is

328
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:24,863
This is

329
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,399
Last week Chamberlain

330
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,423
Put a message on it

331
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:32,287
Sift page basically saying that if you want to connect your garage door to a service like if

332
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,335
Or even possibly Google home

333
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:36,895
You're going to have to pay a dollar a month

334
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:37,663
End

335
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:40,479
The outrage was not tremendous cuz I don't know how many people are alive

336
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:41,759
On this device

337
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,039
Although I do and

338
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:43,807
What's connected to it

339
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:46,111
But the people noticed we're not please

340
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:51,487
Now I know they actually reached out to us on Twitter and that's how we found out about it and I wonder if

341
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,511
A lot of people leaving

342
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,791
Do you know about this yet

343
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:57,119
Yes so I sent some questions to Chamberlain yesterday

344
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:00,191
Trying to figure out the Twitter account for Chamberlain

345
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,983
Was like yes we are charging

346
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,287
So it is a real thing

347
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,311
They didn't

348
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,079
Acknowledge the

349
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:11,711
So

350
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:13,247
I asked him what

351
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,015
Services

352
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,295
They were going to start charging

353
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:16,575
Why

354
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:17,343
And

355
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,623
Didn't hear back so

356
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,927
Kevin the absence of Chamberlain

357
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:21,951
Think about this

358
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:31,679
Yeah as soon as I saw this on Twitter I started digging around the gift page and I noticed that they

359
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:38,079
I had a link for partners and like I wonder if Chamberlain is now a partner and what is it really mean cuz I didn't know anybody and

360
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:42,687
Any listener if you want to create your own if this then that recipe and all that you can certainly do that there's no charge

361
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:46,015
X-ray with that that has not changed but if you go into the partner program

362
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:47,295
We noticed that

363
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:49,343
There are two pricing tiers

364
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:50,879
That Partners have

365
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:57,279
Hey and one is $199 a month for and that allows a partner to create a single service and

366
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,047
It's triggers

367
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:00,607
And therefore a to make that available as a service

368
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:02,399
I don't think that's what

369
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:05,727
Chamberlain is doing I think they're in the partner plus program

370
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:06,751
Because what partner

371
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:12,127
Surplus does is it gives you the ability to make multiple products and services available with triggers and if

372
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:14,431
It gives you an unlimited number of end users

373
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,967
Square Dashboard you have

374
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:16,991
Prioritize

375
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:18,271
Server space in

376
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,551
Nashua is

377
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,111
Yeah CSI lazerport

378
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:22,879
Exactly

379
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,159
So

380
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,695
It sounds to me like

381
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:30,047
Chamberlain is probably done this taking it into the partner plus program and that gets into the

382
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:34,399
The pricing and it's a minimum of $499 per month

383
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:36,191
Duck-billed annually and that

384
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:42,591
Minimum is because the price will vary based on company size number of services and customizations to Chamberlain's paying at least five

385
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:44,127
The month I suspect

386
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,431
To offer the gift integration

387
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:47,711
And

388
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:53,599
Having to recoup some of that well looks like they said let's start of people at Buck a month or $10 I think it's

389
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:56,671
The $10 annual fee if you want to do it that way so well I

390
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:57,439
Get it

391
00:15:57,695 --> 00:16:03,839
I understand the need to make money back if it's really comes back again so the question we can talk about buying Hardware services

392
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:09,215
You know when you bought a Chamberlain MyQ Stacy you didn't expect that you would have to pay this for example if you want to connect right

393
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:14,847
I will admit that it was a long time ago

394
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:17,151
I don't think it actually had an ifta integration bee

395
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,175
Because the Chamberlin guys

396
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,199
So worried about it from a secure

397
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:21,247
Perspectives it was highly demanded

398
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,087
When I bought it it's not like they're taking a

399
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:27,903
It is

400
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,695
I am sure Golling

401
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:35,839
Oh my God I can't wait to connect this cuz it's a connected thing and being connected means you should be able to

402
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,679
So that

403
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,007
User

404
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:45,055
And I'm not I can't fault them for

405
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:46,847
Doing this because Integrations

406
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:50,687
Take developer time they're going to take a continual amount of developer time be

407
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,479
Because it will make platform updates

408
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:57,343
Minimum to be

409
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,391
Partner when you start

410
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,415
Multiplying that out

411
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,695
Across lots and lots

412
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:03,743
Jasmine

413
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:11,935
Right plus the partners have scalability included in the so as they get more users or add devices

414
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:17,055
We'll have more service pays more dedicated bandwidth and so on and those resources involved here as well

415
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:17,823
But

416
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,871
You know if you bought your device

417
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,407
Thinking you're buying connected

418
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,199
Set device that would open up this entire new

419
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:23,967
SeaWorld

420
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:26,271
Suddenly that world seems

421
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:28,319
Not moving for you without more money

422
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,647
I feel that way about

423
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,415
My doorbell

424
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,719
Having an additional charge on it

425
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,999
To get historical views

426
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,279
Ever

427
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,071
I'll pay for

428
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:39,839
4 extra

429
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,119
Extra

430
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,423
24-hour. To see my videos

431
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:44,703
I'll pay for anything.

432
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:46,495
It does irk me that I'm like

433
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:48,543
Oh so basically I can talk to my

434
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,079
When they're outside my door

435
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:53,151
Oh well yeah

436
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,431
So I get it

437
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:57,247
Yeah it sucks again maybe Chamberlain

438
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,271
Will clarify

439
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:00,319
The conversation that you're having with them

440
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:06,207
The communications I should say and we can get some information I suspect we should probably prepare ourselves for other

441
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:07,999
Ifft partners that are going to have to

442
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:10,047
A charge unless they're going to eat these costs

443
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:10,815
In the future

444
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,095
Eat the cost

445
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:19,263
So we have a start-up that I have followed for a while because I knew its founder Jesse Robbins who is

446
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,543
Chef

447
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,567
Which is a

448
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:23,359
Cloud configuration manager

449
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:25,663
If you guys are like what the heck

450
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:26,431
Just ignore it

451
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:28,479
The point is I've known him for a while

452
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:30,527
A couple years ago he started a pushed

453
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:31,807
To talk device

454
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:35,391
Ryan and this company basically you

455
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:37,695
Got a little microphone speaker thing

456
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:40,511
He clipped it under your shirt or your lapel when you push it

457
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:41,535
And you say something

458
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:44,095
And then a team member whose part of that Circle

459
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:45,375
To hear it

460
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,655
I like walkie talkies like

461
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:49,215
They're fun so I like the idea and now

462
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:51,519
What they're doing is real-time translation

463
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,103
I actually thought that was a really powerful

464
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,127
Thing to put

465
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:58,943
On a walkie-talkie like device that is

466
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,735
Just attached to your lapel

467
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,015
Kevin says

468
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:07,903
I fail to see why people keep trying to companies keep trying to

469
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:10,463
Reinvent things add-ons

470
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:12,511
Stand-alone devices when

471
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:18,911
All the functionality could easily be done with the phone that you would likely already have because this Tech is very cool don't get me wrong

472
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,191
I know you like a saying

473
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:23,775
Can you show me the video and it definitely changed my mind that's what they're doing here but

474
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,311
These are little clip on

475
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,591
Microphone speakers

476
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:27,871
That you press

477
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,663
To talk Wichita

478
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:32,223
They're bluetooth-connected so you can only do this from

479
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:35,039
You know within 30 feet or so charge your phone

480
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:37,855
It actually goes back to your phone and there's an app

481
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:42,719
Cat with the translation and so on so you're already relying on a phone I'm just struggling why

482
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:45,023
They're doing another device approach

483
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:45,791
To be honest

484
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,327
I think it's up to me I'm excited

485
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,351
Hands-free

486
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:49,631
Or mostly hands

487
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:51,679
So I don't have to hold my phone

488
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:56,031
If my phone is in my pocket and it's on and I'm trying to communicate with someone doing real time

489
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:59,871
Speech-to-text is going to be muffled because it's in my pocket so that was

490
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:00,639
My thought

491
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:03,455
I'm like this is just clicked on your body just hit it

492
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:09,343
Yeah and I get that I do it it's to that extent it snow a little wearable device

493
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:15,487
I don't know if you have to push talk before you say everything or it's just the one time on and one time off but I mean again

494
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:17,791
They're leveraging the cloud in the phone

495
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:19,071
Foreign the app

496
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:21,631
All the communication bits and so on so to me it's like

497
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:25,471
My phone can be used hands-free it's already got the mic and speaker in the Bluetooth built-in

498
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,519
Why do I need another Mike going to speaker

499
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,079
I think

500
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:30,847
I don't know

501
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:32,639
I think the functionality

502
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:37,759
Stacy and Kevin

503
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:42,879
Sad

504
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,159
Sympatico we are at

505
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:49,023
So let's do some quick news fits before we get to our voicemail question

506
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:52,095
Do shorter are actually I guess it would be do Samantha

507
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,119
Of the week but

508
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,399
District 7 fancy dress

509
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:56,447
Samsung

510
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:57,727
Samsung

511
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:59,263
Which we have talked about earlier

512
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:01,567
Has joined Edge X Foundry

513
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:02,335
Which

514
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,359
You don't have to remember

515
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:06,431
But this is an industrial iot

516
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,455
Middleware

517
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:08,479
Organization

518
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:11,039
Which again not the sexiest

519
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,319
Staying in the world

520
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,855
But crucially

521
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:18,720
I like this project it feels to me like what pivotal was for cloud cam

522
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:21,280
Shooting people still don't use pivotal

523
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:22,304
Enterprises do

524
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:23,584
Amazon

525
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,608
All those guys are

526
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:25,888
We got our own cloud

527
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:30,240
These guys for industrial iot I feel like it's

528
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:32,288
Probably going to be really relevant

529
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:34,080
Because not everybody wants to

530
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:36,640
Put all their industrial secret data

531
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:37,408
In the clouds

532
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,432
Amazons

533
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:39,456
Measure

534
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:42,272
So edgex Foundry

535
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,576
You may not but I

536
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:45,600
Actually really hot

537
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:46,368
Optimistic about it

538
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:47,392
Sociocentric

539
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:48,416
And

540
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:51,488
They did it because they want to do their Industrial iot

541
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,512
And make sure

542
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:54,048
It is applicable

543
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:55,072
To all of the

544
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,096
Potential industry

545
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,632
Customers so

546
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:58,912
They have been working with

547
00:21:59,424 --> 00:21:59,936
Ocf

548
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:02,496
Activity Foundation

549
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:04,032
And

550
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:05,824
This is just to ads

551
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:08,128
So just just a little news bit

552
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:14,784
I suspect that they also are doing this because it's less of a compartmentalised

553
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,088
Approach like some of the other vendors that you mentioned

554
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:18,880
If this is a Linux Foundation

555
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:19,648
Project

556
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:21,696
And Tyson is

557
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:22,720
Linux paste

558
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:27,072
Samsung's iot platform so I can do it with don't want to be shut out

559
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:29,376
In terms of industrial iot when it comes to tizen

560
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,680
Samsung

561
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:32,704
Security game online

562
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,264
All right we also headache

563
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,544
Kickstarter projects

564
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,080
Is

565
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:40,128
Glow

566
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:41,920
More energy

567
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,200
And

568
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:46,528
Just came across my radar this

569
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:48,320
Past weekend it is still an open

570
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:54,720
In project if you'd like to back it it's an all-or-nothing project as well so it's only fun that it reaches its Gold by fry

571
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:56,256
Geez September 14th

572
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:57,536
It did reach the goal

573
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:03,936
So I'd go with 75000 something 96,000 reminds me when I look at the device itself

574
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:05,216
Reminds me a lot of

575
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:06,240
Hey Google

576
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:11,360
Device has the same similar air freshener shape but it doesn't do anything except

577
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,640
Show a light

578
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:13,920
And that light will be

579
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:16,736
Ranging in color from green to red

580
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:20,320
Depending on how much energy you're currently using in your house

581
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:22,880
And at the other piece of this there is a

582
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:24,928
A device that you put on top of

583
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,976
Your outdoor

584
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:27,744
Smart

585
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,632
Meter in that sensor uses magnetoresistance technology to wirelessly measure power usage

586
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:35,680
So it's simple to install and

587
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:36,704
And use

588
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,752
And when using a lot of juice

589
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:44,128
Spending the lights candy red also web-based dashboard so that you can see real-time innovation

590
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:45,664
If I repair air conditioner Heat

591
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,968
You'll see a jumper spike in that and so on

592
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:52,064
This thing about this I do find it very interesting obviously I would have brought it up

593
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:55,392
We seen other more complex systems that offer for more info

594
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:56,672
Permission and I think

595
00:23:56,928 --> 00:24:00,512
Do you still have a system like that that gets down to the Circuit level

596
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:01,280
Baidu

597
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:03,072
I don't have it on anymore because

598
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:04,096
And here's my issue

599
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,376
All of these things are like

600
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:07,168
Yo you're using a lot of energy

601
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:08,960
But I have taken as a homeowner

602
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:10,240
Almost all the steps

603
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:11,520
Without

604
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:12,288
Really impact

605
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,312
Quality of life

606
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:17,408
Things but I'm not going to keep my air conditioner.

607
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,432
AT&T middle of the summer

608
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:25,088
I totally get that I think if you've gone as far as you and I have as well

609
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:31,232
It's more of a behavioral thing like Jesus did somebody leave lights on or something cuz we were using a lot of juice that we don't normally use here

610
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:34,304
Automated the heck out of our house so

611
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:35,584
Don't usually

612
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:43,264
I'm not against this I think at CD I saw some more interesting energy monitoring things so so

613
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,080
Which is a professional installer product

614
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:48,128
Had a really interesting

615
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:49,152
System that work

616
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:50,688
Plug into your all of your Breakers

617
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:52,224
And control them so like

618
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,272
1/2 generator power you

619
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:58,624
You could say hey you know what I want my generator only to power my fridge and

620
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,648
And my freezer

621
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:02,208
And actually that you could do if you hardwire

622
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:03,488
My dad

623
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:06,048
Crazy so he hardwired his Jenner

624
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:08,096
For most people that's

625
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,728
There was also some interesting battery storage options

626
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,264
Like Sonnen has one

627
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:17,056
It allows you to automatic

628
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,592
Are the powerful

629
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:19,360
Batteries

630
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,664
Which again

631
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,968
Is super cool especially if you

632
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:24,736
Do you have like an event

633
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,600
That was like a this is kind of cute to be good for

634
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:31,648
For kids like I could see installing when in the classroom

635
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:32,416
Middle school tutor

636
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:33,696
Educate people about this

637
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,232
Take a piss

638
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,000
I didn't want

639
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:43,168
Yeah they close not for me either I'm going to do think it's very interesting but you and I are at a different stage when it comes to a home automation

640
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:44,192
Energy monitoring

641
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:44,960
For somebody who

642
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:51,360
Is new to energy monitoring and doesn't have a lot of devices that can already going to be automated to help reduce electricity

643
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,640
Might be worth it

644
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:58,272
So is going to cost you $199 right now which is 30% off the expected retail price

645
00:25:58,528 --> 00:25:59,552
So much cheap

646
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,320
So cheap

647
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:01,344
Which energy does a

648
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:04,928
That's an LED bulb inside at least

649
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,024
Alright let's take a question

650
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,560
From our hotline

651
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:11,584
But first

652
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,144
Let us tell you what are iot hotline is

653
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,680
It is the number is

654
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:17,216
512

655
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:18,752
6 to 3

656
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:20,544
742 4

657
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:22,848
Awesome so call us with your question

658
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:23,872
And this week

659
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:25,408
We have a question

660
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:26,176
From

661
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:29,760
Anita

662
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:30,784
This is

663
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:32,320
Kevin from Raleigh

664
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:36,416
In Raleigh North Carolina

665
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:38,464
And yes you can use this on the air

666
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:39,488
I'm

667
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:41,280
In possession of a butterfly

668
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:44,608
15 + year old home security system

669
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:46,144
It's not very high tech

670
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,424
Works fine

671
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:50,496
And what I'd like to do is do away with the dialer

672
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:52,032
And monitoring clause

673
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:54,336
And leverage that are newer

674
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:57,920
Internet-based and wondering if there's a way to breach the two

675
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:59,968
I know it matters a lot as

676
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:00,992
To which one

677
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:02,528
Generically

678
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:04,576
Can we use that as an uplink

679
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:05,600
Instead of the

680
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:06,880
Cellular.

681
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:07,904
They provide

682
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,184
Some kind of a

683
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:13,280
Thanks a lot look forward to more info

684
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:16,864
Okay Kevin that is a tough question but probably a really common one

685
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,680
And we are going to punt a little bit

686
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,008
We think your best option is probably to

687
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:25,824
I'll be honest you may have to make

688
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:27,360
I could get rid of that monitor

689
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:35,808
That's definitely an option I mean I hate to say that when there's probably a lot of wired sensors that are still good obviously they see you say they stole

690
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:37,344
I work everything works well with

691
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:42,208
You know you're paying a service fee to somebody and so on plus you're stuck on a dial-up line for the canoe

692
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:43,744
Nativity to the vet system

693
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,024
Again if you want to keep what you

694
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,048
You want that

695
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:48,608
Fine they're actually options to do that

696
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:52,704
Depending on your service provider if its ATT or some other

697
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:59,104
Similar service they will likely offer you at a very low cost or maybe even free an option to switch from dial

698
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,896
Does cellular for the

699
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:01,920
Modern bits

700
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:06,528
So that way you don't need to have the landline and kind of upgraded you'll still obviously pay your service

701
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:11,136
But at least you can do that but you can also look into the options to do that you're

702
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:16,000
Self such as using devices like the or the magicJack

703
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:17,792
Which will switch you from

704
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:19,072
Cellular used to

705
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:25,472
Voice over IP but again if you try to give her the service fee I hate to say it but it's going to be really tough

706
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:31,872
What to do with a fifteen-year-old system in my opinion I mean unless you want to do some heavy-duty coding and monitor these old sis

707
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:32,640
Distance yourself

708
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:36,224
Frankly I think it's well worth your time and effort to just to upgrade it

709
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:39,296
Yes if you are technically minded I believe

710
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,064
Asterix

711
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:42,368
Has you can look for some code

712
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:43,648
That you can use

713
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:45,696
Using Asterix that will actually

714
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:46,720
Communicate

715
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,768
With the wired alarm system

716
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,048
As a dialer

717
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:52,096
That's that's

718
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:53,120
Pretty hardcore

719
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:54,144
If you want to go hardcore

720
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:55,424
That's what

721
00:28:56,192 --> 00:29:02,336
It comes down to it what are you going to do with the data from that system then if not somebody else isn't going to monitor it and because it's old

722
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,920
JL torticollis old approaches old

723
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:10,016
It's going to be a challenge I just I really don't know that would be worth it in the long run

724
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:11,552
But if you want a new security system

725
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:12,320
Can we have some option

726
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:13,856
Abode

727
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:15,136
Is actually very good

728
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:21,280
Biotin install it but it's very easy to install I've Heard lots of good things about it

729
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:24,096
SimpliSafe a lot of people like it it does have a monitoring

730
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:25,120
Component but

731
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:25,888
It is

732
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:27,168
Most expensive

733
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:33,568
And another option that if you want to keep a monitored security system you could also call

734
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:36,384
Call someone like an alarm.com and see what

735
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,152
They will do

736
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:38,432
U-kiss baby

737
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:39,712
Be able to provide

738
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:41,504
An integration kind of

739
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,320
From the old sensors to a new platform

740
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:48,672
Before but alarm has the added bow

741
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:49,440
Jonas

742
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:50,720
Colados

743
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:58,912
And actually I mean I used to have an ADT system exactly what Kevin is describing and I wasn't thrilled with a

744
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:03,264
Tengo Madre service after a couple of years so today at just throwing it out there

745
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:09,664
I'm using my wink Hub which is relatively inexpensive a bunch of different door window sensors and an Eskimo

746
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:11,968
And I admire it myself there's no

747
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:16,576
Fee for any of that so I can check in on the system at any time from wherever I am

748
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:17,856
Maybe even coming up a lot

749
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:21,952
It wouldn't be that expensive to change out the

750
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:23,232
Depending on how many

751
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,792
Things you need monitoring if you got 50 windows

752
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:27,584
5 doors obviously it's going to

753
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,864
Add up quick but

754
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:33,984
Depending on how you do it or how much you need it can be relatively inexpensive

755
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:36,288
And you could also do things with motions

756
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:38,080
Detection that you used to

757
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:39,360
You have to have a

758
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:40,128
Like a window

759
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:42,432
Thinking outside the box

760
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,200
Are you call somebody like

761
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:44,736
The Canary Islands

762
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:45,504
Let's see what happens

763
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,296
Options

764
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:52,672
None of which are exactly what you're after but hopefully this gives you the direction depending on how you decide

765
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:53,696
Play this you have some

766
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:55,488
You have some pads

767
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:58,048
That is it

768
00:30:58,304 --> 00:30:59,328
For this part of the show

769
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,864
Stay tuned

770
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:02,656
A message from our sponsor

771
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:03,424
And

772
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,192
4

773
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:04,960
Our Guest

774
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:05,984
David Martin

775
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:07,008
Who is a

776
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:08,544
Jolly Old Australian

777
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:15,968
Talking about how to build a distributed and resilient energy

778
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:16,736
Using

779
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:17,760
Blockchain

780
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:20,320
Yeah it's a really timely one given

781
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:21,600
Catastrophes that we

782
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:22,624
Experienced recently

783
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:24,928
Us and also because

784
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:25,952
Blockchain is like

785
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:27,232
Oh my God.

786
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:29,024
Did you enjoy it

787
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,304
It's super fun and

788
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:31,584
Really thoughtful

789
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:37,984
Forget about the future of our Energy System stay tuned we are breaking into the Internet of Things podcast

790
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:44,384
What's with the message from our sponsor portrait Ashley Stevenson here who is the identity and Technology director

791
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:50,784
We're going to talk about personalizing cars using for trucks digital identity manager

792
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:55,392
Which rock is working with auto manufacturers like Toyota on a bunch of digital

793
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:56,160
Initiatives

794
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:58,976
Why is identity technology needed

795
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:01,280
It is

796
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:06,144
Is really needed more now than ever before because of something that is disrupting the automotive

797
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:10,752
Industry

798
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:12,544
Needing to monetize services

799
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,080
Through the vehicle platforms

800
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:15,616
Just like apple did with their

801
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:17,664
Play music in order to do that

802
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,944
The Autumn Manufacturing

803
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:25,600
Know who the user is inside of the car not just for personalization but also for monetizing public services

804
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:27,648
Kaitlyn

805
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,696
Wow that is a lot of really cool

806
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:30,464
Cool things

807
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:32,256
My vehicle so

808
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:33,536
We are hearing more about the

809
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:34,560
Automotive grade Linux

810
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:38,400
Can you tell us what that's about what role for truck

811
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:41,216
Absolutely so Automotive grade Linux

812
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:45,056
Is an organization under the Linux foundation and it was put together by

813
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:46,080
Consortium of

814
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:47,616
Different Automotive OEM

815
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:54,016
To basically cut the cost initially of the infotainment system in a vehicle that was engineered separately

816
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:55,552
Different build cycle

817
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:56,832
Instead it's

818
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:57,600
Secure

819
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:58,880
Baseline operating so

820
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:01,184
Vehicle

821
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,464
Any auto manufacturer

822
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,744
On top of it

823
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:11,168
I feel but that they would get a secure Base Line operating system on top of which they could build

824
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:15,776
Years ago and we have become the identity layer of automotive

825
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:19,616
So that Vehicles can actually be identity aware and can authenticate user

826
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:23,200
Susan understand who the user is in the context of the vehicle

827
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:24,992
Not just the driver but also the past

828
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:29,344
Vehicles with the baby for a vehicle that they're renting or just

829
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,184
No I'm not sure the general listener understands

830
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,208
Tao complex

831
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:36,000
The overall connected-car environment

832
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:38,816
Can you talk to me about what's going on with

833
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:40,864
Vehicle 2 cloud vehicle

834
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:42,400
Vehicle-to-infrastructure you

835
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:46,496
Personalization inside the vehicle is only half

836
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:48,800
The battle because the connected car is

837
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:55,200
Is essentially a note on the internet once that cellular radio goes live every vehicle is essentially a rolling iot

838
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:56,480
To that end

839
00:33:56,736 --> 00:34:00,064
The vehicle itself and all the components inside of the vehicle

840
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,088
Also needs

841
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:04,672
Secure digital identities and relationships between each other

842
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:06,464
In order to secure their active

843
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:09,536
So for a vehicle to make a call to the clouds

844
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:11,072
Azure cloud service

845
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:17,472
Send a secure aliviar update to a vehicle or traffic signal

846
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:19,264
Vehicles

847
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,032
Json has to be

848
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:20,800
Be trusted

849
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:27,200
And Trust comes back to understanding the identity of an attribution of what that vehicle itself actually is

850
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:29,248
All right that is a lot to digest

851
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:31,296
Where can I go to find out more

852
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:32,064
About 4

853
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:37,184
Edible.com in under one of the dropdowns we have this

854
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:40,000
Page dedicated to are connected.

855
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:49,216
Hey everyone welcome back to the intern

856
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:54,592
This is your host Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest is David Martin

857
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:56,384
Who is the CEO of

858
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,152
Power Ledger

859
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:58,688
Hi David how are you doing

860
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,480
I sent you I'm really well thank you

861
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:01,248
Awesome

862
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,528
So I have been told

863
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:04,320
That I always tell people that I

864
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:05,344
Really excited

865
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,392
So today

866
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:08,160
I am not real

867
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:10,208
Ecstatic

868
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:11,488
To have you on the show

869
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,096
So we are going to talk about

870
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:18,144
Something near and dear to my heart which is

871
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:18,912
Blockchain

872
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:20,960
Renewable energy

873
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:23,776
Alright David

874
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:25,056
You're the CEO of the

875
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:27,616
Why don't you tell us

876
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:29,152
What it is that you're trying

877
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:31,456
We're trying to become

878
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:37,856
That distributed Ledger after I distributed Energy Future I'm not distributed Energy Future is typically renewable and

879
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:41,952
And it's typically owned by the citizens of the world so I quit trying to do it

880
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:45,792
Put the power to manage the Energy System back in the hands of every diaper

881
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:46,816
Oh my gosh

882
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:47,584
The power to the

883
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:49,888
Literally

884
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:51,168
All right

885
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,240
So you guys have started out with a trial

886
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:55,776
In Perth Australia

887
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:56,544
Waukesha

888
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,824
Through what this

889
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:02,176
So actually started a trial phase in October Alaska

890
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:03,712
Manafort trial

891
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:07,296
A place called Bustleton it's about 200 kilometers south of Perth

892
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:09,088
And it was in a lost dog

893
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:10,624
Can we had something about 20

894
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,696
Consuming some with payday and some of that and we installed

895
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:14,464
Marches

896
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:20,096
Each of the Alameda and we started reading how much energy that are producing and consuming as a group

897
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:21,120
Were these people living

898
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:21,888
Totally off the

899
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,448
That were tied into an embedded net worth

900
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:27,008
Worksite pteropodidae a lifestyle Village

901
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:33,408
And that Village had a single point of connection to the local grid and then an embedded Network. Supply.

902
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,432
Private Network

903
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:35,712
Supplied all of the

904
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:36,480
Consumers

905
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:42,112
In that embedded almost microgrid scenario sorry some of those consumers have payday panels already

906
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:43,904
And when I still going to be in

907
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:49,280
Into the network that I wasn't getting anything for it so I thought I need making money off their solar panels on the roof when they were harmed

908
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:54,144
Trinity side rather than just

909
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,168
Spilling that energy

910
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:56,448
Make directed into a

911
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:57,216
Capoeira

912
00:36:58,752 --> 00:36:59,776
Energy bars

913
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:01,312
Acreage by the energy

914
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:05,664
And then I remember right the generator for their trouble sorry we use the blockchain to

915
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,992
Disintermediate the whole energy supply chain process

916
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:13,600
Music generated directly in touch with a consumer and zap prices

917
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,648
Then in real-time measures

918
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:16,928
Generation output

919
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:17,696
Consumption

920
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:20,512
King size three things together as a physical transaction

921
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:27,168
And because of the blockchain giving us an immutable record of all the terms and conditions and values in the transaction Bravo the time

922
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:27,936
Financial trends

923
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:31,776
Instead of saying to a customer you're not going to get anything

924
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:33,056
If your energy that you're storing it

925
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:35,360
The great inside you can sell it to next door neighbor

926
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:38,176
Next door neighbor Robinson you have to

927
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:38,944
Depay

928
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:43,552
The energy that you're buying from the grid how about you pay your next-door neighbor $0.20

929
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:45,088
Identify Gap in the middle

930
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:48,672
Finding the local distribution Network tonight imma keep it upright

931
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:50,208
Wow that was a whole lot

932
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:52,256
So we're going to break some things down

933
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:53,792
You did a great job explaining

934
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:56,352
Why I generator

935
00:37:57,888 --> 00:37:59,424
Somewhere in there

936
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,216
They're usually utilities are

937
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:03,264
Are people who put an investment in a

938
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,032
Grid system

939
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:06,080
And we are still using

940
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:07,616
That Grid 2

941
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:08,896
Send power back

942
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:09,920
Can 4th even

943
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:10,688
In the scenario

944
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:12,480
Absolutely

945
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:14,528
Using a local network is really important

946
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:16,576
Because it's tacky point out to Big investment

947
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:17,856
Is billions of dollars of

948
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:24,000
Investment locked up in in networks around the world. And we're not trying to destroy value while we're trying to disrupt the energy

949
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:27,328
What we're saying is that consumers who are using that net

950
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,352
I've been

951
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:29,376
Unfairly

952
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:31,936
Charge for the amount of the network that actually use

953
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:34,496
And the value of their investment

954
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:35,776
In Renewables

955
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:37,312
Something Family Guy

956
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:39,104
We're looking at a while

957
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,384
Of making sure that consumers

958
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:43,200
I finally got them out of the network that I use

959
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:45,504
And that dream directly Translate

960
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,808
Interesting engagement or sales process with

961
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:49,856
I need a picture of Len plus proximity Tatum

962
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:51,136
Okay so

963
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:52,672
Y tho what are utility

964
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:55,232
Want to let you in on their power meter

965
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:56,000
Paris to do

966
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:57,536
This that's the important

967
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:58,304
Thanks

968
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,096
If we look at what's actually happening

969
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:01,888
In energy Supply around the world

970
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:04,960
Is it normal to protecting from the Greek

971
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:07,008
In some way so they buying this energy

972
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,104
That process going to it's almost your logical

973
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,128
Conclusion

974
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:14,176
Batteries get cheaper consumer

975
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:18,528
Houston net worth less and less and less

976
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:19,552
The cost of running

977
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:20,320
The networks

978
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:23,648
Australia the regulated tariff process

979
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:26,976
An impact of consumers going off grid with Paving storage

980
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:33,376
And you got 10 years Tom Alico Network business will be losing a hundred million dollars a year

981
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:39,008
Going to Raytown tariffs as well as lose

982
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:41,568
Of revenues because of that fall in consumer purchasing

983
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:44,896
The worst thing for the network is that more and more consumers

984
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:45,664
Eloquent

985
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,456
Because it's Network pricing website

986
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:48,480
Not like bikes

987
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:50,784
Demandforce the project

988
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:51,552
McDonald's app

989
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:52,576
I'm sorry we get this

990
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:54,112
Death spiral Dynamics

991
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:55,392
SQL consumers use the

992
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:56,672
Is it going to rain Sunday

993
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:01,280
Spotify

994
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:02,048
Active life

995
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:03,840
Check my network

996
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:06,400
Allowing consumers to use the network as a

997
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:08,960
Are really strong incentive

998
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:12,032
Had to kick the network utilized

999
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:13,568
Highlights of the distribution metal

1000
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:16,128
At night time the body of networks I belong to

1001
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:19,200
Talk to me about the economic so what do you get out of this

1002
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:19,968
Guess what are you selling

1003
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:20,736
And then

1004
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:22,272
What do the utilities get out

1005
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:23,552
I understand it

1006
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:24,832
You can tell them hey

1007
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:27,392
You're not going to die cuz not everyone's going to leave you

1008
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:28,672
But at the same time

1009
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:29,696
They probably want some

1010
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:31,744
Nothing today plus they got the investment they need

1011
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,512
Continue making

1012
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:33,280
In the local

1013
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:37,376
That's right side what way I will to do is pull out some of

1014
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:38,400
The cost associated with

1015
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:39,168
With the existing

1016
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:41,984
Power supply Dalian China

1017
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,032
When you're buying electricity or buying

1018
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:47,360
A combination of energy of energy transport a transmission

1019
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:48,640
Distribution level

1020
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:50,688
Operation

1021
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:51,968
Retail operations

1022
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,320
Andre, what we're trying to do is pull out as many of those cost

1023
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:58,624
Since we can't set that those costs can be shared

1024
00:40:59,136 --> 00:40:59,904
That the generator

1025
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:02,208
In consumer we need to understand

1026
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:03,488
What it actually cost

1027
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:07,328
How to use just save 50 of the distribution Network at the end

1028
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:10,400
Inside this is how much

1029
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:12,448
Pasta wheel

1030
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,984
From your last one night or two

1031
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:19,872
Two Doors Down

1032
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:21,664
Bet networks provide that the high-level

1033
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:23,456
Aram system stability

1034
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,504
Insecurities and I saw

1035
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:29,088
Prices. Costs need to be worth

1036
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:33,952
Going to understand if a consumer is only using

1037
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:35,488
I really small slice of

1038
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,512
Distribution Network

1039
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:38,304
What actually is a fair price

1040
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:41,632
Bearing in mind that we can't get that right

1041
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:42,656
Bill Kennedy

1042
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:44,704
Thanks but nice

1043
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,496
I'll put a battery in my garage

1044
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:47,520
And I'll see you later

1045
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:50,848
Well it we've also discovered that there are a lot of hidden costs

1046
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:55,967
They may be hidden costs they may be actually the externalities associated with some of this dysentery

1047
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:58,271
Mediation so I'm thinking about things like

1048
00:41:58,527 --> 00:42:01,343
The health and safety of workers with Uber taking

1049
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:02,111
The sheriff

1050
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:03,135
Ride sharing app

1051
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:05,695
So what do you see like

1052
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:08,255
When I hear you talk about this I worry about

1053
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:10,815
The cost associated with operating

1054
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:11,583
The backbone

1055
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:12,351
The pig

1056
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:13,119
Nationwide

1057
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:16,191
What we have at the moment is an energy bar

1058
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:17,215
That is splitting down the

1059
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:23,615
The same way we've always had the view that large-scale generators exist somewhere a long way away

1060
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:25,663
Why were you can't hear the most smell the most

1061
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:27,199
And I push electricity through

1062
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:29,247
Transmission systems in distribution system

1063
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:35,647
Deliver electricity to your front door and that's the way that the physical system is always locked

1064
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:36,671
What's evaporated

1065
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:38,719
Givenchy Frameworks of operated

1066
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:40,255
But now in the last 10 years

1067
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:41,535
More and more consumers

1068
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:42,303
7 Stone

1069
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:44,095
Power stations on the road specially

1070
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:45,631
And there's more of an input

1071
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:48,703
Distributed generation outweigh the consumers

1072
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:50,751
Whole Market model doesn't make sense any

1073
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:53,567
The industry

1074
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:54,591
Kind of force

1075
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:57,919
Small plastic play I bought a big Market Rose doesn't make sense

1076
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:02,783
Trying to track my fat rolls that. Big blast off right in the same like a little guy so it doesn't

1077
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:05,087
So what we need to do is text talk

1078
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:07,391
What the market actually looks like we have

1079
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:08,671
A primary and a secondary

1080
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:14,047
So we just need to sit back take a deep breath

1081
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:19,935
Understand that this change is happening the Genie's out of the bottle consumers will continue to do and Siemens do

1082
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:26,335
We need to change that the market Frameworks in the regulatory Frameworks to reflect the fact that the system doesn't look like it's OS

1083
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:28,127
So we've got this by 4

1084
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:28,895
Located

1085
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:31,711
And on one side we've got

1086
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:33,759
The Long Haul generation

1087
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:34,783
Transmission

1088
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:38,367
On the other side we have microgrids local

1089
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:41,183
Peavey neighborhood-based things

1090
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:43,487
Neighborhoods that have access to renewable

1091
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:44,511
Falls in

1092
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:46,559
Possibly battery storage that

1093
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:48,095
Could create their own

1094
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:49,119
Market inter

1095
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:50,911
Absolutely

1096
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:52,191
Cuz you're going to need to still

1097
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:56,287
Call on the larger generation facilities you know in the middle of the night

1098
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:57,055
The wind doesn't blow

1099
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:57,823
Ain't that sort of thing

1100
00:43:58,591 --> 00:44:01,151
In my we use electricity to keep out fridge is running in

1101
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:06,527
Electricity we don't use it for electricity so I can use it for the amenity

1102
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:12,671
What we get from the analogy of security is it fair that we don't need to have huge backup Taylor Swift

1103
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:17,279
It's a huge Camino back up for some rich there because there are markets available

1104
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:18,559
And services about

1105
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:22,911
We can replace one or we can with a lot of pretty quickly

1106
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:26,495
So we'll go in the future for energy Supply

1107
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:30,335
So we can't really live without future thinking of the energy

1108
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:31,359
System 5

1109
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:36,479
Assisting framework to sign up we will always need large-scale backup over

1110
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:37,247
Made some phone

1111
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:38,527
Redundancy summary

1112
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:41,087
Will probably always need some form of alternate

1113
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:42,367
But what that looks like

1114
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:44,927
Like in the shark attacks in the next 5 to 10 years is

1115
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:50,559
He said five years ago you wouldn't need a taxi because the guy next door to you has another by and you

1116
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:51,839
Controlling up on your phone

1117
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:52,607
To an app

1118
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:54,143
I'm getting to deliver you where you need

1119
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:58,239
Now we really used to Aruba

1120
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:05,663
Since I woke my battery is running down I've had 3 days of really heavy Cloud love you so my energy energy storage

1121
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:08,991
An app to get somebody with an electric vehicle

1122
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:12,575
Blocking my driveway plugging and discharges battery into my battery

1123
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:15,647
That's the sort of redundancy the sort of market for energy

1124
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:17,183
Future

1125
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:18,975
Again before we get into the technical stuff

1126
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:20,255
Which I promise you will do

1127
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:22,559
What happens when you have something

1128
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:24,351
Like

1129
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:28,703
Harvey or something when you have like a massive situation

1130
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:30,751
It maybe this doesn't happen

1131
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:32,287
TVs are real

1132
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:33,055
I don't know

1133
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:34,079
Cuz that's what people

1134
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:35,103
Build the grid

1135
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:35,871
For today

1136
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:37,151
So in this model

1137
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:38,687
How should we be thinking about the

1138
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:39,455
The future in

1139
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:40,991
Managing catastrophe

1140
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:45,855
Thank you point is it for you but I don't know if you're aware of the Rave New York progress

1141
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:47,391
That was developed after Hurricane

1142
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:49,951
Find Sandy Hurricane Sandy

1143
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:50,975
Transmission systems

1144
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:52,255
A New Yorkers black

1145
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:53,023
4 a number

1146
00:45:58,399 --> 00:45:58,911
Happy City

1147
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:04,287
Without any looking at how you bring distributed energy sources back

1148
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:06,591
And it's not just paleo

1149
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:08,895
Backup generator

1150
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:11,967
Gonzaga University campus

1151
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:16,319
Actually bringing the generations back to where they can soon as outside

1152
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:18,623
There are two things going on number things going on

1153
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:26,047
Whether it's renewable or what

1154
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:29,887
Generation if you're bringing generation back to where the

1155
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:30,655
Consumers

1156
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:34,495
You're the making the system more resilient in the face of things like anime

1157
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:36,031
Hurricane Sandy

1158
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:36,799
Catastrophe

1159
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:38,079
Alright and now

1160
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:39,103
Now it is

1161
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:43,199
I should stress that the reason

1162
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:44,991
Dave is on the show is

1163
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:46,527
Because none of this would be

1164
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:47,295
Possible

1165
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:48,063
Without

1166
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:49,343
Hbase.

1167
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:50,623
Computing which

1168
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:51,391
And connective

1169
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:53,183
Which is basically The Internet of Things

1170
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:56,767
You can't do this without having some sort of distributed

1171
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:57,535
Processing

1172
00:46:58,047 --> 00:46:58,559
Acacia Network

1173
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:00,351
Just a bit

1174
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:01,375
Update for you

1175
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:03,167
Let's talk

1176
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:03,935
About

1177
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:05,215
What this entails

1178
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:06,495
We talked about the blockchain

1179
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:08,543
But let's break it down further

1180
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:10,591
What else are using in addition to the

1181
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:14,943
We trade all the makers all the time

1182
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:16,991
So we can tell how much a consumer is

1183
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:18,527
How much is generator

1184
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:19,295
Generating

1185
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:22,623
Awaken Paradise 2 inputs and outputs together

1186
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:25,183
Using the blockchain as an immutable record

1187
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:27,231
Permanent historical record of the

1188
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:28,767
Transaction has taken place

1189
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:34,143
And because we have that certainty around the physical contribution to the transaction we can then tie Financial

1190
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:40,543
Transaction to a very quick time in the energy in tuvalu marketing tool in which the energy is produced and consumed

1191
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:41,823
Speaking Thai Financial

1192
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:43,103
Transaction to that as well

1193
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:44,895
And the blockchain aspect

1194
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:47,199
Of this is part of your software

1195
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:49,247
So you got your software that runs in the cloud

1196
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:50,527
Are the trading

1197
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:53,855
Okay it's figuring out pricing and

1198
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:55,647
And

1199
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:56,671
You've got

1200
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:58,207
Is it aetherium is a

1201
00:47:58,463 --> 00:48:00,255
Bitcoin is it something about yourself

1202
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:04,095
It's something we build ourselves we use of private blockchain

1203
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:05,119
Can cold Pikachu

1204
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:06,399
We created ourselves

1205
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:07,935
It's a proof of

1206
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:09,215
Start blockchain

1207
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:11,263
And we use it as I

1208
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:12,031
Close look

1209
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:12,799
Triton Bar

1210
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:14,591
So we have trusted nodes

1211
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:16,639
Recording. Tattoo that blockchain

1212
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:21,503
And if we don't have enough noise on the but trying to give a sip sufficient security that we made with

1213
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:23,295
Entangle that. I with the

1214
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:29,183
Consumers and regulators and Banks

1215
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:30,719
A level of comfort.

1216
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:32,511
The energy that's being traded

1217
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:33,791
Fallout rain jacket

1218
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:37,119
Is not being used for any other

1219
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:40,447
Southway next door neighbor for a value

1220
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:42,495
I got baggage handler games for

1221
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:43,519
Application

1222
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:45,311
China

1223
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:46,079
Apple cash

1224
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:48,127
But I can see my who's buying energy in that

1225
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:54,783
Can log into the pallet of sod but I can pre-purchase they spend that you talking to me that you buy mobile telephone minutes

1226
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:56,575
She can buy tokens that represent

1227
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:58,367
Set the value of energy stock

1228
00:48:58,623 --> 00:48:59,135
Taipei

1229
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:00,927
So you got the lowest denomination

1230
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:04,255
Where you're from and then

1231
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:07,071
It depends at conditions of the Triad identified by your energy

1232
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:08,607
94 / $0.20

1233
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:12,191
And you get $0.15 in the network gets $0.05

1234
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:14,495
Spend I will transfer 20 spots

1235
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:15,263
Into that environment

1236
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:16,543
You'll get 15 of them

1237
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:17,823
The network will get father

1238
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:23,199
Guys fighting to the networks and your online wallet and Iver. Of time as you

1239
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:24,479
Fact fluency

1240
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:26,271
Fox you can go back to the system

1241
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:30,111
Everything nice box with cash

1242
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:32,671
Oh okay so there is Sparks for cash at the

1243
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:35,487
Cuz I was thinking about the poor utility who's going to have all these you

1244
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:36,255
Lisa Sparxxx

1245
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:38,559
Every trading act within that writing

1246
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:39,839
Environment will be able to

1247
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:41,375
Exchange kilowatt hours

1248
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:42,143
Sparks

1249
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:45,983
And then as I exit. Trying varmint this box I've been redeemed

1250
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:49,567
Crude from the initial purchase

1251
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:52,127
That we reduce the risk of numpy

1252
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:53,919
Because you've got to

1253
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:55,711
We also improve cash flows

1254
00:49:55,967 --> 00:50:00,831
Because you imagine you're the network and you'll get in five stock to every throw it out if he's being transact

1255
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:05,183
Your balance is going to rush it out really quickly

1256
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:07,487
Every die every 3 days rather than Whiting

1257
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:10,047
60 days or 3 months to get paid

1258
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:12,351
Improve

1259
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:13,631
Cash flow

1260
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:14,911
Network business as well

1261
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:16,447
Okay

1262
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:17,471
That was really

1263
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:23,359
Awesome from your perspective are you guys a tech company

1264
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:24,383
How do you think

1265
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:27,455
Registration document in the office of the time

1266
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:29,759
How a blockchain company Huawei in energy

1267
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:31,551
On the energy guide

1268
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:32,831
In the business so I've got to

1269
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:35,903
Particular by spit I think one of the things that strikes me around

1270
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:36,927
China

1271
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:39,231
At the moment is it's a remarkable piece of chicken

1272
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:41,535
Send amazing things

1273
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:47,935
But if you're not directing it towards a particular opportunity or dressing particular problem in many respects it's just

1274
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:51,775
Solution looking for a problem rather than a problem looking for a solution

1275
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:54,079
With the energy issue wait time for the engine

1276
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:56,127
Expected we saw Allied defection

1277
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:57,407
And falling you like I should

1278
00:50:58,431 --> 00:51:01,759
The problem we saw apartment buildings that couldn't Bondi

1279
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:02,783
That's fine with that allowed

1280
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:05,087
Tenants to install payday as a problem

1281
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:08,671
And we realize it has a really good solution to those two

1282
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:12,255
A problem sorry Energy company that uses

1283
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:13,023
Is the blockchain

1284
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:14,303
Provide solution

1285
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:19,167
Because I'm very curious what you think all of the currency speculation

1286
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:20,959
I don't know how else to put it but the

1287
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:23,007
Currency speculation around

1288
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:24,287
Blockchain

1289
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:26,079
Ethically cerium and pick

1290
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:30,175
Kind of what that means for a company whose trying to use this

1291
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:32,223
I think it's kind of being tended

1292
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:34,271
Purpose which is distributed trusted

1293
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:35,039
Transactions

1294
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:36,063
On the internet

1295
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:37,855
But that doesn't

1296
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:44,255
That's a utility token

1297
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:48,863
And that allows application host with the network business is our apartment building managers

1298
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:49,887
ShopRite

1299
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:50,911
The Den Bar

1300
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:51,935
Amanda Lawson

1301
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:53,215
Inside the pouch hiking

1302
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:53,983
Would be

1303
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:57,055
I Surrender door and held in escrow by pallet jack

1304
00:51:57,311 --> 00:51:59,615
Animatronic device Paltalk and we will give

1305
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:01,407
The application has the license

1306
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:05,247
How to use the platform and a pool of stocks to operate riding in barn

1307
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:08,319
And then that training environment because the stock is pegged

1308
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:09,343
To the lowest form

1309
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:13,695
The local currency there's no volatility so we don't get that the impact of speculation

1310
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:16,255
Cryptocurrencies flowing through into.

1311
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:18,303
That why either

1312
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:19,327
Consumers are protect

1313
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:20,863
Wicked from any volatility

1314
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:27,775
But we still get the benefit of a distributed Ledger that allows does specific training barnsby

1315
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:29,311
Interoperable

1316
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:30,079
Platform

1317
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:34,943
