00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:08,768
Let's talk about this week's big stories

57
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,048
Want to start with

58
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:12,864
Sonora testifying before Congress or

59
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,144
New York Times investigation

60
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:14,912
Pistons location

61
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:16,192
Choice

62
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:20,288
You do that's why I gave it to you this one this is a democratic show

63
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:22,848
It's like democratic

64
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:24,384
Singapore

65
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:28,224
That's right I'll take him under the table that were sitting at if he picks the wrong

66
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:31,040
How about we talk about the New York Times story

67
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:34,112
Alright so for everyone who did not read this New York

68
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:39,232
And story what they did is they looked at location data coming off of your ass

69
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,512
So when you

70
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:42,816
Tell an app that can track your location

71
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:46,144
You think that it's doing it for various reasons like geofencing

72
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,424
But in reality that dated

73
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,192
Can get

74
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:50,752
Told to advertisers and others who are interested in

75
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:51,776
Finding out demographic

76
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,824
The New York Times

77
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,360
Took that and they basically

78
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:57,152
Look at some of those files

79
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:59,712
House and saw that they could identify people

80
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:00,992
And they had a lot of quotes

81
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,528
Our people were like I am shot

82
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:03,296
Just drop

83
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,320
Did this happen

84
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:06,112
So old what was it take

85
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:08,160
Well I think I'm glad that

86
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:11,232
Story first of all it you no yes

87
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,256
It's just like you said

88
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:14,560
Your listeners may not be surprised

89
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:15,840
Just like my

90
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,632
Theaters on my personal blog

91
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:20,704
Won't be surprised that this is happening because

92
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,472
I think

93
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:24,288
If I remember correctly I've been writing about this for 10 years

94
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,872
I think I started writing about data and privacy van

95
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,152
Facebook launch

96
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,432
Beacon

97
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,456
Essentially

98
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,992
If you think about it

99
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,016
This is just

100
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:36,576
An extension of that idea crossed

101
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:37,600
Every little lie

102
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:39,136
Unfortunately

103
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,416
What is that

104
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,952
New York Times

105
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,744
A writing about this

106
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,768
After

107
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,840
Megan has happened so

108
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:50,400
Long ago these things started happening

109
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:52,704
And so now to talk about it

110
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,240
Is actually taking

111
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,032
Some

112
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,824
Action head is much more difficult

113
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:01,664
Because it's a little too late in Insidious

114
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,432
Attractive

115
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,712
Virginia's widely spread

116
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:05,504
I mean they just looked at

117
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,272
Summit

118
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,296
You know

119
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:10,112
There's not a day goes by when Piano Bar

120
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:12,928
Reaching some unknown

121
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,512
@nina Android store for example as you know

122
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:18,815
But having absolute unique information

123
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:22,143
The other thing is this has been happening for a long time

124
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:25,471
I'm not focusing on the fact that it is

125
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,263
Chrome extensions which doula

126
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,031
For a long time

127
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:32,383
You remember a long time ago there was a coming call report

128
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,919
And it was a plug-in

129
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:36,735
Legacy

130
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:39,295
Guess what quotes. DW used

131
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,855
Plugins like that

132
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:43,135
Extensions like that

133
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,183
Nicole

134
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,207
Recedes from

135
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,999
Amazon are they can

136
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,279
Figure it out like

137
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:52,607
Just a metadata going on forever

138
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,143
So the question is

139
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,679
What can you do about

140
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:58,495
Looking back we can't do anything about it

141
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,775
Looking forward weekend

142
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:01,567
Show my view

143
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:05,663
You know it's just my opinion is

144
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,967
That we should be looking to

145
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:09,759
Very highly regulated

146
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,807
All the data around

147
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:14,623
All the applications in privacy around

148
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:17,183
Watch devices rychcik morning our homes

149
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:19,231
They should be higher

150
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:19,999
Standard

151
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:22,303
Sparkles make Alexa type device

152
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:25,887
Absolutely you the next time you feel I think

153
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:26,655
You know

154
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:28,703
Amazon cannot get a vivid

155
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,495
Saying that all we didn't know

156
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:32,543
Looking Glass time for so long

157
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,823
Even app

158
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,383
I think Dad should be

159
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:38,687
National

160
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:40,223
Data privacy

161
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,503
ICB no

162
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,783
Quality should be

163
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,575
Another amendment to the car

164
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:47,903
Rihanna

165
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,439
Actually beginning to

166
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:54,047
See the merging of the man and machine have to change

167
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,327
NBA

168
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,351
And the cost

169
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,887
Execution has to kind of

170
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:02,751
Adaptive at the time and it needs to be in my mind around this notional

171
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:05,055
What color person data is invalid

172
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,079
Can be used

173
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:09,407
Right now all our personal data has no sense of pain

174
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:12,223
It is basically up for grabs

175
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,247
And for Abused

176
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:16,319
Nina from Manas air down to all the nefarious

177
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,159
Latest very little light control

178
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:23,743
What are our rights as Citizens

179
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:25,791
Okay so that's going forward

180
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:28,607
I don't know if I should be a

181
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:31,935
I'm not a constitutional scholar but that feels like

182
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,471
Such a high hurdle to pass

183
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,751
Because you have to get

184
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:36,287
So many states

185
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:40,127
I do think there are things we can do retroactively

186
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:40,895
2

187
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:42,175
Help with

188
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,711
Privacy in apps

189
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,015
With our devices that were wearing

190
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,319
Filtering out or data places

191
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,111
So what would you say

192
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:52,927
I mean I look at things like apple and their privacy

193
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:59,583
Even things like the loophole disease

194
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:02,143
Apps are explained is the fact that

195
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:04,959
When you give permissions in an app

196
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:05,983
Holistic

197
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:08,287
Permissions they're not telling you everything you're doing

198
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,055
I think

199
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,151
Popeyes

200
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,687
50 Constitutional Amendment

201
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:17,759
It if you don't start the conversation now

202
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,551
20 years from now

203
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:25,439
I think it did it needs to be

204
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,463
Some

205
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,743
Conversation with diesel

206
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:28,767
Today

207
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,327
Saying that enough

208
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:35,167
I have all the answers but I think your feet are smart people.

209
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,191
In the market today

210
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:39,519
Because going forward it would not just be

211
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,799
Largest yacht

212
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:42,847
Devices you can be

213
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,127
Rinaldi's connect

214
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:48,479
Which is it

215
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:52,063
Verbena robot assistants all these things

216
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,855
Wales become part of society

217
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:54,879
They are part of

218
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:57,951
Society I think of them as inanimate object

219
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:01,279
Text but they are sending data they are translating us

220
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:06,655
So we need to kind of thinking about these things

221
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,935
It's not just privacy

222
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,215
A larger

223
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,031
Stop

224
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,079
Insurance

225
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,359
Companies decide

226
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:17,151
That you don't deserve insurance

227
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:21,247
Senior master go out because you forgot to wear your

228
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:25,599
That is like humans

229
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:30,463
It's all carpet rights and what they can do with the data

230
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,511
No one is actually talking about

231
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,095
Peace about this about 2 years ago

232
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:36,863
What's call

233
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,447
Service no terms of trust

234
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,215
Yes

235
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:42,751
Basically actually eggs

236
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,799
Explaining to people

237
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:47,871
Howard this week

238
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:48,639
Collector

239
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,431
Unfortunately

240
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:55,039
No one wants to do that because the lawyer have put so much

241
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,087
Yuno constraints around

242
00:08:57,343 --> 00:09:01,695
I don't think it's just the lawyers I would argue that the easiest way to make a buck

243
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:04,511
Is to sell information to marketing

244
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,351
And I think that's a really big challenge

245
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:10,143
When they're trying to do something

246
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,191
Right

247
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,727
Maybe they've got investors

248
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:14,751
Who am I

249
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,311
It's very easy to give that

250
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:23,455
I mean that is definitely market for data looking Facebook and Google.

251
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:26,271
Facebook Tina Carter used to abuse

252
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:29,343
Privacy and data it continues to be used to knock

253
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,391
Civic Society

254
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,695
We can send a few more hours

255
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,303
Registering

256
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:41,119
Exactly the same thing

257
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:44,447
This is my whole point

258
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:50,847
Talk about the fact that

259
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:51,871
Dangers of bleach

260
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:54,943
Marriott 500 million

261
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:57,759
The cost to a human the time

262
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,039
Cosme

263
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:01,599
Protect my son

264
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:03,135
How is Maddie are going to

265
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:07,487
There was just a government Accounting Office

266
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,279
Report on the Experian app

267
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:12,863
And they were like this was so eminently affordable

268
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,399
And if you read that report it

269
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,703
Joe Ingram

270
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:21,311
These guys basically had and collected all of this

271
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:22,847
Some of their

272
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:23,615
Coliseum

273
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:24,895
They were aware

274
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,967
Good Security in place

275
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:28,735
End

276
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:29,503
They just really

277
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:34,367
Jackie and I think this is where I feel that if you have us

278
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:36,415
Stronger

279
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,951
Privacy Amendment

280
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,487
Answer the call

281
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:44,863
You know I like to see

282
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:47,935
The other US government impose like a 5 billion dollar

283
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,775
And I think the next one

284
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,567
Will be like overall we can't do that

285
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,359
Impose

286
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,895
Find

287
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,711
The Bible in dollars on. In the brain

288
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:01,503
Using diesel

289
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:04,319
So the environment pollution is

290
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,623
Solution

291
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,159
Data privacy leaves

292
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:13,023
Okay

293
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,583
From that standpoint needs to be regulated just like

294
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,631
Yarn company.

295
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:25,823
Automobile driving regulations

296
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,431
I'm just say

297
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:34,527
These are trying to do something about our government doesn't do anything about

298
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,319
Okay so you're

299
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,599
GDP

300
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:38,879
Do you want something

301
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:41,695
Stronger

302
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:45,279
Okay

303
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,815
Business

304
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,095
Needs to happen baby

305
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,119
Is people

306
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,679
Netherlands government

307
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:52,959
I think there's a lot of

308
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:56,031
Partizan will have to be taken care of

309
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:58,591
Gdpr is a good starting point for Europe

310
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,383
I think you would have to come up with

311
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,407
Changing battery

312
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:04,735
Okay and that actually ties into and we

313
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:08,063
We kind of talked about the things I wanted to talk about with Google CEO

314
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:08,831
Testifying for

315
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:13,183
They talked about algorithmic bias they talked about the data breaches

316
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:16,255
And what I didn't see was this kind of conversation

317
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:20,095
About what we need to do in privacy in till

318
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,119
Constitutional Amendment

319
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,239
Capricious

320
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:28,543
I think the basic tenets would be.

321
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:31,871
Companies like Google and Facebook should not be at the

322
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,919
For the conversation at all

323
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,967
Okay so you lost your seat at the table

324
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:37,759
They have

325
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:39,807
Whether it is

326
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:43,135
I would go as far as

327
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,671
Including Amazon in

328
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:47,743
Companies of flights

329
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,279
I would say that as

330
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,303
Access point

331
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,839
The Trust on these

332
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:52,863
To advance

333
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,143
Mega platform

334
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,703
Alarm concern is you

335
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,007
I assume the worst before

336
00:12:59,263 --> 00:12:59,775
Anyway

337
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:03,359
When it comes to Google

338
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,127
How to say taxi

339
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:06,431
I would throw in

340
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:09,759
I would throw in companies that we don't even think about

341
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:14,623
Actually have a lot of information and I would also think about things like

342
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:18,463
Kirby feels like can I just put my data in an escrow somewhere like a last

343
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,511
And I can use that

344
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,791
Retail stores

345
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,071
Hotels in

346
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:26,399
Things like that but maybe the solution there is really just tired

347
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,191
Those guys to make it

348
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:31,007
Play there's nothing which teaches you a lesson.

349
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:34,079
Five Below

350
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:38,431
A lot of money and security

351
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,455
Ming tombs

352
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:42,271
Everybody spending money on making things

353
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,039
Sakura

354
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:45,599
I think this is all nonsense to say that

355
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:48,415
This cannot be done as most of these people

356
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,439
Don't spend the money

357
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:54,303
Don't know there's an idea that you can't ever be security

358
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,071
Always be

359
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:56,607
You have to upgrade your sister

360
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:00,703
You have to start somewhere actually care about security

361
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,007
And I think that's the key thing is like

362
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:04,799
The idea that you

363
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,103
Xperience Fitness

364
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:12,223
That's all they business is number one thing they need to do is four-pack data

365
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:13,759
Facebook forgot say

366
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,039
They have a deal

367
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,319
The whole business is

368
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:20,927
In English

369
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:22,207
Seriously

370
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,231
How are you

371
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:26,047
Talk about dereliction of Duty

372
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,583
Do you have to be

373
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,119
Okay

374
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:32,703
Sandra said we were going to talk about the app

375
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:35,007
You know what apple and

376
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,311
To make it mandatory

377
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:39,103
Perhaps just explained

378
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:41,919
Policies and data collection in a simple English

379
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:45,759
In plain English that is actually one of the things that we talked about

380
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,575
Digital standard reference

381
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:50,367
Currency around iot devices

382
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,159
Components there is

383
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,975
Aceite in English

384
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:57,279
I think that requires a lot of effort

385
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,047
Shimmer

386
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,351
The media needs to be

387
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,887
We have to get better at explaining

388
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:02,911
Things to people in

389
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:04,959
So

390
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:05,727
So we'll see

391
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,287
Next story I picked this because

392
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:09,567
Don't know

393
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:12,383
It's like the 18th time as somebody's video cameras been

394
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:15,967
This is a story from USA Today and someone

395
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:17,759
The camera had been

396
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:20,063
I went into this

397
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,599
Because it was Ness

398
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:24,671
NASDAQ actually has a really good

399
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:25,695
Google yes

400
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:26,719
Google

401
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,487
Alphabet

402
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,791
They have really good

403
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,119
Devices they do a lot of things

404
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:37,471
You have to change your password

405
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:41,311
Make sure that your device is not behaving weirdly and sending things to China

406
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,335
Is there supposed to

407
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,359
And so

408
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,895
I was surprised to see this

409
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:48,479
And what happened it looks like if somebody was using the same password

410
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:50,015
In multiple places in there

411
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:52,063
So 1

412
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:55,391
Happy stories are like panties so insecure

413
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:57,695
Really this isn't an iot device thing this is Jay

414
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,231
Or password practice

415
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:00,511
But

416
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,559
Nest actually pointed out that

417
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:03,583
Hey this is a

418
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,607
Good reason to

419
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,631
I have to factor out there

420
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:07,935
Haitian on your device is especially

421
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:08,959
Cameras

422
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,775
You iot companies that

423
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,359
So how this person had to factor

424
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,639
The camera wouldn't have been

425
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:20,479
And I would basically say hey device makers

426
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,015
Especially for

427
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:25,599
Matt amazing speakers things that really have a presence in

428
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:26,367
People's homes

429
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,903
Camera audio

430
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:31,743
Lock that down on my echo device

431
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:34,559
Yeah I mean do I disagree with more

432
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:37,375
I think

433
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:40,447
Idea of two-factor Authentication

434
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,215
NIU

435
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:44,799
Usable two-factor authentication in front of a human being

436
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,335
And they have no idea what you're

437
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,895
Play hockey at the show my mom house

438
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:51,711
Once she saw it she knew how it works

439
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:59,647
What time to gation and I think this is the biggest challenge we have is the technology

440
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,695
Has become so complex

441
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:03,231
And so pervasive

442
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:08,863
Ss80 but I mean the company than the brand

443
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,423
Taking the time to explain 2

444
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,983
Xi'an customers like what they can do

445
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,263
They should be doing

446
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,799
And everything is very different

447
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:20,127
Just be nice like by techies for tacky

448
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,759
Even if you explain it

449
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:26,527
It is okay

450
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:30,111
You're like I want to get to this I want to set this up I don't want to mess with it

451
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:32,159
I will say that I've seen some really in

452
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,183
Interesting incentives

453
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,719
Curso MailChimp office

454
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:37,279
Doctor

455
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:39,583
Fortnite did two-factor Authentication

456
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:41,631
Free dance

457
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,399
All right

458
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:44,703
Special dance whatever

459
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:47,263
So you know if Nest said hey

460
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:51,359
Two-factor will give you a month or maybe two months of the subscription

461
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:53,151
I think people would be like

462
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:54,943
I'll do it

463
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:56,479
Maybe

464
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:01,599
Plastic idea

465
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:02,367
I think

466
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:06,463
You know everybody should do it like at the more security we can provide

467
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,231
I like

468
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:11,583
Mostly Apple ecosystems

469
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:13,631
I use face ID

470
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,935
You don't like fingerprints and

471
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:21,567
Still time to get devices I kind of see how they made it all the work release

472
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:25,151
So I appreciate that

473
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,943
Knox

474
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:30,271
That's true and there are ways to say hey

475
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,295
What devices are in

476
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,111
Another op

477
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:35,647
To see that

478
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:41,279
Okay. But I think you should keep writing about it I think that's

479
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:44,351
Give me a writer on iot

480
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:46,143
It's your job to kind of sad

481
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:48,959
A little bit of a standard motor standard form

482
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:54,591
Because media is not doing this then the companies will pay no tax

483
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:57,663
There's no incentive to spend an extra dollar on

484
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:59,967
You see that is Ole Miss still the side of me

485
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:00,735
My story isn't it

486
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:02,015
Spend years I am not

487
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,551
Assign UNF

488
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:06,879
R&B I'm glad to not be signing anyone anything

489
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:08,927
Alright let's take a quick moment

490
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:09,695

494
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:21,471
Tracker standings

495
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,751

Big confession

510
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:57,055
Workouts

511
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:59,359
It's a van while I'm taking a shower

512
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:01,663
Showers are great

513
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,199
By the way

514
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:09,599

Zoo hours today

516
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:14,975
Coffee break

517
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:17,023
Yeah that's how you make

518
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,559
Yes he is

519
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:21,375
It's okay I don't want

520
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,167
All right

521
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:25,471
So here's some basic news happening

522
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:27,007
World of iot

523
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:30,335
Silicon Labs has a new Z-Wave

524
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:34,943
Notable mostly because this is the only place you can get Z-Wave stuff right now

525
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:36,223
Silicon labs

526
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:39,807
Sigma and so basically next iteration better

527
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:41,343
Securities lower power

528
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,111
Pretty standard

529
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,391
Other news sites

530
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:44,159
Exciting

531
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:45,951
Is essential witch

532
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:48,767
I think Kevin was one of the few people who had an essential phone

533
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,047
We were mostly

534
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,071
Caring about it because

535
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:53,887
Plants for the home sounded really intriguing

536
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:54,911
They are

537
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:57,983
Still around

538
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,543
Essential

539
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:02,335
It's an email

540
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:05,151
Because I caught a business Indiana

541
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:06,687
Okay

542
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:08,735
Movie Ride Along

543
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:14,111
I don't know I wanted so badly for Andy Rubin to come in and like change the home environment

544
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,903
He's a smart fellow

545
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:19,488
I don't see it I don't see it happening

546
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:21,280
That is the nicest human being

547
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:26,656
Since I've known you this like that is why

548
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:27,936
She's been very kind right

549
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:33,312
Horrible

550
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,384
Sexual harassment issue

551
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:40,480
You know I talked about that

552
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:42,016
This happens all the time

553
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,808
I don't agree with that ass

554
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:44,576
Aspect

555
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:47,648
I can't divorce the technology from the person but in this case

556
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,952
Smart person

557
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:53,280
Let's talk about backpack

558
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,304
Coyote backpack

559
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,352
Because

560
00:21:56,864 --> 00:22:00,448
I thought this was a great story and misfits and we talked a lot about Smart Home

561
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,216
Surveillance

562
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:06,592
And if we can grab

563
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:08,384
Places we can improve the world

564
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,176
And that's really Pollyanna

565
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,712
I do think

566
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:13,760
Be able to understand what's happening with

567
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,552
Culture

568
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,856
Temperatures around plants

569
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:19,392
Is a really big deal in Amarillo

570
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:22,208
So

571
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,488
Pretty cool

572
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:28,864
Data to educating farm and garden

573
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,704
At some point

574
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:35,520
Utopian do you get to view

575
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:39,360
Okay well we're not going to do ads

576
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:41,152
Is the University of Washington

577
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:42,176
His dying

578
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:44,224
Steve

579
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,040
That is true we have to start separating

580
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:53,696
Chrissy ads on Facebook

581
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:54,720
And Google

582
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:58,304
To be fair the ads on the podcast really transparent hand

583
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,096
I'm not taking any information for me

584
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,936
So this is at the University of

585
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:06,752
You're really adorable they're little

586
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:09,824
Backpacks are iot sensors they put on

587
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:11,360
Actual bees

588
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:12,640
Is that a yes

589
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:17,248
I have to double-check this cuz I'm like peanut robot bees right no there

590
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:18,784
Tiny little sensor

591
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:20,832
For real B

592
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:24,928
So yeah I'm like indecision to research thing

593
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,744
These things weigh a hundred to micrograms

594
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,536
So very very tiny and I guess

595
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:30,816
These are really strong

596
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:32,608
I'm not sure about

597
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:33,888
The radio

598
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:34,912
That was the biggest

599
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:38,752
Unsurprisingly the limit here is

600
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:39,776
Honeycomb

601
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:43,104
Bet that is it is a mess

602
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,456
I don't know what they're going to call it but

603
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,224
It's

604
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:50,528
Somebody I can make that joke might as well

605
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,552
There you go

606
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:55,904
So I thought this was cool in the show notes for anyone who wants to watch the video on it

607
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:57,952
Is adorable and

608
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:02,048
Again better information on the world around us is going to help us live in it better

609
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:06,656
I can just say IBS mean exactly 10 years since I met you

610
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:08,448
And you are

611
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:11,008
Way more Narnia now that you are

612
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,384
JustFab

613
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,664
Story Piccolo

614
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:19,456
Has me inside yeah

615
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:21,504
You still there

616
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:22,784
Nothing is change

617
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,576
Just a little bit more and dance

618
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:28,160
Alright this is also super nerdy but this is nerdy more in a

619
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:29,952
Economics way

620
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:33,280
Which is a company that does Cloud Server

621
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,376
Surprises they finally announced

622
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:38,912
And you guys

623
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:44,032
I'm not going to get into like what the heck serverless is but think about it as if you have a

624
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:44,800
Man that you need

625
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:45,568
2

626
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:50,688
Give like your sensors like I saw something now I'm going to go

627
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,224
Is super common in the

628
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:56,320
Serverless it allows you to spin up a server in the cloud that you

629
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:57,088
You can talk to it

630
00:24:57,344 --> 00:25:00,160
Trigger that command without actually having that running all the

631
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:01,440
Which is

632
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:02,464
Prosthetics

633
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,256
So this is part of any

634
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,024
Expanded

635
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,048
Functional program

636
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:08,352
AWS Hadoop

637
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:09,632
4 years with Lambda

638
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:11,680
Google has it with iot function

639
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:13,216
Microsoft has something called

640
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:13,984
Azure

641
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:16,288
And now pivotal has it

642
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,056
Which is

643
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:20,384
About darn time because this is be platform for

644
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,152
Enterprises

645
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:22,432
Is when they're trying to build this

646
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:27,040
So I have no idea if you want to talk about service soon but if you have something

647
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:30,624
You know

648
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:33,184
Adventure

649
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,464
The whole cloud is like

650
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:37,792
Basically abstracting resources and

651
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:40,608
Making them available when you need them so

652
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,144
10 years

653
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,936
You know 15 years after

654
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:46,752
About 15 about 14 years after Amazon

655
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:49,312
Stocks that evolution

656
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:55,456
AWS cloud

657
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:58,528
Okay

658
00:25:58,784 --> 00:25:59,552
I'll Trust You Man

659
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:02,624
So either way I think this is just the next evolution

660
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,696
You know he had to have made an investment in a company called

661
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:06,464
Solo

662
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,024
Richardson's Ice Computing space vs timeout

663
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:14,656
Maybe I'll profile

664
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:16,448
Talk to the phone.

665
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,472
She's pretty amazing

666
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:20,800
Alright amazing people

667
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:22,592
She's also

668
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:26,944
But I do believe that the edge Computing is

669
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,480
Talk about it

670
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:30,528
What timezone yashow Eureka Nevada

671
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:31,808
I think a lot of people

672
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:34,112
Understanding

673
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:37,696
Take me to be going forward and I think

674
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:42,048
As you see that become more and more prevalent and you'll see more and more

675
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:42,816
Ideas

676
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:44,608
New ideas emoji

677
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:45,632
Cloud 19

678
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:47,936
Sara Lance is going to be right.

679
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:49,216
No pun intended

680
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:51,008
Are you sure cuz you did bring us

681
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:51,776
Bee honeycomb

682
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:54,336
Earlier but this one was like not intended

683
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:59,712
Honeycomb mesh that have funny on come on

684
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:03,296
Okay and yes

685
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:05,600
I was actually this week at an edge Computing thing

686
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:07,904
I'll probably write about in the newsletter I will not

687
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,696
Deal with this now because

688
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:11,744
We have to go to our voicemail

689
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:14,560
Without Kevin here I'm intrigued to see

690
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:16,352
You don't really want to do this

691
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,888
Alright so

692
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,704
We take these questions from our listeners hotline

693
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,032

623-7424

697
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:32,992
And ask

698
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:33,760
Question

699
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:35,040
We take a winner every month

700

Ignored all of our conversations about privacy and

703
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:50,656
You do want Amazon

704
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:55,008
Upgrade your smartphone with the safety simplicity

706
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:59,616
Voicemail is from Scott who is a SmartThings

707
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:00,640
User

708
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,432
Practice car

709
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,504
Stacy and Kevin this is Scott in Houston

710
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,576
I've been using the family cell phones as presence sensor

711
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:09,856
Control automation

712
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,136
Samsung smart

713
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:14,208
I really wanted a way to make my car reliable

714
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:15,744
Presents to buy salsa

715
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,280
It would be nice to be able to

716
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:20,096
Track the location of my car and initiate

717
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:21,376
At home

718
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:23,424
Based on one or more geofence

719
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,192
This location

720
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:25,472
What is your recommendation

721
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:26,752
4 pi to do this

722
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,032
So Scott

723
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:29,056
The answer is

724
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:29,824
Actually really simple

725
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:32,128
And depending on how much money you want to spend

726
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:36,992
So I did this for a long time I put a SmartThings

727
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:38,016
Presence detectors

728
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:42,112
Is it a zigbee or Z-Wave sensor that just basically says

729
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:44,160
The range of the Hub right now

730
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:49,792
I used it actually to tell me when my husband was coming home so I can run downstairs and watch the dishes tonight

731
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,632
So that is about $20

732
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:56,704
Cheap option or you can go with the fancy hundred-dollar Ops

733
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,472
Which is a

734
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:58,496
Acellular

735
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:00,544
Connection to detect your car wherever

736
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,312
It is

737
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:03,360
And this is $99

738
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:05,152
And you will have to pay US Cellular

739
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:06,944
Subscription fees so you're going to

740
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,736
Really really really want to track

741
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:09,760
If you're going to do that

742
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:10,528
And

743
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:13,600
If you happen to have a Subaru or a Tesla

744
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:14,880
There is actually a

745
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:16,416
A program called

746
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:18,208
It does have a monthly fee but it's

747
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:21,024
It's cheaper

748
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,840
And we get into your house you can actually control your

749
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:24,864
SmartThings stuff

750
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,632
From

751
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:27,680
Options for youth

752
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:32,032
I mean you could buy a iPhone for like 50 bucks

753
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:33,824
Find my phone

754
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,616
That doesn't coordinate with SmartThings

755
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:40,480
I'm just saying there are other options

756
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:42,272
Simple life hacks

757
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:47,392
So yes there

758
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:48,416
All right

759
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:52,256
We have reached the end I want to say a big thank you thank you old

760
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:57,120
And stay tuned for Bianca Wylie we're going to be talking about smart cities

761
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:57,888
Including

762
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:59,424
Alphabet sidewalk labs

763
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,704
Stafford in the city of Toronto

764
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,752
So expect more updated privacy

765
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,800
How to be a better Citizen and now

766
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:07,616
What do a word from our sponsor

767
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:11,456
Hey everyone we are taking a break from The Internet of Things podcast for a message

768
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:17,600
From our sponsor digicert and I have Mike Nelson

769
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:19,136
Security here to talk to you

770
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:20,672
Hi Mike how are you

771
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:22,464
Hey Stacy good how are you doing

772
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:24,000
Excellent all right

773
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,536
Let's get this started by

774
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:26,816
It's a little bit about

775
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:30,400
We are the world's leading provider of

776
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:31,424
Scalable pki

777
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:35,776
For identity encryption and we use these Solutions

778
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:37,824
Or web servers for Enterprise

779
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,128
Security as well as iot devices

780
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,152
Last week Utah

781
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:42,688
News about this survey that

782
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:46,272
And how the respondents were divided in the category

783
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:47,808
There's a top-tier

784
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:51,136
With organizations who demonstrated more of a Mastery peyote

785
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:52,672
Security and a bottom tier

786
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:54,464
Which were organizations that were released

787
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,488
Struggling to implement

788
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:58,304
Can you tell me more about the differences

789
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,840
The survey found between these two

790
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:05,472
Yeah we asked the respondent about the iot security incidents that their organization

791
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:07,008
Inside experience from the past

792
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:09,568
After years and the difference between the top and bottom

793
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:10,592
Unmistakable

794
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:14,176
The company struggling most with iot implementation or the bottom

795
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:16,736
We're much more likely to get hit with coyotes

796
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:17,504
Security answer

797
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:19,296
Every one of them

798
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:20,832
The bottom tier responding

799
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:22,880
Experience in iot related

800
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:24,928
Security incident over the past 2 years

801
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:26,976
Compared to just 32%

802
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:27,744
The Top Gear

803
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,536
The bottom tier were also

804
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:30,304
More than

805
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,072
6 *

806
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:31,840
More likely

807
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:34,144
I have experience in OT tonight

808
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,424
Service attack more than

809
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,704
6 times likely to

810
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,984
Experience

811
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:42,592
Access to the device they were also much more likely to experience data breaches

812
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:44,128
And 4 and 1/2

813
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:44,896
X

814
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:45,920
As likely to occur

815
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:47,200
Experience malware

816
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:49,248
Ransomware attacks

817
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:50,784
Comparisons rmb

818
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,552
Steak

819
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:52,320
Shows that

820
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:55,392
Those organizations that are working to master iot

821
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:57,184
Security are much better off

822
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:58,208
Wow that's

823
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:00,768
What were the top tier organizations

824
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:01,792
Doing that letter

825
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:04,096
We are still

826
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,376
Talk to your organization

827
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:07,424
What they were doing that was leaving them

828
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:09,984
Successful and their response is really I don't

829
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:10,752
People shock you

830
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:13,824
Are the basic blocking and tackling security

831
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,104
Practices things like

832
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,384
Encryption of data

833
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,176
Open transit in that rest

834
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:19,712
Authenticating their connect

835
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:23,808
Performing risk assessments on their devices and putting them play Skillet

836
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:25,600
Security Solutions so that there's

837
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:26,368
Security

838
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:29,440
Scale not just for what they have today but for what they'll have in

839
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:30,464
325 years

840
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:33,024
Excellent and where can our listeners go

Who is a fellow

849
00:32:58,112 --> 00:33:02,976
At the center for international governance Innovation and the co-founder of

850
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:04,000
Hack reset

851
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:06,048
Canada she is more importantly

852
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,840
An expert on Smart cities

853
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:10,400
Sol Bianca thanks for coming on the show today

854
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:11,424
Thanks for having me

855
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,448
I am super glad

856
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:15,264
That's so quickly let's tell us what you do in your

857
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:16,544
Day-to-day life

858
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:18,336
What does it mean to be all of those

859
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,664
I need a lotion

860
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:26,784
Friend it's writing and thinking about data technology procurement

861
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:31,392
And how those things work together for government policy and in the tech reset Canada world

862
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:32,672
Advocating

863
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:36,000
For public good in the Innovation economy which means looking at

864
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:38,304
What is happening in technology how its effect

865
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,328
Our lives and

866
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,120
Our economies

867
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:41,888
Insertive

868
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:42,912
Understanding how we can

869
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:43,680
Participate

870
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:45,216
And make sure it is happening

871
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:48,032
With as much public good involved as possible

872
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:49,312
We talked a lot about

873
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:50,336
Smart cities

874
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:53,920
On the show and really any time at the Internet of Things is

875
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,968
And what we don't usually talk

876
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:57,504
Talk about is this idea that

877
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,784
We are bringing

878
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,320
Private companies in

879
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:02,368
To gather data

880
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:04,416
To analyze data for cities

881
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:06,208
And in a lot of cases

882
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,256
There's a big tension between

883
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:09,792
What is civil government

884
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,352
So asking citizens what they want telling them

885
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:14,144
And bringing these private

886
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,680
Companies in to do

887
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:20,288
What hasn't historically been the role of government but is it kind of like an entirely new role

888
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:23,104
And that tension is something that

889
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:23,872
I don't think we have

890
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:26,176
Policies for I don't even think we talked about it

891
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,712
So I'd love to get your

892
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:28,992
Take on

893
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:30,272
What the challenge isn't

894
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:31,808
Tensions are between Smart City

895
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:33,856
Please and governments and citizens

896
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:35,136
Absolutely

897
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:36,160
Yeah and I think

898
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:37,952
What's really surfacing

899
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:41,792
In the Smart City discussions right now is that we don't have

900
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:42,816
Great mechanism

901
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:44,608
Democratically in

902
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:46,400
Formed technology policies

903
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:47,424
We have

904
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,752
Historically methods to engage people in urban

905
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:52,800
Planning and even that isn't great

906
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:54,080
It's not a very inclusive

907
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:55,360
The process is not accept

908
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:56,128
The bullet ends

909
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:58,432
To be at least in Toronto the domain of

910
00:34:58,688 --> 00:34:59,712
White homeowners

911
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:01,760
Urban planning and public counsel

912
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:05,344
Station is already problematic now in terms of how we're going to bring technology

913
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,624
Into that the history of

914
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,952
Procurement of Technology definitely did not involve public

915
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:10,720
Consultation

916
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:12,768
Right like it's operational for a city

917
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:14,304
If he needs to buy.

918
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,072
Technology

919
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:16,608
That's something that's done

920
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:17,888
Tamina weather

921
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:19,680
The CIA

922
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:21,472
Depending on the city but it's

923
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:22,496
Not something that you

924
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:24,800
You go out to the public and say hey were thinking of

925
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,080
Procuring some technology

926
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:28,384
What's happening I think is as these two things

927
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:32,224
Come together as how he use that technology actually impact

928
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,784
How you're using urban planning tools

929
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:36,320
Another

930
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:38,368
We don't have a way to have

931
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:39,904
Discussions about this in this

932
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,208
Standard public consultation method

933
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:42,976
That we had

934
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:49,376
For years and years and years and so this is surfacing this real tension here in that there's an oversized info

935
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:53,216
I'm coming from the technology side right now because it's not just

936
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:54,496
Selling software that

937
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:55,264
Support

938
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,800
A standard City operation

939
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:58,336
Now it's beginning to

940
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:04,736
Potentially influence and drive them and the outputs of some of that maybe data or maybe they don't know

941
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:08,320
And these are things that we really need to understand like

942
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:10,880
Who's receiving those things how are they being used

943
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:11,904
And I think

944
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,952
One thing that is really important

945
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:16,000
Products to think about with vendors and

946
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:19,328
Technology is that I would argue it's being 20 years

947
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,864
Really bad

948
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,912
Technology procurement within government

949
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:27,520
Memphis to sweeping statement but a lot of vendors sell to government and it is

950
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:28,800
Extremely difficult

951
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:29,824
For those vendors

952
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:30,592
To stop selling

953
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:33,664
Anti-government so once you get in with government often

954
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,432
You become

955
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:35,712
Whether or not the solution

956
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:37,504
Good cities and other government

957
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,552
Relinquish a lot of that powering

958
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:40,832
Control

959
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:42,368
So I think you put all of us

960
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:44,416
Think together and you have a recipe here for trouble

961
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:45,696
And where we need to assess

962
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:48,768
How do we return the start of Technology governance piece

963
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:50,560
Do something that's more democratically inform

964
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:53,376
Yes and I became aware of your work on these topics

965
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:54,656
Lakes around the city of

966
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:55,424
Toronto

967
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,984
The Waterfront development with sidewalk labs

968
00:36:59,008 --> 00:36:59,520
Google /

969
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:00,288
Alphabets

970
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:04,384
Siri and that seems kind of like a microcosm for a lot of these issues that

971
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:06,944
Talking about do you want to talk a little bit

972
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:07,968
About that

973
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:09,760
Kind of drive this home for

974
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:11,808
Certainly and I think what

975
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:12,832
Critical condition

976
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:14,112
Stand is that this

977
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:15,648
Project is not happening

978
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:17,440
With the city of Toronto directly

979
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:18,720
It's happening with

980
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:24,608
Public corporation that's in charge of Waterfront revitalization and so while the city of Toronto is an actor

981
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:26,144
This is not something that's happening

982
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,168
Between the residence

983
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:28,192
The city in the vendor

984
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:29,728
Another

985
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:31,264
Waterfront Toronto

986
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,288
Is the partner in his

987
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:34,336
Is the person who put out the proposal

988
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:36,896
It's a nuanced but it's important understand because it's

989
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:38,432
City of Toronto dealing

990
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:44,064
The way that this is really come to a head in Toronto is that from the time they are

991
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,344
P was

992
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,624
Put out and

993
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,904
You know where we are now

994
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,696
Which is more than a year later

995
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:50,720
Is that it

996
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:52,256
Incredibly clear

997
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:55,328
That people generally are unable

998
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:56,864
To weigh in on

999
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:59,680
How technology might be used in a neighborhood

1000
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:01,472
Because we're lacking the public

1001
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:05,056
Education layer that we need and I think this is emblematic of the last

1002
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:05,824
20 years

1003
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:07,872
Technology is that it has not

1004
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:08,640
Attained

1005
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:10,944
Is social license required

1006
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:11,968
To go forward with

1007
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:18,624
And so on the heels of this great enthusiasm for Innovation and economic development we stopped asking what

1008
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,160
The impacts are of the resident

1009
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:21,184
People who live with

1010
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:24,768
Ecology and I argue in some cases and places

1011
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:25,792
We are

1012
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:26,816
Entrenching

1013
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:28,608
Essentially a surveillance

1014
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:29,376
Society

1015
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:30,400
Because

1016
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,168
We're not

1017
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:32,192
Interrogating

1018
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:33,728
Enough why are we putting

1019
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:34,496
Technology

1020
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:36,032
Who is it benefiting and

1021
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:42,432
Do we really need it is this even primarily the core of some of the issues that were experiencing in cities and we know sit

1022
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:45,760
Cities are really facing austerity you know they don't have a lot of money

1023
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:47,552
So I think a lot of the stuff here

1024
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:48,832
Really needs

1025
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:49,600
Apod

1026
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:50,880
Thoughtfulness

1027
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:55,232
And thank you for going to go forward with technology we really need me to make sure

1028
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:57,792
A good number of people understand why we're

1029
00:38:58,048 --> 00:38:59,584
Doing it and really are on board with it

1030
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:01,632
Okay there's a lot to unpack

1031
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:04,448
So let's start with maybe something

1032
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:05,728
A little bit specific

1033
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:07,008
Because I think that'll help

1034
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:11,104
Talk about will talk about your ideal process and we'll do it with something that I think is

1035
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,384
It has a lot of ram if I

1036
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:15,968
Asian so smart lighting is one of the more popular options

1037
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:17,248
Because cities have to replace

1038
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:18,528
Street lights with LED

1039
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:22,112
Clear cost

1040
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:26,720
And they have all these cool projects

1041
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:30,048
But it's also a place where you know you could add Wi-Fi but

1042
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,328
Also add cameras

1043
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:32,864
There's all kinds of

1044
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:36,448
So talk to me about what an ideal process

1045
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,216
Ferb

1046
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:37,984
Adding smart

1047
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,032
Tierpoint

1048
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,080
The reason for the replacement

1049
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:45,152
Is because there's a better technology available

1050
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:47,712
And so that makes a lot of sense to do

1051
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:50,528
Which is something that's understood 3/3

1052
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:54,624
How people can get on board with both cost-savings environmental benefit make sense

1053
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:59,744
Now these other things you get into this world of just because you can doesn't mean you should

1054
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,560
Write like and I think this is this moment where we say

1055
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:04,096
Is putting WiFi

1056
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:05,120
Public space

1057
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:06,144
The

1058
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,936
Pressing urgent

1059
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:09,984
Policy issue in cities

1060
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:11,264
And I would say

1061
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:12,288
No

1062
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:16,128
Just as a starting point in a city in Toronto and now we all need to

1063
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:19,968
I think about City to City what the differences are and you know how you would prioritize

1064
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:26,368
Decision I think you have to look at some of these other bits and pieces and say okay hold on yes we could do all of those things

1065
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,904
But we don't have

1066
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:28,672
Have to do all of those

1067
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,000
But if there's a real reason to do those things of course we should do that

1068
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:34,304
So this is when you can enter into

1069
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,352
Kind of conversations a public at

1070
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:37,376
Education piece

1071
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:39,680
Prior to doing the rest of that Edition

1072
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:45,056
And to talk to people and understand like a is this something you would like to have in here are the benefits.

1073
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:46,336
The potential cost

1074
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:47,360
Is always a trade-off

1075
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:48,640
Discussion and policy

1076
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:49,408
So

1077
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:55,808
How do you go about having those conversations in a broad enough way that's difficult right

1078
00:40:56,832 --> 00:41:02,464
Exactly and that's very difficult to do a consultation about

1079
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,000
Public Wi-Fi seems like

1080
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:05,536
Not the worst idea

1081
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:09,888
But also I think it's also the time right now what I think everybody is scared

1082
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:10,656
To do

1083
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:13,728
For me is that is a responsible move right now

1084
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:16,288
It's just stop putting more stuff

1085
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:19,360
And until we have had a bit of a wholesale discussion

1086
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:21,408
About many of those components

1087
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:25,504
Because you can't go off doing one off one off one off right you can't be doing that

1088
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,296
Street lights

1089
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:32,672
Cameras again

1090
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:35,232
That's why I think it's a really good time for

1091
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:36,768
People that pause and say hey

1092
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:38,048
Weaning calves

1093
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:40,864
A digital and data infrastructure

1094
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,656
Plan for City and.

1095
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:44,448
Something that we can talk about all these

1096
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:45,472
Components together

1097
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:46,752
You know what the public

1098
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:48,800
With stakeholders with industry

1099
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:53,663
Then you take that plan and you use it to inform a whole set of

1100
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:55,967
Procurement if we would have had that done

1101
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:57,503
A lot of the issues

1102
00:41:57,759 --> 00:42:01,087
With the sidewalk Toronto project wouldn't be issues because we would have already

1103
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:02,879
He had set out some policy guide

1104
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:05,439
The problem with this particular project

1105
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:07,999
Bring it back to it is that we don't have that

1106
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:09,535
And so now we're freestyling

1107
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:10,559
With a vendor

1108
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:12,863
Which to me is not how you do good

1109
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:17,215
Policy so I think this is really a point in time where you don't try to do little one off stuff

1110
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:21,055
We need to think about that we have a digital and Aiden fish structure policy

1111
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:22,079
Four cities

1112
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:24,895
And that that is something that's done with good Democratic process

1113
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:27,711
And then you're set up well to go ahead and do lots of

1114
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:28,991
If you

1115
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:35,391
Sedona wholesale policy it enables you to take advantage of those opportunities for you're going in and email adjusting into

1116
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:37,951
The structure but then you make sure it's all aligned with your Paula

1117
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:41,023
What is difficult for everybody to do right now

1118
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:42,559
Is to take the time to

1119
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:43,327
Stop

1120
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:44,351
And do that polish

1121
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,143
So with that in mind

1122
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:47,935
Let's talk about how we create

1123
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:49,471
Digital infrastructure

1124
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:53,311
Because I will tell you I live in Austin and we just did a

1125
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:55,103
Got it was like 5 or 10 years

1126
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:56,127
Code next

1127
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:57,663
We're basically trying to like

1128
00:42:57,919 --> 00:43:00,735
Identify and improve housing in the inner city of

1129
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:02,015
We're having a portability

1130
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:05,599
And holy cow we went through this process for

1131
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:07,135
Many many years

1132
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:09,951
Many people wait in any people had strong feelings

1133
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:11,999
And in this last election they were like

1134
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:12,767
You know what

1135
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:13,791
What do a boat

1136
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:14,559
To see if we should have

1137
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:16,095
Scrap everything we just did with

1138
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:18,143
Devil didn't pass

1139
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:19,423
But

1140
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:20,191
The point is

1141
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:23,519
Doing anything at a policy layer is

1142
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:25,055
Hard and it's

1143
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,079
Uncertain

1144
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:27,871
And it's expensive and

1145
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:28,639
The people who

1146
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:30,431
Complain the loudest are often

1147
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:31,711
People who want things

1148
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:32,735
How to say the same

1149
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:35,807
So very curious like if we stop this

1150
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:36,831
What should that

1151
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:38,111
Digital infrastructure

1152
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:40,671
The process look like and how do we think that's

1153
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:41,695
Going to unfold

1154
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:42,975
Klepto

1155
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:45,535
A couple pints and I think one of them is that

1156
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:47,071
We already have

1157
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:48,351
City policies in

1158
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:50,143
Implants right and so

1159
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:51,935
It's not like those things don't exist

1160
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:55,007
And I find that this is part of where the Smart City narrative is very

1161
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:57,567
Its aggressive and overconfident in that it

1162
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:58,335
Forgetting

1163
00:43:58,591 --> 00:43:59,359
That cities have

1164
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:00,639
Plant City

1165
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:02,175
Plant City top priority

1166
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:03,199
Cities have long term

1167
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:05,759
We're not starting from zero

1168
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:12,159
What we're doing is we're looking at what is already prioritize and what is already the policy for the city

1169
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:13,183
Writ large

1170
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:15,231
And then you look at that and you say

1171
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:16,511
How can technology

1172
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:17,791
Support

1173
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:19,839
Those priorities and those plants

1174
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:22,399
And you're using technology in a small

1175
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:23,423
Tool fence

1176
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:26,495
To say hey these are the things we're trying to achieve

1177
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:28,287
How can technology help get us there

1178
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:30,335
The second thing to me is that

1179
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:32,639
Right now is not the time to

1180
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:35,199
Minimize or pretend as though

1181
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:36,223
The impact

1182
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:38,015
I'm all of this data collection

1183
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:43,135
I kind of act like head in the sand or like well not a big deal we already have a lot of

1184
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:47,487
Attack so just put a bit more and you know like this is the future this is how it goes

1185
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:50,815
This is really a really important time to stop and say

1186
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:52,351
We know we're

1187
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:55,167
Getting to volumes of data collection where

1188
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:57,983
Free diamonds are going to be more at risk

1189
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:00,031
The freedom to participate in

1190
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:04,895
Society with that what you're doing being known to others I think this is also a time of

1191
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:06,175
Great unintended pun

1192
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:09,247
Consequences for what it means for some of the players in technology

1193
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:13,343
Have a lot of data as it is what is it looks to be creating

1194
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:16,415
More power asymmetry between corporate actors and

1195
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:17,951
The state does that little talk

1196
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:21,279
These are fundamental element that have to do with power and

1197
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:22,815
Control and

1198
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:25,631
And these are things where we want to exert

1199
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:26,911
Right around

1200
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:27,935
Our freedom

1201
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:29,983
And taking and maybe walk

1202
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:31,263
Getting back some of the decision

1203
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:32,543
Bands that were made without

1204
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:34,079
Consent abroad

1205
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:34,847
Social life

1206
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:37,919
This is the time to do that but in order to do that

1207
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:40,991
You have to make sure that you got a bigger set of players out

1208
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:43,807
At the table because right now it's all you bring in

1209
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:46,111
It policy people and academics

1210
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:47,135
And vendors

1211
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:48,415
You know you're going to keep having

1212
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:49,439
Missing conversations

1213
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:52,255
This is the point in history to bring in

1214
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:54,815
Everybody like this has to become

1215
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:58,143
Social issue where the public is at the table in large numbers

1216
00:45:58,399 --> 00:46:02,751
We need to make a comfortable space for people who don't have a tech background

1217
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:04,031
Participated

1218
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:07,871
Because things about democracy control Freedom privacy those aren't

1219
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:09,151
Technical issues

1220
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:10,687
Deeply

1221
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:12,223
Social and ethical issues

1222
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:14,271
So we need to figure out a way

1223
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:15,295
To make that space

1224
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:16,319
Comfortable

1225
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:17,855
Way more people than

1226
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:18,623
Currently is

1227
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:19,903
And if we don't do that

1228
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:22,975
We're treading ahead with stuff that does not have consent

1229
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:28,095
And the public and I think what we seen in the last year is it high time to stop doing that

1230
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:29,631
Because of all the unintended

1231
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:31,423
So I think we're falling into this

1232
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:36,031
Surveillance State not just because it's easier in the public may not quite realize it

1233
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:38,079
I think we're also doing this just

1234
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:41,407
In general especially I'm in the US year in Canada

1235
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:42,431
Because of

1236
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:43,455
X

1237
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:44,735
Political leadership

1238
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:45,759
That we currently

1239
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:46,527
We have

1240
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:49,343
So I worry that it's easier as a government

1241
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:50,367
To say

1242
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:51,903
Yes we need this

1243
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:54,207
Stoking that fear and that feels

1244
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:55,487
Not a technology issue

1245
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:57,023
Tissue that feels kind of like a

1246
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:57,791
Overall political

1247
00:46:58,047 --> 00:47:02,399
Climate issue and I'm not sure how we addressed that because right now we're in the state where we

1248
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:03,167
We have all these

1249
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:04,959
Crazy tools available to us

1250
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:06,495
Bixby used for something like what

1251
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:08,031
China's doing with their social

1252
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:08,799
Scores

1253
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:11,615
But I think like two points on. The first one is

1254
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:12,639
People like to point

1255
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:16,479
China there's a lot of stuff going on in North America that is profiling

1256
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:19,551
On people using social media information

1257
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:21,343
Whether it's a bank looking at it

1258
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:22,111
Whether it's

1259
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:23,647
Employer looking at it

1260
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:25,439
We're doing a lot of this same

1261
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:27,231
Stuff but we're not doing it

1262
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:29,023
Necessarily is National policy

1263
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:31,583
I just want to say that because I think a lot of times

1264
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:32,351
People liked

1265
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:34,399
2.2 China and I think that furthers

1266
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:38,495
This misunderstanding that is a lot of bad stuff happening in North America to

1267
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:40,031
In some ways worse because

1268
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:43,359
It's not so highlighted as state policy it's more

1269
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:45,407
Again like various actors

1270
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:46,175
Freestyling

1271
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:52,575
I think the other thing about the political climate we're in is that it's not just that we have the kind of actors who my

1272
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:53,855
Pro surveillance

1273
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:58,463
Because of for me a significant moment in time with post 911

1274
00:47:58,719 --> 00:47:59,487
Winspear

1275
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:00,511
Became

1276
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:01,279
A driver

1277
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:03,071
And a rationale for many

1278
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:06,399
Including technology but the flip of that which is

1279
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:07,935
Older the 9/11

1280
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:10,239
Is efficiency efficiency efficiency

1281
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:13,055
Until when governments are make it you know they're being

1282
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:15,359
Sold that they're going to save a whole bunch of money so

1283
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:17,407
Magical they got some Hobbies

1284
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:18,175
Technologies

1285
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:19,711
Great times of efficiencies

1286
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:20,479
Without

1287
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:21,247
Interrogating

1288
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:22,015
Kudos

1289
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:23,551
Efficiencies impact

1290
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:25,599
Politically is a whole nother round

1291
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:27,647
Trouble because that's happening

1292
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:32,767
To write and I think this is where you look into the work of like a Virginia Eubanks with the automated

1293
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:33,535
Quality

1294
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:37,119
Roblox glitches that you know where you look at using software to create a fish

1295
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:40,703
To be sure but you know who it continually in trenches and accelerate

1296
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:41,983
Discrimination of poor people

1297
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:42,751
And

1298
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:44,287
It's not like it's benign

1299
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:46,079
It's done intentionally but it's

1300
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:50,175
Sounds very defensible to say well we're just using technology for efficient

1301
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:51,967
But we're not

1302
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:56,063
Sing ourselves efficiencies mean when you look at how are those deficiencies applied

1303
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:57,087
And so I think

1304
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:01,695
Completely right about the first Realm of the political thing but I think there's this other longer

1305
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:05,023
Political issue which is who in the government doesn't want to think they can

1306
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:06,559
Can buy their way out of things like

1307
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:10,399
Affordability or sustainability like for me but this is a persistent

1308
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:11,423
Interrogation of

1309
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:12,703
Quite a bit smart cities

1310
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:15,007
Stop the saying it's technology what we need

1311
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:17,055
Or his political leadership what we need

1312
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:23,455
Right so we as people really need to be involved in this stuff because it cannot just be left up at that political level

1313
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:25,247
Because there's way too many disincentives

1314
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:26,015
Actually Act

1315
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:29,599
That's right with this business such a alluring short-term

1316
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:30,367
Jobs

1317
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:33,695
And efficiencies Merida is that what is that look like in 10 years

1318
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:35,231
Which is what we all have to live with

1319
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:37,535
So with that in mind

1320
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:39,327
I'm coming up to the end of the interview

1321
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:45,727
Give me some concrete things I should do one as a citizen what should citizens be pushing for

1322
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,007
Thinking about in Dewey

1323
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:49,311
Start encountering some

1324
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:50,591
And then

1325
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:53,663
I guess as a city manager or a

1326
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:55,711
Politician what are some concrete things

1327
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:56,735
Each participant

1328
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:58,527
Can do to improve this

1329
00:49:59,295 --> 00:49:59,807
To have these

1330
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:06,975
I think I'm the first one in terms of what can a resident do I think we need to be really aware of

1331
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:13,375
The demands on people's time and elitism of Technology like one thing we have to do is we have to realize

1332
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:17,471
Not every residents going to be able to put Smart City policy at the top of what they're worried about

1333
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:20,287
So I think we have to think about if you are engaging with

1334
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:22,591
Politicians get in touch with you

1335
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:24,639
Officials are more friends than just a

1336
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:25,407
Smart City

1337
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:31,807
I think you're a non-resident technologist and residents. Should be just getting in touch with their elected officials and saying hey

1338
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:36,671
I'm getting alot about data and data collection and how my data is being used

1339
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:37,439
You have to start

1340
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:39,231
What concern you can start with like how much

1341
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:41,023
What do we know about what's going on how much

1342
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:46,143
Are we doing this in a way that is aligned with stuff that we've all participated on in Polish

1343
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:49,983
Right now it's just signaling to politicians that people care about

1344
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:51,519
And to my earlier point

1345
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:52,543
A lot of people can't

1346
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:54,847
Care about this because they got real

1347
00:50:55,103 --> 00:51:00,223
Lots of other things about survival to care about so if you are caring about this try to think about it in a way we think

1348
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:06,623
What are the implications of data and Technology on poor people on racialized people on people that are being surveilled

1349
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:07,647
For a long time already

1350
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:08,671
And also

1351
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:10,719
How do you engage with people who aren't showing up

1352
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:12,767
How do you make sure that people in

1353
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:15,839
Community housing aren't the ones you're getting more surveillance

1354
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:17,375
Because they're getting something for free

1355
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:22,495
Like we always have to think about that I think is a really important time to remember what are Civic responsibilities are

1356
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:23,519
In terms of

1357
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:26,079
What a city manager might be doing or an elected

1358
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:29,151
Official I think this gets back to reminding everybody who's in

1359
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:30,687
Charge the government

1360
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:32,479
Charge and what is the government have

1361
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:34,271
They have pre-existing policies

1362
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:37,343
Until I think we have to turn this conversation around

1363
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:40,671
How to say the vendors this is what we're trying to do in the city

1364
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:42,463
How are you helping us do that

1365
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:46,047
Not what is your shiny new thing and how do I find a house for

1366
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:48,095
It's right it's the other way around it

1367
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:51,423
Here's what we're trying to do if you want to be part of our

1368
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:53,983
Procurement these are requirements that we're looking

1369
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:55,519
Free to me and to have

1370
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:56,543
Technology

1371
00:51:56,799 --> 00:52:00,383
Nothing really being formed by pre-existing democratically inform policy

1372
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:02,431
That would be helpful as the next

1373
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:08,575
And I think that's a good interim step before we necessarily have digital's and data infrastructure planning or not

1374
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:09,599
Master planning whatever

1375
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:10,367
Procurement

1376
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:11,903
Is a really really

1377
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:14,463
Garden place for everybody Ted Turner eyes right now

1378
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:15,743
Because we don't have

1379
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:16,511
How to change

1380
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:18,815
That much like you can do a lot with an existing

1381
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:19,583
Procurement

1382
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:20,863
To have it operate

1383
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:22,655
In a better way in Mark's pants

1384
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:29,055
And you know and looking at are we looking at open source stuff rather than just proprietary are we looking at in traffic

1385
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:35,455
Mobility can we share Solutions with other cities like cities need to start working together a bit better on this stuff because even in Canada

1386
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:39,295
We got cities that are doing way better than Toronto and we're not really

1387
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:40,831
Implementing their work

1388
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:44,671
And so we should be thinking about that as well like as elected officials

1389
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:47,743
City managers how do we accelerate the best practice

1390
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:51,583
Implementation there is I think a room to be sharing more into me

1391
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:53,375
Like learn from each other more in a pint

1392
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:56,447
Awesome alright well now I feel like I have to go out in

1393
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:58,239
Possibly a better citizen

1394
00:52:58,495 --> 00:53:00,287
What Bianca thank you so much

1395
