00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,056
Hey everyone welcome to the Internet of Things podcast I am your host Stacey Higginbotham

2
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:14,592
Is your co-host

3
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:15,872
Tired Kevin tofu

4
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:17,408
Tired Kevin

5
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:21,760
Tired tired

6
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:23,040
Oh good

7
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:25,088
That you're happy to be here on Earth

8
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:25,856
Virtual

9
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:27,136
Podcast called

10
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:28,160
So

11
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:30,464
You just got back from Google IO

12
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:32,512
Hence the tired part

13
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,096
Maybe we should remind everybody that Kevin

14
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:36,864
Does work

15
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:40,960
Google I can actually say I work with the Android in the Chrome folks now I can say it

16
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:44,032
Got it just so people know where Kevin is

17
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:45,568
So

18
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,616
First order of business

19
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,152
Google

20
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:50,176
Home

21
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:51,456
Yeah

22
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:59,136
No I've no I want to hear what you have to say cuz I was excited to see it and I know that you were two

23
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,184
Super excited

24
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:03,232
So here's my

25
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:04,000
Quick summary

26
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:05,024
Last week

27
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,816
If you were not paying attention

28
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:09,120
Google announced

29
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:11,424
Competitors Amazon Echo competitor

30
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:13,984
Is it called Google home

31
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,336
It is called Google home and if you go to home. Google.com you can sign up and get

32
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:22,176
No updates on it yes which I'm sure you probably did I pray

33
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:23,968
You make it updates

34
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:26,272
But so

35
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:27,808
What this is is

36
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,856
It is a speaker

37
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:33,440
Link to Google Assistant

38
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:34,720
Which is also new

39
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:36,000
Which is also new

40
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:37,024
And

41
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:37,792
Unlike

42
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:38,816
The echo

43
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:40,608
It doesn't have a name that I

44
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:43,168
I'm aware of yet so there's no lady that you

45
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,704
To call out to and say

46
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:51,104
I think in the demo they said Hey Google but there is a video that they show that we can always go back or linked to in a shirt

47
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,640
People can see because

48
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:55,200
They show a video of a family using this device so

49
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:57,760
How they use it I presume would be how you would use it

50
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,296
Which is so exciting

51
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:01,600
So there are two features that are really

52
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,880
Freaking awesome

53
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:03,904
1

54
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,672
Multicast

55
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:08,768
So if you have a bunch of these you can actually linked to them just like your Sonos

56
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:11,072
Play the same thing in every room

57
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:12,096
Twerk

58
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:12,864
Yes

59
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,168
Yes you can you can tell

60
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:18,496
You can say hey Google and I think they're going to use hey Google I'll tell you why

61
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:20,032
Cuz a lot of phones

62
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,568
Ucok

63
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:23,360
Google and I pause on purpose

64
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:28,480
So I didn't stop everybody's phones some people have it set for always listening so if you were to say that

65
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,272
Which device you're talking to right

66
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,552
Yes

67
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,088
Should I point

68
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:35,904
I wish they went with something a little

69
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:38,208
More human benefits with Google

70
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:41,792
The others

71
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:43,584
Multicast

72
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,656
Well I just want to mention

73
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:52,032
Google home and they said this in the keno is built on the same technology that they that Google uses for

74
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,824
The Chromecast products

75
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:59,968
That is important right so the multicast for example

76
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:01,760
If you had multiple Google homes

77
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,040
You could say

78
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:08,416
Hey Google Play Rihanna in the living room hey Google play in all rooms

79
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,440
Play

80
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:15,328
Sachin Sachin a different room so yes you can multi casting control it by voice per room so it's a saunas like experience

81
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,352
Via voice

82
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,144
But it's also

83
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,168
Again because it's

84
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,472
Tied into the Chromecast Technologies

85
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:22,496
You can

86
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:29,152
Stream things to a connected TV from it via voice which is something I want so badly

87
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:32,480
On my echo and my Amazon Fire TV but I don't have right now

88
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,016
Yes

89
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:34,784
So that is key

90
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:38,112
And this this is actually a

91
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,648
A bigger differentiator in my house

92
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,440
Which is

93
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:42,720
In the video

94
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:45,792
They showed the home device

95
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,328
Beeping at the woman

96
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,144
Wandering around the room

97
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:52,704
Hey Google I'm listening

98
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:56,032
Talk to her it gave her a notification

99
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,592
To me this was like killer

100
00:03:58,848 --> 00:03:59,360
Because

101
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,896
Right now my phone

102
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,688
I run Google Now on my phone

103
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:04,224
It tells me great

104
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,504
Pieces of information like

105
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,296
You should leave in 5 minutes

106
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,832
It's to make this appointment

107
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:11,648
Write contextual information get surface to you

108
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:12,416
Yes

109
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:15,744
That's because I wrote about it in

110
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,791
Before the Android Wear watches came out

111
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:20,607
When I said contacts this King and I want Google Now on my wrist

112
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:23,423
There you go so this could be Google Now

113
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,959
In any room that you have

114
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:25,727
This device

115
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:26,495
Which

116
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:27,519
Awesome sauce

117
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,567
Absolutely

118
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,615
I'm super excited about this now

119
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:33,407
The thing that I

120
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:36,223
I wrote about it actually the newsletter but I'm a surface it here too

121
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:37,247
Is

122
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:39,039
I'm really disappointed

123
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:39,807
In a couple thing

124
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:43,391
I'm disappointed that Sonos every time I

125
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,159
I can't talk to it

126
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,439
I just like what

127
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,463
I stopped using my

128
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,743
Almost completely

129
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,791
Leafar really subpar speakers

130
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:50,559
Because they're easier

131
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,375
Every time one of these comes out

132
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,655
I'm just more irritated

133
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,983
I don't actually

134
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,287
Want to buy a device

135
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,055
To tie into

136
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,383
Because white pictures

137
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,151
Because

138
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:07,455
I really want it to be more of a like

139
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:10,015
And here's where Sonos still has me it's

140
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,831
It's okay will provide a really good speaker

141
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:14,879
You can

142
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:17,183
Put whatever software you want

143
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:21,023
Timmy is where the world

144
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:21,791
Should be going

145
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,327
Because I

146
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,887
May want to Google device in one room

147
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:32,287
I may want an echo and another and I don't really want to replace my speakers again this is an early adopter thing

148
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,311
Right right

149
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,103
But this is actually going to

150
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,127
Cause people

151
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,223
Pain that financial aid will call it that

152
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,319
Income slow adoption because it's a lot harder to say I'm going to commit to this

153
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:48,159
Whole ecosystem then it is to say I am going to buy another

154
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,231
Bluetooth light speaker that has these

155
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:53,023
Escapeability on the back end

156
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,047
And this is abacus

157
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:54,815
Can product

158
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:57,631
Yeah because this is why I mentioned

159
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:01,471
I said Google assistant is also knew because the whole back end

160
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,519
Is this new Google Assistant which

161
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:07,615
Is I guess the next evolution of Google now so to speak

162
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:08,639
It was

163
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:10,943
Touted onstage how

164
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,479
Google can do

165
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:16,575
You know this type of contacts better than anybody because it knows more about

166
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,599
People in

167
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:20,159
You know the algorithms we have any idea aviata

168
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:22,975
And In fairness I I actually do agree with that be

169
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:27,071
Because when I look at the echo what does Amazon really know about me well

170
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,607
It definitely is my purchases

171
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:32,959
It definitely some of my consumption habits based on what music I listen to

172
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:34,751
Emma Cleary's I asked

173
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:35,775
Black

174
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,567
Knows where I live

175
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:38,335
But

176
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:43,967
Amazon itself doesn't have that relational database of all of my contextual information some of it like

177
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,271
It knows my search history but it's not

178
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:49,087
The results are not coming from it and they're coming from

179
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:53,439
Maybe you will from Alfred or you know Wikipedia or being

180
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,487
And whatnot what Google is saying is

181
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:59,839
We provide you all that information yeah we don't just get your search and

182
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:04,447
And your consumption areas we actually have the information we can tie it all together

183
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,983
So you getting

184
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:09,311
You're right Google home is a front-end to the Google Assistant

185
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,079
Back-end

186
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:16,223
Do you want to tie into that ecosystem I mean it's a personal choice and personas users I totally get it

187
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,039
You invested money you want to stick with what you have your happy with it

188
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:22,623
This website is a lot people don't have a Sonos and

189
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:25,695
Chromecast the whole idea was userland on speaker

190
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:29,023
I don't care what speakers you use just plugging this little dongle you know what

191
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:29,791
You can

192
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:32,351
Use that with Google home

193
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:35,167
And use the speakers already have so to speak so

194
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:41,567
I think you're right I think there's going to be a lot of people like no I'm not going into this because I have a Sonos or be there still a big mistrust

195
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:45,151
How Google uses data what it knows how much it knows so

196
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:49,247
There are people who would just say I don't use any Google probably cuz I don't want Google to know everything about me

197
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:52,575
I think that's true and I would also say

198
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,623
When comparing the two ecosystem

199
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,159
Honestly it might be nice to

200
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,183
To do both because

201
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:59,231
Who is banking on

202
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,791
The back end in the knowledge

203
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,327
That it has a

204
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,351
Right

205
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:08,191
What we haven't heard yet

206
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:10,239
The echo

207
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:13,567
An Amazon has built in this very open

208
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:16,127
So what they don't know about you

209
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,199
You can actually pull from just about anywhere

210
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:21,759
And just say hey I want to enable these skills

211
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:22,527
I have all

212
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:23,807
Apus access to things

213
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:25,087
If you combine the two

214
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,391
Man that would be amazing

215
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:35,071
Cuz you brought the skills and I agree with your and I think Amazon is in a great job I mean I have the Echo and a DOT

216
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:38,143
Right now and we talked about a bazillion times in the show and I love them

217
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:40,703
And you're right you can plug in if your

218
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:42,751
I mean you are I could write a skill

219
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,031
Create our own little skill

220
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,567
Or the echo

221
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,615
If there is someone out there that meets our needs

222
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,151
But

223
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,943
I think Google took a different

224
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,223
Approach in that

225
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:55,295
It makes it easy for developers to tap into

226
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:56,575
IT services

227
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:59,647
A little bit easier as opposed to skills on the echo

228
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,183
They seem like a

229
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:03,231
I want to say I hacked because they're not

230
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05,535
It's just it seems more clingy to me

231
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,303
So

232
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:07,839
Yes

233
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:10,399
They also have and I'm sorry everybody

234
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,423
They have

235
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:13,727
Voice services

236
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:16,799
Yes I do yes which means

237
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:23,199
If you don't want something kludgy you can actually again this is a dedicated device but in this case the dedicated device doesn't have to be

238
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:26,015
Speaker it could just have

239
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,063
Access to the bank

240
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,367
And we haven't even

241
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,415
Apple

242
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:40,095
It apparently is working on something similar and it plans to open up the SD

243
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,375
Dk4 Siri

244
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:42,911
Or at least

245
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,959
We're not 100% sure

246
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:45,727
Because at Apple

247
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:49,055
Where it's going with this but it wants to give developer

248
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:50,591
Siri which

249
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,127
Yay

250
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,151
Yay

251
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:59,551
Siri came out I want to say in 2011 and I say came out meaning it came out on the iPhone 4 commercial or

252
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,831
Consumer use

253
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:03,391
Technology in the company actually existed before that

254
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,671
An apple purchased it

255
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:07,487
But the implemented into the into iOS

256
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:08,767
I think 2011

257
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:12,351
I don't really see what they've done too much on that

258
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:16,703
What's inside and I've said this a couple times and post and podcast

259
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:19,007
Kenneth Siri, got stagnant

260
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:22,335
And it's it's almost past time I think for

261
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:24,383
This to happen but it's still very good

262
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,919
It will make a lot of people

263
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:26,943
Happy once

264
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:29,247
Apps are fully integrated into Siri

265
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,783
Our with Siri I should say

266
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:34,111
Yeah no I mean I've I've started using

267
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,647
Anxiety

268
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:36,415
Like I

269
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,951
Say okay

270
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:38,719
And then I say

271
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:42,047
Google and I can do a lot with my phone

272
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,351
Yeah opening up other apps

273
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,399
Everything Zen

274
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:48,447
So it's kind of my husband sometimes

275
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,239
Siri

276
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,287
And you're right it did come out

277
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,055
2011

278
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:55,871
Faurecia

279
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,151
So

280
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,687
That's that

281
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:03,039
Pictures of pulling one last thing I'm

282
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,087
Siri unless you're in a Tyler Moore

283
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:07,903
I'm wondering what they're going to do with that and homekit

284
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,207
Will Siri does control homekit

285
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:13,279
You can do things with it

286
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:16,863
And I forget cuz I am not as good with numbers time is a

287
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:17,631
A fluid thing

288
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:20,703
With the always-on Siri that

289
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,727
What's in the iPhone

290
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,287
5S

291
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:30,431
It came out maybe a year ago for plugs in devices but now the newer devices don't need to be plugged in for it to work

292
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,967
Certain on plugged in

293
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:35,551
Having until they have that it was kind of

294
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,575
I thought silly

295
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:40,927
Of course the fact that home kid is not really fully baked yet

296
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:41,695
Is

297
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,463
You know kind of

298
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,487
Arella hurt

299
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,279
It makes it almost irrelevant

300
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:47,583
You can say

301
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:48,607
Whatever they

302
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:52,447
Wake up word for serious you know turn on the lights in living room

303
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,215
And it should

304
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:53,983
Nice

305
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,823
That's there I haven't played with it

306
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,871
Recently enough that I can tell you what the

307
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,663
Sure

308
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:03,455
Sure

309
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:05,759
All-in-all I mean what I really like is

310
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:06,527
All of these

311
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,831
Are advancing

312
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:12,159
You know that the user interface for your home weather

313
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:16,511
Lights or whether it's energy things or whatever it may be TVs

314
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,815
And that's really the key to me and end

315
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,095
I think you're going to see a lot of

316
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:22,655
I said more competition in the space now

317
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:26,239
It seems like it's gaining traction the market has been proven

318
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,287
Mainly I think by the echo

319
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,055
Which

320
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:32,639
The CEO of Google Sundar pichai actually give a shout out on stage saying

321
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:34,431
No thanks Amazon for

322
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:35,711
You're showing

323
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,735
The world that

324
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:37,759
This can be done

325
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,807
And people are enjoying it

326
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:40,831
So

327
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:43,647
You know it doesn't matter to me which platform you use I think

328
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:46,719
All of them are going to get them immensely better over the next

329
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,767
6 to 18 months as a result of all this

330
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,071
This is why you don't want to hardware

331
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:54,655
Well

332
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:04,127
Yeah you need you need some kind of Hardware you need microphones and need speakers and you need something to capture and

333
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,943
Something to send to the capture text to the

334
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:10,527
Web services that translate the natural language processing and

335
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:13,343
Sorry I hear you but I don't know how else you

336
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,367
Could do it yet

337
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,135
I like

338
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:22,047
You mentioned the web services that Amazon offers notice I didn't mention her name you could build that into a TV

339
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:22,815
For Allah

340
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:23,839
Sprint live chat

341
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:28,959
Speaker a small chip in the end of microphone so I like the way they're going in a sense because it's

342
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:31,519
You can put it into any hardware supposed to

343
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:33,055
Find specific Hardware

344
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,615
Yes but you do have to build the ontology

345
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,663
It is says

346
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:40,479
Vocabulary of words that will turn your you know

347
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,807
Cuz I really want to tell my Roomba to

348
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:44,831
Uflymike

349
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,391
It's very

350
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,719
Actually work

351
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:54,047
The Voice Services her voice service

352
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:58,399
Supports the words fly my pretties and recognizes that that will

353
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,167
Actually

354
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:04,799
Which still though I mean we're making progress here as opposed to

355
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,615
When Siri first came out that was really the first one

356
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:08,639
Lucy and natsu

357
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:11,711
That's true and that's where the openness I think that's where

358
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:15,551
You know the echo building up the developer ecosystem matter I mean

359
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,623
Siri stagnating I think is partly because

360
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:21,439
You just couldn't

361
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,719
Do much with it

362
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:24,255
Beyond like what

363
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,047
Describe Apple

364
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:32,447
Exactly it was a very native bacon solution and it's finally now becoming what we I just hoped it would

365
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,215
Become

366
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:36,543
Openness yay for the win

367
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,079
Speaking of openness one less

368
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:38,847
Quick thought

369
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:44,479
The one thing we did not hear from Google while we've been here a couple things I wouldn't hear price or availability for Google home

370
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:47,295
I think it was later this summer or maybe later this year

371
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:51,135
Better this year okay yeah there's a lot of products announcing their all later

372
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:53,695
You can't get anything that was announced yet

373
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:55,999
Except for something I know we're going to talk about shortly

374
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,023
And

375
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:59,327
The one big missing piece to me

376
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,375
Where was thinking about you and I talked about this

377
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,399
As soon as it was announced

378
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,935
There was no list of

379
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:07,775
Partner products and such that it will work within the home

380
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,311
Other than of course nest

381
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,847
So we don't know

382
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:13,151
You know is it going to work with WeMo is it going to work

383
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:16,223
Wink smart home there's more things in

384
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:17,759
Intel Cannon

385
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:19,039
And then all the others

386
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,319
So there's a lot of

387
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,599
Open questions on

388
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,391
Who is going to be a partner for this

389
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:25,695
All right

390
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:26,719
We're moving on

391
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:28,767
All right

392
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,559
These are could be shorter Converse

393
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,167
Pebble

394
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:38,239
Announced some new products that will launch

395
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,007
Again

396
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:41,823
Actually not even later this year some of them won't come out until

397
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,103
The beginning of next year

398
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,895
The pebble core

399
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:49,503
I was so excited about this you guys if you heard me talk about it was

400
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,575
The device called The Mighty you'll understand why this is a

401
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:57,183
Clip on iPod Nano

402
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:57,951
Has both

403
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:01,535
The possibility of a Cellular Connection you will have to buy your own

404
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:02,815
And

405
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:07,167
4 gigs of memory so it can store your Spotify playlist

406
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,447
You can listen to it with

407
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:11,263
Wired or wireless headphones

408
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,287
And I love it

409
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:15,103
I love you not having to carry

410
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:15,871
Phone

411
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:18,943
On a walker run specially as it gets hotter in

412
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:19,711
My clothes just

413
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:26,111
Super excited early bird specials on Kickstarter

414
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,391
69

415
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:30,207
And it's going to retail for 99

416
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,743
But I won't be out till January

417
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:32,767
2017

418
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:36,095
No I run a lot both with a phone and without a phone

419
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,399
And I like what they've done here

420
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:42,239
But I probably will not get one and the only reason why

421
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,263
Is

422
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:46,335
I can already do all that on my SmartWatch

423
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:49,407
I don't need to carry my phone like it might have GPS in it

424
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,431
I have

425
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:54,015
I'm working for a cat 4 gigs of storage I have Bluetooth

426
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,295
Compatibility for

427
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:56,575
No foreign

428
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:57,599
Listen to music

429
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:58,623
So

430
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,647
I think

431
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:03,231
At this point I think it's great and then and I do think they'll do well with it

432
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:04,255
But

433
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:10,143
I almost feel and you intersect I want to throw this question at you and you can please just agree with me

434
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:12,959
I must feel like this is a little bit of a pivot for them

435
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:14,239
It is

436
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:17,311
So they also announced

437
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:23,455
It is to new watches but they're really the same

438
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,735
Old watches

439
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:27,295
With the addition of a heart rate monitor

440
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:28,831
It is a little bit of a

441
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:29,599
Pivot

442
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,623
It's a reckoning

443
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:32,415
Maybe they plan to do this all the time

444
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,695
Baby the idea was

445
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:36,767
Entrance through wearable Computing and I do think

446
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,815
Wearable Computing is going to have

447
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,607
A billion different form factor

448
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:46,239
So I think it's really interesting for any company that's looking at this because personally

449
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:47,519
I think

450
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:49,311
The technology should be

451
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,079
Freaking interchange

452
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,127
Alright and it's how you execute

453
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:53,407
It's going to be

454
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:58,527
The pebble is really if you think about what they're doing they're really trying to do that

455
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:02,111
It'll be hard for a small company though to build a bunch of school

456
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:04,159
You know a bunch of different products like that

457
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:09,535
Whenever you know I'm glad to see the moving out of just SmartWatches because like

458
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,583
Fruit for your example

459
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:12,351
I don't like

460
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:16,447
You know I get it I get it

461
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:18,239
So I like the fact

462
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,031
Score in

463
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:23,359
I also like the fact that you don't maybe they'll get into like

464
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:29,247
Jewelry or maybe they'll get into something crazy like sticking modules inside athletic

465
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,527
Close

466
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,575
That's kind of where I think this will go

467
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:34,879
Anna I don't disagree. I like

468
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:35,647
That there

469
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:37,439
The recognizing we can just

470
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:40,767
Be a smartwatch company we need to be a smart wearable company

471
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:43,327
So I think you're right I think they're going to

472
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:48,191
Continue innovating new products after doing SmartWatches now for the better part of

473
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:51,007
At least 3 years

474
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:54,847
I remember their initial Kickstarter was the largest Kickstarter ever

475
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:58,687
I do find it interesting that they're using Kickstarter again as the

476
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:01,247
Point of sale for this it's kind of

477
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,039
Super strong release

478
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:04,831
Yeah

479
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:05,855
So that's

480
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:06,623
That's what that is

481
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:09,439
Yeah I totally get it and you can go

482
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:12,767
Bed Retail Partners as well as it's not just the kickstarter think so

483
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:14,815
Probably smart for them to Leverage

484
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:19,679
Leverage the relationship with Kickstarter and I don't want to downplay this by Pebble Court too much

485
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:21,215
I mean everything I won't buy one

486
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:24,287
It can do something that my SmartWatch is my car smogged

487
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,055
Just can't do

488
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,847
Because there's a 3-g connection

489
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:29,919
You know if you want to pop a SIM card in there you can do that and

490
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:32,735
Not just could you stream Spotify instead of

491
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,271
Plain local playlist

492
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:36,319
You could actually

493
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:39,647
Send your location in emergency

494
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:45,023
It has a programmable button so you can you can hack away kind of like the you know the Amazon tile

495
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:47,327
I make it a single-purpose thing and

496
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:52,191
Again my watch when I go out for a run and we just found behind I can do everything but

497
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:55,519
Tell my family hey come pick me up I got a problem or whatever

498
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:57,567
There are certain smart watches and

499
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,103
I think you're going to see this actually

500
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,639
Quite a bit in the future

501
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:03,455
Have integrated 3G or LTE but

502
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:07,295
My watches don't so the Pebble Court definitely has a an advantage over what I have

503
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:08,319
We're still going to need that

504
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:14,719
Yeah I guess either you know 5 or $10 a month to add has a device I presume

505
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:17,023
Characteristics plant

506
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,303
Pricing

507
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:25,727
Yeah that's that's what they've done with smart watches that have LTE just a device like a tablet for 10 bucks it's

508
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:28,799
I suspect maybe it'll be five bucks

509
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:32,383
Highway robbery well yeah because considering how much

510
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:34,431
How little did are you use on a

511
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:38,783
Pebble core vs connect a tablet I agree but if you

512
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:39,807
Portray it as

513
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,343
Emergency contact

514
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,623
I suppose

515
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:45,951
You know you're paying $10 a month for being always able to

516
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:49,279
Connect are you a Spotify user

517
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:50,047
I am

518
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,143
And I am not so when I sit here in and see

519
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:58,751
That you can only stream Spotify without 3g connection to Penelec

520
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,543
Why can't I pick and choose my

521
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,335
They're going to add other

522
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:05,151
Partners in maybe they'll have another reason

523
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:05,919
Set partner

524
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:06,687
I don't know

525
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,479
Yeah so we'll see

526
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:09,503
Okay

527
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:13,343
So this should bring us up to more wearables which is Android Wear in Tyson

528
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,367
Which

529
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,903
The rumor has it

530
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,952
That Samsung is debating

531
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,048
Using tizen on its SmartWatches as opposed to Android Wear

532
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,072
Now

533
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:24,352
The story came out and was like

534
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:27,424
Kind of walk back

535
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:29,728
So write the story was

536
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:35,360
Samsung is abandoning at Android Wear essentially an in Samsung to huge and our partner so

537
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:37,152
Of course everything

538
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:39,200
But then there's been an update which is

539
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:42,272
Not much of an updating anyways Engadget spoke to

540
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:45,344
A Samsung representative and said no no no everybody is missing

541
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,112
Interpretive essay

542
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:49,440
And we didn't say that we're not going to do Android Wear

543
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:53,280
But they're not saying that they're going to either so it's really kind of

544
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:54,560
Fuzzy right now

545
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:56,096
But the reality is

546
00:21:56,608 --> 00:22:00,448
Samsung actually started with Android wear with its first Gear watch

547
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,520
3ish two years ago to si2

548
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:06,080
Cuz I don't want Android Wear hasn't been around that long

549
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:09,408
But they eventually came out with additional models that use their

550
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:11,968
Not there ties in with the open-source ties end

551
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:18,112
And then they switch the Android Wear ones that they have on the field they sent a firmware update and updated them all

552
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:19,392
Tyson so really

553
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:24,000
It's not a huge surprise if they don't make an Android Wear device anymore

554
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:26,048
Because I really not doing it today

555
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:31,168
I think it was more of positioning that the media token like is a big big issue

556
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,704
I don't know that it is or not

557
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:33,984
Okay

558
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:35,520
So there we have it

559
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:36,800
And then

560
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:37,824
Will ended

561
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:41,408
An update for you guys a couple episodes ago we talked about

562
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:45,760
Vampire power consumption and I said I would wander around with my

563
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:49,856
WeMo Insight switch and test power consumption of

564
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:51,648
Wink

565
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:52,416
And

566
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,464
What you find out

567
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:56,256
They don't consume a lot of power

568
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:59,328
Yay

569
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,120
This is good news

570
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:02,656
Zodiac

571
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:04,192
Roughly 3 Watts a day

572
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,728
Wow that's low

573
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,032
Superlo

574
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:09,824
So I take

575
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,896
Really high electricity rates I pay like $0.16

576
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:14,944
Per kilowatt-hour

577
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,552
I I get very confused when I think about this and so it's saying I'm going to use

578
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:20,320
About

579
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:23,648
$0.34 a month paying for my Amazon

580
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:25,184
Sunlake

581
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,208
Totally worth it

582
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:28,256
And then

583
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:29,792
Which is the Hub that

584
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:30,816
Used most often

585
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:33,376
Antennas less than 2 what

586
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:35,936
The cutoff point for the WeMo

587
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:37,728
Inside switch so I I can't

588
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:39,264
Tell you exactly how much

589
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,032
Consumes

590
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:41,568
It could be less

591
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:46,176
Estimate like $0.20 a month to run it over

592
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:51,296
It is okay it's okay it has to be less than

593
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:53,088
The $0.37 from

594
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,112
America

595
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:55,392
It's west of the 34 Cent

596
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,976
Just a quarter just a quarter

597
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:01,024
$0.25 I don't know

598
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:03,328
It's still super loud which is awesome

599
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,376
It is you should be running all kind

600
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:08,192
Because why not

601
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:10,496
It consumes $0.22

602
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:12,032
Sam's close

603
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:15,104
Yeah you were you were very close it's saying today it's

604
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,152
It's so far consumed less than

605
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,176
A tenth of a penny

606
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:21,504
That's pretty awesome

607
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,784
So there you go so

608
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:26,112
Both are always on connected devices that are

609
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:27,648
In my house always on and

610
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:28,672
Neither

611
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:30,208
Is going to break the bank

612
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:30,976
However

613
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:32,256
However

614
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,024
However

615
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:33,792
If you have

616
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:35,584
Doesn't something

617
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:36,864
If like certain

618
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,888
People like me

619
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:40,704
You may find yourself consuming a lot of energy

620
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:44,544
So that is

621
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:45,824
The update there

622
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:47,616
Keep trying if you guys

623
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:49,152
Try anything in

624
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:49,920
Particular icon

625
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:53,760
Play things and I'd be curious to see what a IP video camera

626
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:57,600
You want to plug in a Foscam into your inside

627
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:03,488
That's a good point I do have a Foscam I may be packed already since we're moving but I will I will look for it

628
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:06,304
That's okay

629
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:12,704
At precisely the wrong time.

630
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:13,984
Okay

631
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:14,752
All right

632
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:17,568

Thanks for having me

664
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:50,240
Oh thanks for coming on the show we had a lot of questions about Russia

665
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:56,384
Listeners who don't know what this is can you give them a brief overview of what you are selling

666
00:26:57,408 --> 00:27:01,248
Sure so we make an internet-connected bring the controller for residence

667
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:06,880
Ira places on the existing timer that you would find on your wall in your garage and once it's connected

668
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:07,648
Weehawken

669
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:08,416
Consumers

670
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:15,328
I got its information about their about their Zone in their landscape and then take that information

671
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:18,144
I don't do things like adjust the frequency of watering

672
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,680
Adjust the duration of watering

673
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:22,752
And we can watch for a ringtones and make sure you're not watering in the rain

674
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:23,776
Awesome

675
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:28,896
And I will let you guys know that I actually installed one of these about 2 weeks ago

676
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:31,968
Water

677
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:34,528
We'll talk about that in the future

678
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,088
It was easy to install

679
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:38,624
And so far my father-in-law's house

680
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:40,928
What I was actually kind of

681
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:44,256
Surprised out when I connect to a

682
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:46,816
Weather station that actually is kind of far away from

683
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:55,520
There's no sensors here I kind of always thought for something to be really intelligent

684
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:57,824
I'm very curious like

685
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:00,384
Do you have plans to kind of

686
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,992
Add to the product or do you think maybe you know you'll do that through like an ecosystem play

687
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,344
Yeah that's a great question and I didn't weather specifically is

688
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,672
One that we get a lot about a lot of questions around in

689
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:17,280
Birth certificate the same exact circumstances you ran into where there is a weather station that is

690
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:19,072
If I were 6 miles away

691
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:20,864
The really good news is

692
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,192
Absolutely approach

693
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:25,984
Perspective and create another

694
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,032
Accessory

695
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:32,128
Study we can also leverage other products that are out there like

696
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:33,152
Uid number of

697
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:34,944
Text mother station then

698
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:38,016
Yo where did using one letter seriously

699
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:39,808
Plan do I do that until you can

700
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:41,600
Imagine that there is a number of

701
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:46,720
Personal weather stations in all kinds of weather information that will make

702
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:49,536
It's a digital version of whether I'm better and

703
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:51,584
You better resolution as a user

704
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:54,144
I feel like I don't know if I want to digital version to the

705
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:56,960
I feel like the real-world analog versions of the weather

706
00:28:57,984 --> 00:29:03,616
They're alright you know some services are getting really good at analyzing radar and weather stations and

707
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:10,016
I didn't even using water balloons and the other getting out of basically one square kilometer of high-resolution weather

708
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:10,784
15 minutes

709
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:15,904
Get really cool and you can kind of get that digital version of it and use it in our software

710
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:21,280
Let's think about how all this plays out because

711
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:22,816
A lot of companies

712
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:28,960
I feel miss the Mark is a start up there like

713
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:29,984
Intelligent

714
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:32,800
I think that a lot of them

715
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:33,824
Don't realize it

716
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:39,456
Maybe the in-service that you're delivering here isn't a connected sprinkler that's easier to program

717
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:43,040
But I know that's what my father

718
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:45,856
Curious how you say

719
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:49,184
Kind of rachio when you think about the actual problem you're solving

720
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:53,280
Start a company with with a mission to really

721
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:55,584
Save water in and make it available

722
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:57,888
Sustainable way

723
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:59,424
And your water use

724
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,728
Outdoors is hugin in the US

725
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:04,544
And you know a smart sprinkler controller

726
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,592
Where the input comes from

727
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:07,872
In terms of weather and

728
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:09,152
Soylent

729
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:10,432
Even Flow sensors

730
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:12,480
Yeah you can really start to dial that in

731
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:18,880
Especially with great that's what's great about a product is weekend update the software over the years and make it better and better

732
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:21,440
I'm in and really reduce that that way

733
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:23,488
And that's really interesting for

734
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:25,024
Just holidays to a lot of

735
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:27,840
The Westin house

736
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:29,120
Water reduction

737
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:30,400
Whataburger or

738
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:32,704
Goals are ejected they're trying to meet I think

739
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,008
What was really close when you have Cactus products

740
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:38,592
Analytics bacon look and see if they're beating their targets

741
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:39,872
Or even predictive

742
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:43,968
Alex on when we think we might water may be based on last year or

743
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:46,528
What we're seeing in the upcoming couple weeks or months

744
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:49,344
I was thinking about this because here in Texas we have

745
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:51,392
Edgewater

746
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:52,160
Conservation

747
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:52,928
Program

748
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:57,024
And I was thinking you know if everyone in my neighborhood for example

749
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:00,864
Like the neighbor neighborhood

750
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:06,496
Right now we've got water restrictions so like you can water like maybe one day a week if you're on one side of the street

751
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:07,520
Another day the other

752
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:12,384
You know if you're on the other side with the system like this if everyone has some sort of

753
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:17,248
Intelligent sprinkler system in that data would you could contribute that data to

754
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,784
Neighborhood pool

755
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:20,320
You can actually

756
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:21,856
Maybe do a lot more

757
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:24,928
I guess personalized watering and maybe

758
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:29,536
Baby the city takes over as a service

759
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:32,864
I just think the power there is really interesting but I'm not sure how

760
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:33,888
Never get to something

761
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:38,240
Know yet that's super interesting to us as well as

762
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:41,568
Actually we didn't work in a couple minutes polities. If you have Ark

763
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:45,408
Controller you don't have to follow the restrictions because of some

764
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:49,504
We have some type of schedule that only really Waters when it when it needs to

765
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,528
And you're

766
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,832
Artificial Warriors butt

767
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:53,600
I think

768
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:55,904
Yeah you touched on it that is as a community

769
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,976
Yo almost like a budget and look at the fair budget

770
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:01,792
Hey we only have this much water today at to use Outdoors

771
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:04,352
This is the most often used for it

772
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:06,656
I am your municipality in

773
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:11,264
Customers and Technology can work together to really create a task

774
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,800
It's a sustainable watering

775
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,080
Planters Outdoors

776
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:15,104
To me that's fast

777
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:18,176
Although then you kind of get into issues of Lake

778
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,064
Although it also turns brown

779
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:28,160
Is that something you guys would ever

780
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:30,464
Waiting

781
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,000
Americans love their lawns

782
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:35,840
Is that something you guys are thinking about her

783
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:44,032
Yeah absolutely I mean I think you would even love to be able to make recommendations on

784
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:45,056
Yo people in

785
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:50,432
In your area have benefits many zones are this this much square footage of a lawn

786
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:53,504
Buffalo grass or Kentucky Bluegrass and

787
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,784
Now you may consider

788
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:59,648
Switching some of these islands out to I'm more of a Zero Escape or a drought resistant

789
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:00,416
Pipezone

790
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:01,696
Here's the recommendation

791
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:02,720
How to do that

792
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:09,120
And yeah I think that's definitely part of our plan as well

793
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:10,912
I am

794
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:16,800
Let's get going

795
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:18,336
I do I've given up

796
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:19,616
That's kind of

797
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:20,896
Long-term vision

798
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:23,712
Today you guys are on your second generation product

799
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:29,600
What have you learned because the last time I talked to you I think it was before you launch your first-generation product

800
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:31,392
You are amazing cuz y'all were already in

801
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:33,440
You're going into Home Depot so

802
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:36,000
How's it been what have you learned from now

803
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:37,280
2 Generations

804
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:40,096
Yes oh it's been

805
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:42,912
Experience

806
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:46,240
One of many things we learned in 900 should just be a given but

807
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:48,032
I'm sorry that it seems but

808
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:50,336
Create a really reliable products

809
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:53,408
Hardware to Software

810
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:54,688
Connectivity

811
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:56,992
Customer support

812
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:59,296
Helping a customer sometimes

813
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:01,856
No it's their first connect device or even a second

814
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:05,952
Make that transition into a connected world where they found from

815
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:07,232
Wanting to

816
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:11,328
You're wanting to but that's what they were doing

817
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:12,864
Do controlling it

818
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,424
Falling asleep

819
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:16,960
Hey

820
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:22,592
We're going to watch for water and we're going to adjust your schedule over the month

821
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:26,176
And experiences.

822
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:31,040
Build that trust those those customers out overtime and make sure that information at their fingertips

823
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:32,832
Nothing much at this time of day

824
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:36,672
Other than Running Springs prices like that was kind of first and foremost get all that right

825
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:38,720
And there's ways to have optimized from there

826
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:41,792
In specifically because I know a lot of

827
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:46,144
Companies are trying to get their products in a big box retail

828
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,192
Words of wisdom for those guys

829
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:52,288
I didn't realize we were the lucky situation where we were at the first product of her kind

830
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:56,384
And retailers were really looking to build out this connected home

831
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:58,176
Japanese second home category

832
00:34:58,688 --> 00:34:59,968
So the number of Dimes

833
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:02,784
Got in touch with us they did with other

834
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:04,320
Entering space

835
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:05,088
Same time

836
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:10,720
They dilated products and you know they they brought ours in getting into retail

837
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:13,024
Wasn't necessarily difficult for us

838
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,560
I think that was just a function of

839
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:17,120
Timing in the pot if you're watching

840
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:19,680
And even things like Bike Shop in the last

841
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:20,960
But I actually

842
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:27,360
Going through the channel is where ye'll it starts to get a bit more difficult and I think that's where we're really learning as a

843
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:28,128
As a company now

844
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:30,944
What are some of the things you've

845
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:31,968
Insofar

846
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:34,528
Telling the story of iot at the Shell

847
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:36,320
Is difficult

848
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:40,672
There's a lot of information to kind of pack into that small area that you have on on a Shelf

849
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:44,256
You know one thing that we're finding right now at retail and

850
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:45,792
Witness it first-hand

851
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:47,328
Just last weekend for example

852
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,888
Izod I it's really

853
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:51,936
Appears to be a destination sale

854
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,472
Well you have a lot of

855
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:57,056
Murders that are coming into

856
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:58,080
The Stars themselves

857
00:35:58,336 --> 00:36:00,896
Driving to the store. Just last weekend

858
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:03,456
I'm talking to someone in the irrigation

859
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,296
Daughter unit

860
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:09,600
It's amazing how people come in and ask for it by name

861
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:14,976
I was at the shop and I was standing there another gentleman walked up and

862
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:16,768
I'd like to have the wink on cat

863
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,048
Where is it at

864
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:22,144
I think that's what we're seeing right now at retail is that it's really the onus is on

865
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:28,032
Start up companies like elastic I'll bring those people to the shelves to go by the product but not necessarily

866
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:31,616
We are going to find that magic formulas and I'm than learning at the Shelf quite yet

867
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:33,152
Difficult

868
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:34,944
Know that there's a lot of information

869
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:38,016
And I'm delighted by the idea

870
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:39,040
You're standing out in the

871
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:41,088
Irrigation

872
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:42,368
Local hardware store

873
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:46,976
That's about it

874
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:48,512
Happy lighting aisle or the

875
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:50,304
My my look

876
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:53,888
Accosting random stranger

877
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:54,656
Hi

878
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:58,752
How is it

879
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:00,288
Dealing with your customer

880
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:03,104
Because one of the things that I find from

881
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,128
People who have built

882
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:05,920
You know pretty successful connector

883
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:08,224
They have

884
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,296
And dedicated customer base who is not afraid to tell them

885
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:12,576
When they mess up

886
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:17,696
And I think it's both a blessing and a curse so I'm curious like how you view

887
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:20,256
I don't know the early adopters still that your cuss

888
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:26,144
Yeah it it's funny you should ask that we we were very vocal

889
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:29,984
Customer base and we loaded our community is Super Active online

890
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,800
As we are even near the road right at other channels

891
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:34,336
AR support directly

892
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:40,736
But our community specifically they give us great feedback on all kinds of features things we're planning things that we

893
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:43,808
I give you a great example is

894
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:46,368
Beaver trying to simplify the product a little bit

895
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:50,720
And actually produce a better scheduling system then we move the future

896
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:53,280
I met a girl

897
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:55,840
Call rr Flex scheduling

898
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:57,888
It can be somewhat unpredictable sometimes

899
00:37:58,144 --> 00:38:00,448
It really is the right way to water

900
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:04,288
He was great in helping us understand that we should bring it back

901
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:09,152
Can we listen to all and they brought up some really great point that we hadn't even thought through

902
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:14,528
Because that we're excited to bring it back and she better rate on that product with them

903
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:16,832
Actually really know what the problem is that was all that now

904
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:18,368
That kind of stuff is invaluable

905
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,928
True know how then as you become

906
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:23,232
Hopefully we'll cross our fingers more successful

907
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:24,256
How do you

908
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:30,144
Account for the demands of a vocal few perhaps like you're hardcore users and then

909
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,424
What everybody else me

910
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,216
It's because I think that's going to be

911
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:35,520
A challenge for a lot of these companies

912
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:37,056
As they find success

913
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:41,152
Oh absolutely that's a conversation we have on a daily basis

914
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:42,176
Nothing for us

915
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:43,200
It was

916
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:47,808
We didn't try to make a reaction

917
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:51,648
We want to do is replace one type of schedule with

918
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:52,416
A different time

919
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:54,976
And you know we talked about it as a group and said

920
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:57,024
If we weren't going to

921
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,352
If you're just going to say we went to remove this feature the future that we ended up

922
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:01,376
The scheduling

923
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:03,936
Turning off would we actually do that

924
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:07,008
Or we compromise anything he will replace it with this

925
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:12,384
Yeonwoo scheduled mean on the new schedule really wasn't what they were looking for and what you kind of went through the process of

926
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:16,224
Dining around saying well actually all we've done is taken away future.

927
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,272
Yell at certain percentage of our customers really like

928
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:21,344
We made a decision that we should bring it back until

929
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,624
It can be completely replaced

930
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:27,232
What's something that would make them happy and it is hard to evaluate by The Warriors versus the majority

931
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:30,816
But we do have data only have an idea of you know how many people have those types

932
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:31,840
Schedules and

933
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:34,912
Time you were able to make a decision on that

934
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:36,448
Awesome and

935
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,216
What is next

936
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:37,984
For you guys

937
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:41,312
You've done that the first gen sprinkler

938
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:42,336
Sprinkler controller

939
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:45,920
2nd gen product

940
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:51,296
Enclosure and outdoor enclosure that

941
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:52,064
You sound like

942
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:57,440
There's some logical

943
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:00,256
Yeah

944
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:03,072
You don't have to pass to go down

945
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:06,400
I think one is DP accessories kind of modeling

946
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:08,704
There's a number of pieces of hardware and

947
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,288
Products that are on a road map that we can make good I think compliments

948
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:13,568
Controller nicely

949
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:16,640
Yeah there's I think the software called the company

950
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:18,432
Very excited about

951
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:23,296
Natural extensions that maybe you know Tyson some enterprising and and I

952
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:25,600
Or maybe business and let me buy.

953
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:27,392
Trip to

954
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:29,184
Adjacent markets that are really interesting.

955
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:32,000
What is a professional landscape space

956
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:34,560
70% of these controllers have been solved by

957
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:37,120
Landscapers 4 years

958
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:38,400
I am

959
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:41,984
Yeah we're we're trying to learn from them about what makes our controllers

960
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:45,056
How it can possibly improve their businesses

961
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:49,920
Or make their communication with the customer better or you know Christian relationships and bonds

962
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:54,272
I'm about to produce products to them that they can help him.

963
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:56,576
The other Jason Market is really utilities

964
00:40:58,112 --> 00:41:04,256
It's really interesting to see how they're approaching water conservation problems or even things is simplest keep shaving

965
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:07,328
You know what really starts to happen when you have this

966
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,352
Throat

967
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:11,680
Disconnected nodes out there that can help solve some of these bigger problems

968
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:13,984
Balance of those types of

969
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:17,056
I'm heading frosting

970
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:20,896
You know we're looking forward to continuing to

971
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:24,480
When I open my rachio I noticed that this was

972
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:28,320
Actually the whole things made in America

973
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:30,368
And I did want to ask you about

974
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:31,904
True Manufacturing efforts

975
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:32,928
Because

976
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:33,696
Struck me as

977
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,232
Yeah

978
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:37,536
There's a lot of things that go into that

979
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:38,304
And

980
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,072
1

981
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:41,120
The only was first launched in the product

982
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:42,656
We wanted to

983
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:46,496
Because to a manufacturer we wanted to be able to move with Speed and Agility

984
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:47,264
And

985
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,032
At the same time

986
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:50,592
Blvd Costa design process

987
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:54,687
BO2 45 minutes from RR 290 pictures then

988
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:57,759
I can't tell you how valuable that has been

989
00:41:58,271 --> 00:42:01,343
Show me different circumstances where you get to drive up to the the factory

990
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:03,135
I was all on the side

991
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:05,183
You don't get the process back up and running

992
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:06,975
Driving that was the most important

993
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:08,511
Things for us when we are first starting

994
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:10,047
Apple at the same time

995
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:11,583
I can't tell you like how great it

996
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:14,911
Feels to walk onto the Florida manufacturer

997
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:16,447
I'm a ninja.

998
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:18,751

That's a great experiences while in

1001
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:25,663
So far it's been rewarding enough.

1002
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:28,479
You know we want to continue to manufacture here in the US

1003
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:30,015
All right

1004
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:32,063
How many do you guys produce a day
