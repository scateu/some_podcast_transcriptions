00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:12,288
Hey everyone it's time for The Internet of Things podcast

2
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:15,616
This is your house Stacy

3
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:16,896
Kevin tofel

4
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:19,456
Are you today

5
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:20,224
First off

6
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:21,504
We should say that

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,784
Hey welcome back

8
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:24,064
Good to be back

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,368
Rite Aid

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,904
A run for your money

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,184
I heard that

12
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:29,952
I heard that

13
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:37,120
First off Kevin's back today and we have

14
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:38,144
We can talk about

15
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:39,936
Cool uses for

16
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:40,960
Lighter

17
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:42,240
Rings

18
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:43,520
Security

19
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:45,824
Roomba

20
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:49,664
Iot design Manifesto I learned about at South by Southwest

21
00:00:55,808 --> 00:01:00,416
You're going to enjoy it and I still can't get my SmartThings and Lutron integration to work

22
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:05,536
We'll have a message from our sponsor Samsung

23
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:10,656
And our guest this week is concerned who is with Hogan Lovells

24
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:11,680
Oh Law Firm

25
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:13,472
And she specializes in

26
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:15,776
Class action suit can we talk about

27
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:18,336
What the iot is going to do

28
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:20,896
For class action lawsuits and

29
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:23,456
Product liability and deceptive trade practices

30
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:25,248
She actually taught me a lot

31
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:27,296
Before we get

32
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:31,392
Another one of our sponsors

33
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:33,184
SSO

34
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:40,096
The world's top three automakers use wolf SSL to secure their vehicles and they aren't alone

35
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:46,496
Wolf SSL secure is 2 billion connections across a multitude of iot devices including Automotive

36
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:52,896
Connected home industrial military and medical devices with the Mirai botnet in the girl

37
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:59,296
Rolling threat of ransomware attacks on the Internet of Things companies have to pay attention to security or wrist litigation

38
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:05,696
Bad PR and their brand value securing the iot is hard but wolf SSL has he

39
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:08,256
Sperian specialized expertise to help

40
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:12,096
Shouldn't you be using both SSL to find out more

41
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:18,496
Visit wolf ssl.com and yes you probably

42
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:23,360
You should be using SSL because as we learned later in Today Show security is a big part of

43
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,384
Risk

44
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,152
Management

45
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,224
All right

46
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:29,504
Kevin

47
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:30,784
Stacy

48
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,600
Let's just get started with Intel

49
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:34,624
15

50
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,464
Three billion dollar acquisition of mobileye

51
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,864
That's huge well I mean not as Huges other Acquisitions until has made but I didn't

52
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,680
Not see this one coming and for those who are not familiar

53
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:50,496
Mobileye is in is really based

54
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:54,336
Company that started back in 1999 and

55
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:57,664
Their technology Powers a large percentage of

56
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:01,248
SA

57
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,528
Vehicles

58
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,600
That's what was using them for quite a while if I recall correctly

59
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:07,904
Yeah and then I know other automakers are

60
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,720
Are also using mobileye for their

61
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:16,096
Self-driving efforts but yeah

62
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:16,864
Deal

63
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:21,472
It was $63.54 per share

64
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:26,080
Which was a 33% premium to the prior day closing price for mobileye

65
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:31,200
That is up a chunk of their short-term cash they see you and I were looking at until

66
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,736
Recent balance sheet

67
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:36,832
Just before the show minutes it's almost like all of it

68
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:37,856
I think was 17

69
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:38,624
2.1 billion

70
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,672
Are cash and short term

71
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,976
That's not to say they can't raise me

72
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:43,744
More cash they can

73
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:46,816
We sell a lot

74
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:47,584
Or chips

75
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,608
But it's a big deal

76
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:50,912
Tide like

77
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:54,496
It's actually almost as big as their recent acquisition about Tara

78
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:56,032
Which was about

79
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,568
Two years ago that they announce the

80
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:59,104
Still I think it closed last year

81
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:01,920
And this was Intel spending 16

82
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,712
7 billion dollars

83
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:05,504
Company that makes

84
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:06,528
Programmable

85
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,296
Chips

86
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:09,344
So I'll tear with an F

87
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,672
So you guys might be looking at this

88
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,976
Hey Intel has just bought

89
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,256
Mobil ISO

90
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,303
Computer vision for cars

91
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:21,887
Then they also bought a company called movidius which was computer vision

92
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:22,911
On battery power device

93
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,727
And prior to that

94
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:28,543
Nervana systems which was all about AI

95
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:33,663
And there's a company making an AI chip but also an AI kind of software-as-a-service layer

96
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:38,783
And then I'll Tara so what's happening here is Intel is really try this time around 2

97
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,575
Get ahead of where it thinks

98
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,599
Computing is going

99
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,159
Can I just say

100
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:46,207
Spending a lot to get there but

101
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,767
I want that again I will never bet against it

102
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,351
Cuz they have money and they have

103
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,375
Know-how and

104
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:56,703
Brian krzanich the current CEO is just like

105
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:58,751
For a long time until was hobbled by a

106
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,799
It's dedication to x86

107
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:01,567
Picture witches

108
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,151
And now they're like

109
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:05,919
You know what

110
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,199
It's in the past

111
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:12,063
And when you say Havel they mean

112
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:14,111
It was always up for a large

113
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:16,415
Curative time until was focusing on

114
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:18,719
Processing speed and Power

115
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:21,023
Just at the time when we were looking at

116
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,559
Chip efficiency

117
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,583
Hence the rise of

118
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:26,143
Arm architecture and mobile devices which

119
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:28,703
Sure power is great in your performance

120
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:32,799
Empower a great but you need to be efficient because everything's battery-powered so

121
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,847
We kind of lost out in a large

122
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,383
Way on mobile

123
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,151
So far

124
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,943
What's notable

125
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:42,783
Is wise chips

126
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,575
Their IQ

127
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,111
Their chips are the IQ

128
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,135
They're basically

129
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:50,207
Massive supercomputing type

130
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,487
Power for doing

131
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:52,511
Computer vision

132
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,839
325 Watts

133
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,143
Really

134
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,423
It's not like

135
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,191
Cell phone

136
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:02,495
It's definitely loafers

137
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,055
Power that is

138
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:08,639
Pray I mean I think even Intel's Adams back

139
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:11,455
Time my last used one was probably more like a

140
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,735
5 watt chip

141
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,271
So

142
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,831
I think that

143
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:22,719
Yes Intel is clearly getting into cars in autonomous vehicles which is going to be huge

144
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,743
Ed koehn Ford

145
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:24,767
It's also just

146
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:28,607
Look at it as Intel continuing to invest in lower power

147
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,887
Computer vision

148
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:31,679
Or even lower power arcade

149
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,215
Rail

150
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:35,775
And for scope of the other potential here

151
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:40,639
Goldman Sachs has a projection for Advanced Driver assistance systems and autonomous vehicles

152
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:45,503
They're saying they expect that market to grow from about 3 billion dollars in 2015

153
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:50,111
296 billion in 2025 and 290 billion

154
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,391
20:35

155
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,927
Predator

156
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:55,743
View out and lot of things can change but

157
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,279
You can see why

158
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,071
15 billion dollar investment

159
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,119
Is chump change with a potential error

160
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:02,911
Now the question I have

161
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:06,495
Built its dominance on the fact that

162
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:11,359
The x86 architecture license

163
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,175
Inside out

164
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:20,831
Intel's now moving into markets where it's going to have to be

165
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:23,135
Competitive

166
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,927
This this type of silica

167
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:25,951
So

168
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:28,255
It will be really interesting to see

169
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,023
Howard

170
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,071
Only

171
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:38,495
Agreed and it's funny because it's competing against the same folks that are it's competing Us in the mobile market medicine video call, so

172
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,263
Citrus soap

173
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,799
It's not like it's competing against

174
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:42,591
Players here at the same

175
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:44,895
Players and you're right this is a different

176
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:48,223
Environment for until 2 to try and succeed in

177
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:49,247
So we'll see

178
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,807
In other exciting news

179
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:52,575
About

180
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,623
Kevin actually

181
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,671
Told me something today that had me

182
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,207
Oh my gosh

183
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:00,511
I have Associated a technology called lighter

184
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:01,791
With

185
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:04,607
Drive self-driving cars only self-driving cars

186
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:09,215
Forever Kevin shared with me that when he was gone last week he was doing

187
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:10,495
People with lighter

188
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,799
Before I talk about it I'll just

189
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:17,663
You might standard disclosure that I do work as a consultant for Google and it's actually work

190
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:22,527
I was last week it was working for Google at our Google Cloud next event in San Francisco

191
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,367
And I was Manning the booze for my area which is

192
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:28,415
Cloud devices and Mobility

193
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:33,279
And we had in that Booth I didn't realize it at the time or beforehand

194
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:36,351
We had a $25,000 lidar sensor there

195
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,887
Nami by velodyne

196
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:42,751
Which of the same type of sensor you see on the self-driving cars that unit sits on top and spins around

197
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,031
And so on and so forth

198
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:48,895
And yes you're my most people associate that with self-driving cars for obvious reasons

199
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:52,479
Put together a prototype demo

200
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:56,063
Of using lidar to basically instrument

201
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:58,367
A space that could be any space

202
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:03,231
Some of the ideas that we had we were sharing with customers were hey you could put this in

203
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05,023
A retail store for example

204
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:05,791
And

205
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:10,143
You can then get a physical heat map of your store

206
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:16,031
Showing where people are walking you know it's late to traffic patterns where people are stopping and looking at product etcetera

207
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:19,615
Manufacturing in office environment

208
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:26,015
How many people are standing by the printer right now and why are they standing there is a problem with the printer or you can start gathering this type of

209
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:30,879
Space data and apply in totally different ways from the self-driving vehicle application

210
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:33,695
It's kind of interesting

211
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:43,935
Yeah that's the exact same sensor yeah we just had it mounted up high

212
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:47,007
And you know people are walking by it was tracking

213
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,567
Weatherlock hanging over there standing

214
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:55,967
There's no personally identifiable information which makes it a very interesting application so as opposed to a camera

215
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:57,247
Example in the store

216
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:00,831
You just see these wireframe stick figures essentially people

217
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,439
And whatnot but you can't really see who's who

218
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,463
So I think that's

219
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:08,767
A kind of advantage of a camera and

220
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:11,839
You think about the data that you're capturing a man

221
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:15,935
Tons and tons of data because these things take like seven hundred thousand

222
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,727
Pieces of data per second

223
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:20,543
Because that thing spins around there's multiple lasers in there

224
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:21,823
It's just

225
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,615
Amazing amount of data that actually

226
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:24,639
Generate so

227
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:28,479
I'm just an interesting number of applications that maybe people haven't thought of

228
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:29,503
I like it

229
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:32,575
Anakin versus Cameron

230
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,855
We might be having

231
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:34,879
Until the end

232
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,207
All right

233
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:38,975
So

234
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:41,279
If you have a ring doorbell

235
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,303
Because

236
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:49,727
This is a security challenge for the ring doorbell

237
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:54,847
What happened is somebody noticed that

238
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,895
Was heading to a server in

239
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,175
China

240
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:58,943
And they said

241
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:03,039
Why are some of my package getting diverted to China

242
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,087
And they wouldn't read it

243
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:09,439
They posted it which is exactly where I would go if I notice some highly technical

244
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:13,023
The response actually

245
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,839
To their credit the VP of security at ring answers

246
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,655
He basically said that the

247
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:21,215
End of a live color motion they lose connectivity

248
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:23,519
Occasionally

249
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,823
Rather than abandoning the entire call

250
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:28,383
They said the last few audio packets that are

251
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,151
Corrupted

252
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:29,919
2

253
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:32,735
A non routable address on a protocol that

254
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:33,503
No one uses

255
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:34,783
Okay

256
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:39,903
The plan is that they're going to update the firmware

257
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,671
So this doesn't have

258
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:45,535
And he talks a little bit more about why they're doing that kind of architecture design

259
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:49,631
What I don't think they talk about and what I imagine is also taking place here

260
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,935
Is ring uses a camera from China

261
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,471
Ring does not build its own

262
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,823
I'm wondering if this is something that was

263
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,407
Basically part of the camera architecture and they just for like

264
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,455
Don't mess with that we'll just leave that is it is

265
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,039
I could be I could be

266
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:11,647
It's interesting to me in and I hope we post the link to this conversation in the show notes because

267
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:15,487
Is this actually the whole conversation went on a lot longer than we have time to

268
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,255
Cover

269
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,791
There's a lot of back-and-forth

270
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:21,375
UDP packet

271
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:23,679
So long story short

272
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:26,751
Conversation went back and forth this was a technical user

273
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:33,151
Going back and forth with the VP of security at ring ends explained

274
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:39,039
It's a really good conversation and I'm glad that's person knew what she was talking about

275
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,855
Doubly glad that ring is finally said

276
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:44,415
Yeah we're going to take it from her since no longer happens

277
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,719
Yeah the point here is

278
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:49,791
When you are building connected devices

279
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,327
You are building

280
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,887
On top of infrastructure that is

281
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,167
Already in place

282
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:57,215
And you need to evaluate

283
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:59,775
Every piece of infrastructure

284
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,591
To create your product

285
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,615
Ridiculously hard

286
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,687
Or we need to come up with some sleep

287
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:10,271
Unified certification layers or levels

288
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,807
For each layer of

289
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:12,831
Kind of a product

290
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,903
You don't understand how this happened

291
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:19,487
Happens if your sourcing in a products from someplace and

292
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:22,303
Ear like this is good

293
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:23,583
Put it here

294
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,887
Yeah you don't know what's in the firmware

295
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,983
The point root beer need to see here

296
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,263
Is you need to learn

297
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,823
Exactly

298
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:34,847
Where your

299
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:37,151
Cloud-hosted service provider is

300
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,431
Is putting your data

301
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:43,039
You need to understand what kind of security practices accompanies you contract with

302
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,319
Having place

303
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:46,367
For example the connected

304
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,671
Teddy bear hat from a couple weeks ago

305
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:53,023
Part of the issue there was it the toy company had contracted with

306
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,815
An outside vendor to set up

307
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:55,583
Therap

308
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:56,607
Which

309
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:57,887
Relied on

310
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:02,751
A mongodb database that had it like 14 month old security flaws oh shoot

311
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,031
Right

312
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,359
You can't do

313
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:08,639
Black Sheep tattoo

314
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:13,247
It goes back to what we said many times if you're going to deliver a product or service

315
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,271
You have to

316
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:18,623
Evaluated from a security perspective from beginning to end an everywhere in between

317
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:19,903
That means every

318
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,183
Server touches

319
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:21,951
Every

320
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:22,719
Network

321
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,999
Part uses

322
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:26,047
Cameras any parlor

323
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:28,095
The databases

324
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:30,655
It all has to be secured and evaluated

325
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:33,983
And now we're going to add another layer into that be

326
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,007
Has Kevin found

327
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,311
Some crazy

328
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:41,151
Crazy research that puts the physical in the Cyber visit

329
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:41,919
Call security

330
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:47,295
Yeah I never thought of this but it totally makes sense so

331
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:49,343
University of Michigan

332
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,623
Research esthetician

333
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,415
Different research

334
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,695
Earlier this week

335
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:55,231
That shows that

336
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:56,511
How you can use

337
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:58,303
Sound frequencies

338
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,583
2

339
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,887
Kind of wants a hack but I'll say

340
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:02,655
Yeah

341
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,423
Creek

342
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:07,519
Accelerometers that are in common devices that we use everyday such as

343
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:10,847
Watches Fitness tracker smart phones Etc

344
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:13,151
I didn't make sense when you think about it

345
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:16,479
Because accelerometers I mean they're measuring movement

346
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:19,039
And sound waves do

347
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:21,343
Have movement

348
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:24,159
So what these folks did was they actually just

349
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:27,231
They use a $5 speaker

350
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:31,071
And injected thousands of fictitious steps into a Fitbit

351
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,351
Just by playing

352
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:34,655
Particular sound frequency

353
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:39,519
They also used a music file on a smartphone Zone speaker

354
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:42,847
To Pilot a toy remote control car

355
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:43,871
And he

356
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:47,455
They took a different music file and got the word Walnut spelled

357
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,479
Autograph

358
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:51,551
On a Samsung Galaxy S5 because of its accelerometer

359
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:54,111
I just never thought of it but sound waves are

360
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,391
Vibrating

361
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:58,463
Chinese memes

362
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:01,279
These accelerometers can be affected

363
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:05,375
Basically a meme is a digital component

364
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,423
Physical world

365
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:10,751
So the accelerometer is usually like tiny little Springs

366
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,335
The digital component Translate

367
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:16,127
The movement of Springs into

368
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,919
Footsteps or whatever

369
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,199
Whatever algorithm

370
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,223
The company is putter

371
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,039
Here it's just

372
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,063
Be somebody

373
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,343
Springs

374
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:30,463
What's crazy is if you know the types of algorithms used you could do something like

375
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:34,559
Fake a seizure across a wide number of the population

376
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,327
For example

377
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,375
Aziz accelerometers if they've got

378
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,935
Devices that track Falls right

379
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:44,031
You might be like Wyatt

380
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,055
Would that matter but then

381
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:47,359
Emergency resources someplace

382
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,127
Right

383
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,175
I don't know I don't think like someone

384
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,015
If I could but if I did

385
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:59,391
I guess that's that other layer that

386
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:08,351
And I don't know from a security standpoint how you would protect against that that's that's going to be challenging

387
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:10,655
Okay

388
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:12,191
So that was a little bit of

389
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:14,495
4r

390
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:18,591
Habits of Happiness we have any happy news today

391
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:22,943
I was at South by Southwest and I didn't do a whole lot of stuff there

392
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:23,711
Because

393
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:26,527
It was really raining in cold and terrible

394
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:28,831
I did

395
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:33,183
Design workshop for iot

396
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:37,279
Devices and I discovered the iot design Manifesto

397
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:40,607
Manifesto

398
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,911
And it was basically

399
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:45,471
In this Workshop we actually built

400
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:47,775
We designed it

401
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:53,919
In the one thing I notice there are 10 things to think about with Society design

402
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:54,687
Manifesto

403
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,759
Privacy of data there's a secure

404
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:58,527
Charity

405
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,295
Element

406
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:00,575
There is

407
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:04,415
Parties parties associated with an iot product

408
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,695
Explicit

409
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:06,463
If your

410
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:09,023
Send your data to someplace else that they're using

411
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:13,119
And all these are awesome but what I didn't see

412
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:14,655
Is

413
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,703
Anything about business model

414
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:18,495
And I thought that was really kind of

415
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:19,775
Huge oversight

416
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:20,543
Cuz I think

417
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:23,871
I say this all the time so you guys might be sick of it but

418
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,943
We don't know how without a business model

419
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:27,967
You can't

420
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:34,367
Allocate the resources you need to continuously secure something or you can't tell customers that their device isn't going to die

421
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,391
In

422
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:39,999
Because I think it is

423
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:40,767
A great

424
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:41,535
Start

425
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:46,399
So are you suggesting maybe they need to add something that says you know

426
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:49,215
If you're providing a device or service

427
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:52,799
Promise to go open source if you go under

428
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:55,359
Oh that's a good idea I don't know how to think of

429
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:59,711
If you're designing a business model you probably also want to think about like

430
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:03,295
If your business model is selling data Maybe you

431
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:06,367
Have to add a clause about how you deal with the

432
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,391
When you sell it

433
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:12,255
If you shut up you don't but if you do

434
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,351
Put the source code in escrow

435
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:22,239
I don't know I just thought you know it's worth thinking the nice thing is

436
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:28,127
If you guys think it's worth doing you can actually

437
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:30,943
Submit thoughts and ideas to these people and maybe it will

438
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,223
Captain

439
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:35,295
That was that

440
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:40,159
Which is my favorite store

441
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:42,207
They don't pay me to say that I just like store

442
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:47,839
A San Francisco location and an Austin location

443
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:50,143
They already have a Seattle

444
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:51,167
Palo Alto

445
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:52,703
But

446
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:55,263
They're coming to my state

447
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,311
For my house

448
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,615
Very nice

449
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:03,199
And it turns out they're already in Seattle you said

450
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:10,367
And I am going out to Seattle in June to run the Rock and Roll Marathon with my other podcasting but

451
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:12,159
My mobile tech Roundup show

452
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,695
Just to get in through the hole

453
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:17,279
His first marathon and I think I will have time to go visit

454
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:20,863
Because it is

455
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,655
In each store stocks differ

456
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,679
Devices I should say

457
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:27,775
You could you could go to one in one place and see

458
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:29,055
Certain devices

459
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,591
And then go to another place

460
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:31,615
Play something totally different

461
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:36,223
Cool thing is they don't actually care if you buy it there

462
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:39,807
There gold the companies pay to be in the store

463
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:40,831
And it's basically

464
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:41,599
Additional mark

465
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,719
Go try to be our

466
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:51,327
Let's see we also have everything

467
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:52,351
Which

468
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:53,887
Doesn't have any vowels in it

469
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:55,679
This is

470
00:20:56,959 --> 00:21:00,031
I like you're not going to find this company if you search for it but it's everything

471
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:03,103
With no vowels in it except for that first to eat

472
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,895
Is an iot platform

473
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:06,687
Based out of Europe

474
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:10,527
Gotten 24.8 million in series B funding

475
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,343
This is an Enterprise kind of corporate platform

476
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:17,440
But it's got deals with like Avery Dennison which is bigger

477
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:20,768
Crown holding

478
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:23,072
And westrock

479
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:26,912
So these are all big packaging companies and what they do is make smart Packaging

480
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,704
Dave provide the platform

481
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,984
For these guys

482
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:30,752
2

483
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:31,520
Put

484
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:34,080
No NFC or RFID tags on stuff

485
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:35,616
Shipman

486
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:36,896
Monitor

487
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:37,920
Train Transport

488
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:41,504
It's platform is used to monitor things like

489
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:43,808
Where to buy citizen the shipment

490
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,112
It gives consumers product information if they

491
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:46,880
They want it

492
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:48,672
And it also sends data back to

493
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:56,352
Like when I buy my

494
00:21:56,608 --> 00:22:02,752
Liverpool Football Club Jersey there's an authenticity thing on and I can scan that and register it so it sounds like that's one of the things I can

495
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:03,776
Theoretically do

496
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:09,408
I actually had a conversation with another company

497
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:14,272
There's some really cool stuff Packaging

498
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,344
And I think I'll probably be ready

499
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,880
Stay tuned for that

500
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:20,416
Feels like something we probably shouldn't

501
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,184
Talk about 2

502
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:25,280
It's a little nerdy not everybody

503
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,048
He's excited about the

504
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,328
Packaging

505
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,424
Let me just leave it at

506
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,704
You will be

507
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:45,760
Get air

508
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:47,040
Echo integration

509
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:50,880
This is only the 900 series which has a

510
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:51,904
Wi-Fi connection

511
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,184
App

512
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:56,768
The idea is that soon you'll be able to tell your

513
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:00,096
Or ask the echo to start your Roomba

514
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:00,864
Which is

515
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:02,656
Pretty awesome

516
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:05,216
I have long wanted

517
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:07,776
Fly my pretties

518
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:10,848
And have my Roomba go because I am

519
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:11,872
A strange person who

520
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,200
Deep affection for The Wizard of Oz

521
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:19,296
You don't remember seeing the roomba's flying around in The Wizard of Oz but maybe in the

522
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:22,368
Yeah they're they're like the flying monkeys all day

523
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:23,136
You thinking about

524
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:23,904
Bratz

525
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,184
Or track poop

526
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,464
Whichever

527
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,000
Depending on your situation

528
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:30,048
So

529
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:33,120
Roomba is been really vocal about this in

530
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:34,912
I'm excited

531
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:35,680
I don't know if it's

532
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,264
Reba spent a lot of time talking about how they can be

533
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,288
Rooms

534
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:42,592
But they're not lighter

535
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:43,872
Twitter

536
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:45,152
Sensors

537
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:50,016
But it is an economical

538
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:55,648
And sharing that information back to other products in the home

539
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:59,744
Because of where the Rumba is I'm not 100% sure how

540
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:04,096
Useful that's going to be a me the stuff my Roomba normal encounters isn't stuff

541
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,120
The whole lot

542
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:06,144
Right right

543
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,448
I'm thinking this could be

544
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:11,008
Maybe you want to vacuum is very specific room

545
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,872
Maybe you don't want to pick up the room by bring it in there at the Starbuck whatever

546
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:16,640
You can just

547
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:17,408
Tablet

548
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:19,200
You don't go vacuum the dining room

549
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:21,248
Gas coming over something

550
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:26,112
And it will learn what room is what room and and therefore through voice control you can

551
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:27,392
You can do that

552
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,976
Yeah and they're also saying

553
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:33,024
Since the Roomba knows what room is

554
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:33,792
The kitchen

555
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:35,584
Eventually

556
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:36,864
The kitchen

557
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,144
Yeah

558
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,168
Information to

559
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:42,752
Other devices and then you can just say turn on lights in the kitchen

560
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:48,640
And you wouldn't have to program it in your essay so it so that I get it so today like when I I have

561
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:52,992
Lights in my kitchen I have them specifically labeled as kitchen light so that my

562
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,784
Want to turn them on to have to say that but

563
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:58,112
Element that naming programming Park in the setup

564
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:59,648
Because the information of

565
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:02,208
Kitchen would be found through the room up raps

566
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:08,096
Everything to make life easier it's all good

567
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:10,144
All right

568
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,448
I feel like that's pretty good for this week

569
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,520
It wasn't a whole lot of news

570
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:19,872
The Neo Smart Car debuted at South by Southwest and it's pretty

571
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:21,920
It's far offs

572
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,040
We should mention this because we have a lot of people who like their echoes

573
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:29,088
AWS has

574
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,880
AWS promotional credit

575
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:31,648
It's for

576
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:32,928
She who shall not be named

577
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:38,816
Basically you're saying it's free for Echo and I'm just going to say instead of

578
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,352
How to say Echo

579
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:46,240
So it is now free for Echo Developers

580
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,264
Echo skills

581
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,544
Using AWS

582
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:50,336
And they're going to offer

583
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:51,872
You can apply to get

584
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:52,896
An additional

585
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:55,456
$100 promotional credit each month

586
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,016
That you know you encouraged

587
00:25:58,528 --> 00:25:59,808
Use your scale says you're skilled

588
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:03,392
What happens if it's free to develop usually it's free for life

589
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:06,720
Like a small number of users but if it gets really popular

590
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,512
Which is fine

591
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:09,536
Is prison

592
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:13,376
This way

593
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:15,680
You can apply and get an extra hundred dollars in

594
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:16,960
From

595
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,288
I will put the link to that so you can

596
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,056
Can I apply for that

597
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,176
They're letting you scale

598
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:29,760
On the cheap or for free because what they're saying here is if your skill

599
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:34,368
Surpasses the AWS for usage tier you may be eligible to continue receiving promotional credits in

600
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:35,136
I think

601
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:41,280
To get pass at 4 usage tear it was 1 million AWS Lambda requests in a given month

602
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:47,936
And or up to 750 hours of the Amazon elastic Cloud compute or easy to compute time

603
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,984
So if you're still really takes off

604
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:54,592
Don't panic and think I'm going to have to pay a lot of money to continue scaling

605
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,384
Does not look like you will

606
00:26:57,152 --> 00:27:00,480
Exactly you know this make sense they want to get developers on board

607
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:01,504
There's

608
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:03,552
Increasing competition

609
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:07,392
And if you have all the skills I mean cuz like if I've developed

610
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:15,584
It will work across any hardware that's also using that platform which is actually really cool because a lot of other companies are

611
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,632
Building devices that have

612
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:24,032
If we should make an echo skill that so you can just say

613
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:26,592
Her name and save play the latest iPod

614
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,384
So you can actually do

615
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:30,944
Play that latest I know you could actually

616
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,576
Play The Internet of Things

617
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:38,368
Because we are

618
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:39,648
Yeah

619
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:45,280
But I have been thinking about a recipe of the day skill which I think would be kind of fun

620
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:47,328
Or maybe it's recipe

621
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,888
I like that's a lot of recipes to come up with

622
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:52,960
I just haven't gotten to the point

623
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:55,264
Okay I'm ready to do an echo skill

624
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,032
But

625
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:58,848
I'm talking to the Amazon team tomorrow so

626
00:27:59,104 --> 00:27:59,616
We'll see what happens

627
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,712
I have a complete

628
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:04,736
So

629
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:05,504
Lutron

630
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:11,648
And SmartThings integration between the two platforms where you can control your Lutron lights with

631
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:13,952
The SmartThings the Samsung SmartThings platform

632
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:16,000
Super excited

633
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:16,768
Because

634
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,120
I was like because which one is awesome

635
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:24,448
Samsung actually works with the Google home and

636
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:25,984
Currently the wink doesn't

637
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:28,032
Oh yeah

638
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:30,080
Now I can control more stuff for the Google home

639
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:32,128
Well

640
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,920
I haven't gotten a tour

641
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:36,736
So last week I told you guys that for some reason I was having

642
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:37,760
Itachi issue

643
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:44,160
In touch with me they deleted my account

644
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:45,440
SmartThings

645
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:47,232
So I could restart from scratch

646
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:49,024
That did not solve the issue

647
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,304
What was happening as I could

648
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,072
Connect

649
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:52,608
My Lutron

650
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:53,888
Bridge

651
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,680
To the SmartThings app

652
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:56,960
But when it went to this

653
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:58,496
Discover my devices

654
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:00,288
It didn't work

655
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:01,056
I kept getting an

656
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,384
Send that to them

657
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:05,408
An

658
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,432
They

659
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:08,480
The first was like okay

660
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:09,760
Try again

661
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:11,296
Because

662
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:12,320
Networks

663
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:19,232
It didn't in this case and then they they looked further they said well we don't see your buchon Bridges connecting

664
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,768
To the server

665
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:23,072
It doesn't look like it's actually connecting out to the intern

666
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:25,120
But

667
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:26,144
That's not true

668
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:27,168
I

669
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:28,960
Next ACT test

670
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:31,264
I was like turn off the Wi-Fi on my phone

671
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:35,872
Text my

672
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:39,456
Bridge turn my lights off

673
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:41,760
That sounds like

674
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:42,784
Nope it is connected

675
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:44,320
Soul for some reason

676
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:46,624
SmartThings doesn't see

677
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:47,648
Miley Trump

678
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,232
And I've now reached out to

679
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:52,256
Bouchon

680
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:54,304
Maybe next week

681
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,096
Cuz I really just want to test this integration

682
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:04,032
If anyone is experienced this issue and knows how to solve it

683
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:05,312
Please let me know

684
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:09,408
If you've experienced the integration and you love it

685
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:10,432
That's also a good thing.

686
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:12,736
She said I can tell

687
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:14,272
I can tell all of our listeners

688
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:15,552
Hey guys

689
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:19,136
Maybe

690
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:24,000
I mean I know I have a lot of stuff I always I always test the stuff it doesn't work

691
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:30,144
There there are more variables in your environment than most people's I will I will grant you that

692
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:30,912
But

693
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:34,240
I don't really see why this would be an issue

694
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:36,800
On this case anyone it feels like somewhere

695
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:38,848
Somewhere there's something getting lost

696
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:41,920
We'll see

697
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:43,456
Alright Kevin I feel like

698
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:44,992
Wechat

699
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:47,296
We should probably move on to our guest

700
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:48,320
Phoebe Wilkinson

701
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:50,112
Who is a partner at Hogan Lovells

702
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,416
And we are going to be talking about

703
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,720
Lawsuits and the internet

704
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:56,512
Stay tuned

705
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:57,280
For that

706
00:30:57,536 --> 00:31:01,632
And now a message from our sponsor

707
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:08,032
Hey everyone this is Stacy and we are taking a break in the podcast for a message from this week sponsor this week

708
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:10,080
Sponsor is Samsung artik

709
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:13,152
And today we're going to learn about smart lighting and

710
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:14,688
Building automation

711
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,480
Friend Thomas

712
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:20,832
Let's just get started by telling me what Samsung is doing in smart lighting

713
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:22,368
What we're doing is

714
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:23,136
2

715
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:23,904
Connect

716
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,696
Different lighting devices

717
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:26,720
Aesthetic system

718
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:27,488
Silo's

719
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:28,256
Today

720
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:29,536
In the cloud

721
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:35,936
Imagine a building where your sensors and light switches your flight fixes Luminaires they're from different men

722
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:39,264
The factors to operate on different connectivity protocols

723
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:41,824
And they do not talk to one another

724
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,104
So what you do is

725
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,664
Build a platform that allows two

726
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,944
Connect all this device

727
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:47,712
McLeod

728
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:50,272
And interoperate with one another

729
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,576
And smart lighting is part of

730
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:53,600
A bigger picture

731
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:55,136
Actually building automation

732
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:58,464
Why are people investing in building automation

733
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:00,256
That's right lighting

734
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:04,352
Heart of building Automation in the building you have

735
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,632
Traditionally

736
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:07,168
HVAC systems UFC

737
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:10,752
Security systems of data center North Coast lighting system

738
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:12,288
All operating in

739
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:13,568
Silo's today

740
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:14,848
And by

741
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:17,920
Connecting these different disciplines

742
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:23,040
You can optimize the energy used in buildings you can also

743
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:24,320
Connect the lights

744
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:25,344
This remotely

745
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,624
And operator

746
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,904
Building

747
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,208
Any place in the world hangzhou smart

748
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:32,000
How do you bring this together

749
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:34,560
Using art

750
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:36,864
Brings all these different devices

751
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,680
Together such that third-party devices

752
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:41,216
Interoperate

753
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:42,496
One another

754
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:44,032
In one place

755
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,568
Securely

756
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:47,104
Easy onboarding

757
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:53,504
It's the one place that brings Hardware software third-party devices and services

758
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,528
Together

759
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:58,368
So that they can truly interoperate which is the true meaning

760
00:32:58,624 --> 00:32:59,904
Off the Internet of Things

761
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:02,720
Now that I've taken my building automation

762
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:04,512
Thumbs all through Samsung

763
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,304
What kind of Roi

764
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:13,216
Yeah that's a great question so the ROI can be brought down to half a year

765
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:17,056
Maybe one and a half years which is significantly better than

766
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:19,872
The four years you have to have today

767
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:22,176
Traditional building management system

768
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:23,200
Consider that

769
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:29,600
Traditional building management systems you pay a minimum of $2 50 per square foot sometimes after

770
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:30,624
$7

771
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,160
Square foot

772
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:32,928
Modern

773
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:33,696
Iot

774
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:37,024
Base building management system you can bring this down

775
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,048
2 hours

776
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:39,328
75 cent

777
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:43,936
What's it about five times less than that of the traditional

778
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:44,704
Billy Madison

779
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:47,008
And this week Samsung

780
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:48,544
Has launched a new e-book

781
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,568

7 questions for achieving optimal value

784
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:57,504

Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacy

795
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:28,736
And today I have a wonderful guest for you guys this is Phoebe Wilkinson

796
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:30,784
Who is a partner at Hogan Lovells

797
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:32,576
CD

798
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:33,856
Why don't you tell us

799
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:34,880
What your specialty

800
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,184
Thanks Stacy I'm just

801
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,000
Really pleased to be doing this podcast with you

802
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:45,120
My area of specialty is that I represent manufacturers of products

803
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:48,704
In court litigation or perhaps sometimes in arbitration

804
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:53,312
With a heavy focus on class actions as their litigated here in the US courts

805
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:56,896
Basically she tells people how to make things that won't get them sued

806
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:57,920
Is that a good summation

807
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:04,576
I do I try to make sure they do not get sued working with people you know as they bring products to Market but

808
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:08,928
Also to the degree the inevitable happens and they they do get sued

809
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,000
Routinely in their defending them and

810
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:15,328
Trying to make sure classes never get certified against my client

811
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:21,216
Exactly so I thought it would be really awesome to have you come on the show to talk about the Internet of Things

812
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:24,032
Because it feels like a really ripe area for

813
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:26,080
Gosh class action lawsuits

814
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:31,200
I see a lot of people talking about how the government is not regulating this area so maybe it will be regulated

815
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:31,968
Quartz

816
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:34,528
And I would love to just get your sun sign

817
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:35,552
Big picture

818
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:37,600
What role do you think the Court's going to play

819
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:41,184
Kind of making the internet of things a little bit

820
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,464
Maybe more secure

821
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,488
Baby

822
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:44,256
I don't know

823
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:45,792
More consumer-friendly

824
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:50,144
Given that these devices are so new and

825
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,472
Regulations always sort of lag a little bit behind

826
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:58,336
Technology and advancement that you often find that the courts when they're faced with lawsuit

827
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:03,456
It's often become the first area where where policy or laws or

828
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:07,552
Howa manufacturer needs to operate in terms of thinking about the risk

829
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:11,392
Of operating in the space that courts play a pretty big role

830
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:16,512
And shaping how we all operate before maybe regulators and legislators ketchup

831
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:23,168
Got it so when we talked to earlier you actually gave me this awesome history of class action lawsuits in the first I was like

832
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,704
Why are we doing this

833
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,240
But as you explain to me

834
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:30,336
This actually helps understand what's a class action lawsuit and what isn't

835
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:33,152
So I'd love for you to kind of explain that to her audio

836
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:34,688
Sure

837
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:36,480
So the class action

838
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:41,344
Mechanism in the tool really came about I want to stay in the 70s

839
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:44,672
And it came about for a very logical reason

840
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:48,256
So you had an airplane that unfortunately perhaps

841
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:49,024
Crashed

842
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:49,792
Or maybe a

843
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:51,328
Skywalk fell

844
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:55,168
Before they had the class-action rule in the procedure

845
00:36:55,424 --> 00:37:01,312
Every person who was involved in the crash or the Skywalk that fell

846
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:02,592
They have to sue

847
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:08,992
The manufacturer or any of the defendants one by one and what someone came up with was you know what

848
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:10,272
I shouldn't really have to

849
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:11,040
Prove

850
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:13,344
That the engine was defective

851
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:17,696
But if there was a problem where there was a liability 230 times

852
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:19,744
I should really only have to do it once

853
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,304
Because if we know the person was on the plane

854
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,120
There's really going to be no question as to causation

855
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:26,656
The plane went down

856
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:29,728
Liability was determined to be the fault of

857
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:31,264
XYZ

858
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,800
And then everybody on the plane

859
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:36,384
You should get the benefit of all that work and not have to do it

860
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,944
230 * an individual lawsuit

861
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:40,992
That made a lot of sense

862
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:44,064
What's happened however since that time

863
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:45,600
Is that

864
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:49,440
Lawyers and even technology and products

865
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:50,720
Have started

866
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:56,096
Look to that tool and they said we'll meet him in it maybe I can use that tool for other loss

867
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:57,888
And at one stage

868
00:37:58,144 --> 00:38:01,728
They were used against the tobacco industry against the Pharma industry

869
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:08,128
The world of el diseno that's really too many individual issues there so we can't really use it for those

870
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:09,920
Personal injury type cases

871
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:12,480
But then the next advancement was

872
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:16,064
Famous lawyers or litigants who said well

873
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:19,392
But I have a deceptive trade practice or disc

874
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:21,696
Deceptive thing that a company did

875
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:24,512
In connection with how they advertised

876
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:25,280
The product

877
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:28,608
Or whether they made it safe and reasonable for youth

878
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,424
And the class action tool is actually

879
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:36,288
Really the right tool to use in terms of an action

880
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:39,360
That goes after what those activities were

881
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:41,152
So for example

882
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:43,200
Do you secure your data

883
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:44,736
How do you use your data

884
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:46,528
What have you told people

885
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:50,112
And that is sort of I think the New Frontier 4

886
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:53,184
Manufacturers are people who are in the

887
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:58,048
In the world of Internet of things and just think about that because it does present

888
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:59,072
A challenge

889
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:03,936
Going forward but when I think that they can at least think about how to mitigate some of that risk

890
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:07,008
That was really helpful so that the challenge has become

891
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,288
Inks Lake

892
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:10,592
So deceptive trade practice that's things

893
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:13,152
I'm saying my device does something that

894
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:14,176
May not

895
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:15,712
Or maybe I'm overstating it

896
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:16,736
Abilities

897
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:20,576
Could it also tie into devices that

898
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:23,904
Consumer might have an assumption that they'll be around awhile but then they get

899
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:25,184
Richter

900
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:25,952
Turned off

901
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:27,232
This is actually happen

902
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:29,792
Find a lot in the internet of things with devices

903
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:33,632
That you know maybe the company goes out of business and they're not going to support it

904
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:36,704
Or music company gets acquired in the new company isn't going to support it

905
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:37,984
So

906
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,264
I really trying to figure out

907
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:41,056
What cases

908
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,080
Might come up

909
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:43,616
For class-action status

910
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:48,480
I think there's a variety of them and I think you've identified number

911
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:51,552
But think about a very sort of straightforward one

912
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:58,208
And we've actually seen this play out recently with respect to to a manufacturer of a smart device

913
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:00,512
Smart devices collect a lot of data

914
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:01,792
And

915
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:04,352
It's a manufacturer is going to do anything

916
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:07,168
Set data so for example maybe they'd like to

917
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:08,192
To sell the data

918
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:09,984
To companies that

919
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:13,312
Track advertising or track audience measurement

920
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:16,128
Or track the successive advertise

921
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:18,432
If the manufacturer of noctis

922
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:19,200
Closed

923
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:22,528
To the purchasers of the smart device

924
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:25,344
Hey I'm going to be collecting the data

925
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,112
And

926
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:30,976
You can opt-out if you'd like but also I may use that data that omission

927
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:35,584
Not telling a consumer about what you're doing with respect

928
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,656
To their privacy their viewing history

929
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:40,448
Whatever it is it the smart device

930
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:44,032
Does Tracking not telling them actually is actionable in this

931
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:46,080
Because every state

932
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:47,360
All 50 states

933
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:50,688
Pretty much have what they call a deceptive Trade Practices Act

934
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,272
All of them in essence a manufacturers

935
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:57,344
Or sellers of products cannot engage in

936
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,672
Deceptive trade practices which includes advertising

937
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:06,816
What you say about a product if it turns out not to be true or what you don't say about a product

938
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:09,120
Internet since that's my omission

939
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:12,192
Example and the danger of these

940
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:15,520
These statutes and the way they can be used very

941
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:17,312
Aggressively is that

942
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:21,920
Most states allow you to bring a class-action using that statute there's a few that don't

943
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:24,992
But they carry treble damages often

944
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:26,784
They carry the right

945
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,320
For the manufacturer

946
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:30,368
Have to pay attorneys fees back

947
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,392
To the planets

948
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:33,440
And in some instances provide

949
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:34,464
Punitive damages

950
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:37,024
So the stakes are very very high

951
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:41,120
And the actions you take as a manufacturer

952
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:42,656
Can very much be

953
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:46,240
Implicated because if you say something but you don't say everything

954
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:48,800
Or if you say something but you don't say it

955
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:50,080
Sweetly truthfully

956
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:55,455
There's a lot that can be done with attorneys who say that is a deceptive trade

957
00:41:56,223 --> 00:42:00,063
It also frankly can come up with a to Securities if you don't secure the data

958
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:04,159
And you have a big reach that's not going to be a deceptive Trade Practices Act

959
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:07,231
Per se but they're either can be class actions

960
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:10,047
That are lodged against you for failing to

961
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:12,351
Secure the data that you've collected

962
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,655
In a way that is reasonable

963
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:17,471
In terms of your obligations to secure that data

964
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:20,031
Okay so we've got ate a security

965
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,055
We've got

966
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:22,335
This idea of decep

967
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:23,359
How to trade practices

968
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:25,151
Are there other issues

969
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:26,175
That

970
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:27,199
Might be risky

971
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:28,479
Kefir manufacturers of

972
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:33,343
Those are the primary ones if you're going to collect data you have to

973
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:39,743
Secure it but if you're going to collect data or if you're going to do anything with respect to the information that you obtained from your

974
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:41,791
Are consumers connected to

975
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:44,863
Smart devices you really need to make

976
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:45,631
Disclosures

977
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:48,447
I guess there is one other risk and it's not

978
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:51,007
Pacific to say a cause of action

979
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:52,799
But the reality is

980
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:53,567
That

981
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:58,943
Data izax it's not expensive to hold we know that these days right

982
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:01,247
It's pretty actually cheap to hold data in the cloud

983
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:03,295
But if you're involved in a litigation

984
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:07,135
And then you have to produce the data through the court process

985
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:08,927
That can be an exception

986
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:09,951
Soleus pain

987
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:15,327
Addition and severe say I think companies need to think about if they are going to collect data is

988
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:19,935
Do we really need to hold on to it for any particular period of time

989
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:24,031
In legal parlance we call it a document retention policy

990
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:26,335
Birthday tarp reservation policy

991
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:31,455
Where you sit beside you know what we really don't need to keep anything for longer than x years

992
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:32,991
Let's go a little crazy here

993
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:34,271
Because

994
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:40,159
What you're talking about artificial intelligence

995
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:43,743
And how people are using data collected off to train

996
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:45,535
Models in SoHo

997
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:47,327
That becomes really interesting be

998
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:49,119
Because the data

999
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:50,399
Is used to create

1000
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:52,959
Basically a model that says like this is a dog this is

1001
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:53,983
The cat this is whatever

1002
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:55,007
R4 Leica camera

1003
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:55,775
For example

1004
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:57,567
And then that algorithm

1005
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:59,359
Lives on four

1006
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:00,127
Forever

1007
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:02,687
And then it gets gradually retrained with more data

1008
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:04,479
So if I'm thinking about like

1009
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:05,759
Data retention

1010
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:12,159
Do I need to keep the data that becomes part of an algorithm especially as algorithm start making things happen so a

1011
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:12,927
Actually eating things

1012
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:16,511
I may not get a notification on my security camera

1013
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:17,791
If it thinks it's a dog

1014
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:21,375
I'm in maybe someone breaks into my house because of that and I'm

1015
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:22,399
Timeout money

1016
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:23,935
Maybe there's a fly in there

1017
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:25,471
Product

1018
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:26,751
I don't know I'm kind of

1019
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:29,311
I feel like it's a little far out there but then I'm also like

1020
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:37,759
I don't think there's anything that's far out there and in this evolving world of smart data smart technology

1021
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:40,575
And I think you've identified a lot of things

1022
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:42,111
The people need to think about

1023
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:48,767
In terms of the retention there's no question that if the algorithms that you have or any of the technology

1024
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:49,535
LG

1025
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:51,583
That you have that operate

1026
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:52,351
It's the device

1027
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:59,007
You're going to want to keep that right because you're going to want to make sure that you have the ability to always create the history of how we got there

1028
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:00,031
And keep it updated

1029
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:06,687
But there may be other data that you decide is not necessary to maintain in terms of the Opera

1030
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:07,455
Recent

1031
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:12,831
Of the business or the or the operation of what your business is doing or what you're looking at

1032
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:14,879
And so it's that day that I was

1033
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:19,487
Suggesting that they're up there can be instances where companies will not want to keep that data

1034
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:21,279
Because it's expensive

1035
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:23,839
Down the road if there's ever any sort of it

1036
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:24,607
Disputes have to

1037
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:25,375
Producent

1038
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:27,935
But you're right there are there going to be categories

1039
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:29,983
The data that you're going to want to hold onto

1040
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:33,055
For the viability and for the progression of the business

1041
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:38,431
Okay well that makes it so maybe they don't need to keep that it's my cat but they should probably keep the record that it

1042
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:39,199
It's a cat

1043
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:40,223
That is great

1044
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:41,503
So

1045
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:42,783
Let's think about

1046
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:45,343
Disclosures because you've mentioned this

1047
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:48,159
As a risky area for companies

1048
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:52,767
I'm very curious because I buy a lot of connected devices and I

1049
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:54,303
Click through a lot of terms of

1050
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:56,095
Service agreements

1051
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:59,935
Where a lot of these devices will say hey we're going to sell your data.

1052
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:03,007
Make algorithms

1053
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:04,031
And

1054
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:06,335
Enough

1055
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:12,735
I feel like when I'm clicking through a terms of service on a 4-inch screen on my oven or maybe it's the 2-inch screen on my

1056
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:13,759
My thermostat and like

1057
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:17,343
Is it really reasonable that I read a 40-page ulloa on

1058
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:18,623
That particular time

1059
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:19,391
I don't know

1060
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:20,415
So

1061
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:21,951
Any any thoughts there

1062
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:24,255
I think if you want to be

1063
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:25,279
Really

1064
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:27,071
Prudent and manager risk

1065
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:30,399
You consider identifying at the top

1066
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:31,679
Of those

1067
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:32,959
Documents

1068
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:37,311
Or somewhere prominent right where and then user starting to use it

1069
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:38,591
That the

1070
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:40,895
30 page or the 40 pages

1071
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:42,175
Contains

1072
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:44,991
The following types of disclosures

1073
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:47,807
And identify them by category and say

1074
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:50,367
You have the opportunity if you'd like to opt out

1075
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:52,159
And if you do want it

1076
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:53,695
See more about this right away

1077
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:57,023
To create that link that maybe they can go there right away

1078
00:46:57,279 --> 00:47:01,375
I'm a defense lawyer and I tell my clients all the time it is always safer

1079
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:03,935
When you start out to anticipate the worst

1080
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:05,215
And work backwards

1081
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:08,287
And so if you think about ways and terms of the

1082
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:09,055
Disclosures

1083
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:10,591
That you make

1084
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:13,919
The especially if you are going to

1085
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:15,199
Use the data

1086
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:19,295
Sell the data or you want to do something with the data that you capture

1087
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:21,855
From a person smart

1088
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:22,623
Device

1089
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:24,415
I think it is prudent

1090
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:29,535
To be pretty clear about that up front and if you give them the opt-out right and they don't

1091
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:32,607
At least if there's ever a problem down the road

1092
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:37,727
You can say if your face was some sort of a regulatory inquiry or a lawsuit

1093
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:39,775
Hey I was very upfront

1094
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:43,359
Early on as to what this document contains

1095
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:47,711
I just closed it and I gave them an easy way to opt out

1096
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:48,735
And they chose not

1097
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:51,039
It does depend on the type

1098
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:54,111
Of disclosure and probably the type of device

1099
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:56,415
So your thermostat

1100
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:58,975
It's probably not collecting

1101
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:02,303
What people would consider what should be a

1102
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:05,119
Private data essay

1103
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:06,655
Your television viewing

1104
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:12,287
Or either we have seen even recently there was some case involving

1105
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:14,335
Data involving sex toys

1106
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:16,127
So there are there's a

1107
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:18,687
Whole spectrum of privacy

1108
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:20,223
In terms of water

1109
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:21,503
Particular device

1110
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:22,783
My capture

1111
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:26,367
The probably will also dictate the degree to which

1112
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:28,415
You should make your disclosures

1113
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:29,439
Very prominent

1114
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:30,719
Does that make sense

1115
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:33,535
It does so my sex toys they should probably be saying

1116
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:36,095
We are collecting this information and we will share it

1117
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:39,423
Also with probably my television or my Broadband viewing history

1118
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:41,471
Maybe my thermostat

1119
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:46,335
On the idea of opt out

1120
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:50,687
This is always kind of irked me because I usually read these things and then I'm like

1121
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:52,223
And to opt-out

1122
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:54,271
You can not use our software or device

1123
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:55,551
And

1124
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:56,575
In many ways

1125
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:59,647
That feels eminently reasonable especially when I'm

1126
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:01,951
What is essentially a luxury

1127
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:02,719
Thermostat

1128
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:04,255
But

1129
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:05,791
As we kind of put

1130
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:09,119
Technology in four places it feels very strange like

1131
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:11,167
If I buy a car for exam

1132
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:15,775
When I sign into the app for the first time after I've taken possession of

1133
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:16,543
The car

1134
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:18,847
Probably not the best time to tell me I can opt out

1135
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:19,615
Play not using

1136
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:21,919
So I am very curious like

1137
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:23,455
Do you think we'll see a shift in

1138
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:27,039
Maybe when were offered an opt-out or how those might work

1139
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:32,927
You raise a good point and I think we probably will and I say that because

1140
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:34,719
In other areas

1141
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:38,815
Where we have faced opt-out questions we have seen

1142
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:44,959
The law of evolved to a place where you have to make it pretty easy for the consumer top doubts

1143
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:47,775
The specifically I'm referring to

1144
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:49,311
Mandatory arbitration

1145
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:50,335
For example

1146
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:57,247
The law has developed over the years where a mandatory arbitration Clause may have been buried somewhere

1147
00:49:57,503 --> 00:50:00,063
Are in a warranty document or in a manual

1148
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:03,903
And then you know Court said no you got to be prominent about it and

1149
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:06,719
What we saw was that manufacturers

1150
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:10,559
Said okay will make the disclosure of the arbitration

1151
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:12,863
Claws more prominent but we're going

1152
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:15,167
To put conditions on it and say

1153
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:17,215
If you return it to us

1154
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:19,519
Then you can opt out and by the way there's a Reece

1155
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:20,287
Restocking fee

1156
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:23,359
And Court said no you really can't

1157
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:24,639
Put a burden on the

1158
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:26,431
Consumer if they want to opt out

1159
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:28,735
Answer the manufacturers have been the most

1160
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:29,759
Successful

1161
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:32,319
Getting arbitration clauses

1162
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:36,415
To be deemed valid or the ones who have said very prominently

1163
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:39,487
There is an arbitration clause in this document

1164
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:44,863
And if you would like to opt out please call the following number within 30 days of purchase

1165
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:46,911
And so they've made it easy

1166
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:48,191
For the consumer

1167
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:54,847
They've made a reasonable amount of time 30 days and courts have said you know what that is appropriate

1168
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:59,711
And if someone does not opt out by making a phone call in 30 days then yes

1169
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:00,991
We are going

1170
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:02,783
To enforce arbitration

1171
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:06,367
So I can see something like that happening

1172
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:08,415
With smart devices wear

1173
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:09,951
If it's litigated

1174
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:13,535
I suspected the manufacturers who make it easy

1175
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:15,839
For someone to opt out

1176
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:17,887
Are the ones who will see

1177
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:19,423
The greatest success

1178
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:20,959
And having

1179
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:23,263
Chorus or Regulators say

1180
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:25,055
That was a reasonable step

1181
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:29,407
They didn't do so and so you were free to use the data

1182
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:31,711
Thank you I'm glad that that might have

1183
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:34,015
Because I I've been thinking a lot about that

1184
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:35,551
I almost never give something up

1185
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:38,623
Let's tackle one more issue that I think is really

1186
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:39,391
I think

1187
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:40,927
But we'll see what you say

1188
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:47,327
A lot of these devices we're getting to a point where they're not just tracking data and notifying us there actually taking action

1189
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:48,095
Action on our behalf

1190
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:49,887
Something at things like

1191
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:52,447
When I leave I program my door locks

1192
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:53,471
Tlaloc behind

1193
00:51:53,983 --> 00:52:00,127
And this gets really interesting because like insurance companies are paying for people to put you know connected smoke alarms and things in their house

1194
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:00,895
So

1195
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:02,687
When you have a connected device

1196
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:03,455
Styx

1197
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:05,247
Controlling the real world

1198
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:07,807
Does that introduce new levels of

1199
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:09,855
Caution

1200
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:10,623
Baby

1201
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:16,511
Can you share a duties that I don't know the legal terms for these things but as a manufacturer what should you be thinking about

1202
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:17,279
When your

1203
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:18,047
Actually

1204
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:19,583
It's a great Quest

1205
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:22,911
And it's one that is undeveloped yet

1206
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:25,471
In our legal system but I do think that

1207
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:27,519
To the degree that say it doesn't work

1208
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:28,799
Write your

1209
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:35,455
House doesn't lock for whatever reason or becomes unlocked for some reason after it was locked for a few hours in

1210
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:36,223
When you are away

1211
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:37,759
And something happens

1212
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:39,807
Or for some reason

1213
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:46,207
The device doesn't give the warnings it's supposed to say it's a thermostat that actually operates also

1214
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:47,231
So it's some sort of us

1215
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:49,023
Security or fire hazard

1216
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:51,583
I think there certainly is risk

1217
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:54,143
That a manufacturer will face

1218
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:56,959
A lawsuit in that regard for

1219
00:52:57,215 --> 00:53:03,359
Basically the product didn't work right or there was a malfunction and it'll go then to was it designed appropriately

1220
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:05,151
Or if something happened

1221
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:06,943
Remotely that

1222
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:11,551
The company somehow there's something happened at the company that caused the device to

1223
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:13,087
Turn off or to unlock

1224
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:14,623
What were the safeguards

1225
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:16,159
That were

1226
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:21,791
Use of the company to make sure that that didn't happen did they have warnings had it happened before

1227
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:25,631
And there you get into very straightforward product liability law

1228
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:28,447
I think you're unlikely in that instance

1229
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:30,751
Sia real class-action risk

1230
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:33,567
Because those are one-off event

1231
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:37,151
Is it a risk of liability for manufacturer sure

1232
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:39,711
Because either now they're not just

1233
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:46,367
And think about the old days they didn't just sell the product and they weren't they were done with it they're actively now interact

1234
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:48,415
Staying with the product even while you use it

1235
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:51,743
To the degree that it's connected and

1236
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:53,791
To the manufacturer and that

1237
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:55,583
Things are happening or not happen

1238
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:57,119
Running right so it's

1239
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:59,935
Created a relationship that's almost day-to-day

1240
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:01,215
Goes beyond

1241
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:02,239
The point of sale

1242
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:04,799
With the the old way that devices

1243
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:05,567
Where sold

1244
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:09,919
So do you think it's going to be interesting to see how the law developed

1245
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:10,943
In that regard

1246
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:14,783
But I don't see that lending itself to class action

1247
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:16,319
Treatment or risk

1248
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:18,111
As much as I do

1249
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:20,927
The security of the actual data

1250
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:22,463
Disclosures Etc

1251
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:25,023
That's that's over the large

1252
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:27,327
Large pool of people versus individual action

1253
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:28,095
And although

1254
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:31,935
I could imagine if my connected pet feeder you know stopped working in

1255
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:33,215
Till the whole bunch of cats

1256
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:34,495
Interesting

1257
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:35,263
In terrible

1258
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:36,287
I should have terrible

1259
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:37,055
Okay

1260
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:40,383
TV I feel like I have learned a lot

1261
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:43,199
Are there any other topics that you're like Stacy

1262
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:46,271
Just for all the people making smart devices out here

1263
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:47,807
You should also think about this

1264
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:49,855
I think the big ones are

1265
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:52,671
We started touchdown them indirectly but just

1266
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:59,327
Assume as you go down the road of new technology and advancement and the more connected your

1267
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:00,095
Becoming

1268
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:02,911
Two people that you're nowhere near

1269
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:04,959
I do think think about work

1270
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:06,751
Work from the back what are the risks

1271
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:10,847
What are the risk of something goes wrong what are the risks of what we're doing

1272
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:13,663
And work backwards from what anybody see this

1273
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:16,223
As a infringement of some

1274
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:17,759
Sores that would cause

1275
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:22,879
A whole bunch of people to be able to in one Fell Swoop say that we had done something wrong

1276
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:25,439
And I think working backwards like that

1277
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:28,767
It's just a great risk management technique and I think

1278
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:32,095
Is important to always think about risk mitigation

1279
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:34,143
And risk management

1280
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:38,239
At the same time that you're evolving and developing technology because

1281
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:44,639
The companies of Osteen get in trouble or the ones that things get too big too fast and sort of the infrastructure

1282
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:48,735
And the thought process about how to manage risk and how to

1283
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:50,015
Mitigate risk

1284
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:55,391
Doesn't keep up with the Amazing Ideas in The Amazing advancements in technology

1285
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:56,671
And that imbalance

1286
00:55:57,183 --> 00:55:58,463
Can just create

1287
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:01,791
A lot of problems down the road it only takes one

1288
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:06,655

1289

1291
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:11,263
Hey

1292
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:15,359
But it's hugely disruptive to the company to go through that kind of

00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:19,967
Litigation or regulatory oversight or regulatory investigations

1294
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:26,367
And also you take a hit in the media and in all of those things I really think can be mitigated by a little bit of thought they had

1295
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:32,767

1300
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:45,055
