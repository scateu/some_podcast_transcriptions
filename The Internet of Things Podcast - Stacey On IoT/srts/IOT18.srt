00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,008
Hey everyone is the Internet of Things podcast

2
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:12,288
And this is your house

3
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:13,312
Stacey Higginbotham

4
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:14,848
And your other host

5
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:15,872
Kevin tofel

6
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:18,944
And this week we have some awesome stuff for you beginning with

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,736
Anti-poaching effort

8
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:22,528
In South Africa

9
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:23,296
Not eggs

10
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:24,320
Not eggs

11
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:25,600
Rhinoceros

12
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,464
Living with our friend

13
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:31,744
The algorithm

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,768
And how

15
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:33,536
Is it worth it

16
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:35,584
We'll also talk about

17
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,656
Best Buy in The Geek Squad and our guest this week

18
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:40,960
Is David Newman who is the guy who helped

19
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:44,032
Target build its new retail concept for The Internet of Things

20
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:47,616
There's definitely a French theme running through this

21
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:48,384
This week's podcast

22
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:49,664
Spot It

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,432
So

24
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:51,200
Kevin

25
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:52,992
Let's get started with

26
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:54,272
Poached rhinos

27
00:00:54,784 --> 00:01:00,928
Is this is interesting that you pointed this out to me I had not heard of this story but this is a way to use the Internet of Things

28
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:04,000
To basically connect rhinos to protect them from poachers

29
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:07,840
And you are a story about this so how are they doing this

30
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:10,912
This is an effort by an organization called

31
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:13,984
Protect and they are funded by The Humane Society

32
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,008
The international

33
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:15,776
Humane Society

34
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,824
It's actually kind of crazy

35
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:19,616
Take

36
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:20,640
Rhinoceros

37
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:21,920
Rhinos

38
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:22,688
Rhinos

39
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:23,968
Rhinos thank you

40
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:24,992
And

41
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:27,552
Surgically implant a video

42
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:30,112
In their secondary horn

43
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:30,880
So

44
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:34,720
Do a little rhinoplasty

45
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,584
They also

46
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,120
Add a heart rate monitor

47
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:42,144
The Rhinoceros

48
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:43,424
Rhino

49
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,192
Dry nose

50
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:44,960
And

51
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:46,752
They had a GPS

52
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:49,312
And what they do is they track the rhino

53
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:52,128
And when the heart rate monitor spikes

54
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:55,456
Check to see through the video camera

55
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:57,760
What has happened to cause that Spike

56
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,040
And if it is

57
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:01,344
Is an injury or some kind of problem

58
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:04,672
Share the GPS location

59
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,976
With the Rangers that protect the rhinos

60
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:08,768
And they send a helicopter

61
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:11,328
And helicopter come speeding in

62
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:14,400
Apparently hopefully catches a posher

63
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,168
In

64
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:17,984
Action and hopefully before it actually

65
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,264
Kills the rhinos

66
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,848
That's the key the timing is the key here

67
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:25,152
It is because what happens is

68
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:26,176
Your

69
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:29,504
If you're a ranger in Africa you're trying to protect

70
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,296
Thousands of miles or

71
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:32,832
Thousands of kilometers

72
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:33,600
As they would say

73
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,648
Of Savannah

74
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,464
You really can't do that very effectively

75
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:43,840
It's too difficult because it's too broad of an area there's a limited connectivity and so on so

76
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:47,424
It's kind of interesting to me that they're essentially instrumenting the rhinos

77
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,192
Scare

78
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:51,264
For you know Health monitoring reasons end of the video camera

79
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,336
I mean I don't want to sound morbid at all but you don't

80
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,616
Thinking Out Loud here

81
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:57,152
You'll be able to tell

82
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,944
By the video if perhaps something

83
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:03,296
Scared the Rhino and it's okay or something like that that made the hearts way

84
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:05,344
Obviously it's like they see the

85
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,624
Camera view

86
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,928
Sideways or something obvious to the Rhinos down

87
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:11,744
Yan in the show notes will include this but they also

88
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,768
You also get

89
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:13,536
Rhinocam

90
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:15,072
Which is a

91
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,632
Rhino horns I view of the world

92
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:20,448
Which I think would be kind of a fun

93
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:22,752
Perspective as they fight or

94
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:23,776
Run around

95
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,312
Doing Rhino things

96
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:28,128
They're kind of solitary animals so I'm not sure if

97
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:29,920
Good footage

98
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,200
They have is

99
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:32,992
Hey here

100
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:35,040
Grassland scrub

101
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:35,808
Oh

102
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:36,576
Awesome

103
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:39,904
It's still kind of interesting and

104
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,696
Because the admission early there's

105
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:44,000
No connectivity challenges in these areas

106
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,048
Corrector using satellites

107
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:48,864
For the connection

108
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,192
They're actually a lot of technical challenges here outside of the

109
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,728
The challenges

110
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,032
Hunting down a rhino putting it to sleep in

111
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,824
Surgically implanting a camera in it

112
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,176
It snows I think this is a really interesting project

113
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,968
It is daunting

114
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:04,736
I still think

115
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:08,064
Hey it's worthwhile that they've gotten the proof-of-concept out

116
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,344
The Prototype

117
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:14,464
There's like one prototype running around there to have a couple more and the idea is

118
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:20,351
To actually expand this program to elephants and tigers they're starting to develop those proof of Concepts this year

119
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,399
And within a couple months

120
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,423
This will be

121
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,191
Kind of

122
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:27,519
The prototypes will be on the ground in South Africa

123
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,799
On the rhinos

124
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:29,823
And

125
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:32,383
Yeah it seems like a really cool project so

126
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,663
If you're interested I'll

127
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,199
Information

128
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:37,247
I'm watching the video feed

129
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:39,039
That you have in your story in

130
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:43,903
The camera quality outstanding except there's this giant horn in the way that lock

131
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:50,303
Yes yes you do just so you guys know if you want to go check this out you're not

132
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,839
How can I get the complete picture

133
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,375
You know if you saw the

134
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,143
Jornada

135
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,191
R2 that would

136
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:58,495
Kind of time defeats the purpose

137
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:03,359
That sounds like a good startup opportunity for somebody Cash Out million

138
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:05,919
Sorry

139
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,199
You are terrible

140
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:09,503
So moving for a rhino horn

141
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,111
Prince and the plains of South Africa

142
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:17,183
Sorry go ahead

143
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,487
Could you outrun a rhino these are questions that

144
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,511
Maybe we should

145
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:21,535
Ponder

146
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,815
As we watch that video

147
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,351
I'm going to have to see him run

148
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:27,167
Cuz he's going back and forth night looking at plants and eating so

149
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,727
Is this interesting

150
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:35,615
I watch a lot of Discovery Channel and National Geographic and so on and

151
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,943
I really get into this kind of thing so yeah I mean I'm mesmerised

152
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:39,711
Did you not

153
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:42,271
Alright so Kevin is going to be one of the first

154
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,551
Backers of the rhino

155
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:46,879
Sodexo

156
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,415
Moving on from

157
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:50,975
Fran okay I'm going to move into actually

158
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:51,743
Smart Home Care

159
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:55,327
Earlier this year I tested the netatmo

160
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:58,399
Is that the doorbell camera or

161
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,167
No this is

162
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,215
Is a Pringles can

163
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,079
I made it look like it look like a smaller print

164
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,871
And it looks more like a

165
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:10,431
It look more like a hairspray can remove scan

166
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,455
It's a little skinnier

167
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:13,503
For those of you who use product

168
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,271
In your hair

169
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:18,111
Does if you could do not it's just skinnier than a Pringles can and shorter

170
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:22,463
And it is beautiful it is champagne colored aluminum

171
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:23,999
And

172
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:30,143
It purports to have facial recognition and it learns via algorithm who the people in your family are

173
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,959
And it starts alerting you

174
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:36,031
And get your notifications instead of saying I detect

175
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,823
Movement it says things like

176
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:41,151
In my house it would be Stacy just into the house

177
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:44,991
Which is a little bit more useful and you don't even have to click through to the app

178
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,527
To be like oh who just enter

179
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,319
I told you

180
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,111
So I've been to

181
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,135
Testing that

182
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,159
And then

183
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:57,279
I've also tested things like the canary which is an all-in-one security device and then there's the classic

184
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:02,911
The Nest so I thought it'd be kind of fun Kevin for you and I to talk about like

185
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,191
Life with an algorithm

186
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:08,543
Because a lot more Smart Home Products are touting this idea of

187
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,335
An algorithm is being

188
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,615
Epic selling

189
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:18,015
Like I think we're still trying to figure we Izzy and industries are trying to figure out how to make these things

190
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,831
Work in a smart way when we say smart home

191
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:26,463
To me that's not just these individual devices if the algorithms that tie Services Android devices

192
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,231
Together

193
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:33,887
And didn't take it off and doesn't work the way you think it might work the way you want it to and I suspect that's what you've been finding out

194
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:36,447
In testing all these things but I'm taking a wild stab here

195
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,239
It's a little like that so

196
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:40,287
The key point I think the

197
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,847
Anytime you see the word algorithm

198
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,639
With these products is

199
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:46,943
That you have to remember is you have to train them

200
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,735
And that's kind of what I'm getting at

201
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:49,759
Because a lot of these

202
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:50,527
Annie's products

203
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,343
Take the nest requires about a week-long train

204
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,903
And that's fine

205
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,695
And that week-long training. With

206
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:02,047
The Nest Is You by The Nest you install it in for a week you treat it like any other thermos

207
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,327
You know when you're high

208
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,375
You go walk to the nest or you

209
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,143
Use your phone

210
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:06,911
When you're like

211
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:07,679
Hey I'm hot

212
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,775
After about a week of that the nest

213
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:12,543
Dislike

214
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,311
You know what

215
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:15,615
I think I got your schedule and then it starts

216
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,895
Working on its own

217
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,455
If it's based on your behavior

218
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:21,759
Learn from your behaviors and starts

219
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:24,575
Reacting to or acting upon

220
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,647
Your behavior without you manually giving input

221
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,183
Yes

222
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:29,951
So

223
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:33,023
With the facial recognition because the canary has a

224
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,047
And

225
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:37,119
What is trying to do is its trying to identify things

226
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:37,887
Things like

227
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:44,287
Oh hey that's a dog so when your dog comes in sets off the motion sensor I'm not going to call in a lot

228
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:45,567
Right

229
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:46,591
Which

230
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:48,127
That's awesome right

231
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:51,711
Oh that's great because in the old days which was not long ago

232
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:54,271
If you had motion detection sensors

233
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,831
We did we had an alarm system

234
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,111
And the cats

235
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:00,415
Would actually be able to set it off we weren't home

236
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:03,999
So then we had to buy special motion sensors that were programmed to ignore

237
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,023
Sings

238
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,327
Moving around under roughly 40 lb

239
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,351
So

240
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:12,447
If that's not ideal if you can have actual recognition that's the way to go

241
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,215
Right

242
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,751
Things like that so

243
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:18,079
In the welcome camera ideas it recognizes

244
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:21,407
Is people's faces who live in the house so it can give you better

245
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,175
Data

246
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,967
Slack better notifications

247
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:25,247
How can I deal with notify

248
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,015
Vacation fatigue

249
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,039
Great

250
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:27,807
So

251
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,855
The challenge with both of those system

252
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:30,879
Was that

253
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:33,439
The training. Didn't actually

254
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:34,719
Stop

255
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:35,743
After a week

256
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,023
It never ends

257
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,583
And so what would it what would happen is

258
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,119
At first you know

259
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,399
So we'll start with a welcome

260
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:45,727
Everyone in my house had to go in front of the camera in

261
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:46,751
Antenna

262
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,031
Faking it was like

263
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,591
Here we are

264
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:51,871
Like 3 or 4 days

265
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,431
Every time it was show you

266
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:57,247
A list of faces basically in

267
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:00,063
It would be you would just be like this is dispersed

268
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:01,855
This is

269
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,391
Righteverywhere

270
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,415
Every face

271
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,951
It wasn't

272
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:06,975
They made it nice

273
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,791
It after while. Really good

274
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:15,423
But it's still with throw up faces for you like every morning when I open the app it would be like

275
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,727
Here like 15 faces would like

276
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:18,495
For you to identify

277
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,031
Or

278
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:20,799
Sure

279
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:21,823
14 faces

280
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,639
Can you confirm that the following six are Stacy

281
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,199
And you would hit them

282
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:30,783
What I was actually really impressed with was some of them

283
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,319
I couldn't even identify a state

284
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,879
These are pictures of

285
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:35,903
Purportedly of me

286
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,439
And I be like

287
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:41,023
And the pressure is on actually to get it right

288
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,303
Because

289
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,071
If you get it

290
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:43,839
If you were like

291
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:44,863
I don't know

292
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,935
You're kind of like I miss him with an algorithm

293
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,519
And decreasing the probability that it

294
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,567
Be able to identify me

295
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:57,663
Right sure you don't want to be the one that weaken the algorithms intelligence

296
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,431
Just might be

297
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:00,735
So

298
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:01,759
I felt like

299
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:04,575
After a certain point in time I wanted it to stop at

300
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:08,671
Like after a month I was I was really done with

301
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:09,695
Interactive

302
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:14,303
Yeah it's it's a shame that it

303
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,351
Doesn't really ever end

304
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:19,423
Yeah I bet you don't maybe if they showed it to me like

305
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,959
Hey do you have time to go through

306
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:21,727
Some faces

307
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,287
And they made it like a fun game or something

308
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:30,431
You know there's value in going through every especially like I have a small child too

309
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,967
You know her face changes

310
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:32,735
Overtime

311
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:35,039
So there's value in that

312
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:37,343
And you know when new people come in

313
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:40,159
It's like hey I just saw a totally new person

314
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,695
We care about that person

315
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:44,255
Every morning I would wake up

316
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,839
Here's 15 new faces of your husband

317
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:49,119
I know that's

318
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,167
Again they got to put

319
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:55,519
Some limits on that to decrease the number of times over the

320
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,311
How often does that because

321
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,127
It just it just loses value

322
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,663
Kind of interesting because

323
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:06,783
Mei I have no problem with the facial-recognition approach I know a lot of people will and then that's fine that you know

324
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:09,087
Privacy issues etc etc I'm not going to go there

325
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:12,159
But there's one device that I've had for the past

326
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,695
I'll say three years

327
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:14,719
That is

328
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:19,071
Does an outstanding job at recognizing everybody in my family as well as some of the neighbors

329
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,631
I don't think you'll ever guess

330
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:22,655
I will not ever

331
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:23,935
Your talk

332
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:26,239
Well yes that are there is that

333
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,007
Bedtime

334
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,799
He's going to be around forever and for tonight

335
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:31,615
The Microsoft Xbox Kinect is fan

336
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,383
Tastic

337
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,407
And identification

338
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,967
Fantastic

339
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:40,831
So I don't know if it's any use multiple sensors it's not just a camera that use infrared

340
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:43,135
But you some type of RGB camera

341
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:45,439
They have multiple sensors in that connect

342
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:48,511
And they do a fantastic job with it

343
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:49,791
I don't think

344
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,583
It's ever actually do because

345
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,863
When you set it up

346
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:54,399
You know it takes your picture and so on

347
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:57,471
You said your accounts and etc etc

348
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:58,751
And then

349
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,031
Anytime you walk

350
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:06,431
If you have it set up this way every time you walk in front of the Xbox it literally will just automatically sign you in if you have a configure to do so

351
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:09,247
I'm almost wish they would license it out because

352
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:12,319
Think these products would benefit greatly from that

353
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,599
Who that would be

354
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:17,695
If your buddy at the echo somewhere behind you I won't say

355
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:18,719
Shi shoes

356
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:20,255
She who shall not be named

357
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:22,047
We call her in our house

358
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,095
Doubt that could be really compelling

359
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,887
Are there kind of creepy

360
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,703
So moving right along

361
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,495
Living with algorithms

362
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:31,263
And maybe something

363
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,055
Might be better about training

364
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:36,383
Since we're going to see a lot more of them and they should get better

365
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,479
Because that is the only way we're going to handle the information overflow that we're going to

366
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,247
Reconnect

367
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:43,295
Get the information day loser

368
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,087
Is

369
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:49,183
There is there is more help on the way other than better AI

370
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:50,463
Is

371
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:52,511
Best Buy wants to help

372
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:57,375
Speaking at brainstorm Tech the CEO of Best Buy

373
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:58,655
To bear

374
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,703
Judicially

375
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:04,543
Got on stage and I can't believe I forgot to talk about this last week

376
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:09,151
He said that his retailer as a retailer Best Buy is

377
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,687
This is super poised to help

378
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:11,967
With the Internet of Things

379
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:14,527
Because not only will they sell connected devices

380
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,319
They also

381
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,087
Well

382
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:20,671
How people install and troubleshoot

383
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:23,487
The stuff that you know Kevin you and I do like

384
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:26,047
Hours at a time on weekends

385
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,071
What do you think about that

386
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,375
Well

387
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:35,519
Say hello and I say this I don't want to categorize every single Geek Squad member as being fantastic or terrible

388
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,055
As long as

389
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:42,431
You barely can guarantee a certain minimum level of performance I think it's a great idea

390
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:47,295
Because most people either a don't have the time that you and I have to devote

391
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,063
To this kind of thing

392
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,087
How to troubleshoot everything

393
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,903
Time

394
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:55,999
And Emily just before the show we were kind of laughing out loud saying

395
00:14:56,255 --> 00:15:00,095
Anytime there's any small problem with any of our systems are other devices

396
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,119
What are apps

397
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,399
If he comes this

398
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:04,191
Debacle of things that

399
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,983
Take hours to resolve

400
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:11,359
And people don't want to invest that kind of time that the whole point of all these connected devices

401
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:14,431
Is that you're pretty smart things in your house and around you

402
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:17,503
So you get some of your time back and you get some value

403
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,271
So I'm

404
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,039
Fine with

405
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:23,647
Best Buy being the Apple Genius bar for my smart home provided

406
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,415
You know it's

407
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:26,975
It's not me spending two hours trouble shooting

408
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:29,279
I'd rather do than have them spend

409
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:31,839
2 hours or 3 hours and not be able to figure it out

410
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:32,607
Right cuz

411
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:34,399
You & I we generally figure this stuff out

412
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:36,447
We do although I will say

413
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,727
When I think it's a gene

414
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,543
What I think of the Geeks

415
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,567
Squad

416
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:42,335
Sorry

417
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:46,687
Sorry

418
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:49,247
Oh I did it again

419
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:52,319
What I have on the brain

420
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:54,111
Sorry God

421
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:58,463
Going to try it takes. T Squad Squad

422
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:00,511
Tutu issues

423
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:01,791
What is

424
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:03,327
Guys have fun

425
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,095
Corn on your

426
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,631
Computer I really do

427
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:08,703
So you bring it in and they like rifle Terraria

428
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:09,727
Your folders on your heart

429
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,007
For like

430
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,031
Improvising stuff

431
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:16,639
There's been some horror stories about that yes

432
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:20,991
Poking around your house near

433
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:22,783
My house that I know of

434
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:26,111
I was going to say Stacy specifically not saying

435
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:30,975
They don't want to hurt you if you wanted to find a point in her house she did something happen to find anything and

436
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:31,999
So

437
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:33,279
The other thing is

438
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:36,351
You don't the hard thing about the Internet of Things

439
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:39,679
Is that your combining both it in like

440
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,703
Physical

441
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,471
Infrastructure

442
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:44,287
It's it's like people call it it and OT

443
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:46,335
God help me if I ever use

444
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:49,919
It is true you have to have

445
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:50,943
Physical like

446
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:51,967
There's Electric

447
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,015
Afraid so I got stymied by intellect

448
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:55,807
But this weekend

449
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:58,367
Not and then I got signed by a network

450
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,135
Arkansas

451
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:01,695
So you got to have those two things

452
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:03,487
And you know I was tok

453
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:04,511
Usually about

454
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:10,911
Like are you going to bring in like electricians because I would be really interesting service for BestBuy to offer if I could just call them up and get like

455
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,447
An installation Network

456
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,215
Work is well

457
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:18,079
And that doesn't seem to be in the plans because there's licensing things that differ by each state

458
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,615
That's the tougher things

459
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,383
To sell

460
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,919
Although I think that would be amazing

461
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:23,711
Stop ride Amazon with it

462
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:26,015
Amazon Home Services is actual

463
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,551
I coming in real strong there

464
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:31,135
But so I feel like that would be like a much more compelling thing

465
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:35,231
That's those are two things that Best Buy really with its Geek Squad would have to address

466
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:35,999
Before I'm like

467
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,279
Yeah

468
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:39,071
This is a really compelling offering

469
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,375
Come on over

470
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,399
Geek Squad

471
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,191
Yeah I mean

472
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:50,591
Computers phones those are all very personal devices but there's nothing more personal to probably anybody then

473
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:53,919
What's going on in their home their home itself and so on

474
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:54,687
Cancel

475
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:58,271
There is the trust issue that they have to work on and I think it's

476
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:00,575
We can take some time I I suspect

477
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:05,183
He saying what he should be saying you know in Defence of his company hey we have something nobody else offers

478
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,207
That's true

479
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:08,255
But a lot of people will not

480
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:09,791
Be swayed by that

481
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,071
I don't I don't think

482
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:15,423
Yeah I mean cuz like if you think about it Comcast AT&T

483
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:21,567
Verizon I mean those guys all have an installer Network and a smartphone Prada

484
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:22,591
Actually Verizon

485
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,615
I don't think has a small

486
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,943
AT&T and Comcast have

487
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:29,503
ATT has one

488
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:32,319
Alarm.com Vivint all of those guys

489
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,087
Do and they have

490
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:35,135
The same sort of expertise

491
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:42,303
Yeah I mean I get what he's driving at and I agree with you if they offer

492
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,327
You no more

493
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:46,911
Technical electrical type install services that would probably

494
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:47,679
Be element

495
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,959
Make it more compelling

496
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:50,239
But

497
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:53,567
The reality is these products are being designed so that

498
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:54,591
Hopefully

499
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:58,943
Somebody can just go to a Best Buy or whatever store they buy their gear out or get it from Amazon

500
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,991
And literally be up and running

501
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,271
On their own

502
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,295
It in a short

503
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,319
Matter of time

504
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:05,855
So

505
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:09,183
You know it's it kind of defeats the purpose of these devices

506
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:13,535
It to some degree if it's going to require a Geek Squad or

507
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,583
AT&T tech or an electrician

508
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:20,959
The promise of the Smart Hub you know it's brings all the Simplicity and everything else but if you have to pull your hair out trying to get it installed

509
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:23,775
And you don't be on the phone with support for an hour or two

510
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:26,591
It's frustrating it's like

511
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:28,127
The promise has not been met here

512
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:30,431
Course without it we wouldn't have a show so

513
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,199
On that note

514
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,223
Good point

515
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:35,551
We should end the show but before we do

516
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:39,647
Kevin and I are taking a much-needed break because it will be

517
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:40,415
August

518
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:41,951
In August is a great month

519
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:42,975
To take a break

520
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,279
Cuz that would just be

521
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:46,559
Puppy lazy

522
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,327
I'm not lazy

523
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:48,863
Asellina

524
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:49,631
No

525
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:50,655
So

526

Maybe you guys have heard of

544
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:40,319

I am super excited

548
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:51,327
Because a couple weeks ago we talked about this Kevin and I on the show

549
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,351
About Target

550
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,375
Open house

551
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:56,191
This is a brand new retail concept for Target

552
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:59,263
So David do you want to tell us a little bit about open house

553
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:04,383
Yeah absolutely open house is the culmination of

554
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:07,967
Work we've been doing in the Internet of Things stays for

555
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,759
18 months

556
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:12,063
An ultimately with open house

557
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:14,623
We set out to create a very

558
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:16,416
Fun educational

559
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:18,208
Experiential retail space

560
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:21,024
Where consumers can come in and experience

561
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:25,632
The Internet of Things in the connected home in a very easy to understand way

562
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,192
Okay you got about fifty products

563
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:30,496
Dinner in the space end

564
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:36,128
I have yet to visit because I am not in San Francisco but let me tell you I have gotten text form about

565
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,664
A dozen people who've

566
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,968
So far showed up so you guys

567
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:41,248
It's only been like two weeks

568
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,528
When we're recording this

569
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,856
But this is been open but already a dozen people have sent me

570
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:50,976
Text an email saying hey I've been in this this amazing experience happened to me

571
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:51,744
You have

572
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:56,608
Clear furniture that is showing the stuff off to Lake

573
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:58,656
Crazy degrees you got Interactive

574
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,680
Tables you got

575
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:03,008
A lot of documentation that shows these things working together

576
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,056
So tell me a little bit about

577
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:06,336
If I go in there

578
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:07,872
What am I going to say

579
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:08,640
Cnexps

580
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:12,736
Sure will you mention the furniture

581
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:15,552
And the first thing you're going to see walking into open

582
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:16,576
Open house is

583
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:17,856
Very literally

584
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:21,184
In open house so we have a cross section

585
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:21,952
The house

586
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:25,536
Location appropriate house it's a

587
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:26,304
Victorian home

588
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:29,120
And we have all the various rooms

589
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:29,888
Tibet House

590
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:30,912
And it's made out of

591
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:35,008
Clear acrylic and the purpose of that actually came out of a number of

592
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:36,288
Design experiments that

593
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,824
Weed in San Francisco

594
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:40,640
I all around this idea of showcasing

595
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:41,408
Vinyasa

596
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,176
Products work

597
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:43,456
Getting together so

598
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:44,480
Our first

599
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:47,808
Our first-ever we call these iot playground

600
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:48,576
That's when we did that

601
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:53,696
And for any of your listeners who saw these around San Francisco we didn't brand them as targets

602
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:59,072
I'm the first one we set up a living room with actual furniture and connect

603
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:01,120
Good products and show various vignettes

604
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:02,656
So someone coming home and lights

605
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:03,680
Turning on

606
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:08,544
Music coming on different interactions all possible today with the various

607
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:10,080
Out there

608
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:12,896
It was interesting and I was as you can imagine

609
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:15,200
You walk into a space with locks

610
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:17,248
Living room furniture and some very

611
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:18,528
Smart connected products

612
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:19,296
And

613
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:21,088
It looks like you're in a living room

614
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:22,368
You notice the couch

615
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:23,392
Table you noticed

616
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:29,280
And so we realize that once we explain to people what we were doing they were interested in the technology

617
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:30,560
But it was too

618
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:31,584
Scared when

619
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,352
1 1st Ave

620
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:33,120
Encountered

621
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:36,704
So the next experiment we ran we actually took

622
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,472
A difference

623
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:40,288
Set of vignettes all around the babies

624
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:42,848
And went to a different location in San Fran

625
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:46,944
Cisco and for another 3 days we set up our next iot playground

626
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:47,968
Did the team win

627
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:48,992
And we

628
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:52,320
Set up baby furniture and this time we made me

629
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,856
We spray painted everything White

630
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:56,416
And in the baby's room we had

631
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:58,464
Activate monitor we had

632
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:00,000
Sonos speaker

633
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:03,584
And once again we found that while we work to obscure the fern

634
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:06,656
We still had big furniture

635
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:09,984
Even though it's all painted white it just look like a room full of white furniture

636
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:10,752
Iran

637
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:11,776
Small products

638
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:15,104
So all of this design experimentation let us

639
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:21,504
To the recognition that if we really wanted to show these products working together in sit you in these various room

640
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,528
Rooms of a home

641
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:24,576
That we really needed to

642
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:28,928
Make that furniture both literally and figuratively transparent

643
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:30,464
Like make the product

644
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,232
The Stars

645
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:34,048
And show the data interactions

646
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:36,608
And the very real daily life

647
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:38,656
Problems that we all want help solving

648
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:41,216
Unfolding before our eyes and

649
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:42,240
And how these products

650
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:43,264
You're helping so

651
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:47,360
To your question of what do you see when you walk in you first see this house and

652
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:49,664
And you go from the living room into

653
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,736
To the bedroom into a baby's room a kitchen

654
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:59,136
And a garage and a backyard area each that has the appropriate connected products or literally show

655
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:00,928
Showing entire home

656
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:03,488
Experience from the front door to the back door and

657
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,536
The backyard and everything in between

658
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:09,632
So both with the house and with the Deep dive tables

659
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:11,680
A big part of the

660
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:16,032
The design is all around the stories of how these products connect and work

661
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:16,800
Work together

662
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:18,592
And then lastly there is a tree

663
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:20,384
Traditional shelf that has

664
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,408
It's along the backbone

665
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:22,176
The sidewalk

666
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,992
That has products out of their boxes UK

667
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:26,528
Pick him up you can

668
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:29,600
Interact with them via the device that is paired to eat

669
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:31,392
Each one and so that's more

670
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,928
Opportunity to engage with

671
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:33,952
The product as is

672
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:35,744
As an individual product

673
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:42,144
They're the least number of products on that shelf as compared to the Deep dive

674
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,192
Got it

675
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:45,216
And

676
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:47,776
Is consumers you can actually purchase products

677
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:48,800
Guess

678
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:52,128
Every product we show is for sale

679
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:53,664
So

680
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,944
You guys have now been open

681
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:57,760
As of this conversation about a couple weeks

682
00:25:58,272 --> 00:25:58,784
So

683
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,832
What have you seen so far

684
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:01,600
Because

685
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:03,904
This is an entirely new way

686
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,976
And I have to applaud you for selling this way because

687
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,864
It is by far the most comprehensive plan I think I've seen for selling the Internet of Things

688
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,680
I've had a lot of retailers on the show in

689
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:19,520
And visited just about every store that sells connected gadgets

690
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:21,056
Kind of understand

691
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,848
How this is being sold

692
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:23,616
Because it's

693
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:26,432
Is very complicated you're trying to show

694
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:31,808
Most people are just popping single-use devices on a shelf or a hub on a Shelf

695
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,856
So it's hard to understand

696
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:34,880
What products work

697
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:35,648
With what other

698
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:38,208
So I really like what you're doing

699
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,256
There are no plans though now to

700
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:41,536
Anywhere between

701
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:42,816
Right

702
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:46,400
You're right now this is a one-of-a-kind space and it's

703
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:47,936
Purpose of experimentation

704
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,472
So we put it there

705
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:51,264
Because all of the question

706
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,032
Is that

707
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:54,080
One of your listeners might ask

708
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:55,104
Or a Sceptre

709
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,176
Think about the overall connected-home and iot

710
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:59,200
T-space my ass

711
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:02,016
We think there's validity of every one of those question

712
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:04,064
We're focused on trying to get to the

713
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:10,208
Rather this is a place where we think we bring all of the right parties together in a salon like way

714
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:15,584
And just have dialogue that we never felt we could effectively had around the conference

715
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:17,376
Around my table

716
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:19,680
We can state that we're serious week

717
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:21,984
Can state that we intend to do certain things

718
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:25,056
But when you're standing inside that space and you and you

719
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:26,848
You see the care and

720
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,640
Design that went into what

721
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:29,408
We felt

722
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:32,736
It just makes for a very different conversation with the makers

723
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:34,272
In the platform players

724
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:38,112
Consumers I think they see it and it's a different way of

725
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:40,672
I've just understanding and for many who come in the space

726
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:41,952
It's the first time

727
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:45,024
But they're saying that they may not have the friends who have

728
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:48,608
Put Nest up on their wall or have a Sonos speaker in their house

729
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,888
So it's a it's

730
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:52,448
It's an opportunity to really just have a gift

731
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:56,032
Start a conversation in and gather a different set of observations

732
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:58,336
We thought we could do without it

733
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:01,920
So what are you seeing what are what are those conversations link

734
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:02,944
Are people buying

735
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:06,784
Your people are buying me I think first and foremost

736
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:11,392
Consumer response and they're sponsoring the target gas that have come through has been really

737
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:17,024
People really get it people find it very very educational and we find that both from those who know this

738
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,096
Space is lost those who down at the very least those who know the space

739
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:24,448
I probably seeing a few products is only read about or maybe haven't even

740
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:25,216
Inseam before

741
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:28,288
A people definitely appreciate seeing how they work

742
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,824
Together and those little story

743
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,616
One of my favorite is just

744
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:33,152
The role of a connector

745
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:33,920
Speaker in a baby

746
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,736
When the baby wakes up

747
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:39,040
If you have that connected baby monitor

748
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:42,368
Then if you want Beethoven playing at plays

749
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:43,904
Baby wakes up in the middle of the night

750
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:49,280
You have this option to either notify you immediately or to play some white noise

751
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:50,560
4 Hour lullaby

752
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:53,888
A minute or two to see if baby goes back to sleep

753
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:55,936
And when people see that I think they the

754
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:56,960
Promise of the

755
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:57,984
These products comes

756
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:58,752
Life

757
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:00,288
So there's been a lot of excitement

758
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,664
Hearing some vendors and other companies in the iot

759
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,688
T space is pretty

760
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:07,712
Consistently

761
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:08,992
This is what we need

762
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,296
We needed the space like this where week

763
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:12,576
Cast and weak

764
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:14,624
Can observe and we can do that

765
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:19,744
On a consistent basis and do it in in close proximity to all these other great Prada

766
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,608
So it's the dedication of the space has really resonated with the vendors and

767
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:28,704
I think it would be also really interesting from a troubleshooting perspective

768
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:31,008
Like for example

769
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:32,032
My house is

770
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:33,056
Probably not as

771
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:35,104
Pretty my friend is none of my furniture is

772
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:35,872
Is clear

773
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:39,200
I can't see my devices

774
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:44,576
Just setting up devices together and trying to get them to work together

775
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:45,600
Is educational

776
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:48,672
Not just for me but for some of the vendors where I'm like

777
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:52,768
You see this works together but when I put them together

778
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:54,048
Did they actually don't work

779
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:59,680
Updater app

780
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:00,960
So have you had any

781
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,520
Examples where I don't know maybe

782
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:07,872
Maybe things didn't quite work out as planned and you helped kind of broker

783
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:09,152
Apache or maybe

784
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:11,200
To manufacturers like hey wait a second

785
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:16,576
Just by virtue of being in the same room with these guys we suddenly seeing it would be a great idea that we

786
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:17,344
We if we

787
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:18,368
Built-in

788
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:19,648
Integration together

789
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:23,488
It's a great question in fact we probably

790
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:24,512
Had the most

791
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:25,536
Experience

792
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:27,072
In This Very topic

793
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:28,608
As we were designing the

794
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:29,632
Space where

795
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:31,936
There were stories we wanted to tell but

796
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:36,032
Products didn't necessarily there made one of the products maybe didn't yet have an open

797
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:36,800
API

798
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:40,384
Or you had a more restrictive API where access needed

799
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,920
Be granted to a

800
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:42,944
Platformer differ

801
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:43,712
Product

802
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:50,368
So it was really interesting exciting just to have those early conversations with these companies and some of them

803
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:51,136
Has opened

804
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:52,160
Things up

805
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:55,488
Haven't had an open up app that API access

806
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:56,256
Prior

807
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:59,328
Or they've agreed to open it up so long as we have

808
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:04,704
The space up so they may be saying hey world will keep this open and as long as Target is doing this and

809
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,752
And committed to it will continue to serve

810
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:07,776
Supportive

811
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:08,544
Aspen grade

812
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:11,360
We've yet to run into any problems

813
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:12,128
Games with any of the

814
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:13,664
The products that we have connect

815
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:16,224
And part of that is acceleration that went into

816
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,552
Because we did The Upfront work to make sure everything works

817
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:22,368
We also did the diligence to ensure that

818
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:25,696
Yeah we were going to know if apis ever changed or

819
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:26,976
Any of those

820
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:28,512
Particulars that can

821
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:30,304
Can keep things from working

822
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,072
Together

823
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:37,472
It's also get that why we don't have every we're not trying to have every product available in the space

824
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:39,520
Is part of what goes into a select

825
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:40,800
Sing a product for the space

826
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:42,336
Is making sure that

827
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:43,872
It has that openness

828
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:45,664
And that reliability

829
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:46,944
Before we put it in the

830
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:48,480
Nice

831
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:52,576
So I have to ask because there's a huge component here

832
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:56,416
I'm bringing startups and interesting ideas to Target

833
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:57,184
Which

834
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:57,952
Is awesome

835
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:01,792
So if I am an iot startup or smart home startup

836
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:03,840
Who do I contact if I call you

837
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:05,632
To get into the space because

838
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,424
This isn't just

839
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,192
Hi

840
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:11,520
I want to I want to put a device here you're also talking about

841
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:12,544
Letting

842
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,080
Companies come in and

843
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:16,640
You know create focus groups to talk to

844
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:23,552
And I'm not sure how great it would be to talk to the San Francisco focus groups I think talking maybe to the people in Boise might be better

845
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:24,320
But you know

846
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:26,880
Still getting in front of you so she would be good

847
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:28,672
So how how did

848
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:30,976
What kind of programs do you envision for startups

849
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:32,256
Then how can I get involved

850
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:35,072
Well first off in terms of talking to that

851
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:40,448
Consumer from Boise the nice thing about the location being directly across from the Moscone Center

852
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,032
Is that we do get a lot of traffic from the conventions

853
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:46,080
There there which is really interesting because

854
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:47,616
You're on any given day

855
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:49,664
Last week the semicon

856
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,688
Conference

857
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:53,248
Which is all about for the semiconductor industry

858
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,832
And so understandably a lot of interest in the space

859
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:59,904
Many of the makers of these chips that are in the products were coming

860
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:00,672
Through

861
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:02,464
And so everyone was from

862
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,488
Someplace different

863
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:05,024
And so that's that's an exciting

864
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:07,584
Part about the location and why we sleep

865
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:11,680
Which shows that this is the singular location for this one

866
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:12,704
Find face

867
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,728
In terms of

868
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:15,776
Companies wanting to

869
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:17,824
Come into the space the first thing is

870
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,128
We have to get familiar with what we're doing

871
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:21,664
Before we even start talking

872
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:27,808
The best thing to do is you only have a website that can give you a high level overview that's open house. Target.com

873
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,112
And then by all means if you're in the area

874
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:30,880
Come on Inn

875
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:31,904
Explore the space

876
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:34,464
And then in terms of actually putting a product

877
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:40,864
In others there's a couple ways we recommend on that website open house. Target.com we have our email

878
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:45,728
Address we also have instructions of how to contact us BR Twitter handle

879
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:51,104
And give us awareness of your product and that will that will set off a

880
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,896
A series of follow-up conversation

881
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:55,200
And what's really exciting is

882
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:58,016
You're giving that weed this is not our

883
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:59,296
This is not a date

884
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:01,600
Restore roll out of this experience

885
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:06,720
The conversations are not of that nature of how do you get a peg or how do you get a

886
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:08,512
A space on the Shelf but rather

887
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:10,048
How do you fit into this eco

888
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:13,120
What are those what are those everyday life

889
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:14,144
Scenarios

890
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,168
You're helping.

891
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:16,448
Solve and make better

892
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,496
And how would you fit in in this house

893
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:20,288
Put you in the house what room would you be

894
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,360
What other products if any would you be interacting

895
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:26,432
And same with the tables we can point out how

896
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:28,224
Product on the on the interact

897
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,272
Cable it doesn't connect to any

898
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,856
Is actually less interesting from that Interactive

899
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:36,672
Experience Ben are other products bad

900
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:37,696
Have a whole lot of

901
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,000
And frankly we found this.

902
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:45,376
Unexpected on their side so if they're used to wanting your getting questions about

903
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:50,240
Their supply chain efficiency or their packaging or what not

904
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:52,544
And we really want to know is you and what what

905
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,616
What's the story what story are we telling here because

906
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:57,408
This is all part of

907
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:58,432
A bigger

908
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:01,504
Endeavor on our behalf to understand

909
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:07,136
What role do we target play in this overall ecosystem how do we bring broader value to it

910
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:08,928
And how does the consumer Bennett

911
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:14,304
Cuz I want all those pieces come together that's when that's when an industry is really that's when it really starts

912
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,072
Takeoff

913
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:18,144
I like that I like that kind of mentality

914
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:22,240
Although Supply chains will eventually come in handy that's not your focus here

915
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:24,032
I think it's worth pointing

916
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:24,800
Out

917
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:25,568
Because

918
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:30,432
You're not the steppingstone necessarily to all 1800 Target

919
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:31,200
Acrostic

920
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:36,064
No but we certainly we are part of Target and we can help with

921
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:41,440
Are Merchants I was just just recently with our electronics and home

922
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:45,792
Merchandising leadership and brainstorming on all of the different things they want

923
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:46,816
What to do on the space

924
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:49,888
Whether it's a product launch where if it's

925
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:50,912
Thanks

926
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:52,192
Target do we Leverage

927
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:53,216
Space to launch it

928
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:56,800
It's certainly a lot around prospecting new and exciting products

929
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:58,336
And also around

930
00:35:58,848 --> 00:35:59,360
Sometimes

931
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:02,432
It's the right product the way we operate very big box

932
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:04,992
And so the right product in the wrong space

933
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:07,040
Can be another challenge end

934
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:09,344
You take a product like tile everyone under

935
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,112
Stand for you

936
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,392
Yorkies

937
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:14,976
But where do you where do Yorkies come into play in your shopping app

938
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:21,376
Experience in our box is it as you're looking at a bike and you're thinking about a bike lock and you're losing your key

939
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:24,704
Your bike lock keys while you're on a bike ride is that a great place

940
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:26,240
Sonos

941
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:29,824
Has application in the baby's room and in the living room and

942
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,104
In electronics and

943
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:35,712
That's a you know that is a new challenge from multi-category retailer to

944
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:36,480
Kcon

945
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:41,600
So that some of those it those are the conversations we want to be having and that's where I can

946
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:43,648
Take the bridge between what we're doing it open

947
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:47,232
In house and what goes on Bradley at Target I think that's

948
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:48,768
That's one of those big connection

949
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:50,048
That's true

950
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:50,816
Although

951
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,120
I'm not sure the

952
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:54,656
The merchants are not the merchant

953
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:55,936
DIA

954
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:57,472
Manufacturers

955
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:58,752
The product companies field

956
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:01,056
No we want the stores

957
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:05,920
I should say because Kevin and I talked about this a couple of weeks ago when this lunch

958
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:06,944
And

959
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:13,344
You guys took issue with how he described it which I totally understand so Kevin and I said that this was in

960
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:15,392
The basement

961
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:17,696
Of the city Target across from a scone

962
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:24,352
And you were quick to point out that this is not actually a basement which sperm any probably conjures up get of darkened

963
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:25,888
Dingy places that

964
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:26,912
We're scared of

965
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:29,216
This is actually at the ground floor level

966
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:31,520
We I was just thinking it

967
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,872
Underneath the the main target which starts at the second floor

968
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:36,640
Ourself

969
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:38,176
This is street level

970
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:40,224
Florida City Target

971
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,760
Not the basement

972
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:43,552
So that that was one

973
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:44,320
One big

974
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:46,112
You know things that we should clarify for

975
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:48,160
People it's at 4th and Mission so

976
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:49,184
If you were there

977
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:51,232
And I'm hoping to be there at the

978
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:52,768
End of August so

979
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,584
You know I will let you guys know so I can pop in and

980
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,120
Play around but

981
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:58,144
I think David

982
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:58,912
I

983
00:37:59,168 --> 00:37:59,936
I have really enjoyed talking

984
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:01,984
Into you I cannot wait to go

985
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:02,752
Play

986
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:03,520
And see

987
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:04,800
I'm going to ask you

988
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:09,920
Has it have you changed anything do you have any connected Gadgets in your house or you know

989
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:13,504
Found a use case that you hadn't thought of in in putting this together

990
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,064
You use casewise those aha moments

991
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:18,368
We keep having them in

992
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,696
The happening at unusual moment

993
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:22,464
So

994
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:23,744
Things like

995
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,048
The role of Sonos in a babies

996
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,584
Things like

997
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,608
The important

998
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:32,448
Where in your house might you be most in

999
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:33,728
Interested in having the

1000
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:35,008
Screen that shows

1001
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:37,568
And the ring what's happening on your ring doorbell

1002
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,128
Or what are you picking up on your Dropcam

1003
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:44,736
I think when you see it in in the house you get to actually imagine

1004
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:45,504
Products

1005
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,272
Different location

1006
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:50,624
We were doing as we were designing these early playgrounds we were talking

1007
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,648
2

1008
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,440
Consumers in their home

1009
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:55,232
In their homes and

1010
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:56,768
When you should one of them

1011
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:59,328
Tile product which they haven't seen before

1012
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:00,864
They were in process

1013
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:04,192
Storing a bunch of boxes in their garage

1014
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:06,496
And ask the question will can I put a tile in

1015
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:07,264
Chinese box

1016
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:09,824
And then link that tile to the right

1017
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:10,848
Piece of my spreadsheet

1018
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:15,968
To tell me so I can quickly find anything that I put away and so a year from now I'll remember end

1019
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,320
That was another one of those aha moments it also gets into interesting question

1020
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:22,368
Around that use case and the

1021
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:23,648
Expected battery life

1022
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:24,928
Thailand so

1023
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,976
There are all sorts of these moments

1024
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:28,512
It's undeniable that this

1025
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:32,864
This is coming you'll be very hard-pressed to find a baby monitor in the next few years it is

1026
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:33,632
Connected

1027
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:37,216
Lost Art probably owning a piece of apparel that might have

1028
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:38,240
Ships

1029
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:39,520
Sensors in it

1030
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:43,360
I'm wrong thermostats are probably going to Aldi connected

1031
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:45,152
Shemar Moore store

1032
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:46,176
These products will be

1033
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:51,296
Connected and that means that we we need good answers to how do you showcase

1034
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:54,112
Please because if you put them all together into a single connected

1035
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:57,696
Kidspace what do you do when everything is finally connected and you have to start taking it

1036
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:58,464
Apart again

1037
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:02,048
Tell for me I'm following the curves of what the market research

1038
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:06,656
Search is telling us that the growth rate for these products in the in a home is

1039
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:07,936
Upwards of 30

1040
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:12,032
2% so I went from one couple years ago to 2 to 6

1041
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:12,800
Send

1042
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:14,592
When you're growing fast so I

1043
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:16,896
I continue to enjoy experimenting and

1044
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:19,968
We look forward to having you in our space

1045
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:24,832
