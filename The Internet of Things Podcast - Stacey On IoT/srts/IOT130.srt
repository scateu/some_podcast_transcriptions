00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:44,960
Right

48

Heaven

49
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,032
Let's get started with a big

50
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,312
News of

51
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,080
Week

52
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:50,848
Which is

53
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,384
Nat Nast

54
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:53,664
Yay

55
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,968
Wednesday they had a massive press

56
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:58,528
And we have known about this for a while

57
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:02,368
Speculation was rampant at cedia we talked about things like

58
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,904
Oh my gosh they're going to doorbell

59
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,672
Oh my gosh

60
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:05,952
They're doing a security system

61
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:06,720
Oh my God

62
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:08,256
They're doing all of that

63
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,792
So quick rundown

64
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,072
So you got a sensor

65
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,096
What's happening

66
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,632
This all went live yesterday

67
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:14,656
But

68
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:15,424
3

69
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,704
Hardware elements

70
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,728
And then there's this

71
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,752
Cool

72
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:21,568
Little additional feature let's hit the additional feature first

73
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:23,104
What's the biggest news I think

74
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,640
Really alright

75
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:27,200
Kevin's biggest news Google Assistant

76
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,480
Coming to the nest

77
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:29,760
Cam IQ

78
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:30,528
Indoor

79
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,368
So that's $300 camera that Nest announced

80
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,392
Fairly recently

81
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:38,464
It's got neat features like Nest aware

82
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,792
They come on in and now

83
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,584
It's basically like

84
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,608
In a lot of respects

85
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:49,984
It is and I think it's great news but I'm also like I just want a regular Nest cam

86
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,824
So if I didn't know this was coming I might have waited

87
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,616
Splurge on the nicer one

88
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:57,152
Well maybe this will make you feel better

89
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:59,200
There's going to be no Direct Media playback

90
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,224
On this device

91
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:03,040
So you know how you can tell it to play songs for

92
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:04,576
Spotify if you're not going to be able to do

93
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:10,976
And that's okay because that's exactly what those little Invidia Underwood called that we talked about two weeks ago the plugin

94
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:11,744
Mike's

95
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,888
We just enable you to speak commands for maybe media playback elsewhere or the house or whatever it's on okay with that

96
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:22,496
Okay yes and you can use it to play media back actually you can tell Google to play things on

97
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,264
Other speaker

98
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,800
You just can't play it from there

99
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:28,128
Turn lights on unlock a door give commands

100
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:28,896
Yes

101
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:29,920
You all of that

102
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:33,504
So but I actually don't think that's the biggest news I goofed

103
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:40,672
I wasn't sure the order you're going in there I thought you will get through it and then I'll jump back in and say that I think this is the big

104
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:46,560
Okay so we'll go in order of complexity

105
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:49,120
Nest is also announcing a

106
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,144
Nest

107
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,168
Cam IQ

108
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:51,936
Outdoor

109
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:55,520
To all of the functionality of I should say

110
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:57,312
The Google Assistant that's going to happen

111
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:59,104
So it's going to be

112
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:04,736
Nest cam outdoor it's coming

113
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,784
That's going to happen in November

114
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:09,856
That's pretty much an outdoor camera only thing that

115
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,904
Maybe worth noting is it

116
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:14,208
Super water resistant

117
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:16,000
Because it's ip66

118
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,815
There's this crazy readings

119
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:22,143
Any other thing you should know about it is

120
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,679
It actually plugs in

121
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,447
Through

122
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,215
Inside

123
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,263
So you got to drill a hole through your house

124
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:30,847
My hunch is going to be more professional installer

125
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:31,615
Nothing but

126
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:32,895
You can DIY this

127
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,175
I know they have

128
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,479
Like the face ID stuff where they can

129
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:42,879
Yeah I wish you could apply that to say to a delivery truck such as UPS FedEx Etc because it's always handy to know

130
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:47,743
When they pull up you can just come get them at the door that's just me or I get stuff delivered a lot too but

131
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:48,511
So like that

132
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,327
All right we're going to ask nest

133
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,607
Think about identifying

134
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:53,631
Track ID

135
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,935
Track ID

136
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:56,959
For all the gadgets

137
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:02,335
All six of us all right

138
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:04,383
They also are going to do a doorbell

139
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,151
Nest

140
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:06,175
Hello

141
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:10,271
Is the name of the doorbell it will also be Nest aware and have some of your face

142
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:12,319
Recognition the other thing is

143
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:14,111
As adorable so it's a little bit unique

144
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:16,927
It's going to be closer got a 4:3 aspect ratio

145
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,975
Which is kind of like the August doorbell

146
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:19,743
So

147
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:20,511
Up and down

148
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,815
As opposed to kind of the wide-angle that

149
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,351
News24 rain

150
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,375
Skybell in those guys

151
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:28,447
And I kind of like it looks nice on the phone and

152
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,727
You can see your packages

153
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,519
You can always do

154
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,079
Hypocrite in the wrong spot like right under the doorbell

155
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:40,479
Okay so the other thing about that that's interesting is those quick actions that they talked about it's a list of all

156
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:43,551
Options that you can have happened when the doorbell rang

157
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,319
Sole

158
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:50,463
In our case with the UPS man who does Rings it runs you know it might can have it say leave the package by the door

159
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,743
Are you going to be

160
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:52,767
Not your voice

161
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,047
But

162
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:57,119
Leave the package by the door

163
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,399
Human voice

164
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:00,191
It's like that

165
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:02,495
Spotify

166
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,799
Gotcha so that'll be

167
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:05,567
Excited

168
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,103
And that is going to be

169
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,383
Turtles are hard

170
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:09,407
Don't come out until

171
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,175
G1

172
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,991
So we'll see it at CES

173
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,015
Yeah

174
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,063
Yes

175
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,111
And finally the big exciting

176
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,135
Plicated crazy

177
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:20,671
Which is

178
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,719
The session border can

179
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,999
Stroller

180
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:24,767
Yes

181
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:25,791
So

182
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:28,095
This is the big news

183
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:30,655
But that's what it is

184
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,191
So this is Nest overalls

185
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,215
Security system

186
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:35,263
And we'll get into the features

187
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,567
You probably already read about those

188
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:39,103
But there's two elements here that

189
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:39,871
Really

190
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,919
Fighting one is the return of

191
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,199
Weave which is

192
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:45,247
Speakable protocol for

193
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,527
Device Communications

194
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:49,087
In home so like it'll be like hey

195
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:52,927
I would like I can turn on and off that's kind of what we've does every device

196
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:53,951
Can say what it does

197
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:54,719
Aunt

198
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:55,999
All the other devices

199
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:58,815
We know it's like

200
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,863
So the other piece of news

201
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:04,447
Is the other thing that Kevin is really excited about I don't

202
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,215
Blame him

203
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:07,007
Is there going to be the nest

204
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,031
Connect

205
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:10,847
Which is a device that's going to both.

206
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:11,871
Heater for light

207
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:12,895
Red

208
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:13,919
Stuff in your home

209
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,967
And thread is a nest

210
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:16,991
Designed

211
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:19,295
Protocol that actually is a wireless

212
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:20,319
Protocol

213
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,855
It's on par with like

214
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,647
Zigbee or Z-Wave

215
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,927
So it is a mesh Network

216
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,975
Dang it runs over the same radio actually that

217
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:27,743
Sopitas

218
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,047
Anyway

219
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,583
This thing also access

220
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,607
What is attacked at

221
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:33,887
I get the

222
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:37,215
Session border controller SBC

223
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:37,983
Indecision

224
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:42,591
Because what it could theoretically do if we're right

225
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:48,991
Session border controller skin kind of create or Bridge networks together that use in Enterprise and even when I carry

226
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:51,295
Facilities and what you could do is

227
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,831
Essentially have that

228
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:53,855
Secure

229
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:57,951
Iot Network kind of inside your regular home network with this

230
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:59,743
Again if we're understanding this correct

231
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:00,767
Yes

232
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:01,535
So

233
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,839
Lots of questions and actually next week

234
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:06,143
That writers of Nest will be here in the park

235
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,727
So this would be exciting it would add

236
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,519
A lot of security we think it

237
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:13,311
The most

238
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:16,383
Interesting news here because this real problem

239
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,943
Meeting is private.

240
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,991
Now this network

241
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,271
Weave

242
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:27,647
This is important for your security system because you know

243
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:29,695
But it helps keep it more tamper-proof

244
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,999
Hopefully but let's talk quickly about the

245
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:32,767
Security system

246
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,047
Cuz there's some things to like in a

247
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,375
Things I wish

248
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:39,935
So

249
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:40,703
Thirsty

250
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:41,727
It's $500

251
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:42,751
So this is actually

252
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,031
Reasonable price

253
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,823
For what is a

254
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:49,663
Hub 2 sensors and then to kind of presence detection pops

255
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:52,223
Sonus Calls the Heart but guard and

256
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:55,551
It has a motion sensor it has a siren on it

257
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:56,831
And it has

258
00:08:57,087 --> 00:09:00,159
So it works like an alarm system you come in and

259
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,951
Can't you punch in the keypad or

260
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,743
You can come in and use one of the

261
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:04,767
The presence of tag

262
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:08,351
Stacks and you wave it over it or you can disarm it

263
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:10,655
I kind of

264
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,679
I wanted something

265
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,263
Like my favorite feature in the entire world

266
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,031
Apple Smart Home

267
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:21,407
And I'm so sad no one else does it is netatmo has a facial recognition you can train it to recognize

268
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,175
People eater

269
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,455
And then

270
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:26,015
It arms itself at a certain point like you

271
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:28,831
Until it's 15 minutes after you don't see anyone in my family

272
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,879
Armed and so it automatically arms

273
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,695
I like it when someone come

274
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:36,511
If you want to disarm

275
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:39,071
And you can actually I believe say disarm

276
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:43,167
So you don't think that would be a fun

277
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,959
Option for the nest because then you don't have to

278
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,007
Wear something punch something or

279
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,287
Do something

280
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,591
Ennis

281
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:51,615
They have the camera

282
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:53,663
So I have to assume something like that

283
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,943
Could be updated

284
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:58,527
And then finally there's these Nest detect

285
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,807
Spencer's they're little

286
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,599
Multi sensors date

287
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,623
Door window

288
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:05,183
The clothes in the mail so act as a motion sensor

289
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,487
Pop it on your wall and it will be

290
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:10,047
Which is kind of unique thing

291
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,839
Most overdosed sensors in motion

292
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:12,863
Separate

293
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:19,007
And if you want to buy more of them you can they're $59 and then the tags that you have more than two people in your family

294
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:22,079
Starter pack comes with two you can buy more of those for

295
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:22,847
$25

296
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,919
These are also kind of like

297
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:26,687
Tiles in the sea

298
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,479
When you run out of battery on

299
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,391
So

300
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:36,927
That's all the News That's fit to

301
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,207
Or talk about

302
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:38,975
Unnest

303
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:40,767
Thoughts here are

304
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:42,559
I like this idea

305
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,327
Of

306
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,351
You know having this

307
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:46,399
Extender that also acts as like a

308
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,935
A bridge between your network

309
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,519
I feel like they cut it a little bit more innovative

310
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:53,055
Anna home security front

311
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:55,103
But maybe we're just going to wait and see

312
00:10:55,359 --> 00:11:01,503
It's a start I'm actually more excited because this is really in my opinion the first time since Google

313
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,039
Alphabet bought nest

314
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:08,415
That we've had a true integration between what Google currently offers and what Nest has

315
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,695
It's been a long time

316
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:11,999
As long time, cuz basically

317
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,791
All we saw that was that

318
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:16,607
Hey just always worked with your Google home

319
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,399
Google assist

320
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,423
Not always

321
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,447
It was one of the first

322
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,727
Innovations that was.

323
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,007
And I was being sent up there

324
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:30,175
So you're right that is good and I I also like that this is actually a very easy alarm system

325
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,711
Car security system

326
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,479
To build an a

327
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,247
Install

328
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:36,063
But also public cellular backup

329
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:40,415
Prices are details on that yet but cellular backup in a battery so

330
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:43,487
But it is still DIY so a lot of people might say

331
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:45,791
Oh that's cool I want to do that

332
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:47,583
And it kinda reminds me like a

333
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,911
Abode or less a SimpliSafe cuz I've got a monitor

334
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:54,239
This could have a manager component if you want it later

335
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:57,311
Nestos plan to introduce that at some point in future

336
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:00,895
So I don't know I feel like this is a pretty approachable way

337
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,431
To do security

338
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,455
Do people like Ark

339
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,735
Color last week actually

340
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,527
But

341
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,551
Best of them alone

342
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:12,159
We're going to see a lot more companies coming in with this ring is building an alarm system and

343
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,439
We also have

344
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:18,559
Comcast and their scheme of the existing alarm systems although ATT

345
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,327
Stopped with

346
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:20,607
Soap

347
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,887
I don't know what time

348
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:30,335
And we might have a alarm system from another company that we all know which I never to talk about a few minutes

349
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:33,151
Sexy saying we are

350
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:36,991
Yeah tell me

351
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,271
Don't keep me in suspense

352
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,039
Amazon

353
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,159
All right talk about that

354
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:49,279
Answer this news just hit this week and it is just a report in the financial times

355
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:52,863
That Amazon is reportedly making

356
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:53,887
Two things

357
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:56,447
1 is a pair of smart glasses with

358
00:12:56,703 --> 00:13:02,847
She shall not be named assistant built in

359
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:09,247
Apparently her camera glass did I kind of wish it will have a camera

360
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:15,647
Pictures more for scanning objects when I'm shopping I can just take a picture of something

361
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:18,719
What it is and tell me what the cheapest prices on Amazon

362
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:21,791
Security bit

363
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:25,631
The financial times says that Amazon's working at home security camera

364
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:27,935
It's Echo devices

365
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:32,031
So I don't know if they are reading into what the echo look does

366
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:36,383
Or they just have some good inside sources but it could be that

367
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,943
We have amazon security systems in the near future

368
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:43,295
So I have some thoughts about that because I actually

369
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:45,343
Use the Echo Show

370
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:48,415
Because I have these doorbells that work with it from August

371
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,695
I actually

372
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:54,047
Can see like I can see who's at my door on my show and then I can actually with her

373
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,071
See what's happening

374
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:03,775
So you can put your own system together now with Amazon as part of it but I'm wondering are they going to supply a hole

375
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:06,079
System and maybe even

376
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,871
Inexpensive monitoring system

377
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:10,175
Maybe because they actually have been

378
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:14,527
Show me the news at cedia was that they've been pressuring their Partners to really

379
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:16,063
Go all-in.

380
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:18,111
To get a madame a badge

381
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:21,183
You have you have to bring your

382
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:21,951
Camera stuff

383
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:22,975
Into

384
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:24,255
The show

385
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,023
So

386
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:25,791
That would it

387
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:26,815
Explain

388
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:27,839
Why they're soaked

389
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:28,607
Keen on that

390
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:30,911
Some of their partners are like really really I just

391
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:31,679
I want to

392
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,727
Just a plain old skill that says

393
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,799
I feel that does the things I wanted to I don't want to

394
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,079
Do the formal

395
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:38,847
Amazon

396
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:42,175
Programs it gets me this bad but now I kind of need a badge

397
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,199
Because I don't work

398
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,223
Work with the echo

399
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:46,783
Very interesting

400
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:49,087
So yeah if glasses are confusing to me

401
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:51,903
They sounds like glasses that act like the airpods

402
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,951
Because it's not going to have a screen or a camera

403
00:14:54,207 --> 00:15:00,351
Conduction speaker which is exactly what

404
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:07,007
Which was easy to hear and other people really couldn't hear it when they're around you so that's a way to get that assistant

405
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:11,615
Type information only into your brain and not out in the general conversation

406
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,639
Why not to

407
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,687
Maybe

408
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,527
Peapod's yes

409
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,623
Yeah yeah

410
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:23,647
Don't know

411
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:25,695
I mean yeah so what do you need glasses

412
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:33,631
Yes he that's kind of why I'm thinking maybe they do have a camera because what do they do today in the Amazon app you can scan

413
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,423
Items and it magically

414
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:40,031
You sees them and determines what it is and it returns

415
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:42,591
I think if you're going to have glasses I think you're going to have a

416
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:43,871
A camera just for that reason

417
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:46,175
Not to take pictures of people in space

418
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,455
Record things

419
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,479
Stop Chatham

420
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,759
But two

421
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,039
Get you to buy more stuff

422
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:52,063
From Amazon

423
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,855
That's always what it comes out to

424
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:56,159
And nobody should take pictures of themselves

425
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:56,927
Whippies

426
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:00,255
Let's talk now about

427
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,023
August

428
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:04,095
Everything's getting over shattered so much news

429
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,631
But August this week

430
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,399
Launched

431
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:08,447
New devices

432
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,471
And theater

433
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:11,775
Lovely devices I installed

434
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:13,311
One of them but doing really good

435
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:15,871
Play with it so next week I will tell you all about it

436
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:18,431
So the three things they added are a

437
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,479
Fancy 279

438
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:21,503
Smart Lock

439
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:22,527
Row

440
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:23,807
And that is

441
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,599
It's basically like the homekit

442
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,391
Smart Lock that they really

443
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,415
Lease last year

444
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,183
Siri

445
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:32,767
Google Assistant but it also has the August

446
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:36,351
And I think they were you triggered some things and then they

447
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:38,143
The big news is they added

448
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:38,911
Capability

449
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:39,935
Doorsense

450
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:40,959
So this

451
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:44,799
This has a sensor built into the Locking a sensor that comes separately that you stick on the door

452
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:47,103
Basically says hey is this door open

453
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,895
Closed cuz what happens is

454
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:49,663
What's some people say

455
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,991
They walk out the remotely enable the door lock

456
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:53,759
At the door

457
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:54,527
Is actually still

458
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,575
And there's actually no way

459
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:57,343
Tell that

460
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,111
Without

461
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,903
So you be like your walking around

462
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:00,671
All day

463
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:01,695
Your doors wide open

464
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:04,511
And that is a sad

465
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,303
So that is what August

466
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,071
Doorsense

467
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:07,839
Does

468
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:08,863
Yay

469
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,399
You'll know if your doors closed

470
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:15,007
I actually I run into this problem all the time because my daughter takes

471
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:18,591
A jar slightly just a little bit in the door lock

472
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:21,663
Can't get into its insertion point so and I don't know that

473
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,991
So that it is a problem for me but in your case

474
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,015
Just as it

475
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:26,783
Unlocked cell

476
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:28,575
It does

477
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:30,879
That's true if I go check that's correct

478
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:32,671
Now

479
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,207
I will say also

480
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,231
Tapered deadbolt

481
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:40,607
But there is more there is a noun

482
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,631
Cheaper smart

483
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:42,911
Is 149

484
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,215
That's going to replace

485
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:45,983
It's

486
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:46,751
Baidu

487
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:50,335
It's a bottom-line Smart Lock but that's what it is so

488
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:52,383
Entry-level thank you thank you

489
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,407
But it is

490
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,687
It is funky

491
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:56,735
This

492
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:58,783
I don't know how you just have to look at a pic

493
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:05,183
Picture it's funky looking it's not the Yves Behar designed around chunk it looks more like a traditional lock.

494
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,463
That goes over your door

495
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:07,743
Kind of big

496
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,535
Some people will like it some people want

497
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,815
As is the case in

498
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,351
So

499
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:14,143
It also will have doorsense

500
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,167
But it won't support hose

501
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:16,703
And then finally

502
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:17,727
The news

503
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,263
Did I am super

504
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,031
Super

505
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:23,871
Super excited about introduced another doorbell Cam and maybe this time

506
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,175
I don't have this

507
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,711
But I will get one

508
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,735
II

509
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:29,759
Did it comes out

510
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:30,527
Because I love

511
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:32,063
The look at the August doorbell

512
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:34,367
I liked a lot of the features but

513
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,391
It was a terrible

514
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:40,767
Two reasons one connectivity was always kind of an issue is very sensitive that way and it drew a lot of

515
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:42,303
Power so that's what

516
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,839
They say that they redone the

517
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:44,607
Antenna design

518
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:48,191
So the connectivity is better but they also have solved another problem

519
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:50,495
Which was they didn't actually put any sort of

520
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:51,263
Camera that can

521
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,031
Can see in the dark

522
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,823
So no IR no night vision

523
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:56,895
Hang on there so it when it's dark you can't actually see who's at your

524
00:18:57,151 --> 00:19:02,015
A lot of people may not have an issue with this because they're street lights and stuff and it does well in those situation

525
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:04,575
But now it has a flood like it holy cow

526
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:05,599
A floodlight looks

527
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:06,623
Peri-Peri

528
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,647
So that's

529
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:08,927
Adventure

530
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:15,327
I don't know if I wanted like black people in the face with light with a ring or doorbell

531
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,863
But we'll see

532
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:20,959
So I can't wait to test that and next week I'll tell you all about how

533
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:21,983
Deluxe work

534
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,007
Compared to the

535
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:26,335
So that is a lot of news

536
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:27,615
I feel

537
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:28,383
Bright Kevin

538
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:30,687
So let's move over into some of the

539
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:31,711
Quaker newspaper

540
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:34,783
Before getting to LT watches from Apple and

541
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,367
Ready Google home mini go

542
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:44,767
Google how many $49 is there in may hear about this on October 4th it looks like a small

543
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:51,167
Speaker just like you'd expect round, pill shape that would call it doesn't do anything different that we're going to

544
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:56,031
If you're into the Google home ecosystem and you don't want

545
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:58,335
Dad Echo dots you could add a Google home Mini

546
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:00,127
Perhaps after October 4th is my guess

547
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:01,151
Or

548
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,711
You can just wait till sometime in winter

549
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:05,503
Enable it on your fancy fancy camera

550
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:07,039
You can't have it

551
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:10,111
Silver Springs which is a

552
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,647
Smart grid startup

553
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:16,255
It's publicly traded company has been around for a really long time

554
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,535
They built

555
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,815
A smart grid system

556
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,095
In the early aughts

557
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,375
And they were bought

558
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:23,167
Buy itron

559
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,447
Interesting here

560
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:27,263
They were bought for 1625 per share

561
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:29,311
That was just a premium of 25%

562
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:30,847
Silver Springs

563
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:33,663
Its Revenue growth was not everything it should be

564
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,711
Its total value was eight hundred

565
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,735
30 million

566
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:38,783
And

567
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:39,807
Basically

568
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:42,879
Silver Spring was trying to transition from the smart grid into

569
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:44,415
Smart cities and Lighting

570
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:46,463
Itron is a

571
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,231
Company in the

572
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:47,999
Energy Spa

573
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:53,631
So you basically they do energy and water usage so they try to help

574
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:54,655
Utilities

575
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:56,703
Cities manage our resources

576
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:58,751
Sufficiently so this makes sense

577
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,543
It makes me feel like the Silver Springs

578
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,335
Smart cities efforts

579
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,359
When panning out

580
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:05,151
Or maybe itron is just going in

581
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:06,943
Big news

582
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:08,479
Finally

583
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:10,271
Comcast bought

584
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:11,551
Stringify

585
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:13,343
Comcast is not commenting

586
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,879
On the deal but

587
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:16,416
I got an email from

588
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:19,488
Subscriber user whatever the word is

589
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:20,512
And

590
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:22,560
I got an email and everything

591
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:26,912
So Comcast isn't talking about it

592
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:29,728
But basically stringify was a way to

593
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:30,496
Paul

594
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:31,264
Services

595
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,824
So many devices

596
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,128
Together for users in the

597
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,152
Idea was

598
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:38,688
Companies would also

599
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:39,968
Payit2

600
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:40,992
Get there

601
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:42,016
Connected device

602
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:44,320
Together so I'm not sure what this is

603
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:47,392
Really a consumer-focused thing for Comcast or if this is

604
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:49,696
Part of like they're bigger business leanings

605
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:50,976
Cuz they got their machine

606
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:51,744
Two kind of

607
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:56,352
Offerings so that's what I'm actually looking forward to hearing about when they start

608
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:57,376
Which

609
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:58,400
They are not

610
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,168
Cuz I did not

611
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,192
To my request

612
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:03,520
I know these guys have in common

613
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:06,592
And we probably don't know the answer to this book stringified today is a

614
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:08,896
Free product for consumers to use right

615
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,736
Yeah my guess is we're going to find out very soon that it's not

616
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,272
So

617
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:15,552
Now that we've been through

618
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:16,320
Most of them

619
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:29,888
Yeah so I think last time we said or I said I was considering purchasing one and I can

620
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:31,424
Tell people now that I did

621
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:37,824
It's not here yet they will be here in time for the next show so I'll be able to discuss my thoughts on that I do have an Apple Watch series 2

622
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,360
So really this is just

623
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:45,248
Newer Hardware inside obviously LTE connection the reviews are hitting

624
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:51,648
I've already hit and I read through most of them and it seems like there are a fair number of issues probably the most negative Apple

625
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:54,464
Product reviews I've read amongst everyone

626
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,536
Reviews and total in probably forever quite honestly

627
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:03,936
Lots of challenges that are even appears to be an issue that apple is admitted to wear the watch is trying to connect to unknown

628
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:05,728
Wifi networks

629
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:07,776
And it will drop its LTE connection

630
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:11,360
And they are going to address any software update is what they say so there I would you to make rice

631
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,320
What LTE and any wearable is really

632
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,856
For because

633
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:23,648
All of the reviews have just gone

634
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:25,184
Off about the battery life when your

635
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:25,952
Talking

636
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:30,304
Making phone calls with this in lieu of your phone and I get that but

637
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:32,864
You have a much smaller battery than you would have been

638
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,912
Pinterest with this watch

639
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:38,752
An hour of talk time is not good this should not be a primary phone for anybody

640
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:40,800
It's a secondary phone device at

641
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:43,872
Best and I think people need to really understand that

642
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:47,200
The way apple is doing this from

643
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:51,040
Apple watches connected to your phone via Bluetooth it's going to use that connection

644
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:57,440
If it's not in Bluetooth range of a phone but it has more power

645
00:23:57,696 --> 00:24:00,256
If it's not near your phone at all minis left the phone at home

646
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:06,656
Which is what most people try and do it this thing people then go up to the highest power connection that is LTE

647
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:09,984
Switching between connections here but don't think

648
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,080
That you're going to put your phone down at the house and walk out of the house for 8 hours and you're going to be

649
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:20,480
Fine just like you had your phone with you cuz that's not the case so I just one thing I want to point out with all these reviews I think they're all well worth reading

650
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:22,528
I think they're legitimate issues but I also think

651
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:23,552
You have to either

652
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:29,440
You got manager connections are going to manage your expectations so it's just a thought before I get my watch will see how it actually works when I get

653
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,768
Vintager connections

654
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:36,864
Can we trademark

655
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,400
Try

656
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:39,168
Alright

657
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:40,448
Now

658
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:41,472
Let's go

659
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:43,776
To the hotline

660
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:49,152
Would you like to remind people of the hotline where we will solve your pressing iot issues or

661
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:50,944
We will admit to Battlement

662
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:53,248
Because not every issue can be solved

663
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:57,600
I will try all you have to do is call and leave a voicemail at 5 1/2

664
00:24:57,856 --> 00:25:00,160
623-7424

665
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,184
Shut up

666
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,232
And this week's voicemail is from Bruce

667
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:04,256
Santa Fe

668
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:05,792
Stacy and Kevin

669
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:06,560
Hi this is

670
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:07,840
Spruce in Santa Fe

671
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:09,376
You can use this on

672
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:10,144
Broadcast

673
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,936
If you like my question is this

674
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:15,264
Moved into a new non-automated house

675
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,824
Adding Hue bulbs and

676
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,104
Things like that over the course of

677
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,640
Is that drive up in

678
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:21,408
Evening

679
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,200
Hit my garage door open

680
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:25,248
It seems to me that I had to be able to

681
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,272
Homelink

682
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:27,552
Italian pie

683
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:28,320
Hue bulbs in

684
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:30,624
Turn on my lights near the garage in

685
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:31,904
Dali courtyard

686
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:34,720
Make my travels that much easier if

687
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,512
As we get into fall and winter

688
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,048
The Dark Knight

689
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:39,072
I need your help

690
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:40,352
And I hope you have a great aunt

691
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:41,120
Thanks so much

692
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:42,400
Oh

693
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:43,936
Reus we have

694
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:45,216
Options for youth

695
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:46,752
Exciting

696
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:47,776
And they're not

697
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:48,800
Credibly

698
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:50,592
Except for Spencer

699
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,944
Yellow realtor

700
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:56,224
Relatively

701
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:58,272
So basically you want

702
00:25:58,528 --> 00:25:59,040
In need

703
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:00,064
Ewe

704
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,624
To see if your garage door is open and closed

705
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,232
And your luck because I have exactly what you want already set up in my house and it works like a

706
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,512
Charm and I love it

707
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:09,536
But I did have to buy some

708
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:12,352
So I don't mind with the Chamberlain MyQ

709
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:15,936
And we actually recently talked about it because they're starting a program

710
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:17,472
With it we're

711
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:20,288
You have to buy the device and its $99 ish

712
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:26,688
Sometimes I see it for a little bit more sometimes I see it for Less so you buy this device you install it and what it does

713
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:32,064
Tells you if your garage door is open or closed and there's an app that will open and close it for you

714
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,392
So it's very nice I had a little reminder setup so after

715
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:38,464
15 minutes of my garage door is open I get a notification on my phone

716
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:42,304
Shut it

717
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,632
So you need that

718
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:46,912
It won't interfere with Homelink

719
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:48,448
Because I have that on my car too

720
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:49,472
And that will act

721
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:50,496
As a trigger

722
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:52,288
Here's where you have two options

723
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,872
I have set mine up and had my running for over a year

724
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:57,152
On the wink hub

725
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:58,944
In the wink Hub works with Chamberlain

726
00:26:59,456 --> 00:26:59,968
And

727
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:06,368
The only caveat I have there is Wink recently changed ownership and we're not really sure how long that's going to last

728
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,904
They're not expensive

729
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,952
So if you buy the wink hub

730
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:12,256
You set up they called a robot it's like a

731
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:13,280
And

732
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:16,608
I have connected mine to actually my front porch lights in

733
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:17,888
The robot says

734
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:18,912
If the garage

735
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,192
Store open

736
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:21,472
After

737
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:22,240
Dark

738
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,264
And there's a sunrise Sun

739
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,056
Set option so after Dark

740
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,336
During these times

741
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:28,384
It's 30 minutes after sunset

742
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,408
Till sunrise

743
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,688
Turn on

744
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:31,456
Porch lights

745
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:33,760
Neither Lutron enabled lights but it would work with

746
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:34,784
Hue Lights

747
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,552
Whatever else

748
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:38,112
Wink so that's how I've done it

749
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:41,184
Now they also recently did this affect integration

750
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,976
So for a dollar a month

751
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:44,512
Or $10 a year you can

752
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:49,120
Control your Chamberlain

753
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:50,656
So

754
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:55,264
It's a way to connect to the MyQ to other things in your house and then

755
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:56,800
Yeah and then you won't by the way

756
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:58,080
You won't need that

757
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:59,360
But you will pay $10

758
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:01,152
To keep them

759
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:03,200
So I don't wake up by the wake up

760
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:07,296
Yeah I did

761
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:13,696
You just get so much more flexibility cuz now you can truly said he doesn't have a smart home if you think you want to get into the Smart Home

762
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:17,792
And eventually add more things get The Hub and that way you can just keep adding to your heart's content

763
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:20,608
And I can see wink hubs

764
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:23,168
They're on sale for like 60 bucks

765
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,704
You can buy one used

766
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,032
Original version

767
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,080
So

768
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:34,176
You know it another thought if we're going to go down this wink Hub pass or Bruce

769
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:36,480
Could he just get an inexpensive

770
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:37,248
Sensor

771
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:39,552
Like a door open sensor and use that

772
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:40,576
For the garage door

773
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:42,112
The challenge is

774
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:42,880
So you

775
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:45,184
But you won't know if it's open or closed

776
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,464
There's some logic

777
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:49,280
The Chamberlain knows if it's open or closed

778
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:50,304
So

779
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,328
Well if it's magnetic

780
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,936
You have one piece yet one piece on the wall one piece on the door that's not far or less

781
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:59,008
Expensive way to go like a Z-Wave door sensor

782
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:02,592
Okay so you could do that but then you got to think it was so here's the thing.

783
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:03,872
You got to think about whether

784
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:07,712
So thinking about weather and then you also have to think about

785
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:10,784
Usually Those sensors because their battery powered they're going to rain

786
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,088
Stickney or Z-Wave your garage is

787
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:14,880
Kind of far out if you don't have other

788
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:19,232
Take me to Z-Wave devices on the network you're going to want your wink Hub to be pretty close to it

789
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:20,000
Correct

790
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:21,024
I would worry about

791
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:21,792
Weather

792
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:27,424
This is something that

793
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,216
I've looked at in there at their other ways

794
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:31,776
To do this there fancier ways that involve

795
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:33,056
Programming

796
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:34,336
People if you Google

797
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:35,616
Connected garage

798
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:37,152
Store UK

799
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:38,432
Arduino zener

800
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:39,200
You can do some crazy

801
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:41,760
So you're right this is by no means

802
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:42,528
The only way

803
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,552
This is one

804
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:46,624
Bruce

805
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,648
Pick your level of

806
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:51,232
That is it

807
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:53,280
Sweet show

808
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:54,560
We are going to take a break for

809
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:55,328
A word from our

810
00:29:55,584 --> 00:30:00,448
Car sponsor and then after that we're going to have Rob Tiffany the CEO of

811
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:01,472
Itachi's

812
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:02,496
Ramada Plaza

813
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:04,800
Talking about the creation of a new

814
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:05,824
Company called band

815
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,104
Aura and

816
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:11,200
We get into the industrial but for those who are interested in that what's going to happen

817
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:17,600
With the industrial iot it's going to be a good in stay tuned everyone we are breaking into the internet

818
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:24,000
Better things podcast with a message from our sponsor

819
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:28,608
Shrek is a digital identity management

820
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:30,144
For talking about

821
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,168
Edge security

822
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:32,704
So can you explain

823
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,728
What the problem

824
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:34,496
Is here

825
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:40,896
Two interconnected world where we make business decisions based on data that comes from devices or device

826
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:46,784
Vices make decision based on data that comes from other devices we really need to establish trust in these devices

827
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,576
Whether it's at the humans Trust

828
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:54,976
The data is coming from the device is authentic that the data has not been tampered with or that device is also Trust

829
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:58,304
The date of that I was coming from each other so in order to establish Trust

830
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,072
Devices

831
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:00,352
We have to have a

832
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:02,912
Picture process that establishes an identity

833
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:07,008
Can be used and trusted by all different players in the ecosystem

834
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:10,080
All right so can you tell us what forgerock is doing

835
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:11,616
Help securities iot

836
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:19,296
So there's two main pieces in our new Ford Rockledge security offering is coming up later this fall the first one is called the I dunno

837
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:20,320
The Edge controller

838
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:22,112
And if you think about what

839
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:23,904
People need to do to establish Trust

840
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,720
Online or evening person there's different levels of trust

841
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:33,120
For example you trust a passport more than you trust a driver's license but you trust more than a year lanyard that you

842
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:34,144
You get out of conference

843
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,448
What you need to provide your driver's license to get

844
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:42,336
Versus a business card that anyone can have printed up so those are examples of credentials that provide different levels of

845
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:45,408
Insurance for humans super devices they also need

846
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:47,456
Those credentials and different devices

847
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:49,504
Different levels of a shirt

848
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,600
But you need to be sure that if you have a solution that you can get that highest

849
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:57,440
Level of assurance and Trust in the device like the passport level

850
00:31:57,696 --> 00:32:03,840
Security in a nutshell the identity Edge controller provides process and technology and software that allows

851
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:09,472
Devices to establish that high level of trust or lower levels of trust depending on what these cases

852
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:10,240
So weird

853
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:12,288
Sending our platform

854
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:14,080
And the code that runs our platform

855
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:16,896
You also run on edge devices to help

856
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:23,296
Establish trusted device identities course then credentials authentication and authorization for devices which

857
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:24,064
Also help

858
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:26,880
Ashley this is great

859
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:29,696
So where can I learn more about forgerock in it

860
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:34,560
A Dracula for drug.com or we've got a whole page that decayed Tourette's

861
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:38,912
Security where you can look at case studies and even see a link to a recent webinar about the

862
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:39,680
This very subject

863
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:55,040
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your house Stacy Higginbotham of it and today's guest is rough

864
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:59,648
Tiffany who is the CTO and Global product manager for the LaMotta iot

865
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:00,672
Platform at

866
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:02,720
Tai Chi hi Rob how you doing

867
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:05,024
Hey Stacy how are you

868
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,328
Excellent so we're here because

869
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:09,376
Itachi this week unveiled

870
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:11,680
A major industrial iot initiative

871
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:15,520
That was a little weird about this as we are recording it before the unveiling

872
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:17,056
If we don't actually know what it's called

873
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:18,848
But by the time this publishes

874
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:19,616
You will know what is

875
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:20,896
But everything else

876
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:21,664
Is going to stay the same

877
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,432
So

878
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:23,968
Let's talk about

879
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:25,248
Why Hitachi

880
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,272
It's doing this

881
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,088
Sure so Itachi

882
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:35,488
As you know one of the major yeah there's only a handful of really giant Global industrial conglomerates you know they make bullet train

883
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:37,536
Windmill turbines

884
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:38,816
Giant mining trucks

885
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:45,472
Factory machines all that kind of fun stuff has been around for like over a hundred and six years in that.

886
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:48,288
Space building all this stuff but also Itachi

887
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:49,312
He's been at the it

888
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:50,080
T space

889
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:51,872
Or like 57

890
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:53,920
Urine stay actually made bed frame

891
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,968
So there is at lineage

892
00:33:56,224 --> 00:34:02,368
Actual legit it and OT experience for a woman long time

893
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:04,928
I believe the sinking is while it's great to

894
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:07,488
Made it this far for over a hundred years

895
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:09,536
Being a big Industrial conglomerates

896
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,352
The sinking is moving forward into the future

897
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:13,888
It's going to be harder and harder to

898
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:15,168
Survived another Hunter

899
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:17,216
Years without a large tibbitts

900
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:18,752
Coyote

901
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:20,032
IAAI

902
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:23,872
To get more value out of the Machinery that we're selling to our house

903
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:29,248
So Hitachi is really looking to the Future and it sees an existential threat

904
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:34,112
We mentioned earlier some things businesses might fall away

905
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:35,648
Some of the storage option

906
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,952
You guys have

907
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:43,328
So what kind of challenges do you guys see specifically as a threat to

908
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,096
The way that

909
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:45,376
Business operates

910
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:46,912
Or what it sells today

911
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:53,568
Sure I think in a big way so I just kind of generically think of all the type of heavy equipment and stuff does Itachi make

912
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,128
Picture of Japan think of Germany

913
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:58,176
Ultra high-end

914
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:01,504
High quality product but more expensive labor forces

915
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,272
Covington

916
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:03,808
Compete against lower-cost

917
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:04,576
Equipment

918
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:07,136
Machinery coming from China right and as

919
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:08,160
You start adding

920
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:14,560
Machine learning and Ai and you instruments all that equipment the threat I would say the threat is

921
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:15,328
Is good enough

922
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:18,144
Machinery or equipment and lower-cost

923
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,168
And so

924
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:24,032
How do you differentiate yourself how do you make your equipment more valuable than

925
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,056
Brand X

926
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:25,824
Right

927
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:29,920
And so what can you do with software and all of our experience

928
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:33,760
And ML and AI to create a differentiator

929
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:39,648
Hitachi equipment across the border

930
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:46,304
And it launched its own predix platform it started internal

931
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:50,656
Equipment

932
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:51,424
Those

933
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,496
To start building this canal software-based

934
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:55,520
Asset in terms of

935
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:57,056
Predictive failure

936
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:01,408
Guess to what Hitachi

937
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:03,456
Absolutely

938
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:07,296
And it's not like this is new to Itachi

939
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:10,368
Play like a lots of big companies Itachi has been

940
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:12,928
Manufacturing instrumented equipment

941
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:17,024
Three years you know what their own microcontroller reason sending Telemetry but

942
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,632
Is there probably well aware if you think of the forerunners to iot things like machines

943
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:22,912
Machine in the bed stuff

944
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:24,448
Going on for a long time

945
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:25,728
Siloed

946
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:29,312
Orbitz airline to different business units or product line

947
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:33,408
Sometimes everybody's got their own thing so how to do this is not new

948
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:39,808
Since you been doing it for so long to try to get all of the touchy machinery and then ultimately external machinery and you're right

949
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,088
Very analogous

950
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:42,368
Say what Jesus has done

951
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:44,672
All right we're going to get to that

952
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:46,976
First I want to bring up

953
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:48,512
Conceptual challenge

954
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,304
In the industrialized

955
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:52,352
Just actually

956
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:54,912
Scale back some of its Ambitions around

957
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:02,848
Going to work with

958
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:06,688
Just a few months ago it basically said

959
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:11,296
Hey you know how we're going to do all Industrial

960
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:13,088
3 core areas where

961
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:13,856
We've already got

962
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:15,648
Customer said that was

963
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:16,416
Energy

964
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:17,696
And I am forgetting

965
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:21,280
Especially the industry's took this and said hey

966
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:26,656
It's really hard to do industrial iot well across a huge swath of Industries

967
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:27,936
Redis doesn't scale

968
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:30,240
And so I'm curious if you guys are

969
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:31,264
Looking at that

970
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,544
Insane oh

971
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:38,176
Should we take a lesson from there or do you have technology or something that you think actually changes that equation

972
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,480
I think we have a lot of humility

973
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:41,504
Hitachi

974
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:46,624
Every know in advance that animated generic sense trying to be all things to everyone

975
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:51,488
Usually leads to failure at this whole order and so we didn't have such ambitions

976
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:53,024
Even though our

977
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,304
Portfolio products

978
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,840
Renee is very similar

979
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:58,656
GE makes and what Siemens make

980
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:00,192
We had no designs

981
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:05,312
To try to just overnight go and have a platform and tackle and try to support everything we do

982
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:07,872
So I think we're taking things with simpler

983
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:12,480
Steps even if you think of we're only going to do what we know it's still too much

984
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:16,064
Okay and what are the industries are going to focus on first

985
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,088
You know how

986
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:18,112
Peyote

987
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:21,440
In general people think of kind of broad use cases

988
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:23,232
Besides several specific ones

989
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:27,072
Play Bunny

990
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:31,168
Score better customer service just really generic

991
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:35,520
I didn't even hear people say and I'm going to change my business model

992
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:39,360
And I'm going to transfer my business and other sound really flowering it

993
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:40,384
Ambiguous

994
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:44,480
But a specific instance of that transforming

995
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:46,528
Model has to do with our bullet train

996
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:50,112
I'll tell you the story about what's going on in the UK

997
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:51,136
How does time zones

998
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:59,328
Perspectives Nevada is not just some iot platform that stretches out everything we're doing so it's the machine

999
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:04,192
Together to make sure we have a good holistic

1000
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:09,312
We make bullet train Japan

1001
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,176
You play never seen a Japanese

1002
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,784
You know if you're writing on the page a baby in France or you're in ice

1003
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:23,136
Something like that

1004
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:24,416
UK government

1005
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:30,048
Has all these Intercity trains going all over the country in as you can imagine if you ridden on some of them

1006
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:32,352
They've been around for a while and they like some new one

1007
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:33,376
They like to replace

1008
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:40,544
Entities that want to replace something they say ever inducted in our feet and get people to put in proposals

1009
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:44,896
Tens of billions

1010
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:51,296
Pounce in this case to do that it's an expensive tall order and so you can imagine all The Usual Suspects showing up

1011
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,856
And yes I'll be happy to.

1012
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:54,624
Things for you

1013
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:57,184
So he who has no presents

1014
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,464
And Europe showed up

1015
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,000
What the different kind of proposal

1016
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:01,024
Which composer

1017
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,560
Trains as a service

1018
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:05,632
Instead because we're putting our money where our mouth is

1019
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:06,912
We Believe

1020
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:09,472
Are trains with tens of thousands

1021
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:10,240
Sensors

1022
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:16,640
And our LaMotta Telemetry you know our acquisition of telemetry being able to do stuff and rml and Rai

1023
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:17,408
Find systems

1024
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:18,432
Well enough

1025
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:19,712
We're going to take that risk

1026
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:21,504
So our proposal was

1027
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:23,040
You don't have to pay it's anything

1028
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:26,368
You're going to do train social service and working to build these trains for you

1029
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:29,696
And then you're going to start using them and we're going to have to hit your SLA

1030
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:32,256
Pay-as-you-go

1031
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:33,792
Would be really attractive

1032
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:40,192
To any governments are next who's looking at having to pay tens of billions of dollars or pounds are you

1033
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,520
To have someone show up

1034
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:46,592
You know what on our time and that's taking out risk

1035
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:48,128
We will build these trains

1036
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:49,152
In advance

1037
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:51,712
And we will deliver them to you and then you'll just start

1038
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:52,736
Paint as you go

1039
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:53,504
Wow

1040
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:59,648
So actually these trains are operational and you guys are delivering them as a service today or they are about to be

1041
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,720
Operational I think there's already some trains are running now

1042
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:05,536
So now let's talk about some of the technology

1043
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:09,120
So you guys are creating a new company new name

1044
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:14,496
And talk to me about what assets you're sticking under that new company to kind of help

1045
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:15,520
With

1046
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:16,288
This whole

1047
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:19,104
Delivering things as a service enabling Iowa

1048
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:20,640
Across your bows

1049
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:23,456
That certainly includes assets

1050
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:29,856
Itachi inside group that has been building LaMotta and again when I say building alibata ITP

1051
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:30,624
Platform

1052
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,928
It's not like we're just figuring it out from

1053
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:34,464
Scratch we're going around

1054
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:40,864
I thought you were decades event am experiencing analytics and pulling the best stuff together to make this reality so

1055
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:41,632
Spotlights

1056
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,192
Something came off the top of her head

1057
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:44,960
It's

1058
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:47,520
Pentaho which is Analytics

1059
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:53,663
Machine learning Big Data company we acquired a few years ago that does a great job of

1060
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:55,455
Enterprise Integration

1061
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:58,015
Hundreds of connectors to connect to any kind of

1062
00:41:58,271 --> 00:42:02,111
Back-end system the customer have you have databases

1063
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:05,695
Components of our storage business

1064
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:07,487
Hitachi make

1065
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:08,767
Really high-end

1066
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:09,535
Storage

1067
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:10,815
Computer systems

1068
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:12,351
Battle still be apart of this

1069
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:14,399
And so you know we'll be delivering to

1070
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:16,959
Hyper-converged solution

1071
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:18,751
Where to pre-configure

1072
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:22,335
Giant stack of ultra high-end servers and terabytes

1073
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:23,103
Storage

1074
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:25,919
And I'll demonic platform in pentaho and all that

1075
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:28,735
Technology already to go where customers

1076
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:31,039
Get up and running in the industrial Spain

1077
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:32,575
Unlike the consumer space

1078
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:34,111
You talk to people all the time

1079
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:35,391
Are they tell you hey

1080
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:39,743
The day that doesn't leave my factory or can't leave my plant and it's not always

1081
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:43,839
For the reasons like I'm afraid of the cloud or I'm worried about shaqiri

1082
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:45,631
Sometimes it's just practical reason

1083
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:47,167
You to imagine a lot of

1084
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:48,191
Industrial settings

1085
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:51,775
Putting off terabytes of data each day

1086
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:53,567
Baby shower and sometimes

1087
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:56,383
It's just not practical to try to ship all that data to it

1088
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:58,943
Sometimes not even practical to do so

1089
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:01,503
Some kind of hybrid

1090
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:03,295
Sometimes everything needs to be

1091
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:04,575
Right there on Crown

1092
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:05,855
And sometimes I'm not

1093
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:07,903
Just talking about

1094
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:15,327
Cuz they want that like clothes into the factory or a power plant or whatever 2.2 meet the customer where they are

1095
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:21,215
So that one friend storage stuff comes in there we've got the stick called Foundry

1096
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:23,007
That is the underpinning of

1097
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:25,567
Connect to servers

1098
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:30,431
Text software that we build that makes our technology easy to be portable as far as other part that

1099
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:32,735
This new company was lots of it in Japan

1100
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:33,503
Factory

1101
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:37,087
Easter part of that there's all kinds of data science organization

1102
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:39,903
Better part of it I think we have all the right pieces

1103
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:41,183
Inside the center

1104
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:43,231
To drive us forward

1105
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:44,767
You know in a meaningful way

1106
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:47,839
Let's go back to this R&D component

1107
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:49,119
So looking forward

1108
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:55,519
After this new companies creation what kind of cool things is Hitachi working on that could be pulled into this that

1109
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:56,543
We want to look forward

1110
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:57,823
Certainly

1111
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,127
No one to talk about people making a difference

1112
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:01,919
It's the data scientist

1113
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:03,711
And it's the domain experts

1114
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:09,343
Whenever you for a particular piece of Machinery you want to build some ml models

1115
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:10,111
Around

1116
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:13,695
Cricket cellular analytics are remaining useful life or whatever it happens

1117
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:14,975
Has to be you have to have

1118
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:18,559
Two types of people there you have to have the Domain expert at that

1119
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:21,887
Your type of machinery and those every last thing about it.

1120
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:23,679
Theme parks in USA

1121
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:25,215
You know actual data scientist

1122
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:27,007
You're going to pick the algorithms you're going to

1123
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:30,591
Create a model train the model and work on that to get that

1124
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:31,359
Just wright

1125
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:34,175
And that's no easy task and see if the right people

1126
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:34,943
Do that

1127
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:36,991
Imagine we've got those

1128
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:38,527
People here already

1129
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:40,319
They can make that a reality

1130
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:41,087
For us

1131
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:43,135
Having that know-how and not just hoping

1132
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:45,439
But a customer has some of it is a big thing

1133
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:49,023
