Kevin tofel

We have an amazing show for you today we're going to talk a lot about the Google home

6
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:23,296
After a life-changing experience

7
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:27,392
CES we're going to be talking about blockchain in a couple different ways

8
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:28,928
One shipping to

9
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:29,696
Newchip

10
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:36,608
And then we got a bunch of fun news items for you including what happens to stringify and deposition

11
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:39,936
My BMW and a wireless module that

12
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:41,728
Years

13
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:46,336
We also have a message from a brand new sponsor pointcentral and our guest this week

14
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:47,616
Is Chad

15
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:51,456
Sharma who is an awesome tell, and a list

16
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:56,064
We talked both about what happens with 5G and low-power wide area network

17
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,088
And

18
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:59,136
We talked about how to regulate

19
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:00,160
Companies

20
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:04,256
When data is the new oil so you're going to want to stick around for some

21
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:05,792
What is a life-changing

22
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:06,560
Thoughts there

23
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:08,608
Now let's go to another

24
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:09,632
One of our sponsors

25
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:12,448
This week sponsor is CBT Nuggets

26
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:18,848
How does the iot change the way we do business for many organizations it means a proliferation of devices and tools

27
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:22,944
In every device connecting to your network is another potential vulnerability

28
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:29,344
You may think that your greatest security threat as a malicious hacker but what if it's really an unsecured smartwatch

29
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,624
Someone on your team

30
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,464
But if everyone on your team is trained and security best practices

31
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,304
It significantly reduces your chance of a data breach or the severity of the

32
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,704
CBT Nuggets is going to talk training choice for it Professionals for decades and now they're making that same

00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:58,272
Go to CBT Nuggets. IO to find out more about how end-user security training

36
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,296
Protect your network

37
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:00,576
In the internet

38
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:01,600
Thanks

39
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:05,440
Okay

40
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:06,720
I didn't get the

41
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:08,000
Did you

42
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:11,840
No this is one of the first times that I did not get sick

43
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:12,608
From

44
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:13,632
CES which is

45
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:17,728
Nearly impossible to avoid because you have all those people in

46
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:21,568
Confined spaces for days upon days upon days

47
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,360
No no honey I'm good

48
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,128
Yeah

49
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:24,896
So

50
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:25,664
I feel like

51
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:27,200
Will be struck down with something

52
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,736
Ten times worse

53
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,272
But I'm really excited

54
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:31,552
I got back

55
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:33,344
I was tired so I didn't do this yet

56
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,160
After seeing everything happening

57
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:36,928
With voice

58
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:37,696
It CS

59
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:39,232
I realized it

60
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:42,560
I should probably switch over to using Google home

61
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,096
Instead of Madam

62
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:48,192
So my family is going to kill me but I am switching over

63
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,472
Because

64
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:51,776
I tested out a couple of the

65
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,568
I have been testing out

66
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:54,848
Google related

67
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:56,640
Integrations and they work

68
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,920
Really well in

69
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:00,224
Just Google is so much better than madame

70
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:02,016
When it comes to answering

71
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,552
When it called the big question

72
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:08,672
Yes yes and it's really ironic that you bring this up

73
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:10,976
Because and we did not coordinate this

74
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,280
I'm actually doing the same thing

75
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,840
You know the one place that Google falls down

76
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,120
Amazon music

77
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:19,424
So a couple of my rooms

78
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,192
Can Aleve

79
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:25,056
Echo in like my daughter because she plays music all the time Google is

80
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,080
Terrible

81
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:30,176
When it comes to it like I asked for a song it almost always gives me the

82
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:30,944
Karaoke

83
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,480
I don't know why

84
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:37,088
It just it always gives me the wackiest version of the song I wanted to

85
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:37,856
Play so

86
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:40,416
That is one place where I'm like nope I can't

87
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,184
I can't rely on

88
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:44,000
In your Google Maps history do you have like a

89
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:47,072
Series of searches for karaoke bar

90
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:53,472
That's really odd but and it's funny cuz I thought you're going to say something else about music I agree with you that the music is where it falls down

91
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:56,800
For the most part there's another variable probably talk about it

92
00:03:57,056 --> 00:04:00,128
You're very limited music choices to set

93
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:02,176
As your you know to link rather

94
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:04,480
Nature Google play music person

95
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,248
Yeah you're good

96
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,016
But

97
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,040
I'm Apple music

98
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,064
So Spotify

99
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:10,624
6 weird songs

100
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:13,696
It's

101
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,024
So in my default settings

102
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:17,791
It's just

103
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:19,327
Google's brain just

104
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,631
Maybe Google just feels like I should be

105
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:25,215
Maybe I hear you singing on the show I don't know

106
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,495
I do have it in my bath

107
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:32,383
Could be could be

108
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:38,015
Falls down for me a little bit still in the smart home area but it has gotten better like in October

109
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,295
They added support

110
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:42,879
In Google Assistant which we didn't transfer over to Google home

111
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,671
For Canary integration

112
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:46,463
I'm having problems setting it up

113
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,999
Probably on my end I don't know

114
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,535
They recently added

115
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,303
Sbarro

116
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:56,703
Fathers that come up recently been at it since they haven't quite caught up to Amazon in the terms of those integration

117
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:58,751
But they're getting much closer for me

118
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,055
Yes so I'm going to use my Google home

119
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,591
It's moving out of the master bathroom

120
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,639
It's moving into

121
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,407
Bedroom

122
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,687
And then actually

123
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:09,503
The Google home will move downstairs to the kitchen

124
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:10,527
And then

125
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,319
Google mini

126
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,343
Will move

127
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,367
Into the bedroom

128
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,391
Replacing an echo

129
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:18,463
Yeah see you're in a better spot than I am because

130
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,999
I only have

131
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:26,399
A Google home and everything else is an echo device so I would have to be replacing with some Minis and things and I just I want to get the

132
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,679
Lenovo smart

133
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:29,215
Screen that has

134
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:33,055
Google home integration

135
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,335
For the smaller and

136
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:36,383
Correct

137
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:42,527
I'll wait for that but I'll probably in a couple minutes and unfortunately they're not $29 anymore they're back up to $49 so

138
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,551
I swear

139
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,087
Just walk in

140
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:49,695
Sign up for the New York Times you got it

141
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,975
I see the free mini

142
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,535
Yeah but they usually with things I don't need

143
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,839
I already have that Supply have any Kobe

144
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:59,935
Not that don't figure that part again you're better place from it

145
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:06,335
And as far as going back to the music for singing I'll still stick with the Sonos Play 1 with the matinee

146
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,871
Integration for now

147
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,663
Because I also works with it

148
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,967
Music services that I love you so

149
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:15,551
Show control music but Google home will do everything else is my thought

150
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:20,159
Well there's an opportunity because Google has now hooked up with yonomi

151
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,183
Which

152
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:21,951
Is

153
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:22,975
One of my favorites

154
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:25,791
All-time favorite apps they actually just got 5 million last week

155
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:31,679
Not for their smart home stuff but because they have this really awesome architecture that lowers the cost of

156
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:36,287
Devices of supporting connected devices so on the backend so companies

157
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,055
Like

158
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:37,823
Sonos

159
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,847
Can look at

160
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,383
You know me is cloud

161
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,199
And be like oh it's so much easier to operate

162
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:43,967
Yay

163
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:49,087
The cool thing is with Google being integrated with

164
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:49,855
You know me

165
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,903
Yonomi control Sonos stuff

166
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:54,207
And it actually does a really good job I've had it

167
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,999
Controlling my son has stuff for a while

168
00:06:57,535 --> 00:07:00,351
You can't get it to play a particular song on

169
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,119
On the Sonos

170
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:02,911
Which is better outside

171
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:09,311
Whether you got that's all I need because I tune into channels typically like on XM

172
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,335
Serious

173
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,615
Satellite for example

174
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:15,455
So I can already set that as a favorite in Sonos app so I should be good

175
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:18,783
Yeah so like if I'm looking it allows you to play favorite

176
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,319
Or play a playlist

177
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:21,599
You can also have

178
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:22,623
It tell you things

179
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,671
Can make your own text

180
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,487
Welcome to study law.

181
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:28,767
How may I ask

182
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,071
That's actually pretty scared

183
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:36,191
So all of those things you can do volume mute unmute

184
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:36,959
Next

185
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:37,727
Previous

186
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,519
Play and pause so those are all the commands

187
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:41,567
And

188
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,615
Yeah so it's actually fairly Flex

189
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:47,711
I once when I was first playing with you know me I actually had set it up

190
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,759
All of my Sonos is around my house

191
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:53,087
Play my favorites when I walked in

192
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,623
And what happened was

193
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,671
Their geolocation was still kind

194
00:07:56,927 --> 00:08:00,511
It apparently at 4 in the morning and decided I'd come home

195
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,791
And all of my sodas

196
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,327
This Sunday started playing late

197
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,119
Public Radio

198
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,935
Middle of the night rave party

199
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:10,239
Husband was not impressed

200
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,847
Let's see what else about the Google home

201
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:17,663
We want to talk about it messing with our Wi-Fi cuz that was a big

202
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:21,503
Well it still is a big deal is being fixed however a couple people

203
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:26,111
Start reporting issues and was looked into it turns out that Google's

204
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:32,511
Cast protocol which is used in the Chromecast as well as Google home and other Google devices was causing Wi-Fi

205
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:36,095
Issues in people with what's going on in my WiFi why can't misers

206
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,375
Not working at all

207
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,679
Turns out that the

208
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:43,775
Cast feature sends packets as a keep alive for a connection

209
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,591
For like the Google home

210
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:50,431
Unfortunately when a Chromecast device go to sleep

211
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:52,223
The packets buildup

212
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:57,343
So what happens is when something that uses the Google Cast protocol comes back online

213
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:59,135
It floods your router

214
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,415
Two boards of

215
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:03,231
Tens or hundreds of thousands of packets

216
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:06,815
And the memory fills up on the router and causes like an overflow error

217
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:08,863
And it just have to reboot the router

218
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:13,983
Obviously I don't like pictures the issue temporarily so what's going to happen is Google is working on a fix to

219
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:18,847
Not have that happened I don't think I change the protocol because I think they're using UDP

220
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,895
And yeah and that's

221
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,431
Probably not the way to go if you want to

222
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,711
Control the

223
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:26,271
The packets in this kind of situation so

224
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:31,391
It's more of a a setting or configuration that they need to fix it's nothing a user and user can do

225
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:33,695
But if you do have Wi-Fi issues

226
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:38,559
Give Me Maybe due to Google Cast type products in your house

227
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:42,911
And this will be fixed in the very near future some router

228
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,191
Companies are already fixing it

229
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:50,591
I know Linksys has a firmware update Netgear is working on tp-link which actually makes my Google

230
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,127
Call this now Google WiFi

231
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:52,895
Router

232
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,455
Google

233
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,271
That's it on Hub

234
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,295
Yasso

235
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,319
So it's getting fixed

236
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:03,647
Wifi issues recently this could be the problem

237
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:09,023
Right right

238
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,839
Google Google when messing with your WiFi

239
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,631
Okay

240
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:19,519
Let's see other this is actually an interesting reason to maybe switch over to Google home especially for you guys who want

241
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,055
Troll Kevin

242
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:21,823
Discovered

243
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:24,895
Yeah well I discovered something somebody else's guy

244
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:31,295
Android police wrote an article earlier this week saying Google home as a hidden API that local devices can use

245
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:34,879
My eyebrows

246
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,159
You raise the eyebrow

247
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:39,743
Sleep with this little bit will put a link in the show notes

248
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:46,399
But basically yeah you couldn't as long as you know the IP address of your Google home there is a you can just plug it into your bra

249
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:52,543
Browser search bar and then there are some commands you can do for getting and posting HTTP requests

250
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:57,151
I was able to just before the show like sent a request and just get the wireless network

251
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:00,223
That Google is connected to in my house for example I got all the

252
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,503
The SSID

253
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:04,063
WPA information so on and so forth

254
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,599
I was not able to act

255
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:07,903
How to change anything on my Google home but that's because

256
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:10,719
You do need to install a small little helper app to

257
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,999
Configure your request

258
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:18,655
So I seen pictures of this working I'm sure it's working but I have not actually gotten it to work at so you can enable Bluetooth mode

259
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:21,727
You can change the night mode settings and such from command line so

260
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:24,799
It's interesting and Google doesn't talk about this

261
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:29,151
And they don't offer any type of interface for it and Teresa see if they ever

262
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,175
Open it up so it's

263
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,223
So for those of us who

264
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,015
Terminal user

265
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,551
What is the benefit of this

266
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:37,599
User

267
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:38,879
Why would I want to

268
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:45,023
From a user standpoint you probably don't because all these things

269
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,303
It's already begun

270
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,071
Seriously

271
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,863
They can already be done in

272
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:49,887
The app

273
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:50,911
Got it

274
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:51,679
Okay

275
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:56,287
What but if you wanted to create your own version of a Google home app

276
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,823
And do different things

277
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,615
As a developer could be interesting

278
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,175
I look forward to seeing what you decide

279
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:07,807
Yeah and user / sudo developer

280
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:08,575
I might want

281
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:14,719
How to change the Wi-Fi network my device connects to when I walk in the house because I'm going to use that Network for streaming video

282
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:16,511
I can do that with a command line potential

283
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,583
Say

284
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:27,007
So that's it on Google home but because

285
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:29,567
Switch our stuff over we're probably going to learn a lot

286
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,615
And we will share that knowledge

287
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:32,895
Actually

288
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,175
I do have

289
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,199
Cher

290
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,223
That's why I listen to you

291
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,247
This is he

292
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,271
Pro tip

293
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,807
From one of our listeners Marty

294
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:40,831
Champs

295
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:45,695
Cuz one of my big complaints about the Google home is

296
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:47,487
I can't always tell if it's hurt

297
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:48,511
Right

298
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,279
Is a little

299
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,815
It's on the diagonal

300
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,095
And a little light goes off

301
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,191
And so

302
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:56,959
This person

303
00:12:57,215 --> 00:13:00,031
Email me to let me know that if I go into the accessibility settings

304
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,567
I can actually

305
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,847
Make it give me a little

306
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,383
To let me know that it's hurt

307
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:05,663
So

308
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:09,759
You could actually do that at the end of a command as well if you want to yes

309
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,295
So I needed that

310
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,575
And that his

311
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,343
Significantly

312
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,623
Enhanced my

313
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:22,815
Sepia and I actually do have that turned on because I asked for the very same reason I'm just not sure if it has heard me and I don't want

314
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:23,839
Want to have to look at it

315
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:24,607
So yes

316
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:25,375
And so

317
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,143
Guys

318
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:29,215
I now take away that feature and thanks Marty for

319
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,239
Telling you that

320
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:32,031
Apparently Kevin do it and didn't tell me

321
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,847
Well I didn't know you didn't know

322
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:42,527
Alright let's move on to some really interesting blockchain

323
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:45,599
We'll talk first about IBM and Maersk

324
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,135
The shipping Giant

325
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,159
Building

326
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,695
A joint venture

327
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:52,511
To track shipping around the world I thought this was fast

328
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:57,119
Last year IBM and Maersk created a partnership to focus on digitizing

329
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:57,887
Supply chain

330
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,959
And IBM spin a big black

331
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:02,239
3 years

332
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:04,031
And they were looking at it mostly for

333
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:04,799
Transactions

334
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,103
This is more about understanding worth

335
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,127
Bizarre

336
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,407
And now

337
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:11,199
After playing with this

338
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:15,295
4 year so they've decided there's enough to create like a whole new company

339
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,343
And they're going to put a

340
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:21,439
Global trade digitization platform built on Open Standards

341
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:23,487
For everyone and make it available

342
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:30,143
So what's going to happen is using blockchain they're going to make a record of all the transactions that occur in the global Shipping

343
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:30,911
Supply chain

344
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:31,935
And

345
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:32,703
That's a

346
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,495
Pretty significant

347
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:35,519
Thing to do

348
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:39,615
And it's also very iot Focus because

349
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:42,431
To do this you're going to have to have a way for these

350
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:44,735
Shipping pallets and things that are being tracked

351
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:45,503
Talk to one another

352
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:47,551
I look at this

353
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:51,647
And I cannot wait to see it's going to use IBM's cloud

354
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:53,183
Some of that Watson stuff

355
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,463
And then

356
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,743
Is ginormous a

357
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:57,791
Bishop

358
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,071
How many first

359
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:02,911
The global staff

360
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:05,215
The global stuff

361
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:06,495
So

362
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:09,311
The project has been piloted by Dow Chemical DuPont

363
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:11,103
And US Customs in

364
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,127
Border

365
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:13,663
So

366
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:16,735
This is cool cuz like you could see it being really useful for

367
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:18,271
Like hazardous materials

368
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,039
Counterfeit

369
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:20,831
Very excite

370
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:26,719
Yeah it's interesting that the Customs bit in determining if a product has made it to his destination as

371
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,999
Expected Hino

372
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:30,559
It's going from one country to another coming into our country

373
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:33,119
Yeah it's a wonder if they're going to have

374
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:39,263
They being IBM and Maersk are going to have a first-mover status here because this is a big undertaking

375
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,335
The one that can add tremendous value to any company

376
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,359
Around the world

377
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:44,383
Chips and

378
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,175
Like I said anything and anybody

379
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:50,783
That's a lot of them you know not services companies how to say but anybody produce something or

380
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:55,135
Keeps inventory and sells things you know your Walmarts you're all of your big

381
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,671
Supermarkets in such a penis

382
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:59,231
This is a good move right by these two companies I think

383
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:00,767
We'll have to see if it pays off

384
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:01,535
But I can

385
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:06,399
Citron Menace II out of this

386
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,423
Which is a startup

387
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,703
Filament labs

388
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,495
They've actually announced a new chip

389
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:11,519
The block lit

390
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,287
Chip

391
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:16,383
In what district does is you can put it on to any device

392
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,663
And

393
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,199
What is a secure

394
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,991
Transaction it runs

395
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,271
A variety of different

396
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:26,111
Blockchain so it becomes a secure transaction generator

397
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,135
On

398
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,927
Ascensor

399
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:32,767
This is kind of hard to think about but it's really revolutionary

400
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:33,535
Because

401
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:38,143
What you can do with this is the date of that stored and transmitted via the

402
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,167
Watching

403
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:41,215
Can be used to do transactions at

404
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:43,263
It can be used to

405
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,287
Calculate like

406
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:46,591
How much your old like you could even look up

407
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:47,871
You can even do like

408
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:48,895
For lookups like

409
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:51,967
How often are you pinning this device to

410
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:57,599
Find out where it is for example like much like GPS was monetized in the early days by lookups

411
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:59,647
So you can monetize it based on that

412
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:03,487
There's a lot of interesting things you could do with this and so filament

413
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,279
His creative basically this

414
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,815
Secure side

415
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:09,631
A way to do this securely in a trusted

416
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:10,399
The platform

417
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,167
With

418
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:11,935
A chip

419
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:16,543
So you buy this chip and all of the hard stuff is done on the security

420
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,591
You then enable your blockchain

421
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:21,919
Whichever one you want Sports ethereal and it supports

422
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,199
Bitcoin it support

423
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,223
Others

424
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:27,039
And then you've got to weigh to basically build this into a system

425
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:31,903
Yeah it is and I'm the security side of things

426
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:33,695
I think it's more along the lines

427
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:37,535
Being able to feel comfortable that whatever

428
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,839
Code is supposed to run on that device and

429
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,119
Sensor is

430
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,399
Legitimate trusted

431
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,167
Code

432
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,191
Meaning

433
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:50,591
Nobody could mess with the firmware or the colonel or anything else because obviously been anything that happened

434
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:54,687
Your packets of data could be siphoned off to somewhere else and somebody's getting that information so

435
00:17:55,199 --> 00:18:01,343
If they manage that it's I think it's almost like a Chromebook can't wait to always secure because the special chip inside checks

436
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:03,391
To make sure it's secure and running the most

437
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:04,927
Current validsoft

438
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:05,695
Work basically

439
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:12,095
Yes they are doing deals so they run as a trusted execution environment for both Intel

440
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,119
And

441
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:13,887
The arms.

442
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:17,727
Arm-based chips

443
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:22,335
They also so that the chip design is an existing silicon they

444
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:24,383
Put a microcontroller

445
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:27,967
But that's the kind of combined it a different way so they put a microcontroller on there

446
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:30,271
Solopower low processing

447
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,575
The Odyssey real flash storage they have

448
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:33,343
Handle some of the

449
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:34,367
Reads and writes

450
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:39,487
And then a cryptographic key storage and an engine so there's a co-processor doing all the

451
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,255
Photography

452
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,535
Then again that's good for

453
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,351
So I think this is really

454
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:45,887
Really exciting

455
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:51,775
They've been developing this for like the last five years but actually just last year arm announced

456
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,311
The thing we're going to be able to put

457
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:57,407
A trusted execution environment on their microcontrollers

458
00:18:57,663 --> 00:19:01,759
So before that this didn't even exist so these guys were building it ahead of the big

459
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:04,063
Japan during the space which is armed

460
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:04,831
So

461
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:05,855
It's really

462
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:06,879
I just really

463
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:10,975
It's one of them that I noticed in their white paper

464
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:14,047
They said they're saying the currency involved

465
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:19,167
For now for the people who are doing the the hashing and verifying all the information that comes through

466
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:20,191
The blockchain

467
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:25,055
It's Exchange in private side chains that are separate from the public Bitcoin blockchain

468
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:25,823
Therefore

469
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:30,687
These are shielded from bitcoin's transaction cost which can be very high when you talk about

470
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:35,807
Millions of iot devices using something like this transaction cause you to have to watch that

471
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:38,623
So that is another interesting aspect to me

472
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,927
Alright so that's our

473
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:41,695
Blockchain

474
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,231
Blah blah blah

475
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,535
Talk for the day

476
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,071
Let's go to

477
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:48,095
Some quick news

478
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:50,399
Will Kevin

479
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,679
Did you watch the Viking

480
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:57,823
I did and it was down to the final play of the game

481
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:03,199
The Saints to lose it but Vikings want it and what happened was

482
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:05,759
It was so much back and forth towards the tail end of that

483
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:11,135
Apple watches for telling people that they might be having heart attacks

484
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:16,255
I love this story because it is like it's an example of Wind Lake

485
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:20,351
The mass phenomenon of like sports and all that meets our custom data

486
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,423
Highly personalized data effort

487
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:24,959
We're all the same

488
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:26,239
So did you rap

489
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:28,543
Where you at Vesta

490
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:35,199
No I wasn't that vested in the game and it was a good game I watched it and saw the final play but no

491
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:37,759
Mine did not I'm kind of disappointed in this sense

492
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:38,527
I guess

493
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:43,903
When the Apple watch to text your resting but then your heart rate is above 120 beats per minute

494
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:48,511
That's when it send you your little alert which is super handy I love it I think it's great

495
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:51,583
But obviously in this case it was not a valid use

496
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:52,607
There we go

497
00:20:58,495 --> 00:20:59,263
Moving outside

498
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:01,823
But still in a TV ish Realm

499
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:05,919
Comcast we talked about this Sunday special CES edition of the iot

500
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,711
It's worth mentioning here

501
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:08,991
Comcast

502
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:09,759
Is

503
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:12,319
They bought stringify and they are now

504
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:16,159
Allowing for home automation for up to 15 million household

505
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:20,512
So hey if you're in one of those 15 million households you should totally be listening to us

506
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,560
Talk about automation

507
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:23,584
But

508
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:29,472
This is a big deal this is how they're going to use stringify and if you're stringify user like me and not in the country

509
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:30,240
Cast household

510
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:31,776
You don't have to worry because

511
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:33,824
Cuz they're still supporting stringify for

512
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,592
Other user

513
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:42,272
If you don't like stringify you could try to do it with you know me but stringify is incredibly complicated and can let you do a lot of really

514
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,320
But again

515
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:45,856
Comcast

516
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:52,768
I was actually going to ask you but I waited until you brought up the stringify bit if you could only pick one third party app

517
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:55,840
Right now to use with home automation I you know me

518
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:58,400
Struvite what would it be

519
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:04,288
Yeah I would have to go through what devices probably would be my first step

520
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:05,824
Second step

521
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:07,104
Oh

522
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:09,920
I probably would go with you know me

523
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:14,272
Because they have some nice automation features but I haven't use stringify since

524
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:16,320
Since Comcast started fiddling with

525
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:17,088
That so I don't know if

526
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,392
Change Street

527
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:24,256
It's a it's not as into it as I think I think you know me is much more to it is

528
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:26,560
So I I would tend to agree with him right there

529
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:27,328
And if

530
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:30,144
They've added more complexity but it's still not

531
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,424
It's not to the level I was

532
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:35,008
But for normal people I would totally recommend using IF

533
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,360
Okay

534
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:42,944
Mossy BMW has acquired parkmobile

535
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,504
Which is a an app that helps you find

536
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,272
Parking

537
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:48,320
I cannot wait till I have sensors or

538
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:51,392
Sensors embedded under every parking space or maybe cameras

539
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:55,488
Use computer vision to tell me where parking spaces are so I do not have to Circle

540
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:56,256
Roblox

541
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:02,656
And even better I would like to see my car work with blockchain to automatically just make a

542
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:03,936
Machine machine

543
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,728
Purchase for my parking so I don't have

544
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:08,288
How to do it

545
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:15,456
And since we're on the subject of vehicles and self-driving cars that's worth noting that

546
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,736
Blackberry just launched

547
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:19,040
A new cybersecurity software

548
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:20,576
For these vehicles

549
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:22,112
It did this earlier this week

550
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:25,696
And it's interesting it's called Jarvis which is kind of a bummer cuz Jarvis

551
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:26,464
There's like

552
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,232
Smart Home

553
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,000
And awesome

554
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:32,864
Yeah and those aren't words that I would equate with Blackberry no offense Blackberry fans

555
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,632
China

556
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,168
Just not feeling it

557
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:39,520
In any case Blackberry Jarvis is going to be marketed towards automakers

558
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,800
And it's not

559
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:45,664
This is interesting it's not security running on the vehicle itself

560
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:50,528
It's actually software to help the software designers

561
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:52,576
Check for issues and security

562
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:56,160
Potential issues as they're developing software for self driving cars

563
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:59,488
And that makes a lot of sense I was a QA manager for

564
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:01,792
Wait a while myself for business and

565
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:03,328
It is so much

566
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:07,424
Cheaper to catch these types of issues well before things go out in production

567
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,472
The sooner in the life cycle that you

568
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:13,568
Attach an issue or potential issue security problem whatever maybe

569
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,872
It's so much cheaper so

570
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:20,224
This does two things it reduces the cost of software development in general

571
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,528
Because fixing something later is going to cost a ton of money

572
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:27,392
And two it should improve the security of the software that's used in the

573
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:28,672
Autonomous vehicles

574
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:32,256
Do you think Blackberry can make it come around to come back with the autofocus with

575
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:33,792
Everything

576
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:35,328
Sue

577
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:36,352
I would say

578
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:37,632
Probably

579
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:41,728
I mean anything can happen they've obviously gotten out of the hardware business

580
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:43,264
Is there still BlackBerry

581
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,568
Handsets that are made but those are made by

582
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:46,592
Alcatel One

583
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:47,872
TCL I believe in

584
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:48,640
Just Brandon

585
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:49,664
BlackBerry

586
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:56,064
They're focused on services and software and actually you know they have long been in this business and they know software

587
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:56,832
Security

588
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:57,856
I do think so

589
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:02,208
I really I really do that mean never be as big as they were back in their heyday

590
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:06,048
But I do think they will survive and slowly thrive

591
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:10,400
And final bit of small news4u Sierra Wireless has a new module

592
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:13,728
And why are we telling you this because it's actually a very exciting much

593
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,080
It has a 15-year battery life which is

594
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:19,104
Very impressive

595
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:21,664
And it can work on NB iot

596
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:23,968
Katem networks and

597
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:28,064
Fall back for 2G so this is the kind of module you would see in smart cities

598
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:30,112
Having that 15 year life

599
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:32,672
Really gives it the ability

600
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:33,440
2

601
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:35,744
Desiigner the ability to

602
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,376
Put this on a bridge for example in a hard-to-reach place because you're not going to want to come back out there every year

603
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:42,400
5 years to

604
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:43,168
Replace it

605
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,728
So you can have things measuring likes

606
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,008
Tension

607
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:48,800
Vibration Zoe

608
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:50,592
Tell when something's about to fail

609
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:52,128
So I thought this was actually

610
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,944
It's kind of dirty but it's also really interesting

611
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:55,712
Fort Apache

612
00:25:56,992 --> 00:26:03,136
Yeah and it's currently sampling right now it's not available it will be available in the third quarter of this year is the presumption but I agree

613
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:05,952
Pretty for something that doesn't send a lot of data

614
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:07,232
That is

615
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,000
Remote

616
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:10,304
You know not something easily accessible

617
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:12,352
15 your battery life is very impressed

618
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:13,632
Yay

619
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:15,424
All right let us move

620
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,216

7 4

627
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,224
To 4

628
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:29,248
And

629
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,272
Here we go

630
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:33,344
Hey Kevin and Stacey love the show

631
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,624
Really like the balance

632
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,928
What you guys to bring a different devices

633
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:37,952
Technology

634
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:40,256
Change so quickly

635
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:42,560
My question for you guys is

636
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:44,096
Do you think about

637
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:48,960
Safety a personal health safety police devices be connected

638
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:53,056
Admissions of different waves back and forth

639
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:54,848
Bluetooth technology research

640
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:56,128
Who sings I'm

641
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,712
Going down this journey with smart devices and a part of me wonders

642
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:02,528
How much faster are going to get cancer because of this

643
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,808
Hope to hear from you

644
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:04,832
Thanks a lot

645
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:06,624
Okay

646
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:10,208
This is a question that I almost feel guilty that I haven't

647
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,488
Really thought about

648
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:12,768
So

649
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:15,328
Will a

650
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:16,352
It's a good question

651
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:19,936
My initial take is you know with smartphone something that's

652
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:22,240
Cellular radio waves and its next year

653
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,520
Your brain basically

654
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:29,920
We do have a measurement program it's the SAR testing to determine how much radiation is coming off that device

655
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:36,320
That could impact you physically we don't in the home I'm not as concerned we don't have any testing for that

656
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:37,344
Any formal test

657
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:38,368
Should say

658
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:42,464
But I'm not as concerned I mean we've had Wi-Fi forever not forever but for

659
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:44,000
Two decades whenever

660
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:46,048
People still wear Bluetooth headsets

661
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:48,096
Switch I think you have star ratings

662
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:48,864
By the way

663
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,960
Just with the devices in our house I'm just not concerned about that

664
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:53,984
Maybe I should be

665
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,264
But I haven't seen any

666
00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:01,664
Danger signs any studies that say Hey you shouldn't have all these wireless devices in the home so again

667
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,944
I'm not overly concerned

668
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:04,224
Okay well

669
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,320
That was this week's question again if you have a question and want to stop us

670
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:09,344
Or

671
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,136
Can the pinyin

672
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:14,976
Possibly a knowledgeable opinion

673
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:15,744
Possibly.

674
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,304
6 to 3

675
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,328
7 4

676
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:20,096
To 4

677
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:21,120
And now

678
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:22,656
Stay tuned for our

679
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:24,960
Guess who is going to talk to us about

680
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:25,728
5G

681
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:27,264
Low-power wide area Networks

682
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,032
And

683
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:32,384
How we should think about regulation in this new era where data is King

684
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:39,552
And now a message from our sponsor hey everyone we're taking a break from The Internet of Things podcast

685
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:45,952
Read message from our sponsor this week sponsor is Central and I have Sean Miller president

686
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:47,232
Here to talk to us

687
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:51,328
Tell us just a little bit about what point Central does

688
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:55,168
1 Central in the Metro what we always were the leading provider

689
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:57,728
Home automation solutions to property manage

690
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,848
We've been in business for about five years and where are you supposed to re-up alarm.com

691
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:05,920
Collectively Pete of substantive alarm.com Adidas a lot of

692
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:07,200
What time is it

693
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:08,480
We have expensive

694
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:10,784
Experience working with property managers

695
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,344
As well as the ability to really be a long-term partner

696
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,112
Pop emoji

697
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:17,184
Smart Home Solutions

698
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:21,792
All right you guys offer a bunch of products from big-name vendors like Amazon

699
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:23,840
OGE Lutron

700
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,376
Google home nest

701
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:26,400
Skybell

702
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:30,496
And so what's the advantage of bringing all of these well-known consumer brands

703
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:31,520
Together under the

704
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:32,288
Point Central

705
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:35,616
So we're interested and had a tough time

706
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:37,408
Getting smart home devices

707
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:41,760
By partnering with a lot of deleting devices

708
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:44,320
Windows brands

709
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:45,600
Choose residence

710
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:51,232
What we do on the back

711
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:54,816
Is we make sure all those devices are connected to our system

712
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:57,376
Alexis Toulouse

713
00:29:58,144 --> 00:30:00,704
Hempstead public security privacy

714
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,496
And also operational efficiency

715
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:03,264
For the property man

716
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:05,568
So for example

717
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:09,920
Opera

718
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:12,480
Element homes or apartment unit

719
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,808
The system automatically revert control today

720
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:16,576
The tenant

721
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:19,392
I'm allowed to tended to have the full experience

722
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:21,952
Turn the thermostat with the Amazon Echo

723
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:27,840
Turn lights on from iOS or Android app

724
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:29,632
If they needed to get someone into shape

725
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:30,912
Fix a leaky faucet

726
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:36,288
Or understand what was going on

727
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:37,568
And allowing them to

728
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,128
Mortician on how they help support.

729
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:44,224
Okay so you serve essentially to customer bases the renter

730
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,248
And the property manager

731
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,064
How does that influence how you design your solution

732
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,648
I want him is really exciting because you get to tap into a lot of

733
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:54,464
Passionate creature that got the computer level

Structure

738
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:04,448
As a business tool

739
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:05,984
Something at the property managers

740
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,520
She is a valuable addition

741
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:10,592
I mentioned earlier security

742
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:12,640
Until the Privacy order us another

743
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:16,224
Austin missed connection

744
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:18,272
To get the device data

745
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:19,552
Summerville Georgia

746
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:22,112
Out of the home and into our cloud

747
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:26,208
We found that just helps provide a much more reliable connection as well

748
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,280
And where can we go

749
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:30,560
To find out more about

750
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:37,728

751
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:49,248

Rihanna

757
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:05,632
Super excited because while I was at CES

758
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:06,656
Debate topics

759
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:07,680
When was 5G

760
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:08,704
And the other

761
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:09,984
Holy cow

762
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:12,800
What kind of low-power wide area network

763
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,104
So we're going to get to that

764
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:15,872
First

765
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:18,176
I really would love for you to break down

766
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:21,248
Since you've been doing this for a really really really long time

767
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:22,272
Bricktown

768
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:25,344
What you think carriers in operators need to

769
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,368
Do s

770
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:27,648
Part of the Internet of Things

771
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:30,464
Can you call that your fourth

772
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:31,744
Yasso

773
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,584
Yes.

774
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:38,144
Emanated from

775
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,192
The notion of where the next

776
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:41,984
Generation of Revenue is going to come from

777
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:48,640
Stabbing Family Feud Big W cycle

778
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:50,176
Huntington voice

779
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:54,528

780
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:55,552
Calvin decline

781
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:57,344
Next game

782
00:32:57,856 --> 00:33:00,672
Impacted by ITB Packaging

783
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:03,232
Good point where

784
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:04,512
Spelling in Many Nations

785
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:06,304
And then I'll just

786
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,328
Country experience

787
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:09,120
Indira

788
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:13,216
But eventually even the deer has grown little peep and Deborah

789
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:15,008
Soul Eater Laporte wave

790
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:18,592
Meaning the next cycle of innovation as well as Revenue generation

791
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:20,128
Have to be focused on

792
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:23,200
Anthem of Pakistan

793
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:24,480
Adopted the framework

794
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:26,528
Guan ping

795
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:28,320
AT&T Verizon

796
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:31,392
Docomo kddi

797
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:34,976
And so the notion of course

798
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:39,584
That while you focus on your bread-and-butter business of providing access

799
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,144
Is going to come from

800
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,728
Like advertising or like

801
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:47,520
What's security

802
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:49,824
Verticals like healthcare

803
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:50,848
Nutella

804
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,664
Until under the broad umbrella

805
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:59,040
Also invite other

806
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:01,344
By the way others to the ecosystem

807
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,880
Populist have to compete

808
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:03,904
Very differently

809
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:04,672
Then they have

810
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:07,488
Umbrella

811
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:08,768
Isabel

812
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:11,840
So you mentioned that iot is going to become

813
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,632
Warriors

814
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:14,400
What do you mean

815
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:16,448
They have to really figure out

816
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,472
Misdirection

817
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:19,520
Ultron

00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:24,128
Deployed

820
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,408
Aot

821
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,456
Play in the low power

822
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:28,480
Pandaria

823
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:31,296
He wants that determine out of it play

824
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:32,064
On

825
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,440
Today this part number somebody to create their own

826
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,976
Strindberg and ecosystem

827
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:43,072
That's settled then we have to worry about

828
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:45,888
Awkward Orlando services today

829
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,680

830
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:49,728

Fairy Tail transportation

832
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:57,920
Okay let's go deeper here because we should talk about

833
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:58,688
5G

834
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,480
When they talk about 5G

835
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:02,016
What are they talking about

836
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:02,784
And what are they hoping

837
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,928
I definitely hoping for the 5G is going to generate

838
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:10,976
The next generation of growth Obama

839
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:11,744

840
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,768

Ben 10 PS3 Avenue

849
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:29,408
Enterprise hope is that

850
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,736
The bad news is

851
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:33,504
Barely

852
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,528
Complicated

Snot

854
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:36,576
Simple as

856
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:42,208
Figure out which way to go first

All of them in what time frame hammock stand

861
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:53,728
Where do you see them

862
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,520
If I look at AT&T and Verizon

863
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:56,288
It looks like they're going

864
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,312
Fixed wire

865
00:35:58,336 --> 00:35:59,872
It varies depending on the job

866
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:02,432
Stop it in Korean

00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,208
Yes

00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:15,488
Verizon and AT&T

IGN

881
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:31,360
If you look at that cannot accept fix wireless I'm not completely convinced that

882
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:33,408
Nationwide

883
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:35,968
I think

884
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:38,784
Verizon and AT&T in Philadelphia

885
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,344

Locally

887
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:45,952
A use case that my

888
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:47,488
IFix Wireless

889
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:49,024
Either neighborhoods are

890
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:53,376
Quality wireless access to apartment buildings or factories or Healthcare

891
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:55,936
What does a blanket

892
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:57,216

19

898
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:05,920
And we might see more

899
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:12,064
EBay

900
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:12,832
Actually funny

901
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:15,648
Let's talk about the edge specifically

902
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,440
How we're going to

903
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:21,024
Connectivity to all of these sensors at

904
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:23,072
There is a

905
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:27,168
It's still ongoing debate about which low-power wide area network

906
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:28,448
Work for you

907
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:30,240
And we got

908
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:31,776
Proprietary companies

909
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:35,104
6 public radio reference

910
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:39,200
Help us

911
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:41,504
Make sense of

912
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:43,808
Yasso

913
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,904
Iot as you might realize it's already used

914
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:48,672
Epix

915
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:49,952
And so

916
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:52,000
Anastasia look like almost Park

917
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:54,560
And so it really comes down to requirements

918
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:55,584
And the Sun rises

919
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:59,936
So if somebody is looking for a Time rising of 2 years to 5 years

920
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:01,728
It might require and

921
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:02,752
August

922
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:06,336
If you are looking for 5

00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:08,384
Play Store

924
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,688
Damn you might deploy

925
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:11,968
Different strategy

926
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:12,992
I'm so

927
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:17,088
Ecosystem provides a very compelling Sparrow

928
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,928

00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:24,768
You can be up and running

931
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:27,328
To address

932
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:28,096
Problem

933
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:33,984
And in those cases security might not be a consideration

934
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,264
Or updating

935
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,544
And the sensors

936
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,824
Tesla software

937
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,640
Might not be a critical element

938
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:43,200
You might consider going

939
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:46,528
Unlicensed in areas that require internet

940
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,344
Oregon police

941
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,368
Make the bacon

942
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:53,184
And you need to update or Cara

943
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:56,256
An update

944
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:57,536
LCM

945
00:38:58,816 --> 00:38:59,328
Capable

946
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:01,376
Douglas paektu

947
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:02,144
Noble

948
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:05,216
Is also

949
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:06,752
The number of players on China

950
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:09,824
Is investing in a project that requires

951
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:11,872
Investment

952
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:16,224
They would be safer to go away

953
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,504
Longer than song

954
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:21,344
Thumbs down to a number of factors for a given project

955
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:23,136
Basted eggs

956
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:24,672
Jasmine

957
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:30,048
And in the number of the cases going to be the Laurel and six packs of the world

958
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:31,072
Because

959
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:32,864
Really low car

960
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:35,168
An important occasion

961
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:36,960
Panthers Kentucky

962
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:40,544
And so if I'm asking myself questions

963
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:42,336
Something about 10

964
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:44,384
It sounds like I should think about security

965
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,920
Longevity of my product

966
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:46,944
Cost

967
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,224
And

968
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:48,992
Any others

969
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,600
Do you know how many suppliers can you have

970
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:55,136
And the type of modules might be

971
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:56,928
Hanukkah celebration

972
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:58,976
Can be done

973
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:01,024
Yo what's the projection for

974
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,304
Ditto evolution

975
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:06,912
Because it could be

976
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:08,192
Increase in 5 years

977
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:09,216
Then

978
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:11,776
Project

979
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:15,360
So you have to kind of plan out

980
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,944
Spreadsheet and database

981
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,272
Scenarios and that'll help you narrow down

982
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:26,368
Which wire is orbit technology on my Toshiba

983
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:28,928
Is part of this

984
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:30,976
I feel like you also have to ask

985
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:33,024
Carriers want to do business

986
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:35,328
It's still an ongoing complaint

987
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:36,864
Surprising

988
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,400
A lot of companies

989
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:40,192
We're doing work on Prototype

990
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:41,984
Or even smaller companies

991
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:43,520
Sensor

992
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:44,544
Based

993
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,568
Products

994
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:47,872
Very hard time talking to the

995
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:50,688
What role do you think carriers need to

996
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:51,456
To play with

997
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:54,016
Backing this innovation

998
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:55,040
Younger

999
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:00,416
Nothing depends on what country

1000
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:05,024
Somebody like you

1001
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:07,840
Dabbing dealing with

1002
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:16,032
Reaction time

1003
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:18,080
And so if you think

1004
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:21,664
Bonita Park activity or want to get a module

1005
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,968
American Senior Verizon whoever it is

1006
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,040
You should be able to get in a matter of hours

1007
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:28,320
Sanlitun beijing

1008
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:30,880
Then the court system needs to be

1009
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:32,672
Robeson of scallopini

1010
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:33,952
Sports app

1011
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:37,024
Volume Five

1012
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,560
You should be able to get it

1013
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:39,584
Betty Lake Whitney

1014
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,912
Alka-Seltzer help you

1015
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:44,960
Disorder access

1016
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,544
And showed up on the doorstep

1017
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,568
In a matter of hours

1018
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:51,616
Reaction time

1019
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:52,640
Easterby

1020
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:54,431
Speed of how China

1021
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:55,199
Like to work

1022
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:56,991
Let's move over to

1023
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:57,759
Regulation

1024
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:58,527
Because

1025
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:03,647
Gosh I feel like this was a couple years ago but you published a really insightful publication

1026
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:05,951
About how we should think about regulation

1027
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:07,231
In the digital age

1028
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:09,791
Do you want to give me an overview

1029
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:11,583
Yeah sure

1030
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:15,423
Current regulatory regime

1031
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:16,447
Countries

1032
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:20,287
Is really based on 30-40 your idea of regulating

1033
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:23,871
And subsequently the internet provider

1034
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:30,527
GameWorks

1035
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:32,575
Antipathy

1036
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:33,599
State Farm

1037
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:34,623
Advertising

1038
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:39,487
Bop-It extreme

1039
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:41,535
The Google open the Facebook in the world

1040
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:44,095
If you look at a transportation

1041
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:45,887
Uber

1042
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:48,447
Stilettos

1043
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:49,215
Williams

1044
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:52,287
Who are the various

1045
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:53,055
Entity

1046
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:54,591
I'll be suspending to 1

1047
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:57,663
Requires a different mindset after all one word

1048
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:59,199
Really

1049
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:01,503
The problem

1050
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:03,295
I'm not doing that

1051
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:06,367
In the sense that if you look at

1052
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:07,391
Dell Avenue

1053
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:08,927
I mean from the ecosystem

1054
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:11,487
It used to be 85% of the revenue

1055
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:13,535
In the wireless Market used to be coming

1056
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:17,119
And now that has dropped down to less than 50

1057
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:19,935
The new growth

1058
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:21,727
Clearly coming from

1059
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:22,751
Newark bears

1060
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:24,543
Apples in Pittsburgh

1061
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:25,567
Uber

1062
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:29,663
New revenue for the

1063
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:30,687
The market

1064
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:34,271
Focus on the task

1065
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:37,087
You will miss out what's happening on the lyrics about

1066
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:39,903
Only the second side on the device side

1067
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,695
And more importantly on the application

1068
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:49,375
The most important component

1069
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:51,935
By their own admission did Aizen uol

1070
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:53,983
But apparently they're not

1071
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:55,263
Article about house

1072
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:56,031
Think about that

1073
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:58,079
Saeran lemon aesthetically

1074
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:00,383
Acquisition of one player

1075
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:02,175
Acquire

1076
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:03,967
Stronger player

1077
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:05,247
Spectrum

1078
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:06,271
Or not

1079
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:09,855
The problems we have you don't have to to measure

1080
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:11,135
Competitive strength

1081
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:13,695
Indifferent

1082
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:16,255
How do you compare AT&T with Google

1083
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:17,791
And come up with an answer

1084
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:19,839
And so the papers price

1085
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:28,543
Got it okay so we're going to break some of this down but we talked about things at the access layer probably the most well-known

1086
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:32,127
Neutrality

1087
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:34,943
Under your ideas do you think net neutrality

1088
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:36,223
Still needs to

1089
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:40,575
Exist

1090
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:44,671
Layers in the ecosystem need to be very transparent about

1091
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:46,463
How did Adidas

1092
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:48,511
And the mystical concept

1093
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:49,535
Me too

1094
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:50,559
Mature

1095
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:53,119
Frontpageafrica

1096
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:58,495
Amazon denying consumers Google

1097
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:04,127
Or vice versa in motion of the 9th

1098
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:06,175
And so I think it's a really

1099
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:07,455
Be honest about

1100
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:08,479
Net neutrality

1101
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:10,527
It shouldn't go up and down the chain

1102
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:12,063
But only for certain things

1103
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:14,111
I mean it doesn't make sense

1104
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:15,903
PS of course

1105
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:22,815
Who have a massive platform

1106
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:24,607
Breakfast on big one

1107
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:27,679
Or Android

1108
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:29,471
Are back from life awf

1109
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:32,287
That you be transparent and be equal

1110
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:33,311
Everybody

1111
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:39,711
Albuquerque, new players that are coming on

1112
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:46,111
And responsibility after you go to a certain time

1113
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:48,415
That are you be confident than welcome to

1114
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:52,511
And so do you think it's

1115
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:57,631
A size like number of users would be the threshold is it dependent on the type of platform

1116
00:45:57,887 --> 00:45:58,399
Is it

1117
00:45:59,167 --> 00:45:59,935
There's so many ways to

1118
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:01,215
This cat as it were

1119
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:04,287
Yeah I mean I don't know what the right

1120
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:05,311
What I would like to

1121
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:09,151
