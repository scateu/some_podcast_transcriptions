00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:08,704
Hey

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,008
Everyone welcome to the Internet of Things podcast

3
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:11,776
This is your house

4
00:00:12,032 --> 00:00:13,824
Stacey Higginbotham and Jericho

5
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:14,848
Kevin tofu

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,128
And today

7
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:18,432
We have an awesome show for you

8
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:19,968
We are going to be talking

9
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:20,736
Talking about

10
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:22,784
Actually sensors on planes

11
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:26,368
All of the AWS iot news that we have

12
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:27,136
So far

13
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:28,672
The ocf

14
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:31,488
Iot standard is now an ISO standard

15
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:33,280
And could we have crammed more accurate

16
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:35,840
I don't know we'll see when we talk about it later

17
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:36,864
Mg

18
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,216
We did all right we've got a new Google Assistant

19
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:41,984
Speaker

20
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,336
Kevin's going to talk about smart robots and Jarvis he's building his own Jarvis

21
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:48,128
And it's cute

22
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:48,896
And

23
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:50,176
We've got an update

24
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:52,736
On Amazon smart device sales that will talk to

25
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:54,272
Just to give you a sense of how the world

26
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:56,832
Does going this week we have gone to

27
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:58,368
Limerick from UL

28
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:02,720
And she's going to be talking about these cybersecurity standard that UL is developing

29
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:05,792
I have some tough questions and she mostly answer them

30
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:08,608
So all of this is sponsored by a pharaoh

31
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:09,376
You're going to hear from them

32
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:10,400
Then later and

33
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:11,680
In a few moments

34
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:13,728
So let's get the show started

35
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:15,264
With a message from our sponsor

36
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:16,288
A pharaoh

37
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,824
Looking for an iot

38
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,128
Deplatform find out why Kenmore and D-Link

39
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,152
The pharaoh

40
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:25,760
Affero customers have experienced as much as an 80% reduction in time to Market

41
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:28,320
99% pure support calls

42
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:30,112
M10x higher activation rate

43
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:31,136
Bus

44
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:34,464
Bakery use 90% of their work from one project to the

45
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:37,024
To learn more visit a pharaoh

46
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:37,792
Dot IO

47
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:39,072
That's a f

48
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:40,096
Ero

49
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:41,376
Dot IO

50
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:43,680
Okay Kevin

51
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:44,960
Let's get this started with

52
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,520
Sad story

53
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:49,568
So this is really sad story

54
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:54,176
I felt like crying but it was also hugely important to talk about I felt.

55
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,456
Because of the iot Inc

56
00:01:55,712 --> 00:02:00,576
Girls here so data from the Black Box recovered from The Lion Air flight

57
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:02,368
The crash into the Java sea

58
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,136
Last month

59
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:04,160
Is now available

60
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:06,208
And basically what it shows

61
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,280
Was that the Boeing 737

62
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:10,304
That was being

63
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,072
Flown

64
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:12,864
Had bad censored

65
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,448
Reporting bad sensor data which made the autopilot behave in

66
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,776
Terrible way it kept try the nose of the plane kept trying to go down in the

67
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:20,800
The pilots kept trying to

68
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:21,568
The correct it

69
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:22,336
They

70
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,104
Actually did

71
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,872
Correct it

72
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,664
More than two dozen times

73
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,688
String deflate

74
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:27,456
But

75
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:28,480
They failed to

76
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:29,760
Maintain it and

77
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:30,784
It crashed in the ocean

78
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,344
They actually corrected it manually

79
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,184
Like you said more than two dozen times within 5 minutes I'm looking at the timeline.

80
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,208
5 minutes

81
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:42,816
They had to fight against the automatic anti-stall system which is why the

82
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:43,584
Clean cab

83
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,400
Putting its nose down automatically thought the plane was

84
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,168
Stalling

85
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:50,240
So they're two things that I thought

86
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,264
We're really important here

87
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,824
Kevin's has got his own things that are also

88
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,616
So one is

89
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:56,896
The sensor data

90
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,944
That was causing the system

91
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,712
Fail

92
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:00,480
The sensor was

93
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:01,248
Reporting bad

94
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,040
And I think it's important

95
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:04,064
To notice that

96
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,344
Not just because

97
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:07,392
Why did they replace the sensor

98
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:08,416
How to replace a

99
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:14,304
But there is a lot of research right now going into malicious attacks and how to spoof

100
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,072
Censored

101
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,096
In

102
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:18,144
I think it's worth noting that there are

103
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,936
Things like physical attacks like

104
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,728
Certain frequencies of noise can

105
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,032
Confuse accelerometers for example

106
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,056
There's no evidence

107
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:26,592
This happening in this case

108
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:28,384
But you something

109
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,664
Researchers are looking at

110
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,968
And having this sensor

111
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:33,504
Report bad information

112
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,296
Funnel that through the system

113
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:37,088
In a way that took control of the

114
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:37,856
A plane

115
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,136
We have to start thinking

116
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,160
About those

117
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:40,928
Hack Avenue

118
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,976
And I talked to

119
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:45,280
Their biggest on the show Alistair Allen is

120
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:46,560
Who talked about

121
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:48,096
Reading like a truss system

122
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:48,864
4 sensor

123
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,424
Basically having sensors on

124
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,216
Our automated systems

125
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,240
He talks about doing it

126
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,264
The black sheep

127
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,056
Basically what would happen

128
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,592
When is Every sensor

129
00:03:58,848 --> 00:03:59,872
The report's information

130
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:01,152
Into the system gets

131
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:01,920
Credibility

132
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:02,944
Basically like

133
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,712
What's this

134
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:04,736
Yes or no

135
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,784
In overtime the system would

136
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,552
Would learn

137
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:08,576
Whether or not

138
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,344
You can trust that

139
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:12,160
So in this case it may be that every time the

140
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,184
Pilot's manual

141
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,464
Corrected the data

142
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,024
Import overrode descent

143
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,327
And that's the system with stop

144
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,863
Pay attention to that sensor

145
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,655
That didn't happen obviously

146
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,423
I did not have

147
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,959
So that's one aspect

148
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:27,775
Does like homie iPad sensor data we need to start.

149
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:28,543
Designing for

150
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,103
The second element

151
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,127
Isabel

152
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,151
This was a soft

153
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:33,919
Software update

154
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,199
Boeing issue

155
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:37,503
And bowling basically said

156
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,551
When they did the software update their like

157
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,599
Everything is going to work the same way

158
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:42,623
Used to work

159
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,671
But that wasn't actually the case

160
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:46,207
To fix this error

161
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,999
The pilots did what they had always done

162
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,023
It didn't work

163
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,815
Boeing later issues

164
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,143
Correction of clarification saying that Pilots actually

165
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,935
How to manually take control head to do

166
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:57,215
Two additional step

167
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:59,775
When I looked at that I was like

168
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,591
I was frustrated because

169
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,383
Assume that soft

170
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,407
Where is just soft

171
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:08,223
But when we start letting software

172
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,503
Garden sensors

173
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:13,087
As the input into the real world and controlling the real world

174
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,879
We actually have to think about

175
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,159
Software

176
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,183
Isn't just software

177
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:20,255
It's something we could actually cause an actual event like

178
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,791
The plane crash like a car

179
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:22,559
Crash

180
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,839
In the case of a smart home

181
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:27,167
Am I allow someone into the house and I don't think

182
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:30,495
Corporations are really thinking along those lines

183
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:31,519
Just yet

184
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,543
How software will

185
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,103
And Kevin you have a Corollary

186
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,711
Yeah you kind of stole my thunder because this is the first thing I thought of

187
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:46,111
Is wilty this is a plane it is awful but we are seeing some progression in automated Vehicles cars

188
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:49,695
And all these threat actors and sensors all exists

189
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:51,743
Any Vehicles as well and

190
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:55,327
To totally turn over control when the systems

191
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,863
Maybe shouldn't have control

192
00:05:57,119 --> 00:06:01,471
Or reading faulty data and therefore are basing their control based on bad information

193
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,775
That is a huge huge challenge

194
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:04,799
And I just

195
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:09,407
Granted a plane obviously has more passengers it's terrible how many people passed away in this

196
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,175
Plane crash

197
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:15,295
There's so many more cars on the road in a sense I I look at that as a bigger issue quite honestly for future

198
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:18,879
Purposes additionally unreal

199
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:19,903
Boeing response

200
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:20,671
It's like saying

201
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,975
All this information was in the user

202
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:24,255
Pilots flight manual

203
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,559
And I think they had updated the flight manual and

204
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,607
They follow the flight manual the Pilots Dead

205
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:35,007
But the system kept overriding their overrides and I said my question is and I asked is because when I first IT jobs with us

206
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,799
Software tester and

207
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:37,567
User manual

208
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:40,383
Documents are used to create user manuals for software

209
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,407
Who tested it

210
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,943
How did the test it I mean

211
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,295
If somebody is tested in a real plane that might be dead to right I get that but

212
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,831
Simulators

213
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:49,599
What is this

214
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:52,927
Tested / the manual not how do I get to work

215
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,975
But how does the manual say it works

216
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:57,023
And how does the manual say to proceed when it doesn't work

217
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,559
I want to know who Tessa that but

218
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,351
I'm sure we'll never find that out it's just

219
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,119
It's something

220
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,399
Has to be considered

221
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,935
Trinity smart system

222
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:07,007
And let's not forget that underlying

223
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:10,079
All of these issues in this is why it's so important

224
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:12,127
189 people

225
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:14,943
I mean and they died I don't know what it's like

226
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:15,967
The fall for the area

227
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:17,503
But I imagine that it's not

228
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:19,295
And so

229
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:21,343
This just drives home that we are

230
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,647
Putting a lot of reliance

231
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:24,671
On software

232
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,951
On sensors

233
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:28,767
Automated systems and I'm not saying that we should

234
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,071
Because I mean planes have been drive-by-wire

235
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,095
For decades

236
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:36,447
And there are lots of safety protocols in place but I do feel that

237
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,215
As we are

238
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:37,983
Pushing

239
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,007
More friendly

240
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,055
The plane automations

241
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:43,103
And drive-by-wire systems have been built

242
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:43,871
In

243
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,407
The vacuum it were built

244
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,431
Hainan airline

245
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,199
Regulation

246
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:49,759
Right so very safe

247
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:52,575
Where is now we've got a lot of

248
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,111
Companies building

249
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,135
Their software

250
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,159
Tech review

251
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:56,927
Which

252
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,975
Has been kind of bad breath fast and break things

253
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:01,791
And those things are colliding in a way that

254
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,583
We need to borrow

255
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,119
From that highly

256
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:07,167
Highly focused testing

257
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:07,935
Kind of world

258
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,727
When we start applying these things to

259
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:10,495
Cars

260
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:11,263
Airplanes

261
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,287
Medical device

262
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:13,823
And so on

263
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:18,687
So breaking things is fine I get that it's part of the process but not when those things are people

264
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,247
And maybe it's move fast and break things

265
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,271
In a simulator

266
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:24,319
Maybe it's an emphasis on testing

267
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,599
Kevin said

268
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:26,623
Maybe it's

269
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,159
Now it's probably an emphasis on

270
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,439
We should focus on

271
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:32,255
Is unfun and as not exciting

272
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,071
I think that's probably where we need to

273
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,607
Pause slow down

274
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,143
And take a few moments to

275
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:38,911
Get it right

276
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,447
Because it really matter

277
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:42,495
So that is our take

278
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,799
On this plane crash and

279
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:47,103
Yeah iot didn't do so well there

280
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,479
I don't know if it's happy

281
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:55,039
It's interesting it's interesting

282
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:57,343
So this week

283
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:59,391
User conference

284
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:04,511
Non-stop so much exciting

285
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:07,327
First up we're going to talk about a WIC

286
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,119
Space Network

287
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,679
They have a new service called AWS

288
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:13,983
Ground station which is basically

289
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,519
Providing you satellite

290
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:17,055
Antennas on the ground

291
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,591
They will work with iridium

292
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:19,615
And

293
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:22,431
You will have a satellite connection that you can buy on demand

294
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,711
Through AWS

295
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:25,247
Which is pretty cool

296
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:27,807
Especially if you think about for iot

297
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:30,111
Services so you could actually

298
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,391
Maybe you've got a connected

299
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:33,439
Okstate dog collar but you probably don't

300
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:36,767
It's a sad life her that

301
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:39,839
Attract Norm where's where's Norm

302
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:42,655
I'm going to retest with satellite to find my dog

303
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,703
Let's talk about container ship

304
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:54,431
Becomes an interesting option where we go

305
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,199
To have

306
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,991
12 in operation by the middle of neck

307
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:57,759
Skyr

308
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:01,599
They said they're saying that you can ingest and process your data from the satellites

309
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:07,999
Direct to AWS very cool. I am curious about the cost that because I mean we all know about

310
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,023
Everybody

311
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:15,423
Probably knows about iridium and how it's been a spectacular fail so far and is pivoted at 3 for different times

312
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:19,007
Which was originally going to be satellite-based phone technology

313
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:22,591
Over the cloud anywhere and there's only satellites up there

314
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,615
Really don't do that

315
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:24,639
They still developer

316
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:28,223
Now it's not making any money because we have great cellular network

317
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:31,807
Brightwell and you still need satellite phones for super remotely

318
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:32,575
Location

319
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,647
It's super expensive

320
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,439
For the data connection because

321
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,719
I can't scale relay

322
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,351
Is expensive

323
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:45,631
Require special

324
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:46,399
Radios

325
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,167
Search

326
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,191
Huge

327
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,727
There is no Moore's Law

328
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:53,567
Fitting satellite technology right now so you get these massive phones

329
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,591
Right

330
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,359
Can you set them up

331
00:10:55,871 --> 00:11:02,015
ICM

332
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:05,855
Takes a second or two for that voice to travel up and carry back down

333
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,135
When does space

334
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,415
So you know

335
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,439
This will be an interesting

336
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,207
Pink

337
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:13,279
The pricing will see so also in relevant

338
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,047
Coyote

339
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,863
There's an update to security for AWS

340
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:17,887
Coyote green

341
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,679
Green grass is the

342
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,471
Service that lets you run

343
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,495
AWS

344
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:25,055
Beer AWS instances on

345
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:25,823
The edge

346
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:26,591
Basically

347
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,615
So now what you can

348
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,919
Can do with this is you can have connections to

349
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:30,943
Use third-party app

350
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:35,039
Location that other AWS services that are secure they're going to have Hardware root of

351
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,575
Trust storage

352
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:39,391
The isolation of permission settings that lets you

353
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,671
Basically just take

354
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,439
More control

355
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,999
And this is really important

356
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,023
Because there are a lot of

357
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,303
Enterprises

358
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,583
And even Industrial

359
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:50,143
Using AWS Greengrass

360
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:50,911
And

361
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,703
Necessary service

362
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,727
More secrets

363
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:54,751
Moore security

364
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:59,103
Yeah it looks like they also have another service that's

365
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:04,991
Password related it doesn't necessarily require green grass but I saw this IRT sitewise which was interesting

366
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:05,759
And

367
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,295
Sounds like it's a piece of

368
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:10,623
Hardware because they said there's an on-premises Gateway device.

369
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,647
That collects data

370
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:18,047
And far is it to AWS or further processing so then you can build representations of production lines and processes safer

371
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,071
Industrial iot

372
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:19,839
Yes

373
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:22,911
The big focus seems to be here on AWS

374
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:25,215
Really making sure that they have something

375
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,495
Industrial and

376
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,055
Plant cell in addition to sitewise

377
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:29,823
Which australians

378
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,871
They have 8.

379
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:34,431
Events that that you do iot sensors

380
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,199
It's scale

381
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:35,967
So that's

382
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,527
And then they have AWS iot

383
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,295
Things graph

384
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,343
It's basically letting you do

385
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:44,927
Locations for Edge gateways

386
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:45,951
So

387
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:46,975
It's basically like

388
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:48,255
Would I look at this and I see

389
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,815
Microsoft is done with

390
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:51,583
With Asher

391
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,863
In iot

392
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,935
What kind of screw this up guys cuz everybody Nancy Rio.

393
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,215
Hardcore

394
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:58,239
Score

395
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,567
Before I believe I think it's core

396
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,591
So this is

397
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:05,663
Play to get some of that business cuz Asher

398
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,455
Just owns the industrial

399
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:08,735
Because

400
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,015
Microsoft

401
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:13,087
And everybody in the industrial World works with Microsoft

402
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,879
Microsoft

403
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:19,743
It's hot by my bad it's not core Google I think it's core

404
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:20,511
FC

405
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,047
It Is Ash

406
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,095
Is everybody pick one and stick with it

407
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:26,399
We'll just you know pick something different in

408
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:29,215
Instead of iot Hub parkour

409
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:29,983
Function

410
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:31,519
Brain

411
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:32,543
Green grass

412
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:33,823
Skynet

413
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:39,711
Okay so those so far are the big iot related

414
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:42,271
AWS news stories out there

415
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:44,063
You also found one that you like

416
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:46,623
Yes I saw this

417
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:51,999
On the AWS news blog this is the AWS robomaker service and

418
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:52,767
You can go

419
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:56,607
That is read to you by a robot or a robotic voice if you'd like

420
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:59,935
I found a press release which is kind of cool it is a service to help develop

421
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:03,775
Simulate test and deploy the robot of your dreams Amazon says

422
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:10,175
I doubt that because they're open My Dreams or something to talk about little bit later I think this is more for heavy-duty robotics

423
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:10,943
Companies

424
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:14,015
These are packages for the robotic operating system that

425
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:20,415
People used to build robots and it supports a TV services such as Lex Polly as I just mentioned recognition

426
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,951
Which we talked about before the

427
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:22,975
Facial recognition

428
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,255
Yeah

429
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,047
Natural language processing

430
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:29,119
Kinesis video streams

431
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,911
Don't use that never heard of it

432
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,703
Just for videos

433
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:35,263
And Amazon Cloud

434
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,847
I don't either

435
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:44,223
But you can watch the clouds that's not true

436
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:48,831
But anyways because of interest in robotics I thought this was neat could we see this

437
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:52,927
Move into the iot space so I think we might and we'll talk about that in a few

438
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:53,951
Yes

439
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:56,255
Alright before we get too excited

440
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,047
Talk about the ocf

441
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,095
The open connectivity Foundation

442
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,119
Which is now

443
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:03,935
Holy cow you guys an ISO standard

444
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,983
So we talked about ocf

445
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,031
Before they've actually sponsored the podcast

446
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:10,079
A couple times for a special CES episode

447
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,871
Which by the way we're going to have again

448
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:12,895
So

449
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,175
These guys build

450
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:18,527
Universal standard for connected devices is there

451
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,599
And everything will have a data schema

452
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,623
And everything will be

453
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,415
How to talk to everything else as long as

454
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:25,695
Sports Asia

455
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:27,231
The challenge

456
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:27,999
Has been

457
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,303
Did they really delayed issuing

458
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:33,119
Version of the standard with security in

459
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,447
They recently did do that this summer

460
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,751
But we haven't seen a lot of devices

461
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,287
It support it there lots of

462
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,591
Companies that are involved in Asia

463
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,383
But we haven't seen

464
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,407
Devices

465
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,199
I don't know if

466
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:52,575
Hopeful that we'll see some this year at CES that are not just rehashes up

467
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,599
The old stuff

468
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:54,367
What they had

469
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:59,487
I think we will in the only reason I say that is because it's the ocf

470
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:00,511
Standard

471
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:04,095
11.0 spec that has been ratified and

472
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:09,983
They are working on two. Oh and I believe you can correct me if I'm wrong cuz I very well could be

473
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:14,591
That the two. I was back really brings more of a cloud into things

474
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:16,895
Smaller device

475
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,687
Abrams security

476
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:20,223
And the ability to run it

477
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:21,247
Plus

478
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,527
Make smaller

479
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:23,295
Not

480
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,319
Fletched

481
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,623
Smaller chips

482
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,671
Dumber chips for

483
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:34,047
But they're still smart they just useless

484
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:34,815
Power

485
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,351
Yes but they're not as

486
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:38,399
Between like

487
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,423
Nmcu

488
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,703
Andar May 7

489
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,727
But yes

490
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:42,495
So that's

491
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,519
Kind of WhatsApp

492
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,055
To be inside

493
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:48,127
ISO standard I just thought was interesting because you know

494
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:51,967
ISO is actually a very legitimate very powerful standards organization

495
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:52,735
And

496
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,783
The fact that they ratify this is

497
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:55,807
Probably

498
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:57,343
It means

499
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:58,879
Basically if

500
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:01,695
I so want it could develop a standard that didn't

501
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:02,719
Appraise ocf

502
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:05,535
And if it does then everyone has to do it

503
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,071
Ocf is pivoted someone

504
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:07,839
On the smart

505
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:08,607
Home Space 2

506
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:09,631
To focusing on

507
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:10,655
Automotive

508
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,935
Medical device

509
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:12,703
Standards

510
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:13,471
So

511
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:18,335
That might be I don't see this impacting the smart that much if at all

512
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,383
It used to be very smart

513
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:23,199
Home focused in a lot of the companies that are involved are smart

514
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,735
They have

515
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:27,807
Home Appliance devices like LG Huawei

516
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:28,831
Samsung

517
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:35,231
So but they're all using other things and there's such a big audience already for the Eastside

518
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,255
I don't know

519
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,047
Okay

520
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,327
So

521
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:42,655
But since we're talking about I so we should talk

522
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:46,495
Hey they just actually ratified a drill stand

523
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:48,543
Is not crazy

524
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:53,151
Set of standards for drone operations this draft

525
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:58,527
21st of January and they're expected to be adopted later

526
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,807
Some of the things that are in there

527
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:03,903
Are no fly zones so drones won't fly into airplanes

528
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:04,927
That's a big deal

529
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:05,951
It also talks about

530
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:06,719
Like sensitive

531
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,487
Locations

532
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:12,863
Yeah they could actually shut your drone down if it comes within a certain geofence area for example

533
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:15,167
And actually in the USA law was

534
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:17,471
Allows the government

535
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:18,495
To shut down

536
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:20,543
Drones

537
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,823
That is actually

538
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:22,591
A little bit

539
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:25,151
Controversial because it's unclear

540
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:28,479
What areas might be deemed too sensitive so you could see something

541
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,271
Very good reason exam

542
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,807
Trying to

543
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:34,111
Fly a drone over the tornado

544
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,903
Camps where they're keeping the

545
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:36,671
Undocumented

546
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,463
Children

547
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:41,279
The government may be like you know what media I don't want you looking at

548
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,047
To close it that

549
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:44,351
And they could just shoot those down which would be

550
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:49,215
That's a different story

551
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:51,007
We're going to want some clarity in that law

552
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,567
Probably

553
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:54,847
It talks about

554
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:55,871
Flight logging

555
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:58,431
Training maintenance requirements so that would be

556
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:03,807
Really useful cuz I don't know how often you've been hit in the head by a drone but it's happened to me once it was

557
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:10,207
I haven't been you know I hope to never hit anybody because I had to register mine with the FAA so they would know what it was

558
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:14,303
My hair for a week

559
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:18,911
Not that I didn't think this was a big deal because it is but this surprise me

560
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:21,471
Currently the head of the UK's air safety board

561
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:25,311
It said that half of air traffic incidents now involve drones

562
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:26,847
Is

563
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:28,383
Surprising

564
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:30,431
Cuz that's a lot but I also

565
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,455
Recall unit

566
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:34,271
The firefighters not recently in California

567
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:39,647
Probably last year's firefighters talked about like they had to stop helicopter flights because drones were in the way

568
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:40,671
Siri call Dad

569
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,975
This is shared airspace

570
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:43,743
We got to figure this out

571
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,023
All right

572
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,559
Sogo ISO

573
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,839
Working on that if you have comment

574
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:48,607
You should tell them

575
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:50,143
Let's talk now

576
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,727
Let's talk now about a new Google Assistant speaker

577
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:57,823
Just came out of nowhere I did not expect it but then again

578
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:01,663
Pretty much any speaker these days it's on the market anybody's making them

579
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,735
I'm betting they're coming out with models that have

580
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:08,319
A microphone and some smart sync connectivity cuz that's what

581
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,599
Klipsch has done

582
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:12,927
They make high-end speakers they have for years and years

583
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:13,951
Eclipse

584
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:20,351
The three now has Google assistant and being a high-end speaker system it'll cost you 409

585
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:22,143
$9

586
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:24,447
Which is an awful lot for a smart speaker but

587
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:25,727
If you

588
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:28,799
Want that mid-century modern design and

589
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:29,567
Pig sound

590
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,591
I know

591
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:32,639
There you go last minute

592
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:35,967
No cuz I'm not an audiophile I always like

593
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,015
Does it sound okay

594
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:43,135
I'm not an audio file for say cuz my hearing is starting to go but I do

595
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:43,903
Like

596
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,975
Good speakers you know I'm not going to get this because I don't like

597
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:48,767
Good speakers under $500

598
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,047
So is your

599
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,071
What qualifies

600
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:52,095
Just a good speaker in your

601
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,375
What's your favorite

602
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:57,215
Good sounding speakers the best sounding speakers in my house are the Sonos

603
00:20:59,007 --> 00:20:59,519
Call my dad

604
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:06,431
Which still still has not Google Assistant which we mention I'm thinking the last podcast it's not happening

605
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,711
Hopefully early 2019

606
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:08,991
He'll let us know

607
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,271
Oh I will

608
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:11,551
Okay

609
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:15,647
Speaking of assistance we should talk about Amazon because

610
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:17,440
They put out a press release

611
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,208
Talk about

612
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:18,976
There

613
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,256
Turkey five

614
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:23,072
Black Friday to Cyber Monday which day

615
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:24,608
Turkey 5 holiday

616
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:29,728
We will turkeys turkey from now it's not a thing don't make it if you don't ever be a thing Amazon

617
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,264
We're not on board

618
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:32,544
What's that but

619
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:33,824
We are on board with

620
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,592
Finding out

621
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:37,920
You know and just do this with a big heavy load of salt

622
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:42,016
Which is Amazon's press releases are notorious for not actually

623
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,296
Real information

624
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,064
Astounding

625
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:51,744
They give information but it's nothing compared to because they're not providing that extra bit that we give you the comparison

626
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:54,816
So let's see but they did say

627
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:55,840
That

628
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:56,608
They sold

629
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:58,912
A lot of echo dots the best selling products at

630
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:00,448
The Amazon pop-up device

631
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,472
Kiosk

632
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:02,496
Over here is that where it's at

633
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:03,520
35 weekend

634
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:05,056
So basically Thanksgiving

635
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:05,824
Black Friday

636
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:07,104
That weekend and then

637
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:09,152
Cyber Monday

638
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:10,688
It was the echo Dot

639
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:11,712
In the Amazon smart

640
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:12,992
Which

641
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,528
By the way

642
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:15,552
Was on sale

643
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:16,576
25 bucks

644
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:17,600
Was crazy cheap

645
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:18,624
Sounds great

646
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,904
And it's sold out

647
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:20,672
Which is

648
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:21,440
Amazing

649
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,464
And I saw a

650
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,232
A tweet

651
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:24,768
From Ryan

652
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:25,536
Ramallah

653
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:27,328
Who is a voice first kind of

654
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:28,096
Person

655
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:29,376
I don't know how else to describe

656
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:31,168
He's an expert there but he said

657
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:32,192
The source

658
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:33,216
Told him

659
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:35,008
Did the sales of the echo Dot

660
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,824
More than a thousand units

661
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,592
Hersey

662
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:40,896
Witches

663
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,200
It is

664
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:46,528
And just we can put some minor perspective around this

665
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:48,064
Because Amazon said that

666
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,088
Customers ordered

667
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:53,440
180 million items about those five days obviously they were not I'll.

668
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,208
Of course not

669
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:55,744
But the best selling

670
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,280
Products

671
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:59,072
Cyber Monday for example

672
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:01,120
What's the new Echo Dot

673
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:03,680
As fate was in the kiosks as you said

674
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:06,496
So the only kind of idea they gave us on

675
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:11,104
Total sales for Echo devices was Millions sold worldwide

676
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,664
And that the all new Echo dot was the number one

677
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:18,272
Selling price on Amazon globally from manufacturer in any category

678
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:22,112
We know they sold 180 million items and they sold millions of

679
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:22,880
Echo devices

680
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:26,208
We don't know how many millions obviously less than 180

681
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:28,000
Yes which is still

682
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:30,048
Other things

683
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,120
The ring video doorbell 2

684
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:34,144
Makes sense

685
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:37,984
But they also sold the iRobot Roomba 690

686
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:38,752
Robot vacuum

687
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:40,800
That is not the one that actually Maps

688
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:42,080
Your data and can send it to your

689
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:42,848
Google Assistant

690
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:45,408
They sold a lot of TP Link mini Wifi smart plug

691
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:46,944
And the Amazon smart plug

692
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:50,272
This is part of hopefully the mainstreaming of the smart

693
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:51,808
So yay

694
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:52,832
All right

695
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,880
Let's see what else do

696
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,928
Speaking of Amazon

697
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,512
And the robots that we were talking about it is now time

698
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,560
To talk about Kevin's

699
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:03,584
Tri Merle.

700
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:04,864
Well

701
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,400
The next thing on my

702
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,192
Want less I guess so

703
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:12,032
This is not mainstream are going from mainstream to just what Kevin wants but I think

704
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:13,312
Other people will want

705
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:14,592
They just don't know it yet

706
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:15,872
Yes

707
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:17,152
Wait before you

708
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,432
One day

709
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:19,456
YouTube

710
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:23,040
I want an iPad mini and guess what

711
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,088
They did

712
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:27,136
People don't realize that but that's another story

713
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:27,904
Anyway

714
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:29,952
So I mentioned vector

715
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:34,048
The little robot from Anki that I had bought in October last month

716
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:36,864
He's gotten some software updates he is much

717
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,144
More expressive

718
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:40,448
That's the new thing for him was when it's

719
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:46,848
It's cold outside on the weather when it's below a certain amount

720
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:51,968
Please got another update coming and this one gets me really excited not just for the near future but the

721
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:53,760
Faraway 5-year future

722
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:55,040
He is getting

723
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:57,856
Amazon's matinee integration

724
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:58,624
And

725
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,696
The funky folks shared a video

726
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:02,464
Of

727
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,744
What it looks like and how it works

728
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,792
Because you don't have to ask

729
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:07,840
Vector to ask Madame a something

730
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:09,632
Nature's literally at Amazon

731
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:12,448
Echo device for all intensive purposes with this update

732
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:15,264
Is coming in a few weeks and I'm super excited to get it

733
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:19,104
It made me think about though is and I proposed to

734
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,128
Earlier this week

735
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:24,736
For people who are familiar with the Iron Man movies which I suspect most people are you know about

736
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:25,504
Jarvis

737
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,808
If you're not familiar Jarvis is basically a

738
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,136
Bodiless digital assistant just like matinee

739
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,672
Eventually becomes

740
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:38,304
Put into a synthetic body and he's a robot in a sense is real

741
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:42,912
Yeah you're right

742
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:44,704
Geek cred for you

743
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,240
Oh my God was that a spoiler

744
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:51,872
No not well it is for the Age of Ultron as well being

745
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:55,968
What I saw with the doctor and Madame a integration and then

746
00:25:56,224 --> 00:26:01,088
In reality and then the movie where and digital assistant becomes a movable object

747
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,368
I'm thinking

748
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:08,000
Why do we want all these speakers and microphone throughout the house okay speakers yes we want to music

749
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:11,584
Do we need all these microphones I literally have more

750
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:17,984
Smart speakers than I have rooms in my house right now and I just bought another one I just bought a Google home hub over the holidays for the kitchen I'll

751
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,032
Silence we can watch YouTube TV or coffee

752
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:22,080
But I'm tired of buying them and quite honestly

753
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:24,128
It doesn't make sense in the long run

754
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:25,408
Why not have

755
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:28,224
Movable object I a robot

756
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,296
That can definitely humanoid is enough to be enlarged

757
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:37,696
It is a bit bigger than Vector because Vector only lasts 45 minutes on a charge but just had that microphone near me when I want to

758
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:40,768
Near me

759
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:44,608
Robot go stand in the corner I'm going to watch Ironman for the 10th time

760
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:51,520
Whatever you know what I mean because it takes away a lot of the Privacy things now

761
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:57,920
Because you can be a way you can be in a room that doesn't have a microphone or camera Decker as cameras I presume

762
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:59,456
Robot like this would have cameras to

763
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:06,112
Yeah I can go into the non robot and do my thing and be private and then still have the robot within earshot and I can say

764
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:08,160
What's the weather or whatever I want

765
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:09,184
Thomas Martin

766
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:15,584
I don't know I know it's a radical idea I never most my ideas so I can use a radical and some of them actually come true

767
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,376
And I like the idea

768
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:19,424
Like following me around

769
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,192
And you know

770
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:21,728
Hanging out doing things

771
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:23,264
Look it over in

772
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,336
Imagine like a Sony aibo like a little robot dog

773
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:27,616
Having yes

774
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:28,640
Oh my gosh

775
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:29,920
That would be so fun

776
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:32,992
I do think Mobility will add a lot

777
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:37,856
To this experience I don't know that everybody is ready for the right now and I can't that

778
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:43,488
You know the update on the smart speakers have been ridiculously fast and granted

779
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:46,304
I love my pretty inexpensive fat it certainly helps

780
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:50,400
I don't know I think there's a lot of value I didn't mobile virtual assistant such as this

781
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:51,936
There are privacy

782
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:53,728
Questions about this

783
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:57,056
If it's something that can

784
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:59,360
Can follow you around you to lose elements

785
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,128
Privacy Law

786
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:02,688
Like if you only want your digital assistant in certain play

787
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:03,968
Places but I guess you could say

788
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:07,040
The kitchen

789
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:09,856
Having dinner with my wife in candlelight dinner

790
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:13,952
I think that's manageable it's more manageable than it is now these speakers are just there

791
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,488
I have one of my back

792
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:19,584
Gervais get out of the bathroom

793

Canada

818
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:10,016
So sorry rest of world

819
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:11,808
It's a great lock

820
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:12,576
I like it

821
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:13,600
And

822
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:14,368
Now

823
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:16,416
Let's hear our voice mail who is

824
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:18,208
From somebody

825
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,000
But I'm guessing they're from the south

826
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:21,024
Just like me

827
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:24,352
Stacy Kevin how y'all have a question regarding

828
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:25,888
Using the most

829
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:26,912
Current

830
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:28,960
Intelligence which is but in an old building

831
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:32,544
Helping my daughter and son-in-law do some updating and their new house

832
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,848
And he wanted to automate a couple switch location

833
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:38,176
Today they're using Madame age connected direct Outlets

834
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:38,944
So Gateway

835
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:40,736
Stinky shoes I understanding this

836
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:42,528
Building was built and we're guessing the

837
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:43,296
60s

838
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:45,856
This wiring it is two conductors no neutral

839
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:50,976
And that's just about every other ladies Racing shirt

840
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:53,280
A suggestion for wall switches

841
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:54,816
We could use an old house

842
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:57,120
Thanks for being so nice in the right direction

843
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:59,680
Oh this is such a common question

844
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:01,728
Unfortunately for you I have

845
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:02,752
Literally want ants

846
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,544
Because it is the only one

847
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:08,640
So the only option they have

848
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:10,688
Is a dimming switch

849
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:11,456
From Lucia

850
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:13,504
And you will find this it is

851
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,040
Lutron caseta switch

852
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:16,832
Which it is model number

853
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:17,856
TD

854
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:18,880
-

855
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:19,904
6w

856
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,928
CL

857
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,976
And there's going to be another

858
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:26,304
Series after that that's going to denote color in this case it is

859
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,912
6wcl - wh

860
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:31,680
That's white

861
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:32,704
It comes in Black

862
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,472
Almond

863
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:34,240
Some of their

864
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:36,032
So this is a

865
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:38,848
$55 switch

866
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,152
But it does not require

867
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:43,968
It does however require

868
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:44,736
The Lutron

869
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:46,784
Stop the smart Bridge hub

870
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,552
And that

871
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:48,320
Right now

872
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:52,160
Is $117 sometimes I see it on sale for as low as 80

873
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,440
This is ratehub

874
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:55,488
And if you're going to buy a Lutron switches

875
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,024
This Hub is going to be

876
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:58,048
Your best friend

877
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,888
Makes it compatible with Madame a show at the Amazon Echo

878
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:04,704
The Google Assistant ecosystem and even home

879
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:05,728
So

880
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:06,752
It is a hub

881
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:08,288
But it's a really useful

882
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:11,104
And it's going to work with all of your switch

883
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:16,736
This particular switch does not require neutral wire it says so very clearly so make sure you do see those

884
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:19,040
The downside of this

885
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:20,576
I just called you to switch it's actually

886
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:21,600
Is if

887
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:24,160
If you don't have dimmable bulbs this isn't good

888
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:26,976
So for example if you have a fluorescent bulb

889
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:28,512
You're not going to be able

890
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:29,280
To use it

891
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:30,048
And

892
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:31,072
That is

893
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:31,840
Frustrating

894
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:32,864
And I

895
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,192
They used to have a switch that didn't require neutral wire now they do not

896
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:41,056
And I suspect that these aren't going to be around that much longer I'm not saying

897
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:43,872
Days are weeks but I don't know about that

898
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:47,456
Keeps them on their website they talk about it being a perfect option for

899
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:48,992
An older home

900
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:50,528
So I don't know

901
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:53,600
Which year there's obviously there's plenty of older homes out there

902
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:56,416
It's only words

903
00:31:56,672 --> 00:32:01,280
Dimming lights I mean it does have an on-off two buttons one for almost four off at the top and bottom

904
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:03,328
Turn off the dimmer in the middle so

905
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:05,376
If you use a dimmer though with

906
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:07,168
Incompatible lights

907
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:08,960
Liquor in

908
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,776
Yes

909
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:16,896
I was just thinking you're saying this is a dimmer which it is but it could be used as a switch

910
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:18,944
Only on lights to the caveat is

911
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:19,712
Your lights have to be

912
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:23,040
You can't put non dimmable lights with this

913
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:24,832
I did not know that

914
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:26,112
Yes I have done that

915
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,672
I have not

916
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:29,696
Obviously

917
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:30,464
Don't do that

918
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:35,840
So that is the caveat if you have weird if you have normal

919
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:36,864
So

920
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:38,400
Dimmable LED

921
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:40,960
I think like lights that won't work or fluorescence

922
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:42,496
Halogen light

923
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:43,520
So

924
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:45,568
Those are going to be a little bit more difficult

925
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:46,848
But normal lights

926
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,384
Yay

927
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:51,200
That's my

928
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:52,736
Are you so easy answer

929
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:54,016
It is expensive but

930
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:55,552
I recommend Lutron lights

931
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:56,832
Everybody who asked me

932
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:59,392
If they're installing switches I know it's expensive

933
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:00,160
These lights are

934
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:01,696
They just work

935
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:02,976
The work well

936
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:05,280
And the Lutron support is amazing

937
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,304
Also

938
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:08,096
I know you guys know I love

939
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:08,864
How do you spell

940
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:11,936
For this case it is literally the only option so

941
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:13,984
Problem solved

942
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:15,008
Okay

943
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:17,056
Well that brings us to the end of the News segment

944
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:18,336
Of the show and now

945
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:19,360
We're going to be

946
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:20,896
To our guests who is

947
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:22,176
Honda limerick

948
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:26,784
From ul and we're going to be talking about the UL cybersecurity standard

949
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,064
Gosh where is it

950
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,344
Why does it cost so much

951
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,624
What are you guys trying to do

952
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,928
You will like this especially if

953
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:36,512
Like standards and certifications it who does it

954
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:39,072
Get started with this but first

955
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:40,096
A word from our sponsor

956
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:46,240
Everyone we are taking a break from The Internet of Things podcast from our sponsor

957
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:48,032
This week sponsor is a

958
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:52,128
And I've got Joe Britt who is the CEO of a pharaoh here to talk to

959
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,712
So first off would you reminder audience who afero is

960
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:57,248
Fair was fundamentally

961
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:59,808
A platform for connecting all kinds

962
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:03,136
Sensors and devices to the cloud but the most important

963
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:04,672
Vocero is that

964
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:07,232
We put together everything just works

965
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:08,512
And we also feel like

966
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:09,280
It's very

967
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,048
Design

968
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:11,072
Easy to use

969
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:12,608
And very very secure

970
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:14,912
And our customers tell us that it's

971
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:17,984
The best choice for great end user experience

972
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:18,752
And developer

973
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:19,520
Productivity

974
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:22,080
You may remember that many of us out of pharaoh came for

975
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:23,872
From places like apple nest

976
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:25,920
Google Android Netflix

977
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:29,760
And we really wanted to bring the best of those engineering and Design District

978
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:31,296
To the world of iot

979
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:34,624
Excellent so who are some of your customers and why do they pick up

980
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:36,416
Customers like hemorrhoid

981
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:39,488
D-Link chose a pharaoh really because of three key reasons

982
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,768
Time to Market

983
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:43,584
They can cut down their development Time by as much as 80%

984
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,864
Technology reuse

985
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:49,728
Their Engineers are able to reuse over 90% of their work from Project to project

986
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:50,496
For example

987
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:51,776
Kenworth connected more than

988
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:52,800
The 25 Appliance

989
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:54,336
In less than 2 years

990
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,360
And finally custom

991
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:56,128
Experience

992
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:57,408
Our partnership founded

993
00:34:57,664 --> 00:35:01,760
The Pharaohs substantially increases the number of devices that are actually connect

994
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,552
Thanks to our onboarding technology

995
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:04,576
And substantially

996
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:07,136
Reduces the number of conductivity related

997
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:08,416
Customer support calls

998
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:10,720
So what is new since the last time

999
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:11,488
Time we talked

1000
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:12,256
Great Wolf

1001
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:13,280
I'd like to highlight

1002
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:14,304
To really excited

1003
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:17,632
The first is around our patent port

1004
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,448
Few weeks ago we were identified as having the

1005
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:21,216
V large

1006
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:23,520
Just patent portfolio in the iot space

1007
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:26,592
Find large companies like Samsung Qualcomm

1008
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:27,616
Intel and IBM

1009
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:29,408
Now this is a really huge test

1010
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:32,480
Funny to the quality of the engineering talent that a pharaoh has a

1011
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:34,272
But it's also a test

1012
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:35,296
To the market

1013
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:39,136
Get Gap that existed for a fully integrated and secure iot platform

1014
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:40,672
Are patent portfolios

1015
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:41,440
Reflection

1016
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:42,976
Of the benefits that are custom

1017
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:44,768
Get by using the affair of platform

1018
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:45,792
End

1019
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:47,840
What about this Bank of things

1020
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:51,168
We've also been doing some really inspiring work

1021
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:53,216
Work with Mitsubishi ufj Bank

1022
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,032
And this is fundamentally about enabling

1023
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:56,800
Billions

1024
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:58,336
Of tiny micro Tran

1025
00:35:59,104 --> 00:35:59,616
Micropenis

1026
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:01,920
Through smart devices all kinds of

1027
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:04,480
The project is called Bank of

1028
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:05,504
Because

1029
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,808
It marries iot with banking

1030
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:09,344
And also really lays the

1031
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,112
Groundwork

1032
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:11,904
4 things to pay each other

1033
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:12,672
Directly

1034
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:13,952
Sarah provide CIA

1035
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:14,720
Party platform

1036
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:16,512
A Mitsubishi Bank provides

1037
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:17,536
The payment processing

1038
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:20,608
And this kind of solution demands very secure conductive

1039
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,424
And very secure payment processing with minimum over

1040
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:24,960
Each device

1041
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:26,752
Then becomes its own payment

1042
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:28,800
There's no need for the traditional paint

1043
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:31,104
Terminal is an add-on device you get insta

1044
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:31,872
Step response

1045
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:32,896
Highscalability

1046
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:34,176
Reliable operation

1047
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:35,200
Low overhead

1048
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:36,480
Payment Processing

1049
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:39,296
And all of this has to be there to create this

1050
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:40,576
Very unique solution

1051
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:42,624
That sounds really cool so where can

1052
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,672
Can people go to find out more information

1053
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:46,976
Dot IO

1054

Go - big

1056
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,304
Is the best place to start

1057
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,328
If you're a developer

1058
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,608
You can also see.

1059
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:53,376

Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your house

1064
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,064
Stacey Higginbotham

1065
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,856
And I have with me Don't Tell Em bury

1066
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:15,904
Who is the senior business

1067
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:16,928
Development manager

1068
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:17,952
4 Cypress

1069
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:19,232
Security at UL

1070
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:20,256
How are you doing

1071
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:21,280
Aggressive

1072
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:22,048
See how are you

1073
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:23,328
Excellent

1074
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:25,632
So I'm excited about this because

1075
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:26,656
I actually when I

1076
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:32,800
Purchase many of my products including all of my connected Outlets I look for that UL certification just to make sure my house

1077
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,384
So excellent work there and you guys have

1078
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:37,408
Since

1079
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:40,224
Oh I don't know a couple years ago we've been talking about

1080
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,760
An iot

1081
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:42,784
Security standard

1082
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,064
So talked about

1083
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,624
Why you all decided to get into this

1084
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,392
Game

1085
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:49,184
Like you outside

1086
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:53,536
In the face ego names

1087
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:56,608
Sunday making sure your car can catch fire

1088
00:37:56,864 --> 00:38:01,728
When you think about your product that using your home as many products have Network

1089
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:04,032
Connectivity

1090
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:05,568
Device

1091
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:06,592
TV

1092
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:07,616
Your door lock

1093
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:08,384
Baby monitor

1094
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:10,432
And that actually rings

1095
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:11,712
Additional risk

1096
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:12,480
Safety razor

1097
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:13,248
Security

1098
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:19,136
To ask you out what are you guys doing to protect us from these new risks

1099
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:21,696
That's why we have been trying to engage with industry

1100
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:24,768
Around security thinking about security requirement

1101
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:27,584
Cabana some of these security risks that have been

1102
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,608
Paramount life

1103
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:29,632
For example

1104
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:30,912
Losing control of your device

1105
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,728
Having someone reached your data

1106
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:35,520
And related types of risk

1107
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:38,848
So that's where we have gotten involved as physical product

1108
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:39,616
Senior home

1109
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:42,944
Computers Network connectable products

1110
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:47,552
We want to network with industry I'm with consumerism smart homeowners

1111
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:48,576
Managing director

1112
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:49,856
Associated with those products

1113
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:52,672
Okay so there is a little bit of a

1114
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:56,768
Prince here historically if you follow the rules of various physical

1115
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:59,072
Sex right so if I want to create an outlet

1116
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:04,192
PetSafe I have to follow set rules about you know the amount of voltage that goes through that sort of thing

1117
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:04,960
Testing

1118
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:09,568
In the product stays relatively the same but will be start connecting things to the internet

1119
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:10,848
It almost becomes a

1120
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:11,872
Impossible 2

1121
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:13,664
Secure it because things on the internet

1122
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,224
Always changing software is always going out

1123
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:18,528
So how do you guys think about

1124
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:19,552
That because that is

1125
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:22,624
At the core of iot security that seems to be

1126
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,648
Biggest issue

1127
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:26,208
Extremely relevant

1128
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:29,024
Indeed speaking about your products

1129
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,816
Check your TV that's no longer

1130
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:32,352
Screams with a wire

1131
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:36,448
It's actually a software and most of its functionality

1132
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:37,984
Mannix

1133
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,520
Add your TV product level

1134
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:41,568
The cloud sofa

1135
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:42,336
Services

1136
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:45,664
It's no longer Hardware itself and then the risk

1137
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,432
Scenarios

1138
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:48,480
You think about it

1139
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:51,808
Scenarios they evolve over time but they are more

1140
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:52,832
Static

1141
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:58,464
How to break into

1142
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:02,560
The combination of on the one hand

1143
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:05,376
Same-day auctions

1144
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:09,472
Warm or suffer and suffer and be updated

1145
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:10,496
What is manic

1146
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:15,104
At the public library

1147
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:19,456
Science

1148
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:20,736
And how we help industry

1149
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:24,832
Ready Set Go

1150
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:26,624
Email leaving the factory

1151
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,672
That's where I stopped caring about it

1152
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:29,952
You know it has to be

1153
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:36,352
Miami Heat Reddit shooting turn left and that's where you all need to step up and help

1154
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:38,656
Ultimately

1155
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:39,680
Society as well

1156
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:41,216
What does ongoing

1157
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:46,848
Insurance that products are being used

1158
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,152
So that implies a continuous

1159
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:50,176
Testing process

1160
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:53,248
So something like more like a nice so kind of standard

1161
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:56,832
Approved and then you go back in every now and then they come in and

1162
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:58,624
Certify you again or make sure that

1163
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:02,464
Up-to-date so is that something that you all has done in the pasture does

1164
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,488
The plan to do this

1165
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:05,280
For the cyber security program

1166
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:16,800
Want to be nimble to

1167
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:17,824
Customers needs

1168
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:22,176
To be a enabler to business and to maintain a

1169
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:25,504
The quality of products in the past we have collaborated

1170
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:30,624
What industry to make it happen.

1171
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:32,160
Calibration

1172
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:33,952
Has gone beyond

1173
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:38,304
So let's talk about

1174
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:42,912
The broad Strokes of what you guys are thinking about when you talk about coyotes

1175
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:45,472
Security what is the program

1176
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:50,080
That we have done a few things are actually has

1177
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:55,455
A lot of experience and also strong reputation in markets that are currently

1178
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:57,503
Redlands I mean there is

1179
00:41:57,759 --> 00:42:01,087
Standards that have options and adoption

1180
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:04,927
Credit cards

1181
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:07,487
End-to-end security requirements

1182
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:09,535
Secure process

1183
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:11,583
Credit card

1184
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:13,375
All of that is secure

1185
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:16,191
Internet of things not just your credit card

1186
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:17,471
Fendi everything

1187
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:19,263
That you use a life

1188
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:21,311
Is becoming a digital electronic product

1189
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:23,359
Michigan eat

1190
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:26,943
All of those products and communication from those products to

1191
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:27,711
Networks

1192
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:31,807
Ecosystem

1193
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:34,367
My building

1194
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:36,671
100 standard

1195
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:39,743
Which is aiming for a high level of soccer

1196
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:42,815
Security Assurance testing

1197
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:54,335
To think about how come

1198
00:42:54,847 --> 00:43:00,991
Security do you envision a company having to get WL certification so if I'm making a connected

1199
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:04,831
Kitchen product for example

1200
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:09,183
Fire safety kind of aspects but then I'm also going to possibly need a

1201
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:10,463
Cyber security

1202
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:11,743
Certifications

1203
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:16,095
What is that look like for a company that's like

1204
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:18,655
It's going to cost too much

1205
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:22,495
Feeling of course you want to avoid to the extent possible

1206
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:23,775
Products need to be

1207
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:24,799
Celtic Woman

1208
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:25,823
Companies

1209
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:30,943
See it that way and I call you

1210
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:33,759
Security includes

1211
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:35,039
Wireless connection

1212
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:37,599
The cloud

1213
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:39,647
Products for today is

1214
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:42,207
There's no such thing as one

1215
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:43,999
Do you want to work with

1216
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:47,071
Customers and Industry as much as we can as a one-stop-shop

1217
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:49,119
Different elements

1218
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:51,423
Performance

1219
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:52,703
Wireless connectivity

1220
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:54,239
Interoperability

1221
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:56,031
Manufacturer

1222
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:57,567
The care about the brand

1223
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:02,431
I'm going to Market with a

1224
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:06,271
Level of quality and they see you getting there

1225
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:12,927
Let's run down some security features and let's see where they fit into the UL scheme so this will be kind of quick and short

1226
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:14,719
Hopefully so in corruption

1227
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:15,743
Necessary

1228
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:16,511
Where

1229
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:17,535
Very important

1230
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:21,375
For example you think about day that other thing, decayed it's from a product

1231
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:28,031
Example of a IP camera security camera

1232
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:29,567
Is protecting a building

1233
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:30,591
Tamarack sheep

1234
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:31,615
Is sensitive

1235
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:34,687
Information and if it's traveling from the camera

1236
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:37,247
To some clouds environmental environment

1237
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:41,343
Stanley should be able to intercept today that has a hacker and get access to the

1238
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:42,367
Good Life cheats

1239
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:43,903
For example.

1240
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:44,671
Coccidiosis

1241
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:47,231
That is data that ideally you encrypt

1242
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:49,279
When you communicated from the device

1243
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:53,119
Okay what about encryption of data at rest

1244
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:53,887
On the cloud

1245
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:55,679
Very important as well

1246
00:44:55,935 --> 00:45:02,079
Addressed in the cloud or data at rest in the device sensitive data you should be considering

1247
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:05,663
Adequately

1248
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:09,247
Program Spencer

1249
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:11,295
Data protection data at rest

1250
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:14,367
Think about

1251
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:19,231
Spy Store on a server

1252
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:21,791
What about password

1253
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:23,583
Default passwords on devices

1254
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:30,239
That's what's important actually useful password those are not the greatest security practice so I having you

1255
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:32,031
Sports is important

1256
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:33,823
Okay over the air updates

1257
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:39,455
Critical as well to maintaining overall Total Quality seokjin able remote software update

1258
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:42,527
She's going to be very important making that very secure

1259
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:43,551
Is going to be open

1260
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,855
Clear privacy policy

1261
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:47,391
Critical as well

1262
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:50,207
Degrassi kind of go hand-in-hand

1263
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:51,743
Some more and more data

1264
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:58,143
Used in devices and also and devices pick up user-specific data

1265
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:03,775
Devices you need to give up some of your data in most of the cases.

1266
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:05,055
Your username

1267
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:07,871
Or your name the general

1268
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:15,807
It's very important that has you interact with devices and with iot that those data architect

1269
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:18,623
Clearview holiday.

1270
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:20,927
I'm Sedaris a responsible policy

1271
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:23,743
Okay what are some things I missing

1272
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:24,511
What else is

1273
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:25,535
Important

1274
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:26,559
That I don't know about

1275
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:29,119
Do you mention encryption

1276
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:30,399
Oh yeah update

1277
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:31,679
Privacy

1278
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:33,215
DDOS security

1279
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:35,263
You hit the major must haves

1280
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:36,543
Security items

1281
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:39,103
In general when you think about software

1282
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:41,151
One thing that is important

1283
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:46,783
Considered as well as whatever functionality you enable with it if you want to protect yourself or adequately

1284
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:49,087
Any insecure functionality

1285
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:51,135
Albuquerque accident

1286
00:46:54,463 --> 00:47:00,607
Grenadine in the right way

1287
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:03,423
Operate a certain function and if it's not needed

1288
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:04,447
Why am I enabling

1289
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:05,727
For example remote

1290
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:08,031
And maybe have a mindset

1291
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:10,079
Disabled and stops Networks

1292
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:12,127
Security in general even though it maybe

1293
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:14,687
It's still important

1294
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:16,991
To consider and it will remain important

1295
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:21,087
Lansing Social Security office and forms and devices you can consider

1296
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:25,183
Whatever

1297
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:29,279
Device is your navel make sure they're behind a router or a firewall

1298
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:32,095
And I think about Network segmentation

1299
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:36,447
So do you want your computer for example to be linked

1300
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:40,287
Are connected to the same network as your device

1301
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:42,335
Maybe you should apply some smart

1302
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:45,663
Organize your device

1303
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:50,015
That is something that I think about but I'm very curious because

1304
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:52,063
That is not something my company's

1305
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:53,599
Who I'm buying the products

1306
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:57,183
Tell me to do so that feels like not something

1307
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:59,231
It feels out of the UL Lane

1308
00:47:59,487 --> 00:47:59,999
Is that

1309
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:03,327
Increasingly though when you buy these smart Spotify

1310
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:09,471
Devices there should be Industries user guide

1311
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:15,871
Insecure Protocols of protocols being used

1312
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:16,639
How to

1313
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:22,783
Example use your router together with the product to make sure that it's not recording session is still secure

1314
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:25,087
I look forward to that okay

1315
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:27,391
When did criticism of UL

1316
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:29,183
Is that in order to

1317
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:32,511
See the standard you have to pay to get a copy of the license

1318
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:34,559
Which makes it really difficult

1319
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:36,351
For companies to evaluate

1320
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:37,119
Program

1321
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:39,167
And I'm curious how you guys

1322
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:42,751
Like when I talk to the security Community they're like well I don't know if it's

1323
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:44,287
Straight or not I don't want to buy it

1324
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:46,591
So how do you address that kind of

1325
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:50,175
Need for transparency and security with your business motto

1326
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:52,223
That's a good question

1327
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:58,623
Dennis r u l i p where they're also belong to the community so typically like

1328
00:48:58,879 --> 00:49:01,695
Standard

1329
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:08,095
Requirements and working with industry in the way

1330
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:09,375
General Studies

1331
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:13,727
Okay and when should we see a finalized version of this

1332
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:19,615
Do you want a 900 as a standard and design to it

1333
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:28,063
So we gained some traction with that program with that standard and addressing it security

1334
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:30,623
Security number of various products

1335
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:31,647
And embarrassing

1336
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:33,439
Stop there

1337
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:35,999
So when you really think about it you know adoption

1338
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:37,535
Security in a

1339
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:40,351
Scalable way

1340
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:42,399
I really want to work with in this

1341
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:44,447
Leveraging industry programs

1342
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:50,847
Example of

1343
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:52,639
Program

1344
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:53,663
We Are One

1345
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:56,479
Drive adoption of the program

1346
00:49:56,735 --> 00:49:57,503
Then Amazon

1347
00:49:57,759 --> 00:49:58,783
Example

1348
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:00,575
Building Alder Alexa

1349
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:02,879
System they care about device

1350
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:06,207
With Alexa and the security of those devices

1351
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:10,559
Speaker devices for example we work with Amazon to test those devices

1352
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:13,119
Industry initiatives to get to gradle

1353
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:16,191
Windows

1354
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:21,823
And we also proceed you know developing multiple programs that can really comfortable wide

1355
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:22,591
Variety

1356
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:24,383
Products that manufacturers

1357
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:26,175
Centaur building

1358
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:28,735
Security Insurance on Baseline all the way up to

1359
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:29,503
Hirelevel

1360
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:30,527
Security assurance

1361
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:33,087
Okay so if I wanted to look for a

1362
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:35,135
UL certified cyber

1363
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:35,903
Secure

1364
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:41,023
Product so if I'm working with my echo devices or something like that I should be looking for

1365
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:42,559
UL 2900

1366
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:47,423
Yes currently that's or certification program so you can find any you want to know how much

1367
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:53,055
Certification database and then

1368
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:56,383
Including collaboration within the

1369
00:50:57,151 --> 00:51:00,735
