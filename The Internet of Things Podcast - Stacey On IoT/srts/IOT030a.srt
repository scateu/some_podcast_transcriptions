00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:11,520
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast

2
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:15,104
And I'm your host Stacey Higginbotham and this is your co-host

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,128
Kevin coval

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,456
And today we have a hodgepodge of exciting projects

5
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:22,272
Starting with let's

6
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:23,552
Hold on hold on

7
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:26,880
Okay is it a potpourri of iot

8
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:27,648
Oh my

9
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:30,976
Goodness it is a potpourri of iot

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,536
I will never do that joke again I pray

11
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,072
Cuz I asked

12
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:39,936
Cuz I never say

13
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,728
This is a shadow

14
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:44,032
For everyone who is running while listening to podcasts

15
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:45,824
Cuz apparently they're like 5 if you out there

16
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:50,944
Go run run faster faster and for the rest of you hurt slugs like me

17
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:52,480
Just chill it's all good

18
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:54,784
This week on the Smart Home

19
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,088
Prince what do we have we should start off with

20
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:59,392
I got a little testy about smart home stuff

21
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:02,208
Yes you did

22
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:04,512
You cut it off on the whole industry

23
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:05,792
I did well

24
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:07,328
I'm just going to say it

25
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:09,888
Mad I got really frustrated

26
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:10,656
And I

27
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:15,776
To tell you how frustrated I got I basically said the best product out there right now is the Winx

28
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:16,544
Smart home hub

29
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,336
And that that gives you a clue Kevin

30
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:19,360
End of how bad

31
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:20,896
I feel that the industry

32
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:25,248
Oh I know that's bad because I'm like on the wink bandwagon and you

33
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:29,344
Got so many different hugs in the bridges and whatnot that you like me

34
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,112
But

35
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:32,160
The fact that you're saying that the best product

36
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:33,184
In the market

37
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,256
Maybe made by a bankrupt company is pretty telling

38
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:37,536
So my issue is

39
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:39,072
Every

40
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:40,608
Company out there

41
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:43,936
I feel like everyone is basically accepted that early adopters

42
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:45,216
Are going to early adopt

43
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:46,752
And everybody else is just

44
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:49,056
Going to follow them and there's this Acceptance in the market

45
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,336
Sometime

46
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:51,872
People are going to start buying these

47
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,152
Men

48
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:54,944
There's no care for the

49
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,712
Consumer

50
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:56,992
And people just keep

51
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:58,016
Pushing out

52
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,296
Products that

53
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:01,600
Need to be updated in terms of like

54
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:04,672
Like home kid and we even they're pushing out incompatible stand

55
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,464
Nobody is telling a

56
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,744
Coherent story

57
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,512
About

58
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:10,304
What is devices do

59
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,072
And

60
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:15,936
Products are really expensive and people are installing them for the Long Haul

61
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:18,240
Yeah I mean your home is a

62
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:22,592
Tell me the biggest investment that most people make and when you do things around the house

63
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:23,616
Spend that money

64
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:25,920
And you'll do it over and over and over and over again

65
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:27,968
Like you and I do with our Gadget

66
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,760
So that's one aspect

67
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:33,088
Some of these companies aren't even pushing a product or pushing a vision

68
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,624
And then we can have a problem

69
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:37,440
You mentioned you know we've and

70
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:40,000
And Google's thread and all that you know

71
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,536
Nothing's come of that yet

72
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:42,816
Red is a newly launched

73
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,608
Are relatively newly

74
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:48,448
And yeah those products are not really in the market

75
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:53,824
I mean they're backwards compatible there's a couple of things that can be updated the thread if they were using zigbee chips

76
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,896
With homekit coming out basically

77
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:58,432
Anybody who's purchased

78
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,200
A smart home

79
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:01,760
Product in the last to know three years

80
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,808
You're going to have to buy everything new

81
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:05,600
For home yet if so

82
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:07,392
You know everyone's like well orally adopt

83
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:08,416
Do you know that's what have

84
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:11,488
What happens if you want to do

85
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:12,256
The nest

86
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,024
Weave

87
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,328
That's a new protocol that also

88
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:17,376
Isn't actually quite in product Seattle

89
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,400
Won't be till next year is

90
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:19,680
Talk about

91
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:20,704
What is Thatcher thing

92
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,008
Also what if you decide you don't want to

93
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:24,032
Stick with apples

94
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:24,800
Ecosystem

95
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,080
And you want to switch phones

96
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:28,384
I've got all these locks and whatnot

97
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,176
Installed in your house

98
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,968
This is terrible for the engine

99
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:32,992
This is just

100
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:35,040
Terrible it is terrible and

101
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:37,344
I mostly agree with your point about

102
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,952
What's better nothing about the consumer I think most of the companies would argue against that

103
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,488
Hopi prophecy reasons

104
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:46,048
I think really what it is they're all trying to

105
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,840
Innocence I almost blame Apple for this

106
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:49,888
They're all trying to own the experience

107
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:53,472
So they're pushing everything they can at getting

108
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:55,264
You know broad acceptance

109
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,800
Products installed in homes

110
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,848
Getting their apps on everything so

111
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:00,128
People can do stuff with them

112
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:01,408
This is kind of why I like

113
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,944
Amazon's approach because

114
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:05,248
They're pushing your own experience by

115
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,272
Putting out a plateau

116
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,552
As opposed to

117
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:08,320
Putting out

118
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:10,112
Actual Smart Home Products

119
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:16,512
Bright and as soon as I see Amazon embracing or babies other people embracing Amazon and I talked to him

120
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,280
A lot of different

121
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,047
Companies

122
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:18,815
Pushing smart

123
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,351
Sun products

124
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:23,679
Soon as I see more of Amazon so-called

125
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,703
Competitors

126
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,239
Building stuff on

127
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,519
Viecco

128
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:29,823
Play service

129
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:32,127
The Voice servicenow

130
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,407
I will I will

131
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,175
Bailey Bryan

132
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,711
Into it cuz that's really what I want to

133
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:38,271
You know please Google

134
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:40,319
Urm Google is actually

135
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,599
Titus calendar

136
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:42,879
I asked

137
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,671
My echo for my calendar for the day

138
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:46,719
I want to control my Sonos

139
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,487
Over

140
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:49,023
My echo I want to

141
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,559
I want to get Spotify on that

142
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:55,679
And that's a thing I mean it's going to take time for these Integrations and actually I think out of everybody

143
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:58,239
Amazon probably done the best job by putting there

144
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:03,359
Code and SDK is out there and leaving it up to all these smart home product manufacturers to

145
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,895
Use the cloud service or not

146
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:08,991
It's to the point though I were still have to buy so many different unique

147
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,783
Hubs and bridges and things

148
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:15,135
You don't think people don't want and I said it before I don't want all these hugs and prayers only have one

149
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:19,743
Ethernet port on my Google onhub router I don't have room for a bunch of hugs and brushes

150
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:26,655
Well then that's okay I knew I was okay because going back to the very beginning

151
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:27,679
Topic

152
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:31,263
Cause my wink doesn't have to be hardwired to a router it works over Wi-Fi

153
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,847
Hey he works what can I say

154
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:37,663
It does what I needed to do

155
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:38,943
Link is so

156
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:39,711
Temperamental

157
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:41,247
And it turns on my lights

158
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:44,319
If you have much higher standard

159
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,159
And that's okay

160
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,183
My high standard

161
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,231
Interfering with my ability to enjoy it

162
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:52,511
That's correct

163
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:55,839
I'm glad you said it not me

164
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:59,167
Alright well if you have high standards like

165
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,703
You may be disappointed

166
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:01,727
If you don't

167
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,775
Perhaps you should be in the early adopter camp

168
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:04,543
In

169
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,567
Or pick up the wink

170
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:09,407
So so this is my my call to the industry is

171
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,711
Stop treating customers

172
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,991
Like guinea pigs

173
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,807
Especially if you really want us to get beyond the earliest

174
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,855
Because I can tell you

175
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:21,695
People ask me questions about this stuff all the time especially when they find out what

176
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,487
I'm writing about in there just like

177
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:30,143
Stacey how do you spend like that kind of money on something when you know that you know it's going to be obsolete

178
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:36,543
And I'm like oh I'm kind of hoping it's not going to be but but it might be in

179
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:38,079
I have to swear to be okay

180
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:41,919
Then I just kind of shrugged and I say it's my job but honestly if it weren't my job I don't

181
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,455
I can't really canceled

182
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:44,735
I really can't

183
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:47,295
It was amazing to me is that

184
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,831
A Smart Homes are not new

185
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:52,927
Just the consumerization of them I would say is relatively new

186
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:55,487
And even from where we were

187
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,511
5 years ago

188
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,279
5 years ago

189
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,351
Even where we are from 5 years ago

190
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:05,471
We got the basic building blocks in place we finally settled on the right radios and so on

191
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:10,847
And we got pretty widespread compatibility between mobile operating systems to control these things we got voice

192
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,127
Recognition to handle it

193
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:12,895
And yet

194
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:15,199
There are still so many different

195
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:16,735
Ways of doing it and it's just

196
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,271
It's annoying as all get-out

197
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:19,295
I don't even think

198
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:20,319
Solid

199
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:21,599
Be honest but

200
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:22,879
That's okay

201
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:26,463
So that's that was me going postal on the smart

202
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,231
The ministry

203
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,511
Get your stuff together and

204
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,327
But in that vein

205
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:36,703
For those of you guys were Brave out there brave enough we do have a lot of I get the occasional emails from

206
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,727
You guys keep up coming

207
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:38,495
Love it

208
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,775
From people asking

209
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:40,799
Basic questions

210
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:44,127
Kevin I thought this would be a good time to to answer those Bass

211
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,151
Questions on

212
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,175
How does

213
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:49,247
People get started what kind of questions should they ask in

214
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:54,623
Do you know we do this every now and then but I figured now's as good a time as any to kind of go over this so Kevin

215
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,671
What kind of questions should people ask

216
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:58,719
Ask themselves when they're considering a smart

217
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:01,023
Take me like oh I want to have a smart home

218
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,071
Short I mean the end there so many

219
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:07,167
And so and when I can obviously come up with all of them but I can come up with a bunch of the top of my head

220
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:10,239
I think the first thing you want to do is figure out what

221
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,287
Devices you want to control

222
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:14,079
Do you know some people may not care about locks

223
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:16,127
Garage doors and one I just met want lights

224
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:18,431
Timmy want integrated music system

225
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,223
I would make a list

226
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:25,343
And what you want to add first cuz it's tough as we just said does not come cheap

227
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,415
I think in your article you said you'd spent over $3,000 in the past

228
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,695
Er-2

229
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:31,743
Yasso

230
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,535
I was call it what do you want to do

231
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,607
Say you want a smart home

232
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:45,311
Yeah I'm absolutely I'll figure out and prioritize a list of what it is you want to do and I think that's a perfect

233
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,335
Perfect start

234
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,615
And once you do that

235
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:49,151
Then I would say I would

236
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:50,431
Start researching

237
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:52,223
Various hubs and platforms

238
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,247
Because

239
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:56,063
Some of them support certain products emblem support others

240
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:58,367
Certain products and maybe the products you're looking at

241
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,903
Are supported and maybe I want to

242
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:02,975
Pacific garage door opener doesn't work with Samsung

243
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:03,743
SmartThings

244
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,535
Throwing it out there and let me know

245
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,559
Give me an example

246
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:08,607
I think that's your best bet

247
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:13,727
Is to figure out what supported products are on your list work with which hubs and they're going to find overlap

248
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,519
Which is great I think that's ideal

249
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,567
Temperature outside going to find some things

250
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,847
Can't be controlled by certain

251
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:19,871
Certain hubs

252
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:25,247
I would ask if you want to you know do voice activation and control that means you probably won't either

253
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:28,319
Homekit stuff with serious resuming an IOS person

254
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,111
Whenever you go with me Amazon Echo

255
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:33,183
You know nothing there are other we talked about the IV I believe

256
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,975
I would say actually

257
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:35,743
Yes

258
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:37,279
Yes

259
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,303
That is

260
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,071
Emerging

261
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,095
By far

262
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:41,887
Is the most used

263
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:42,655
Way to interact

264
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:45,983
You won't use it everyday but until you can like

265
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,007
Program

266
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:49,055
Like a great rules engine and

267
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,591
All the ones out there kind of

268
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,127
All right

269
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:56,991
It's just so handy in the beautiful thing is I know I said it before but I really think of bears repeating

270
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:00,831
Actual post I wrote four years ago over a cake all about

271
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:06,975
When Siri came out I said this is the invisible interface of the future and that is a beautiful thing because whether it's Siri where there is

272
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:09,279
You're saying Google what you're saying

273
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,559
You know Amazon Echo

274
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:15,423
Anybody can use it as long as I can speak obviously so you're not tied to

275
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:20,543
Everything happening on your personal phone through your personal apps anybody in my family for example

276
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,823
Can turn lights on and off

277
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,103
You know she opened

278
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,383
Close the door and so on

279
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,943
Give me the voice activation that's a beautiful thing as well

280
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:27,967
Those are good things to

281
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:28,735
To start with

282
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,015
Also say

283
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,039
Amazon

284
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:33,855
Dot-com the retail side in their home automation Channel

285
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:36,927
Actually shows you they have a wonderful setup it shows you

286
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:37,951
What devices

287
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:38,719
His work with

288
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:40,511
Yep so

289
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:43,583
That's a wonderful place to do research once you've decided

290
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,119
Hey these are the following sick

291
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,655
6 things I want to do in my home

292
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,703
And you can kind of look and be like

293
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,007
Oh look here all the devices that were

294
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,591
So starting there and then I also had someone ask

295
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,871
Ask me about smart outlet

296
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:03,295
I was just talking about those this weekend and I'll tell you why after you talk about

297
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:06,111
Okay this person wanted to know what

298
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,391
Type of smart outlet

299
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,927
They should install which

300
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:11,999
Dear God that's actually a really hard question

301
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,023
Because they didn't

302
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,815
Ask me anything other than that

303
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:16,095
So there's

304
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,655
There's a bunch of a smart outlet

305
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:19,679
Like a diamond dozen

306
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:22,751
You can get a bunch of soap from a feature category

307
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,287
You can get a smart outlet with

308
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,311
Pretty much any radio

309
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,335
Zigbee Z-Wave

310
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,871
Bluetooth Wi-Fi

311
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:30,943
So I would recommend anyone who doesn't have

312
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,479
Like a hug and doesn't want a hug

313
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,271
You just want to pop a smart outlet in there

314
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,551
Go with a Wi-Fi or

315
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,319
Bluetooth

316
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,087
Smart outlet

317
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,111
Best part Daniel

318
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:42,207
And before you go any further are you are these Outlets

319
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:46,303
Actual replacements for your current Outlets or add-ons to your existing

320
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:50,399
Because that's another question if you don't want to do installation by ripping out your existing Outlets

321
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:53,983
Mostly she just plug right now

322
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:56,543
Caesar daughter picture

323
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:59,615
So some things to look for in these Outlets

324
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,383
This one is

325
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,919
Does it take up your whole Outlet

326
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:04,735
Just think about that cuz like the old school wemos

327
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,271
You played that baby and you have

328
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,551
Like Trader Joe's

329
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,855
And that's no good

330
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:10,879
Think about the future

331
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:11,647
Outlets

332
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:12,927
A lot of the ones on there

333
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:15,231
They monitor your energy usage

334
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,791
Which he might be like yay or you might be like

335
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,815
Screw that I don't need it

336
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,351
I'm paying an extra ten bucks sport

337
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:23,167
Two there's one that offer presents

338
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:29,311
There's actually only one that I know if that's the zuly we've reviewed them which is kind of a cool feature but you have to buy three of them to get that

339
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,079
So if you want

340
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:34,943
Don't do it a lot of them will offer dimmer capabilities on a lamp module

341
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:37,503
So if you're going to plug a lamp in this is great

342
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,551
If you just wanted to turn your Appliance on and off for

343
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:40,831
You don't need that

344
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,623
Let's see what else can these things off

345
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:45,695
Well let me tell you what I was looking at this weekend and why

346
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:50,303
You were kind enough to send me I think for my birthday a WeMo Insight switch made by Belkin

347
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:53,119
And those go for like 50 bucks so they're not cheap

348
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:56,447
Also not too big too big won't lose an outlet

349
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:58,239
It's an outlet just

350
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:02,079
Like any other smart outlet as you would said there's another dime a dozen

351
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,359
What I like about this one

352
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,639
That I can

353
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:06,175
Track the energy usage

354
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:10,271
Both in real time as well as historical and it will tell me my estimated monthly usage

355
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,039
So if you're

356
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:13,343
Plugging in something that may use a lot of juice

357
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:18,463
And you want to keep track of that you can do that right in the app thanks to the outlets with gun additional capability

358
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,743
Lottery winners don't have

359
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,023
That's cool

360
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:21,791
I tend to

361
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,839
Dislike have how do you feel about the WeMo soft

362
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:29,471
It's okay only have one we moved the one WeMo switch I was thinking this weekend about adding another one because we

363
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:34,591
We're going to put a heater in my step daughter's room and we don't want it set to a temperature

364
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,359
Because of

365
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,639
Type of heater that we're getting

366
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,175
We want to put on the schedule

367
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:38,943
So

368
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,527
I thought that we would be good and I can also see how much juice is actually using so

369
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:46,367
I'm okay with it I mean it I just pretty much use the on-off button in software

370
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:49,695
I don't see where yet. Can I get to my wink or any like that

371
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:53,279
That's a whole nother aspect going back to original question

372
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:56,095
Luby's do you want multiple apps or do you want

373
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,119
You know everything in one

374
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:59,423
And right now I got multiple apps for different things

375
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,191
You should be able to

376
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,471
Insight switch

377
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,263
200 not to your wing

378
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:05,055
That's exactly

379
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,871
It's funny you say that because then this could be helpful as well

380
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:10,431
For people who don't know what Hub they want

381
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:16,831
You can actually download the software for these hubs the apps for these hubs that's just SmartThings app or the WeMo app for the win

382
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:17,855
Hub app

383
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:20,671
And in there when it says add a product you can tap that

384
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:23,231
It will show you all of the supported products

385
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:26,047
So that's an easy way to research what sports what is well

386
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,095
Is true although

387
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:28,863
They also.

388
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,143
For profile

389
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,959
Zigbee and Z-Wave which means summer genetics

390
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:33,983
Yeah some of them

391
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:35,263
Just kind of add on your

392
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:37,823
Okay

393
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,895
So that's kind of a little bit for newbies who are like

394
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:44,479
I want to add stuff but I don't know what to do or maybe you're just

395
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,503
Older people

396
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,575
You're your old hands at this in your like

397
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:50,111
I just want to

398
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:52,415
Yeah I don't know

399
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:55,487
Okay so exciting new products on the market

400
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:56,767
Just run down

401
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:57,535
Some cool stuff

402
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,303
Corner

403
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,863
Which I remember if I've ever talked about this

404
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:01,887
But this is in the homes

405
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:02,911
Security space

406
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,447
This is actually really

407
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,751
A cool looking product it is shipping now

408
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:09,567
It's a cool thing because it is a home security products

409
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,847
Four Lake Apartments

410
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:14,431
Safer transient spaces but that made

411
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,199
What is that mean

412
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:15,967
Apartments

413
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:18,015
It was in a box I don't know

414
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,551
A container

415
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:21,599
But it's $98

416
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,879
You got this like

417
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:23,647
Dongle that

418
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,927
A plug into your router

419
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,463
+ 3

420
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,231
Tabs

421
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:27,999
Corners

422
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,791
Open close sensors

423
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:30,815
That you can put on

424
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:31,839
Your door

425
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,375
Windows whatever

426
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,143
In and out

427
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,703
I talk to the CEO of this company and I thought it was

428
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,239
Is vision is basically

429
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:40,543
Just cheap and easy security

430
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,079
Four people and then

431
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:45,407
You know instead of being monitored security what it is is you

432
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,943
You created an app that

433
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,247
Is a circle of friends that gets notified if they

434
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,015
There's a break in

435
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:53,087
I think this is a great value

436
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,879
Three of these for $98

437
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:59,999
I love that I love the fact that these are very unobtrusive looking you probably won't even see them quite honestly because they

438
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:03,583
Kind of blend in with the casing around your window or your door

439
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,399
Musicbee so we got a standard there

440
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,423
Couple things I'm not

441
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:11,775
Keenan I don't have another place to plug a dongle in my router and

442
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:15,103
Not everybody else does either in even if they don't have an onhub they might have something with you

443
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:17,663
Just for ports this gets back to too many things

444
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,711
Being plugged in and also

445
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:23,807
Again this does have an app as you had said and that's what the notifications go

446
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:24,575
Again

447
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:26,623
I would love to see some consolidation

448
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,391
So that everything goes

449
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:30,463
The one that I want a smart home interface not

450
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,231
Smart Home

451
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,023
You know but that's not

452
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,071
Is the new product they could integrate it with

453
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,607
Different holiday credit to credit with

454
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:37,887
Amazon's Echo who knows

455
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:41,215
So that there's a lot to like here in a couple things and I'm like

456
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,495
Improve anyways

457
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,287
Now I will say

458
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:46,079
And talking to people who build these products

459
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:47,615
Wi-Fi

460
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,383
Stability like the way

461
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,175
Link has bad ads

462
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,223
It's about books

463
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:52,991
A couple bucks

464
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:53,759
Steer

465
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,039
Base building materials

466
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,063
Json

467
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:56,831
Retail term

468
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,927
So and I know in talking to the Sea

469
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:01,951
CEO the important

470
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:03,743
If it's super cheap

471
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,279
Because he's

472
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,071
College.

473
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,191
And these are probably

474
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:17,823
Targeted for those folks who don't have any other smart home stuff right now for me you know where the wink hub

475
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,359
Academy support

476
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:21,663
Call correctly so I don't necessarily

477
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,967
Yes I don't need this the stick that comes with the

478
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:24,735
The corner

479
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:28,063
You know I mean I do need it because I tell the projects designed to work right now

480
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:34,207
I know what the audience are going for but you could expand that audience for people who are buying hugs and a

481
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,743
Broader smart home ecosystem

482
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:36,511
You know

483
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,815
I can't see the FAQ is here

484
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:39,839
But if it's

485
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,375
Supports like zigbee

486
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:47,519
Zigbee h a 1.2 wink actually supports that so then you

487
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:52,383
You could actually bring it in it wouldn't have the profile necessarily but you could probably try to bring it in if

488
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:56,223
Yeah I mean I would give it a shot because I don't want that

489
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:58,015
Extra zigbee dongle

490
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:01,343
Add to my router already have zigbee on my network I don't need it

491
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,391
Kevin I don't like dongle

492
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,671
Bojangles

493
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:05,951
See it I'm sitting here

494
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:07,231
You know what I want I want Anna

495
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:07,999
Extra Lutron

496
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:09,535
I can plug into

497
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:10,559
Smart Hub

498
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:11,327
SmartThings

499
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:14,143
Oh because you've run out of

500
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,263
Which by the way guys

501
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,567
I know that I've tweeted pictures and I am

502
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:24,383
In the midst of reviewing are trying out the

503
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,407
SmartThings

504
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,431
Version 2

505
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,455
Bear with me

506
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:29,503
Dying to know I know it's

507
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:32,831
If they really go bye-bye

508
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:39,231
Great I am enjoying putting it on I playing with the software it's a good user experience so far I went in and

509
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:40,767
Tried to do something super advanced

510
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:42,047
Did I mess mine up

511
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:44,351
Not SmartThings fault it was me

512
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:46,911
Just messing things up because I was

513
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:47,935
I was too ambitious

514
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:48,703
See guys

515
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:52,543
So give me give me another week as I try to extricate myself

516
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:54,847
Basically back to life

517
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,639
Spaghetti Smart Home Health

518
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,407
Ya basic

519
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,223
It's a special thing when you

520
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:02,527
My whole family is

521
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:04,831
To hang this to us

522
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,623
Just pick a system in

523
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,903
Stick with it for a week

524
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:10,975
Just tell them that you need a second home and that will be your smart home

525
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:16,351
So so yes that's quarter it by the way it's corner with a

526
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,631
Make a wish you wouldn't know

527
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:20,191
I'm using my hard k sound here

528
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,775
Corner safe.com

529
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,567
With a k

530
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:26,335
So

531
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:27,871
I think Lucy

532
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:29,919
I feel like we've done a good job today

533
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:31,199
Do you have another topic

534
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:31,967
But I don't think we're

535
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,271
Surprise okay okay

536
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:36,063
What about the kitchen in little

537
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:36,831
Products

538
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:39,647
To Baker boards yeah we got to talk about this for all the developers in

539
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:43,743
Y'all are still the kingmakers

540
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:46,559
Play Coyote poop

541
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,351
Okay

542
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,119
So

543
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,143
Exciting things

544
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:53,215
Is Intel announced a new note in Tilden in

545
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:54,239
Sitwell until now

546
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:57,311
Pianos it was a joint announcer with the Arduino folks

547
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:59,615
So they said that they were going to put the

548
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:00,639
Mercury chip

549
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:01,919
Reno bird

550
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:03,967
Which up until now featured

551
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:04,735
What was it

552
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:06,015
Arm-based atmel

553
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,295
ShopRite

554
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:13,695
So actually if I'm not mistaken this is the first shipping product with until scary module inside

555
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:15,487
Even though they shut it off

556
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:17,791
Announced it in January at the Consumer Electronics Show

557
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:21,375
Is it okay well I guess it's not they shut it off also in a fuss

558
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,655
Watch but that mean

559
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,983
That's not shipping yet this is this is actually available

560
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,519
Okay well an Arduino board

561
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:32,127
Yeah so it doesn't look as good on the rest I'll grant you that

562
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:34,943
Geek Chic in some parts of the world

563
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:41,343
So I am eager to hear your experience with this because

564
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:42,367
I know that

565
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:44,671
Some of the major boards that people had tried out

566
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:45,439
Using

567
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:49,279
Which had that had an atom

568
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:50,047
Chip on it

569
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,351
Kansas has the cork I believe

570
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,167
Yeah they had an Edison with a cork

571
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:55,935
On it

572
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:59,007
Nose Edison with Adam those Heretics superhot

573
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:00,543
Ayodhya play with it

574
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,311
A couple of those at the

575
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,079
Maker Faire

576
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:06,943
This is not going to run hot this for this is a 32-bit cork

577
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:07,967
Processor

578
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:10,015
384

579
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:11,039
Kilobytes

580
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:11,807
With a k

581
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,087
Flash memory 80

582
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:14,623
Kilobytes of RAM

583
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:15,647
A digital signal

584
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:19,488
Signal processor Bluetooth LE radio and six-axis sensor

585
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:20,768
This is the tie

586
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:24,352
The type of physical and digital worlds together

587
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:26,912
So what is it this is not

588
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:28,704
Intel Core i7 power dynamics

589
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:29,728
This is not your future

590
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,032
Definitely

591
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:33,312
30 bucks

592
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:35,104
Anda

593
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,640
Yes shipping Now song

594
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:39,712
Sure I have an Arduino board since I could do I want to get this

595
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:42,528
The difference is the chip release I don't I don't know if I'm going to

596
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:43,296
Drop the money off

597
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:45,344
Maybe

598
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,368
So

599
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,648
In another

600
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:48,416
MakerBot

601
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,184
Ford Flash

602
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:55,072
Imagination which is a semiconductor company that does more Graphics chip

603
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,352
Damn

604
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,120
A maker

605
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:57,888
Coyote

606
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,680
Based on the maps

607
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:00,448
Architecture

608
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,824
Mepps man I think I had a pocket PC or PDA with a mips chip in it

609
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:06,848
20 years ago

610
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:12,992
Oh no no no no I'm not I'm not bashing to buy any maintenance great they're still around

611
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,016
Options are good

612
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:14,784
So now

613
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,832
The mips architecture now

614
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:18,624
They're telling us that

615
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,416
End and I have no idea

616
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:22,720
Is this diskin's a little bit out of my purse

617
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:26,304
But they're saying this is great because you know up until now

618
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,328
All of the

619
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:28,096
Other

620
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:30,144
Maker and death boards have been using

621
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,168
You know arm-based

622
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,472
The

623
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:34,496
Pi uses

624
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:36,288
It uses a specialty design

625
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,824
Broadcom SOC

626
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,384
Up until the until announcement that used a

627
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:41,920
Atmel

628
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:44,736
But with the mid stuff

629
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:45,504
This is

630
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,784
Not a mobile

631
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:48,064
Bass processor

632
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,856
This is especially designed for iot

633
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:51,392
Now the specs

634
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,976
Sound too girly iot

635
00:22:55,232 --> 00:23:01,376
Other than it has Bluetooth in it yeah I would agree this is probably more like a Raspberry Pi competitor so you could

636
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:06,496
I still do iot applications and design with it but it's not like Arduino there's a definite difference

637
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:09,824
For one thing is more than twice the price at $65

638
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,848
It's a duel

639
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:11,616
Kormit

640
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:13,152
CPU

641
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:15,456
You correct as Bluetooth 4.1

642
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:17,760
It also has 802 11ac

643
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:19,296
Wi-Fi

644
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,576
An audio DAC

645
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:23,392
An SD card slot switch to me this is more like a

646
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:25,440
A Raspberry Pi competitor

647
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,208
Which

648
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:27,744
Still has tie-ins to 2

649
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:30,048
You know iot and smart home type things you can

650
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:33,120
Do all kinds of things on a runs Linux or Android so

651
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:35,168
This is a low-cost computers with us

652
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:36,960
Oh yeah and I

653
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:38,496
Interesting

654
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:39,520
Cuz I know you can make the

655
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:41,824
Yeah

656
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:43,104
Done

657
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,688
Alright so those are two new boards for people out there who are excited about Mickey

658
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:49,248
18 Hardware Goforth do so let us know which

659
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,272
And

660
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:51,808
I think that's it for the

661
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:52,576
Today Show

662
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:53,344
We will end

663
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:55,136
Stay tuned for our guest

664
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:56,160
Who is

665
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:57,440
Jim heppelmann

666
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,720
Who is the CEO

667
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:05,120
TTC and he's going to talk about using augmented reality in the internet of things and the concept of digital

668
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:05,888
Twins

669
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,424
For your physical stuff

670
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:08,704
And why that matters

671
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:10,496
One of me is scary enough

672
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,056
Best

673
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,104
Don't blame you

674
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:20,992
All right so stay tuned for that

675
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:27,648
Hey everyone this is Stacy

676
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:29,696
Katie Higginbotham and you are back

677
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:31,488
With the Internet of Things podcast

678
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:32,768
And today's guest

679
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:35,840
Is Jim heppelmann who is the CEO of PTC

680
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:37,376
Hi Jim

681
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:41,472
Hi Stacy how are you happy to be here today will thank you for coming on the show

682
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:44,032
So we have you on the show today because

683
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,312
PTC is

684
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:48,384
It has been for like the last 2 years buying up startups

685
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,712
In The Internet of Things you guys started with I think thing work

686
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:52,992
Send keyboard up

687
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:56,320
Heceta and just recently this month you guys have bought

688
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:57,600
Before you from

689
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:58,368
Qualcomm

690
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,648
Is an AR

691
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,184
Play what's a lot of people were like

692
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,280
AR augmented reality in The Internet of Things how does that work together

693
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:06,048
So

694
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,584
I guess we should probably start with

695
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,864
Congratulations

696
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,632
And then

697
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:11,168
What is your vision

698
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:12,448
For The Internet of Things

699
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:15,776
Yeah well thanks again Stacy so

700
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:21,408
You know what we think that what's really happening here is a convergence of digital and physical

701
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:24,736
Elements in the things are the products that we interact with everyday

702
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:31,648
Refrigerator or an automobile or a truck is partially there in front of you in a physical format

703
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:36,000
But it's also partially implemented up in the cloud with analytics and iot

704
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:38,048
It's 04 so we've been assembling

705
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:41,120
A collection of technologies that helped merge together

706
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:43,680
Both the elements of the product but also the

707
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:47,008
Ways in which we would interact with products that are part physical in

708
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:47,776
Buy digital

709
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:49,824
Platform

710
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,872
Helps connect the physical product

711
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:52,896
Up to the cloud

712
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:58,528
And then our cold-light acquisition helped us to perform analytics against the data that we were

713
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:00,064
Gathering Findlay products

714
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,112
And now the beauty 4 U technology

715
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:04,928
Credible ability to go

716
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:08,256
Back to the physical product into projector

717
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:11,328
To augment all of that digital knowledge we have

718
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:12,864
Back under the physical product

719
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:16,192
Dashboard what's going on with the product or

720
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:19,520
Explain how to operate It Works products

721
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:20,800
We can kind of Mary

722
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:23,360
What we know diddly about the product

723
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:26,176
With the actual physical product that's right there in front

724
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,968
So I love this concept

725
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:30,528
Because you called it a digital twin

726
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:33,344
You also called it in Avatar but I kind of like the idea of a ditch

727
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,160
Triple twin because it sounds a little less science fiction e

728
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:36,928
And I think it's

729
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:39,744
Cool idea because and it's a

730
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,048
Easy one for normal people to grasp

731
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:43,584
Switches I have a

732
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,120
Refrigerator in reality

733
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:45,888
And

734
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,192
It's doing everything I normally would expect it to

735
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:51,520
To do but it also actually we're going to stop with refrigerator because

736
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:53,312
Everyone mocks the connected

737
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,128
Let's let's take something a little bit more

738
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,152
More practical

739
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:58,176
I have a Connect

740
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,200
I actually have

741
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:01,504
It has its

742
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,784
Job in reality

743
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:03,808
You know it's a lie

744
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,648
But there's also a stream of digital information coming off of it

745
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:09,184
That I can't actually see

746
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,512
See but it's becoming just as important to me and it's

747
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:13,536
It's this weather

748
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:14,560
Connections

749
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:16,352
Two services

750
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:17,120
So

751
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:19,936
Various different platforms that might be connected to maybe it's

752
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:22,240
But it's also data about you know

753
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:24,288
It might have a temperature sensor in it might have

754
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:25,312
A present sensor

755
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:27,616
So all of these things are also relevant

756
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:28,384
2

757
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,712
Not just me as someone who cares about the light in my home

758
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:32,992
But also

759
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:34,016
Platforms that have

760
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:36,320
That's correct I mean

761
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:41,184
The term Avatar sorted means the digital counterpart to a physical pain

762
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,464
But you're right the term

763
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,512
Digital twin is actually better because

764
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:45,536
Coincidence

765
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:46,816
Born at the same time

766
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:49,120
The point is each time you create a

767
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:51,424
Physical instance of a physical product

768
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,960
You wouldn't react it

769
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:53,984
Digital twin

770
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,288
And therefore all of the experiences

771
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:58,848
And exposures environmental conditions

772
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:00,896
The were experienced by the physical product

773
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:02,944
Can also be experienced by its

774
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:03,968
Digital twin

775
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:08,064
Indifferent any point in time you kind of have a one-to-one mapping between the two

776
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:09,600
This is important

777
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:14,976
Because there are many people that want to know what's going on with the physical product but it's a thousand miles away

778
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:16,512
However the digital twin

779
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:17,792
Is a couple of

780
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:18,816
Lost connection

781
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:22,912
So in terms of the engineers wanting understand how they designs performing

782
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,704
They can check in on the digital twin

783
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,984
What a service technician

784
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,544
Who I wants to understand if there is something

785
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,336
Service needs coming out board

786
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:31,872
To use Predictive Analytics

787
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:33,920
Can interact with the digital twin

788
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:38,784
Wait just one second before we take it to that level

789
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,552
Because I think

790
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:41,344
I want to keep it real simple gesture

791
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,368
For a second

792
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,696
Picture with it is

793
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:46,976
Nnsy

794
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:48,000
Anime

795
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:51,328
Not giving my my listeners all the credit and I'm sorry if I'm not

796
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:54,144
Taking the light bulb example

797
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,680
Cuz I think this is really worth

798
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:57,216
Exploring cuz I think it's

799
00:28:58,752 --> 00:28:59,776
What's before you

800
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:02,080
You're buying this augmented reality

801
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:03,360
Qualcomm hit develop

802
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:06,688
What's in lots of developers use it and it's really powerful in

803
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:07,712
And basically

804
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:09,504
You can hold up your phone

805
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,040
It's your phone that

806
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:14,368
Are there other ways

807
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:20,000
Certainly before you would run on phones tablets and of course my classes okay

808
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:20,768
So probably

809
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:23,584
A lot of use cases in the industrial world with migrate toward

810
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,400
Glasses because they have the advantage of being a hands-free

811
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:28,704
So I hold up something

812
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,472
Like my phone

813
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:30,240
Smart glasses

814
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:32,288
And I if I looked at my light bulb

815
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:33,312
I could actually see

816
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:36,128
See all this digital information that I can't

817
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:36,896
AC current

818
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:39,456
That so I could see for example

819
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:41,760
It would a identify hey

820
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:45,600
Look at the light bulb and it could show me like all the services that I have

821
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:46,368
Connected to it

822
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,648
It could show me like

823
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:49,952
Hey the present sensor says you're here

824
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:53,280
Hey this says it's connected to the Amazon Echo

825
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:54,816
Stacy haiduk says it's connected

826
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:55,840
If this then that

827
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:59,168
These are all theoretical and this isn't what PTC is actually

828
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,704
Doing this is a smart home exam

829
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,472
The listeners

830
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:02,240
Now

831
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:03,520
Jim

832
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:05,824
But I just want people to understand

833
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:08,128
This all could come to light like

834
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,152
Flash

835
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:10,176
Right there and then

836
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:12,224
It could be super awesome because right now

837
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,064
If I look at this late I have to go to an app and try to figure this out after Remember When

838
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,136
I connected it to and there's nothing really on the market that does the

839
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:24,768
So imagine in my garage at home I have my car

840
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:30,912
And my wife has her car parked right next to it and her garage lot and I walk out and I point my phone at her car

841
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:33,472
And it shows me that the gas was a little low

842
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:36,032
And the driver side front tire

843
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:38,336
Isabel law

844
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:42,176
You really should change your transmission fluid because

845
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,712
So disability

846
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:44,480
2

847
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:46,272
Interact with physical things

848
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:48,576
But because of the digital twin

849
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:53,696
The gather all of the information that's specific to my wife's car and map it onto my wife's car

850
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:54,464
Because

851
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,560
And then when I move the phone over and pointed it at

852
00:30:58,816 --> 00:30:59,584
My own car

853
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,144
We've been linked to the digital twin of my car

854
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,936
And we see that the transmission fluid

855
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:05,728
True Predictive Analytics perhaps

856
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:07,264
Needs to be changed so

857
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:09,568
Actually the transmission is glowing

858
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:11,104
When I pointed at my car

859
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,152
Whereas when I pointed it at my wife's car

860
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:15,200
You know perhaps the tire in the yard

861
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:18,784
In the gas tank we're glowing As Seen On TV Gators

862
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,576
What needed to be dealt with

863
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:21,856
You know it's my transmission

864
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:22,880
She was going to be like

865
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:24,672
Hey there's a part of my car that's glowing

866
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:26,720
What's that

867
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,608
Well let me tell you that until the next step would be

868
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:33,376
Homeowner

869
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:37,216
Is a consumer I'm not going to work on my transmission to let's say I wasn't

870
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:39,520
The mechanic

871
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:40,800
I need to work on

872
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:46,176
I could know again using my glasses tablets on whatever look at that transmission and say

873
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:47,456
Explain to me

874
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:49,504
How I would go about service

875
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,088
And it would say well you've got to come over here and open those like

876
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:57,696
And then you need to remove this so I cover panel and then you need to come down here and do that

877
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:00,256
You need to come under the car and drain the fluid here and

878
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:06,912
What is not a general process for a general transmission

879
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:13,312
Specifically what to do for this specific transmission that's right in front of me with full wariness of won't spin

880
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:17,408
Bright

881
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:18,176
And that's

882
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:19,200
Awesome so

883
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,480
You guys have

884
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:21,248
Let's say you have

885
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:23,296
A lot of deals with Industrial

886
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:24,064
Companies

887
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:28,160
Actually got a partnership I think with GE on their brilliant Factory

888
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:28,928
Product

889
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:32,512
How is this going to be implemented

890
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:33,792
With your customers

891
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:34,816
Because there's

892
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:35,840
It's not like

893
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:38,912
One the deal isn't closed yet I think you said you were hoping it be closed

894
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:39,936
Later this quarter

895
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:41,472
So how does this

896
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:44,544
Cuz there's a lot of Technologies involves to walk me through

897
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,824
How this becomes

898
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:50,688
Yell if we take this idea that I have a closed loop with a product

899
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:52,992
Meeting Dad through Internet of Things

900
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:55,040
I'm getting information from that product

901
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:59,136
Two analytics watching that information to find things that aren't obvious

902
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:03,488
And then through augmented reality I'm able to see what I need to know

903
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:05,280
Is a dashboard or an instruction

904
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:08,096
I'm going to get back onto that product

905
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:10,400
This idea of a closed-loop interaction

906
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:13,472
Could be implemented in so many different businesses

907
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:15,008
In so many interesting ways

908
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:19,104
So I think we should just an explosion of possibilities of what things

909
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,896
It what what companies could do

910
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:26,016
People could do it with this type of technology so what we're going to bring to our customers it showed of

911
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:27,552
Technology platform

912
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:28,832
That's a very

913
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:29,856
Fastway

914
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:32,160
To implement some incredibly

915
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:33,696
Innovative

916
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:35,488
Now that we're going to

917
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:38,304
In our Enterprise Solutions business we're going to try that

918
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,376
Pre develop some of the most obvious Innovative use cases

919
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:42,656
But I think

920
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:48,544
So many possibilities here it's going to be very difficult to get the end Solutions all into a box with a bow on them

921
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,080
I think it's dead will be

922
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:52,128
Providing the enabling possibilities

923
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:55,456
Maybe if I could Stacy imagine walking into your laundry room

924
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:56,480
Yeah.

925
00:33:56,736 --> 00:34:00,576
You know my washer and dryer at home have lots of buttons and dials and displays

926
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:02,624
Actually need that stuff

927
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,928
I could just have white boxes and Sheet Metal

928
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:10,816
Washer the dryer it would augment on to the washer or dryer

929
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:12,608
Appropriate digital interface

930
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,888
And then I could customize

931
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,728
So I could say I want a button on the washer for blue jay

932
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:20,032
Get all big load hot water

933
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:20,800
The cold Ranch

934
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:22,848
Etcetera etcetera

935
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:25,664
Whatever I want I'll customize that and say that

936
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,712
Now when I put my phone at my washer

937
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:31,040
In addition to all the standard stuff has got a big button that says blue jeans

938
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:33,088
And I just touch that button on my phone

939
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:34,368
Intruder

940
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:39,232
The washer to configure itself to do blue jeans just the way I like to do blue jeans

941
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:40,768
So you can see it even with

942
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:43,328
Causes to retake the whole way we design things

943
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:45,376
Why put all that human

944
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:48,448
Machine interaction Hardware cost money

945
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:50,752
And you know can be a little complicated

946
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:52,800
Why building a tall is a machine

947
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:54,592
When

948
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:55,872
Wow although

949
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:56,896
I'm going to tell you

950
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:57,664
Two things

951
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,224
One I love the idea of having a programmable button

952
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:01,248
Or two

953
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,296
5 on my washer dryer

954
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:04,064
But

955
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,344
I hate the idea of having the

956
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,160
Carry a phone around for the rest of my days

957
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:10,208
Because none of my products have buttons on

958
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,256
I would I would just die

959
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:13,536
Cuz I I just

960
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:15,328
This is this is a recurring theme

961
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:17,888
So I don't want

962
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:20,448
But I like the idea

963
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,728
To make the world

964
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:22,752
Programmable

965
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:23,776
Through

966
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:25,312
Maybe it's a R&B

967
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:27,104
Programmable

968
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:28,896
Cool with that

969
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:30,176
Very cool so

970
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:31,968
It sounds like you're going to have a

971
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:32,992
Death platform

972
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:35,552
For this and so if I want to make

973
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:36,576
Before it apps

974
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:38,112
And like play around with like

975
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:40,928
Maybe I'm Tesla and I'm like hey this sounds awesome

976
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:42,976
I want to make an overlay for my world

977
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:47,840
Or maybe I'm a hospital that I want to download this and start like playing around with things the nurses

978
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:49,888
Dua for a patient betke

979
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:50,912
That sounds

980
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:51,680
Awesome you

981
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:52,960
AR

982
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:55,520
Certainly I mean I could look at a patient with the

983
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:57,824
Smart glasses are again with my phone or tablet

984
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,616
Who the patient is

985
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:00,640
Everything

986
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:07,040
Any alerts I should know right this moment but also you know how are they doing on the fitness program

987
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:08,832
Body temperature

988
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:12,416
If example anything I could get somewhere volts or from

989
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:15,232
Things like the bathroom scale that this person interacts with

990
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:17,792
I can aggregate together on their digital twin

991
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:23,680
It's all I'm always just comparing the physical to the digital twin and mapping information from one to the other

992
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:27,264
I frankly both directions here and it really gives me

993
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,312
The beauty of the physical experience

994
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:31,616
Which is still the person in front of me I see that

995
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:38,272
But all the richness of that digital information that used to be filed away in databases and I had to look away from the purse

996
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:47,232
Now I can bring that rich information right here into this experience with the person and she both the person and everything I

997
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:48,512
I need to know about the person

998
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:50,304
Soda in the same frame of vision

999
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,864
So right now though my digital twin

1000
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:53,632
Like

1001
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:55,424
I've got a crazy at my house has it

1002
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:57,216
Will twin I have a digital.

1003
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:59,776
Twin but right now all of my digital twin data

1004
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:01,824
Is locked away still in different database

1005
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:04,384
So how are we envisioning

1006
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:05,408
The creation of the

1007
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:06,688
Is digital twins in them

1008
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:08,992
Coming together so like researchkit feels like

1009
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:11,296
A really cool example for the medical

1010
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:13,088
Coalfields of getting that data.

1011
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,112
Come together

1012
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:14,880
Place

1013
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:18,464
I don't see how purple things developing in other Industries

1014
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:20,768
Well I think if you do research on

1015
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:23,328
It's working from NASA

1016
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:27,168
I have the second space shuttle disaster

1017
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,704
They knew on take off

1018
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,520
That a piece of foam had broken loose and hit a tile

1019
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:36,896
And it's suspected that maybe the tile was dislodged they didn't actually have a twin they couldn't stay well

1020
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:37,920
What if we talk

1021
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:41,760
A digital replica of the Space Shuttle and we knock the tile off it

1022
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:44,576
And it tried to simulate the re-entry conditions what would happen

1023
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:50,464
The theoretically could have done that but not in the time frame available to them because they didn't have any infrastructure ready to go

1024
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,536
Ashley pioneered this concept of the digital twin

1025
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:56,608
Which is we want a digital point of a space shuttle

1026
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:59,680
Any point in time by looking at the digital version

1027
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:05,568
We know what's going on with the physical version it's a little hard to look at because it's

1028
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:09,152
Ability to understand

1029
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:15,552
I'm a little complicated here but the basic idea is to have a one-to-one counterpart so for a person that's unlevel

1030
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:17,856
I suppose your digital twin is your social security number

1031
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:20,928
So how could I go and connect elements to Beta

1032
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:22,976
In elements of experience

1033
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:24,512
Social Security Now

1034
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:25,792
Now when we move

1035
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,840
Into the industrial world

1036
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:30,400
We ain't got you like I did your points to be conventional

1037
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:32,704
Because when we try to augment

1038
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:34,496
Information from the

1039
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:37,312
Digital twin positive physical

1040
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:38,080
Counterpart

1041
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:40,896
We want to map it in 3D space as well

1042
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,456
You know if I want to attach a gauge

1043
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:45,760
To a motor on something about machine

1044
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:48,320
I have to know where is the motor on that machine

1045
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:50,624
And how does that change as I walk around the machine

1046
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:52,928
Sit ups and down to Subway

1047
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:56,768
Okay I guess the Internet of Things has a big debt to Nasser that we should

1048
00:38:58,048 --> 00:38:58,816
But not today

1049
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:00,864
Because we are almost out of time so

1050
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,400
Thank you so much

1051
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:06,752
For coming on the podcast I'm a little chilled by the idea of my social security number

1052
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:12,896
And all of the information I'm creating being attached to that but we'll have to work on some security associated with that

1053
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:13,664
And

1054
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,968
You know for people and then four

1055
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:16,736
Devices

1056
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:18,016
I know you guys are

1057
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,040
Already

1058
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:23,392
Adapt it 3D software and all of that so I look forward to seeing

1059
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:25,952
Kind of how this plays out in the real world

1060
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:32,096
But we'll be doing with our digital Twins and how that's going to change manufacturing you want to give us one quick example

1061
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:37,728
Should I walk through a factory in there are many pieces of automation equipment in the factory from different vendors

1062
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:41,824
And I point my phone at 1 after the next on the knees while I get a dashboard of

1063
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,128
How productive that piece of Machinery is

1064
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:46,944
How much you should say odd and what service needs it down

1065
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,224
That's not move on to the next one

1066
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,528
Can I get a whole different experience

1067
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:54,368
Different piece of equipment from a different vendor and you know I'm going to factory filled with them

1068
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,672
What is ability to interact

1069
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:58,208
In a rich interactive way

1070
00:39:58,464 --> 00:39:59,488
One thing at a time

1071
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:00,512
In a way that's

1072
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:02,048
Specialized to that thing

1073
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:04,608
Alex a very powerful exciting idea

1074
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:06,400
Thank you so much for

1075
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:07,168
Coming down the pike

1076
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:09,216
Yeah thank you Stacey

1077
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:12,544
And that concludes this week show

1078
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,616
Thank you so much for listening and we'll see you next week
