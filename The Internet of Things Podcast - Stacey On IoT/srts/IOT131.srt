Kicking it off with the big news which is Amazon

00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:26,880
Then we're going to talk about a super stealthy secret startup

7
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:30,464
IND lighting business that was founded by a former Nest executive

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,256
We've got some drama between an

9
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:33,536
Amazon and Google

10
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:35,584
We've got the FDA doing some

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,120
Cool stuff with companies

12
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:41,216
Kevin's going to talk about his experiences with the Apple watch and

13
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:42,752
He's something he's doing

14

19
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:52,480
And

20
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:53,504
Matt Rogers

21
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,528
David nest

22
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:55,296
Is Ark

23
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:56,064
I guess this way

24
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:58,368
So let's kick this show off

25
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:00,672
With a message from another one of our sponsors

26
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:01,440
Eero

27
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:07,072
Guys you have heard me talk before about Eros 2nd generation mesh wi-fi system

28
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:09,376
It is awesome I have it in my home

29
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:10,400
I do enjoy it

30
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:14,496
The new system contains one zero and then 1/2 too small

31
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:20,384
Beacons and these are little things you plug in that double as a nightlight and they basically

32
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,664
Mesh access

33
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:27,040
Spit make your network bigger so I have one in my garage I used to have one of my roof

34
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,464
Hallway you can buy individual Euros or begins to add your current setup even if you got generation ones

35
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,256

36

48

We are actually adding to our original recording

49
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:04,160
Because Amazon

50
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,440
Secret secret

51
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:06,720
Our secret

52
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:08,000
Where they talk about

53
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,024
Whole bunch of

54
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:09,792
Echo products

55
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:12,864
And of course they did that after we recorded

56
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:15,424
But we love you guys so much

57
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,448
That we decided

58
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,472
We are going to do

59
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:18,496
Just tell you what we thought

60
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:19,776
You kept

61
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:20,544
Keep us down

62
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:22,336
Can I tell you what

63
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:23,872
So I

64
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:25,152
There were two things that like

65
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:28,480
There are two things I was super excited about 1

66
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:30,528
Okay and then one thing I was like what

67
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,344
What day was the Super

68
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:34,880
The echo

69
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:35,648
Plus

70
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,440
This is 100

71
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:39,232
$49 device that

72
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,840
This means it has an additional radio it has

73
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:44,608
Zigbee

74
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:48,192
So obviously it has Bluetooth and Wi-Fi because the original one did

75
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,216
Yes

76
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,496
I should not neglect those

77
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,800
The one aspect about this is

78
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:53,568
You

79
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,848
Can't get rid of

80
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,640
Your hubs that speak

81
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,408
Z-Wave

82
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,944
If you have Z-Wave devices

83
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,480
Because this doesn't have it

84
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:02,016
But if you're only dealing with

85
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,040
With zigbee devices

86
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,320
You could

87
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:10,720
Write this is one of multiple devices they announced today and this is the Echo Plus model which is Jesus

88
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:14,304
Said 14999 and that includes a Philips Hue smart light bulb

89
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,352
Included with it while supplies last

90
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,496
I'm kind of curious and I'm not sure if you know Stacey but I'm kind of curious on the Hub itself

91
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:26,592
Because obviously I have a wink Hub you fuse Dwayne give you SmartThings

92
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:30,432
I bought all these works with wink things now I guess we're going to buy

93
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,200
Works with

94
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,224
Echo thing

95
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:34,016
And they're actually probably

96
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:34,784
NSA works with

97
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,624
Okay well you either way

98
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:43,488
I think bad news for the Lincoln Samsung folks in general

99
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,048
I'm just curious I assume I don't have to

100
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,632
Repurposing my old stuff cuz I can control it now

101
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:51,424
If you've got the

102
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,472
All the existing stuff that

103
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:55,008
It's a lot of it's done over Wi-Fi

104
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:55,776
Anyway

105
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,568
Now what might be interesting

106
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,592
Is if

107
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:01,408
You don't Phillips decided to work with them and they actually

108
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,176
They put their zippy

109
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:04,736
Bulb switch if this comes with it

110
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,016
It just did away with the

111
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,296
Philips Hue hub

112
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:09,088
Right right

113
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,136
Does that mean this is good news for people who

114
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:11,904
Weight hopsewee

115
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:20,351
Which is which is me I don't want like extra hugs extra Bridges and so on I'm still curious the devil's going to be in the details for me because

116
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,375
Cuz I want to see how the

117
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,655
A smartphone

118
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:26,239
Companion app works with this because obviously he's my Wink app quite a bit

119
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:32,127
I'm also wondering you know some of my things are going to get some of them or not is that good

120
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:35,199
PÃ©kin issue here I don't think so but I'm still curious

121
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,479
Yeah this isn't going to support

122
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,807
It doesn't say that it does

123
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:40,831
They would have said

124
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:41,855
So

125
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:43,647
Now

126
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:46,463
So that was my Hulu that's exciting there's also

127
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,487
A new Echo

128
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:48,767
Which is 99

129
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:49,791
99

130
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,887
And this is

131
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,935
Just a better speaker smaller

132
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:57,727
Cloth cover

133
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:02,847
Kilby processing this this to me is the

134
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:06,943
Late competitor to Apple's homepod because that's going to focus

135
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,735
Salon sound quality and

136
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:09,503
Siri

137
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,063
So this should be sound quality and Madame a

138
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,087
And then

139
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:15,135
This is the other devices

140
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,439
Here's the device I'm also a

141
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:20,255
The echo spot cuz it's super cute

142
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:21,535
Askew

143
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,327
Echo with a little

144
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,375
Alarm clock

145
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,167
The little clock face

146
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,447
Did question

147
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:32,799
It's like a modern chumby it's like I'm not as jumpy it is exactly

148
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,591
But how bright is it going to be

149
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:36,127
That's what I want to know I don't know

150
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:38,175
I'm totally buying one

151
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,711
It's $130

152
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,759
129

153
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:45,087
Right right now

154
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:49,951
This is true

155
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:54,559
This is true so this is I guess I almost a replacement for a. In that it's small

156
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:59,423
But it also has a display so it's kind of combined the. Show this would be there if their baby

157
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:03,519
So you can see things on the little screen instead of 2.5 inch display

158
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,591
I thought I read and I'm just double-checking

159
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:11,711
You can get your camera feeds and you could even take a video call this at somebody on your little chunky like device

160
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:13,247
Looking at you and you looking at them

161
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:16,575
Then if there is not a manual cover on that

162
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,343
My camera I do now

163
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:19,903
My bad my bad

164
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,183
Give up a lot of my

165
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:23,487
Right right

166
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:29,631
Sound-wise at 8 probably isn't much better than the. The current. Because it's only a 2 watt speaker very small acts like a smartphone

167
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:30,399
On speaker

168
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,959
All right maybe I'm not going to buy this

169
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:37,311
It's all good

170
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:38,847
Camera

171
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,407
Amazon have a heart

172
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:42,943
Shutter

173
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:47,295
We could probably like make one and a 3D printer market and make noise

174
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:51,647
Low-tech

175
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:52,671
It's not a sexy

176
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:56,767
So there's also a new Fire TV which

177
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:58,559
Not a big deal

178
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:02,911
OIC I like because if they've added they already have a 4K

179
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:06,495
Support in the current Fire TV which is what I use and they've added

180
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:08,031
High dynamic range

181
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:12,383
Which brings out more color pops wider range of color and

182
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,223
Better contrast I have to 4K TV so this is it

183
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:16,991
Ostomy

184
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,271
And then

185
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,551
We got lots of new

186
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:22,111
Skill so they said the vehicles are coming

187
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:23,903
Your Fire TV

188
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:24,671
You could tell Matt

189
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,719
The play catastrophe

190
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:27,999
On the

191
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:30,559
Weather Channel

192
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:36,959
Showtime PlayStation Vue

193
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:39,263
All access NBC Bravo etcetera

194
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,799
They're integrating those

195
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,847
Video content partners

196
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:43,615
Sport

197
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,151
Control

198
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:45,919
Okay

199
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:46,687
Aunt

200
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:47,967
Two more things

201
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:51,295
One we're going to actually talk about this later in the show but we were

202
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:54,367
We didn't know this so

203
00:07:55,135 --> 00:08:00,767
Amazon's introducing routines which allow you to control multiple devices with a single voice commands

204
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,303
All of this. We'll have

205
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,863
Later is actually how to do the Sun

206
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,143
Home so

207
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,167
Prism play Battle

208
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,959
That's still a relevant answer

209
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:09,983
Button

210
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:10,751
4 people

211
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:11,775
Go to bed at night

212
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:15,871
Turn off this

213
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,663
Now you can just be like Madden a good night

214
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,735
Final item

215
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:21,503
Calling

216
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,271
And messaging

217
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,295
To a phone

218
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:24,319
A

219
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,855
Right-of-way / landline

220
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:27,647
And so this is a box that you

221
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:29,439
You buy it reminded me of

222
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,207
I remember

223
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:33,791
It's still around its magicJack 2.0

224
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:34,815
There you go

225
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,351
So yeah it's 35 bucks

226
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,119
The echo

227
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,191
And this sun like Google will dial91

228
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,519
Because this is a landline.

229
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:46,335
Text spacing over. Voice over IP to

230
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,639
Cellular you need to have a lan

231
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:50,687
Right

232
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:52,991
If you're like me and you don't have a landline

233
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:57,087
Same here but

234
00:08:57,343 --> 00:09:00,671
You know this is good because so there are still some people with landline that's that's fine

235
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:03,231
Second as you said $35 is not expensive

236
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:03,999
And it

237
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:06,047
Broadens the range of calling because

238
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,327
Before we could just do like

239
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:10,399
Echo to Echo type calling you those are Echo devices or two

240
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,679
The Echo app

241
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:14,239
Now it's actually going through cellular other

242
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:16,031
Landline phones you can make phone calls

243
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,823
And

244
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,615
Condition of this

245
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:21,663
They're adding we're rolling out

246
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,431
Voice calling

247
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,199
Puyallup

248
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,759
Play Just Like Google home

249
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:26,783
Yes

250
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,063
Yay

251
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:30,367
All right so that's all the Echo news that's fit to

252
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,647
Well talked about

253
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,719
Moving right along

254
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:35,999
Rastelli start

255
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,023
Let's start

256
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,071
Off by tooting my own horn

257
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:39,839
Yes

258
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,167
Last week

259
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:46,239
I have been working on a story all summer long

260
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:49,055
Try to figure out what a company called logo

261
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,079
What's doing

262
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:53,919
And I knew it was some former Nest Executives and who is consumer products

263
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:56,735
Finally last Friday

264
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,015
An FCC notice

265
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:00,831
Application and basically this is a smart lighting startup

266
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,623
So this is from

267
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,903
Eric Charlton

268
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,439
Who is a family member of the Nestea

269
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:09,023
Former head of business he's got people on there from GoPro from

270
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,863
Fitbit Kathy Sanders who was the former CMO it August is actually

271
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,143
Part of this team as well

272
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,423
In what way

273
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,703
Is it as a lighting Prada

274
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:19,519
It is a wifi-enabled dimmer switch

275
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:20,287
Which

276
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,311
Is there two of them

277
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:24,127
Elvis and Wanda

278
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,663
Sativa and

279
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,687
I also

280
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,991
Heard so this isn't in the story that I wrote

281
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:33,087
Time but I also have heard that this is a smart lighting switch

282
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:33,855
Doesn't

283
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:34,623
Choir

284
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,647
Neutral wire

285
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,207
Is really interesting

286
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:45,375
And also in the FCC filing this also has bluetooth support Dimension Wi-Fi but it says both right

287
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,911
It does

288
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:47,935
And

289
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:48,959
Assuming

290
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:53,055
I will assume that it will have mesh capabilities cuz that makes a lot of sense for lighting

291
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,335
Because your phone's name

292
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:57,151
Phone won't always be close enough

293
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,175
Turn it on or off

294
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:58,943
So yeah

295
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:02,271
Again we don't know the details we won't know the details until

296
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,551
Sometime hopefully

297
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:13,791
I'm really excited about it but should be soon because typically want something go through FCC certification it's usually

298
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:17,375
Within weeks or one or two months at most before

299
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,655
Prague is actually launched

300
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:20,959
Formation Apso

301
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:22,239
You know Jose

302
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,031
Christmas almost over so we'll say I

303
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:24,799
October

304
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:25,823
Maybe November

305
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:29,919
And as a lighting aficionado

306
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:34,527
Iams you need more ways to control your thoughts

307
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:38,111
Like I still have some dumb switches in my house and

308
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,647
Got to take out my

309
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:41,951
WeMo dimmer switch because I have decided that it

310
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:45,023
WeMo dimmer switch

311
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,303
Do not put it in

312
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,327
In your bedroom

313
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,095
Very bright

314
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:50,399
Not just when it goes off in the middle of the night be

315
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:52,703
Because it has no internet access but also just in general

316
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,007
Little indicators

317
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:55,775
In a dark room

318
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:56,799
Universim

319
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:59,871
I just to be clear we say dumb switch we're not judging

320
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:02,431
Number one and number two I agree with you on pretty much

321
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:08,831
Any device or switch or anything that hasn't LED I've actually used electrical tape

322
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:12,159
My sister shut off for cover of the LEDs in the bedroom in particular

323
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,695
You're just too bright

324
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,767
If I let it it would look like

325
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:17,535
Like a little like

326
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,351
What is glowing

327
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,631
All right

328
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,911
Next story

329
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,959
Is it a question

330
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:25,727
Issaquah

331
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:32,639
I guess my question is to you because I can't answer it because I do not have an Amazon Echo Show and you do so my quest

332
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:35,711
Question is do you watch YouTube videos on it

333
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,479
Baidu

334
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:37,503
So I

335
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:40,831
We watch gory videos all the time cuz it's right there at the

336
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:43,391
I called the breakfast bar it's where my daughter and I will sit in

337
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,415
Breakfast sometimes

338
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,183
More like hey

339
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:47,231
Madimak show us some Corgi videos and

340
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,255
Pick one and we watch

341
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:56,447
Well I guess you're not doing that anymore because Google has basically shut that service down

342
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:59,519
On the Echo Show

343
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:01,567
So no more videos on Echo Show from YouTube

344
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:02,847
I know

345
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:03,615
End

346
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,383
Why

347
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:10,783
What's that's the thing nobody's talking about

348
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:13,599
Companies don't play nice together you can't buy a Chromecast

349
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:20,255
Google lets you know support certain Amazon services

350
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,535
But I think is

351
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,351
Amazon uses a fork of Android

352
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:26,399
And that is there fire OS

353
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:32,799
They are not a licensee of Google's GMS or Google mobile services that's an agreement that all device maker

354
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:39,199
Your sign if they want include the official Google apps so this is no different than the Fire tablet that's the issue

355
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:42,527
Eric and I don't think it's going to change anytime soon because I don't see Amazon

356
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:46,879
Signing on as a GMS license

357
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:50,975
I don't think it's going to happen I think you not going to get you two back at least not an official capacity

358
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,511
So Google shut this off

359
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,303
Because they were just waiting for

360
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,119
The official statement is at its

361
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:00,703
Ifrit technical problem then I guess you could say well technically

362
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,007
Amazon is not a licensee I don't think it's a

363
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:04,287
A true technical Pro

364
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:10,431
Obviously you can get YouTube running on just about any device and Google

365
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:13,503
So this is not unprecedented by any means

366
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:16,575
But I don't know the stories that I read everybody

367
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:17,343
Open today

368
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:20,671
Nobody's talking about the GMS license which to me is the core issue here

369
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,487
Believe you because

370
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:24,767
Sounds very

371
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:25,791
Not ever

372
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:29,375
Consumer but like as a business person

373
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:33,727
And I think we're going to see cuz Amazon is also pushing really hard on its part

374
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:36,031
To work within its show ecosystem

375
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:36,799
Do certain thing

376
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,359
I think things are getting kind of dirty

377
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:43,711
Smart speaker assistants

378
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,759
Looking good

379
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:48,319
I'm feeling a little down here about this

380
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:50,623
So no more Corgi videos for me

381
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:51,647
But

382
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:52,671
I might

383
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,207
Get better wearables that are

384
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:56,255
Tested by the FDA which

385
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:58,047
I'm kind of excited about I don't know

386
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:03,935
I am super excited about this for a couple reasons one is I think I'm the last show I mention I got the Apple watch

387
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:06,495
Three with LTE and I'm already seeing

388
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:07,519
More

389
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:11,359
Informational Health Data being sucked in by this thing

390
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:14,687
Metrics that I have not seen before which is awesome but

391
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,455
Secondly

392
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,223
When

393
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:22,623
We can start getting these things certified as medical devices and you'll cease consolidation you won't have people have to wear a sir

394
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,415
Turn device to measure save it

395
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,439
You know heart rate because

396
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:30,047
Cuz they have me be at yours me or whatever maybe when that can be approved

397
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:34,143
Certify into an existing device such as

398
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,447
Device you want to wear song

399
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,727
Yay

400
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:41,567
Yes that is awesome and I'm super excited because I would like more

401
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:43,615
Accountability on a lot of these device

402
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:47,967
So you know how I was always looking at these studies from places that talk about

403
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:48,991
Hey

404
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:51,551
This heart rate is actually accurate or this calorie burn

405
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:54,623
Is totally inaccurate so I am looking forward to having

406
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,391
High quality

407
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,671
Jada and then is someone who

408
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:57,439
Who I actually

409
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,975
For a while had to

410
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:01,279
Some heart issues that my heart was fine

411
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,071
But they're trying to figure out why

412
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,351
I kept fainting all the time

413
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:07,679
Let's put you on a Holter monitor which is horrible

414
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:09,471
Battery powered Giant

415
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:10,751
Thing that you strap on

416
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,287
Where all the time

417
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,311
24/7

418
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:16,127
Uncomfortable it's cumbersome and I decided not to do it

419
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,663
Because it was so cumbersome

420
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:19,711
If only I could just

421
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:20,735
Actually use my

422
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:22,015
Fitness watch or something

423
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:22,783
Like that

424
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,063
We here

425
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:24,831
We're close

426
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:25,599
Close

427
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:29,439
Yes I mean the deal is it that certain products such a

428
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:34,815
Those from Apple Fitbit Samsung Etc can get pre-cleared through the FDA

429
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:40,959
And I agree with you on getting some kind of standards for the data because there isn't a smartwatch or

430
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:42,751
Exercise tracker that I haven't tried

431
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:46,591
And the variance in heart rate for example it's just

432
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:52,991
Massive still and we need to have some type of certification says we'll take a little tolerancia no not a wide

433
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:59,391
The data that we have

434
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:01,439
Several times in the past year

435
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,463
However

436
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,999
They announced health

437
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:08,095
Way back with the Apple watch 3 issues ago

438
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,375
They've done a lot here

439
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:12,959
And they should be commended because they're the ones that I think have really pushed

440
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:16,031
More so than anybody else for this type of standard

441
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:21,919
They stopped at every closed ecosystem is sometimes a real pain to get your data out of apple health

442
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:23,199
I give him credit B

443
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,223
Because they have not

444
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,295
I'm going to throw up

445
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:30,111
Cool little monkey

446
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:33,951
I would be excited about this not just for like the fitness and

447
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:34,719
Heart rate

448
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:36,255
But there's also a

449
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,279
A whole.new

450
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,815
Kind of class of things called

451
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:39,583
Shareables

452
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,119
And it's a stupid name

453
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:46,495
But the reason they call it that and not hearing aids is because the FDA certified

454
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:51,615
But there are a bunch of classes of devices that you can plug into your headphone type devices

455
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,919
Put in your ear and you can actually hear better

456
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:57,247
I would love to see some certification moving

457
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:59,551
Forward I'm hearable Zora

458
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:03,391
Being able to actually call them hearing aids and seeing a lot of innovation in that

459
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:06,975
Area because there is so much Innovation happening

460
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,255
On the chip side

461
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:11,071
And on the product side about audio processing

462
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:13,375
The old hearing aids

463
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:15,423
You just going to stick like your airpods or something

464
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,215
Be better

465
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,239
And so I'm actually

466
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:23,103
Maybe not the first thing everyone thinks about when they think about FDA

467
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,127
Pre-certification

468
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:25,407
Or getting some sort of

469
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:27,199
Leniency and developing these things

470
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:29,247
I think that will be a huge area

471
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:33,343
I'm also going to the audiologist

472
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:34,879
Worried about my hair

473
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:37,439
Used to cover music

474
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,207
Can the day

475
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:43,327
Covered it's just a little too much to do we did it

476
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:46,399
Honestly

477
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,423
Let's talk about

478
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,215
Autonomous cars

479
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:50,495
Because

480
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:55,359
Because the sooner I stop driving

481
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:56,383
Happier

482
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:57,919
So

483
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,711
Ford is teaming up with

484
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:00,479
Lyft

485
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:01,759
Tell us about

486
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:02,527
Yes please

487
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:09,183
Yeah this is interesting and recently announced so therefore it has been working in autonomous cars for the better part of six

488
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,487
7 years now they are partnering with Lyft

489
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:13,535
To try and figure out how to effectively

490
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:17,119
Dispatch self-driving Vehicles so if you're a Lyft driver

491
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:20,703
Where I can send Uber driver to you in the future

492
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:24,799
Cedar Tavern

493
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:27,871
Partnering with these Ride On Demand services but

494
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:34,271
Basically just trying to figure out where should we do this with cities what kind of infrastructure do we need to maintain the fleet

495
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,807
And so on and so forth

496
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,087
Customer experience

497
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:41,183
Kind of interesting on how a big car manufacturers starting with a

498
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:44,767
This ride on demand service it's also worth noting that for was one of us

499
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:46,047
First feedback

500
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:52,447
2010 to work on the Wi-Fi connectivity between cars not Wi-Fi in your car but

501
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:58,847
Car talking to another card using WiFi they demonstrated

502
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:01,151
Structure it doesn't use Wi-Fi

503
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:04,991
Uses I believe a spectrum band that is also allocated for Wi-Fi

504
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,527
But it's not

505
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,135
Correct

506
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:13,439
Vehicle vehicle

507
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:16,255
Structurescan Point Smart City it's all part of the same

508
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:17,535
Pay myself yes

509
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,327
Yes they did do that

510
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,119
Actually Qualcomm put out a chip

511
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:21,887
Probably

512
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,167
I'm going to say

513
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,447
Out there sponsored by the way

514
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:30,079
Two months ago it's actually one of the first pieces of silicon

515
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:31,615
Embed allof

516
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:33,919
This vehicle to vehicle and vehicle infrastructure

517
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:34,687
Connectivity into

518
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:36,479
Which is a big step because

519
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,247
Beforehand

520
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:39,039
You know it was all talkative silicon

521
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:40,063
So now they're silicone

522
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,087
People can actually start

523
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:43,135
So that's a big deal

524
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:47,487
So we're actually going to start seeing cars that communicate something to other cars

525
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:48,511
Relative

526
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:55,167
Yeah if I'm not mistaken that Qualcomm chip with a 9150e cd2

527
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:59,775
Which is the first cellular vehicle to everything solution as they say

528
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:01,055
Yes

529
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,847
Yes I never remember the

530
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:03,615
Ship names

531
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:06,175
I'm surprised it's so aptly named

532
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,199
Like because I'm a

533
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:10,783
All right and now

534
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,319
We should move to Kevin

535
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:14,367
Your secret crazy cool project

536
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:15,391
I called your

537
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,464
Play my secret lab haswell

538
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,256
I'm just starting to work on this

539
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:23,328
Sad and it is basically a way to use

540
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:29,984
An Apple Watch or actually any iOS device that has Siri to control non homekit device

541
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,264
Faces by voice

542
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:37,664
There's a project out on GitHub called bridge and are plugins Google or for home

543
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:42,016
She set up the homebridge project on a Raspberry Pi

544
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:45,088
Plugin for wink for example so I could then say

545
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:51,488
Tell Siri to control things on winky another not get certified so that's something I'm working out

546
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,792
Future but in doing all this research

547
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:57,632
Kind of transfer how to do this I realized with the Apple watch

548
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:03,520
People probably overlooked Siri if they don't use homekit Smart Home devices and here's just a little tip that I found

549
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:04,288
When I

550
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:10,688
Want to use my wash to turn on the lights or turn lights off or whatever I actually have to go and open my Wink app on the Apple watch

551
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:17,088
Watch and that's not the quickest thing to do because you got to press the digital crown and a little wink icon in the

552
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:21,952
See your bubbles of apps it's so easy to just tell Siri to open wink or

553
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,000
Open SmartThings when I do that

554
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:26,304
It literally just shows my shortcuts

555
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:30,400
From my Wink app to turn the kitchen light on turn the kitchen light off

556
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:34,496
Don't go talking around on your watch if you're using wink or SmartThings just say

557
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:36,800
Tell Siri to open the app

558
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:40,640
Chicken much faster for you

559
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:43,712
We'll have more information on the project I really get that working

560
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:50,880
Good luck bridge is probably in the same scale is openhab which is my pet

561
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,440
Been working with on and off

562
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:56,000
And I haven't really talked about it much on the show

563
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:57,280
Is getting it up and running

564
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,048
Was just

565
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,072
Not user-friendly

566
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:03,168
Their intention of listeners who are probably

567
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,704
Really Adept at coding

568
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:07,520
Loading things onto a pie or

569
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:10,080
For most people

570
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:11,104
This is going to be 2

571
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,408
Much so that's why we haven't talked about it but

572
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:14,688
I should probably write it up

573
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,712
Put it out there

574
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:16,480
Sometime in

575
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:19,552
We each have our secret side projects

576
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:21,088
Kevin is probably a little bit

577
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:28,000
I'm not a coder I just love tinkering so I'm learning on the way so I don't want people to have an expectation that I can just go

578
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:31,840
Whip up lines and lines of code it takes me some time but there's tons of great

579
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:35,680
Create documentation out there

580
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:38,496
Once I had open have running

581
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:39,264
On my way

582
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,288
I

583
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,056
Could spend

584
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:45,920
Hours it's like a PowerPoint presentation where you start moving things

585
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:46,688
Adjusting stuff

586
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,480
You have that much granular

587
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:49,760
Control over your device

588
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:53,856
So

589
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:57,696
Kevin you should actually tell us a little bit about because when we last talked

590
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:58,464
Have your Apple

591
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,488
Watch with LTE

592
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,816
Oh that's right

593
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:05,888
That's right I've only had it for about 5 days so real quick

594
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:11,264
I am very impressed I think it was well worth the upgrade for me I had an Apple watch

595
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,800
Series 2 that I sold

596
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:16,640
Privately so I have tested LTE calls quite a bit they work

597
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:22,528
Really really well for me I was actually out on a 3-mile run using Apple watch

598
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:28,928
Offering to play music but always to track via GPS and heart rate what you can do with the series 2 model

599
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:30,976
And

600
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:32,256
Friend of mine called me

601
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:36,608
It's about 8:30 at night as I'm running down the street in my local little town and I just

602
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:38,400
Tap the watch to pick the call

603
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:39,936
Did not have my headphones on

604
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:44,288
It was a little challenging for me to hear him because there was traffic going right

605
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:47,616
Next to me I was on the shoulder he said I sounded fantastic I was

606
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:50,176
Shocked so we had a 5-minute chat while it was

607
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:54,016
Keeping up about 8:30 mile pace and I'm like dude there's a hill coming I got to go

608
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:55,040
So I hung up

609
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:57,600
I later tested the next day a call to

610
00:24:57,856 --> 00:25:02,976
That same person while I was taking the dog for a walk out on the trail and I'd this time did have

611
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,000
I had set on

612
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:09,888
He said I sounded the same which was surprising that that speaks to how well the microphone is on the Apple watch

613
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:16,288
I could obviously hear him much better because of being pipe cancer my headphones but on the plus side those are all good things I can connect

614
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:22,688
I can reach out to my family make a call in an emergency

615
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:29,088
I need to work on my notification

616
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:29,856
4 second

617
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:33,440
Things to watch and I'm like it's not important

618
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:35,232
Side detriment here

619
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:41,120
Vacations but all in all

620
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:42,144
Okay and

621
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,216
Do you get a sense that this could be the future of devices like

622
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:45,984
The future compute

623
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,008
The new model for it

624
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:51,616
I would say so and connectivity is liberating when your attitude

625
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:54,944
So from that perspective yes

626
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:01,344
Obviously we have battery life challenges a 10-minute phone call took the watch battery down 10%

627
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,440
For example so this is not a primary phone device I've read reviews and

628
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:07,488
People that sang this is going to be like

629
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:14,144
And it shouldn't you shouldn't expect that when the Box battery is 10% of the capacity of a smartphone battery

630
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,680
Literally so

631
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:17,728
We have to figure out a battery problems

632
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:21,056
Challenges there but yeah I do think you know having that kind of connectivity

633
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:24,128
Are you all the time we had it with the phone today

634
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:26,176
So it's just moving into wearable absolutely

635
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:28,992
Computing and accessed

636
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:30,528
Intelligence as opposed to phone

637
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:33,088
Phone calls cuz

638
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:34,112
Phone calls most

639
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:36,160
Phone

640
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,184
Applications

641
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:38,720
Information so

642
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:43,328
To that point that's really good actually have tested Siri a couple times

643
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:46,912
Just as on a walk just to get information because in the new watch

644
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:48,448
She will actually sweet back to you

645
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:51,776
Which is nice to look at your screen that will only work if you have Kinect

646
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:52,544
So

647
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:56,384
I could try that on an Apple Watch to when you're out and about and don't have your phone with you

648
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,408
Siri is not going to work

649
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:59,200
So by all means this could actually

650
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:02,016
Bring more intelligence to your wearable because it's connect

651
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,808
Write that to me is excited

652
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:05,600
Cuz you know how many times do you pick up

653
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:06,368
Your phone's like

654
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,136
Look up the weather

655
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:08,672
20 minutes later

656
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:12,512
Twitter

657
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:14,304
This is my personal challenge

658
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,584
Well let's pick up

659
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,120
Voicemail so

660
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:17,888
We have

661
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:18,656
Voicemail

662
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:19,680
Jonathan

663
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:22,752
Who is wondering how to handle multiple action

664
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:25,056
So let's

665
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:27,360
Hey this is Jonathan from

666
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,128
Australia

667
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:29,408
Listening to

668
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:30,176
Stacy on

669
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:31,968
This week in Google thank you

670
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:34,272
Not really

671
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:37,856
Planning to be noisy person but now I have the Google home

672
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:38,880
I'm wondering

673
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:40,416
10 MI

674
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:42,720
Get it to do two top with one

675
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:45,792
I want to say to my Google home

676
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:47,072
Lake my life

677
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:50,912
Civil and for the Google home to turn on

678
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:52,448
The TV in my bedroom

679
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:55,520
I don't say maybe play music on Spotify

680
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:56,288
In the kitchen

681
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:57,312
Not really able to see

682
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:59,872
Figure that out I know that's probably not

683
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:05,248
Technical questions but if you can get me through this I'm going to stop buying stuff

684
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:08,576
Thanks Stacy

685
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:11,648
All right I love getting Australian

686
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:14,720
That's my site

687
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:16,256
To I

688
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:20,864
Have done what you asked I done it will talk about it both for your case.

689
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:21,888
With the Google home

690
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:23,936
And also with the Amazon Echo

691
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:26,752
Because a lot of people have those and might also want to

692
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:27,520
Create basics

693
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:29,824
What are scenes

694
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:31,616
Ways that I

695
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:35,200
The first is or the Google home

696
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:37,504
It's company called stringify we've talked about it but

697
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:39,552
Have been purchased by

698
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:40,320
Comcast

699
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:44,160
So I feel like will this be supported

700
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:46,208
But what you can do is

701
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:47,744
Yoodownload stringify

702
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,280
Uconnect whatever devices you

703
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:51,584
Want to it so your Google Assistant

704
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,352
21

705
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:59,008
To go home and what you end up doing is you create a command so like movie night and then you pull in all

706
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:00,800
What's the other devices

707
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:01,824
That work with that

708
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:03,872
Make basically what stringify calls

709
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:05,408
Flow it's a little

710
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:07,456
It's not complicated but it is a little

711
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:08,480
Weird to do

712
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:09,760
If you don't know what you're doing

713
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:11,552
The flows flow from

714
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:13,344
The left rights

715
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:14,880
We do

716
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:17,952
Not everybody does

717
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:20,512
So the flows will come

718
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,352
Pull the devices onto the screen

719
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:25,120
Basically

720
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:26,144
Then you're like soap

721
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,680
When this happens

722
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:28,448
You can do

723
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:31,520
Possibly a dozen I've never gotten more

724
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:34,592
Loso and basically

725
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:35,360
You just say

726
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:37,664
Tell stringify to

727
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,432
Start move

728
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:40,736
And then poop

729
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:41,760
Your scene has been

730
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:43,552
So that software is current

731
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:46,624
Play free and it works really well sometimes there's a bit

732
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,440
It's not a lag exactly but sometimes it takes a while if

733
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:50,720
If you have a lot of stuff

734
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:52,000
Look for it to all happen

735
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:53,536
So be patient there it's not

736
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,560
Instantaneous

737
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:57,888
This is all happening on the server side like after 8

738
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:01,216
Like a good night scene

739
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:02,240
Can take like a man

740
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:03,264
For everything today

741
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:06,848
It's a lot of time to me

742
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:08,896
Yes I mean

743
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:11,200
Yeah maybe you don't do it for things like

744
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,992
I had one setup for when I

745
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,528
Yoga and I would have it

746
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:16,320
It's still very handy

747
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:17,600
Tell stringify to

748
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:19,904
Start yoga in my

749
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,184
Shades will go down

750
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:21,952
My

751
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:23,488
Hue Lights with turn to the

752
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:24,256
Take out soft

753
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:26,560
Color at 50% my Harmony

754
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:29,888
Would come on because to Amazon video that I would do it would come on to

755
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:30,656
Do the Amazon

756
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:31,680
Prime on my

757
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:32,448
My television

758
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:35,008
And my AC would go down to like 75

759
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,032
And that was

760
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:37,824
All of that happened

761
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:39,360
I didn't really

762
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:43,200
Tell you what this I wish we had a localized

763
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:49,600
Version of a string of fire and if that we could run a server at the house at the device so it wasn't cloud-based but that

764
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:51,392
It's just me your next project

765
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:55,744
Olivia other option this won't work for you Jonathan because

766
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,280
You don't have an echo you

767
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:58,048
You have Google

768
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:00,352
A similar sort of

769
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,376
Effort can be done

770
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:03,680
Untrue a site called you know me yof

771
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:04,448
Vendo MI

772
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:05,728
They support the Amazon

773
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:08,288
Echo stringify also supports the Amazon

774
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:10,592
Echo yonomi does not support

775
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:11,360
Google home

776
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:12,128
That I can see

777
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:14,176
Yet so same set of action

778
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:15,712
Very fun

779
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,760
Works well and

780
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:19,040
You can also do things with

781
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:19,808
Gift

782
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:23,648
You can actually so you can do it yes recipes to set some scenes

783
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:26,464
Set scenes

784
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,000
Through stringify

785
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:28,768
With

786
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:30,816
Which is a little weird

787
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:31,840
But if you

788
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:33,120
You really want to just bring that in

789
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:34,144
I don't know why you were

790
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:39,520
I would also say it cuz you've mentioned the word and it's the right word you mentioned work scenes many times

791
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:43,104
And that's really what we're trying to do here in a sentence

792
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:49,504
And what I would do I would keep an eye out on the Google assistant app because they have

793
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,528
Listen to past they have

794
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:51,552
Shortcuts

795
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:54,112
They support shortcuts where you can customize what

796
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:57,184
Your command is what you're going to speak and what it does

797
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,000
But you can't do multiple actions with those yet

798
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:05,888
I would not be surprised if shortcuts becomes word Racine do multiple

799
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:06,656
Thanks

800
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:09,472
If the gas on my car I don't have any inside information

801
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:10,240
But that's

802
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:12,800
Truly missing from Google home and I would

803
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,360
Meet

804
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:18,176
You know I still can't get the actual shortcuts

805
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,712
Work well for me

806
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:22,528
I'm cursed you guys man I try to install all kinds of

807
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,856
In like this week I was going to tell you about the August smart locks

808
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:28,672
But so far my installation effort is

809
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:31,744
Great big brick wall

810
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,768
Star Wars their butt

811
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:33,792
For some reason it

812
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:34,560
Just can't find

813
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:35,584
In the app

814
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,864
It's always something

815
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,448
So yeah this I say this not to throw August under

816
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:41,472
The bus

817
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:46,080
Because you guys

818
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:48,640
Sometimes this is hard and I do this all the time

819
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:49,664
For a living

820
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:50,944
And I still

821
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,736
Hit these weird walls where I'm I

822
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:53,504
Like what's happening

823
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:55,296
The people who sent me this

824
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,624
Persevere

825
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,648
Let us

826
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,696
Take a break for a message from our sponsor

827
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:03,232
And then after that

828
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:05,792
We will have Matt Rogers who is a co-founder of

829
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:06,560
Nest

830
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:08,352
Talking about Nest security

831
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:13,216
Google Assistant it's going to be a good

832
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:14,752
State

833
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:15,776
For all of that

834
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:18,080
Hey everyone we are interrupt

835
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:18,848
AT&T internet

836
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:20,384
With a message

837
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,152
From our sponsor

838
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:22,688
This week sponsor is

839
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:25,504
Qualcomm and I have Raj talluri here

840
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,808
Who is an SVP and GM

841
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,856
Iot at Qualcomm

842
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:31,392
Hi Raj how are you doing

843
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:32,416
Breakfast

844
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:33,952
Call, Ms

845
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:34,976
Well-known

846
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:36,000
As a semiconductor

847
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:36,768
Hair designs

848
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,560
You guys are getting into the smart

849
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:40,864
So people have been talkin

850
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,400
About the concept of the smart

851
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:43,424
Four-decade

852
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:45,216
When do you think it'll be realized

853
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:48,032
Actually very gradual

854
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:50,080
Single event in time

855
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:52,384
You have to come look at the whole ecosystem

856
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,152
Most of us

857
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:54,176
Funeral homes

858
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,456
And I don't just buy like

859
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:58,784
Smart home setup one time you'll be by

860
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:00,576
No one at a time like this

861
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:02,880
Smart TV yellow speaker

862
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:06,976
Light bulbs and so on so what happens is that gradually your home

863
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:08,000
Get smarter and smarter

864
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,560
Problem is the fact condition

865
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:16,960
Because you don't buy them all at once you may end up buying different things from different manufacturers that have various kinds of ecosystems

866
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:18,240
Psychedelics

867
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:21,312
Make them all work together is really dead

868
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:25,664
So what is Qualcomm doing

869
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:29,760
Approach is to build

870
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:32,576
Products that can support multiple protocols

871
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:33,856
Add multiple videos

872
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:34,880
1 SOC

873
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:37,184
For example recently launched

874
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,488
NSLC called UCF 4020

875
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,024
I do that she the first

876
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,096
Chip that support multiple RadioShack Wi-Fi

877
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:45,120
Bluetooth

878
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:46,400
15.4

879
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:48,448
So this device can

880
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,240
Connect to different

881
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:51,008
Protocols

882
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:51,776
Different

883
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:54,336
F-35 customers

884
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,872
Make a product

885
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:58,944
Then what happens is all the different products

886
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:00,736
Different radios

887
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:02,272
Each other and being something

888
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:03,040
No

889
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:04,576
In addition to the physical layer

890
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:05,600
We also put in

891
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:06,624
Enough memory

892
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,392
Time in Australia

893
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:08,416
Austin power this chip

894
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:10,464
So that it can support multiple

895
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:14,816
And so on so that

896
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:15,584
Different

897
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,632
Products from different manufacturers

898
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:20,448
That support different profiles can also intraplate

899
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:22,496
And how do you handle

900
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:23,520
Security with device

901
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:27,616
But why does Noah connected

902
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:28,640
System can be

903
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:29,664
2% + 20

904
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,224
Security Incorporated lot of Hardware basic unit

905
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,248
Features in Terraria

906
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:38,368
Set so that when customers make products using a chipset they're very secure even though they

907
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:39,136
Connect multiple

908
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,952
Where can listeners learn more and get started

909
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:45,024
Qualcomm.com

910
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,816
Flash IRT and get lottery

911
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:58,592
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham and today's game

912
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:00,128
Is Matt Rogers

913
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,152
B founder

914
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:02,432
Product officer

915
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:03,456
Over it

916
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:04,736
Hi Matt how are you doing today

917
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:08,320
It's super great to have you

918
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:10,624
Alright so last week was a big one

919
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:11,648
I asked you guys

920
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:14,208
Launched a security system

921
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:17,280
Upcoming doorbell and made some product updates

922
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:19,072
So we talk about those

923
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:22,400
And we'll get started with just the first Big Sean

924
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:23,424
Can question that everyone's

925
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,448
Asking which is

926
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:26,752
Nest security why

927
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:28,288
Go there

928
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,104
That especially since it feels like

929
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:31,872
Everybody is

930
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:32,640
It's goin down

931
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:36,736
Don't think about building new product want to find out

932
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:39,808
A lot of people actually everyday problems that you have

933
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:43,392
Energy

934
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:47,232
Home safety felt like the next natural extension

935
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:50,304
A lot of our cameras are Nest cams are used for

936
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,584
Security license

937
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,376
Is really unnatural condition

938
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:56,192
I'm already there anyway and you thought about building

939
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:58,240
Security out in Chicago

940
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:06,176
Why use umbrella

941
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:08,224
Okay so what are the holes that you

942
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:08,992
You saw that you see

943
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:09,760
I think you're feeling with

944
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:15,648
Is it still too hard

945
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:17,952
So we serve a lot of people have security

946
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:23,840
The ones that do they feel like

947
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:25,888
A pastor remember the PIN code

948
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:27,680
Did not reach out the door

949
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:33,824
Yeah because of race against the clock for the alarm system goes on when they get back to their home and the middle tonight

950
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,528
Around 90% of time when you're just living with it everyday

951
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,600
As opposed to that 1% of time and you actually I need to use

952
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:48,160
And what kind of features in body that

953
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:50,720
Do we think about

954
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:52,768
We purchase it from several different angles

955
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:54,048
You make it easy

956
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,632
Go to the pin pad if you want to use that

957
00:37:57,888 --> 00:38:04,032
But we don't think most people use that so we created this mess

958
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:08,128
For kids

959
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:17,344
Everything that could be

960
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,880
It is there.

961
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:23,232
So you can open up the best app and disarm you on that way and if you forget

962
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:24,512
Which is xur paper play

963
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:26,560
Did you forget to arm

964
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:28,608
You're on the road are you already at work

965
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:30,656
Will send you notification saying hey

966
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,704
Do you want on your system

967
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,240
And

968
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:36,544
Right now you guys have the

969
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,848
Tags you have some sensors that have

970
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:40,896
A couple capabilities built into them and then you have to

971
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,176
The guard The Hub

972
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:43,968
How other Nest products

973
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:44,736
Work within

974
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:50,368
People use our Nest cams today for security

975
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:51,392
Flying drone

976
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:52,672
You're not there

977
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:56,000
So integrating our cameras with Nest secure was our first priority

978
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:58,048
About the whole experience

979
00:38:58,304 --> 00:39:00,096
What things would you want to know end

980
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:02,656
We've learned

981
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:05,728
Is that the video feed is IQ the most important thing for them

982
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:09,056
To verify that something thrown into home

983
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:12,384
Those who have security systems today usually have false alarms

984
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,944
And the false alarms can be caused by any number of things

985
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,504
Having that video to know what's really going on

986
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:20,320
So

987
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:23,392
Do your phone notifies you that notification itself

988
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:25,440
What's happening in your home

989
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,976
What did you learn for the robbers

990
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:34,656
And at the most basic level they don't want to be caught

991
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:39,264
So they look for homes were doors unlocked and it's really easy to get in

992
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,336
Look for master bedroom

993
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:47,200
So if they see a camera

994
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:50,784
That's already a big barrier that I can work on that house I want to be on sale

995
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,064
I want my face overseas

996
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:55,648
With this I talk to some people and they're at they're looking at this and they're like

997
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:56,416
This is

998
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:57,440
Neat I like

999
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:58,208
DIYs

1000
00:39:58,464 --> 00:39:58,976
Security this week

1001
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:00,256
What's compelling for that perspective

1002
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:01,792
But they're looking at the Price Point Inn

1003
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:02,560
They're saying

1004
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:03,584
Expensive

1005
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,888
And I know that when the nest thermostat came

1006
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,424
That was a big deal

1007
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,448
For many teeth

1008
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:09,728
So do you think this is

1009
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:11,008
Price for the Main Street

1010
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:13,568
We think about pricing

1011
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:19,968
Total cost of ownership with all of our products as well as something that you buy one value over time

1012
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:23,296
There's no contract no walk in those under think so

1013
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:24,832
Yes

1014
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:30,464
First point of purchase it says on the high side and frankly wanted to build a premium best-in-class

1015
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:38,144
Those things always change over time and you want to start at the top and build the best experience possible and things

1016
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:40,960
The premium version

1017
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:43,520
That's the only kind of the value of the product

1018
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:45,824
Is immense compared to cannabutter

1019
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:48,384
Of course you get lots more valuable

1020
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:50,944
Okay I am looking forward to being able to

1021
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,224
Unlock my alarm system

1022
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:54,272
Which I feel like

1023
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:55,296
You guys could totally

1024
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:56,832
That's My Hope

1025
00:40:57,088 --> 00:41:00,160
You're right we could probably do it today

1026
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,768
This is anything that we

1027
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:07,840
You working a lot of beta testers and field testers of our current

1028
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:12,448
And facial recognition technology

1029
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:14,752
Is not ready for

1030
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:20,384
Today is a lot of situations where we still see every once in awhile we'll get it wrong

1031
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:27,296
Especially comes to your home security and safety

1032
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:29,856
Uncertainty but also user in

1033
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:32,416
The one we created

1034
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,488
Play explicit that the users taking the tag

1035
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:43,936
But that doesn't signal enough user

1036
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:45,216
Have you want to ask

1037
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:46,752
That way song

1038
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:48,800
All right

1039
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:52,640
Let's move to the other I thought this was actually a big deal in the announcements

1040
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:54,687
So you made which was putting Google Assistant

1041
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:55,711
On the nest cam

1042
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:56,479
Indoor IQ

1043
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:59,295
And

1044
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:02,367
So it feels like nesting Google are actually

1045
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:06,207
Maybe trying to work a little bit more closely together for a while

1046
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:08,511
There were two weaves there was

1047
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:10,559
Google home and then there is nasty

1048
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:11,839
It felt like they were

1049
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:13,887
Working together basically so what

1050
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:14,911
Can we take from this

1051
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:16,703
About how things

1052
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:19,007
I don't know how have they changed it Google and nest

1053
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:19,775
Are you guys working

1054
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:20,543
More together

1055
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:25,407
We are working very well together

1056
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:26,943
Virgo

1057
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:28,991
We really do working quite closely together

1058
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:34,623
Delete the Google Assistant Nest cam IQ

1059
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:37,183
But we could do in terms of

1060
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:41,023
The eyes and the ears and hands

1061
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:42,559
What you want to do with your voice

1062
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:46,143
Your people use their Google home a lot for music today

1063
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:48,191
Google play me some music

1064
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:49,983
What more things can you do with it

1065
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:54,591
Partnership

1066
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:56,639
Can I check a little bit further

1067
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:00,735
Significantly

1068
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:06,111
Device to device Communication in town

1069
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:09,439
All the way

1070
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:10,463
Okay and then

1071
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:12,255
There's really became Android

1072
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:13,535
So

1073
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:15,583
They're still

1074
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:23,263
Give me an offer exists

1075
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:28,127
Android things is a great package.

1076
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,015
I have to do

1077
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:39,135
So it was really important that allows just started to go and

1078
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:39,903
Grab this

1079
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:43,231
Operating system get some software by some still working

1080
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:45,535
Get up and running size heated

1081
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:48,351
Are you guys using that in your new devices or

1082
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:57,823
We are see my end up in the brain

1083
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:01,407
I'm sure they appreciate the advice you guys

1084
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:03,199
Okay

1085
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:07,807
So you talked actually about feeding some of the nest information

1086
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:10,623
The Google home and I think that's a really important thing

1087
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:13,183
Back in the day I remember

1088
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:13,951
Talking to Tony

1089
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:16,767
Tony fadell about the site

1090
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:19,071
Siri context aware

1091
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:20,351
It feels like

1092
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:22,655
On one side Google has a lot of the machine

1093
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:23,423
Learning ability

1094
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:25,471
To make the sort of context aware home

1095
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:26,239
Possible

1096
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:28,031
And you guys have a lot of the physical Hardware

1097
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:31,103
So I'm curious if that Vision still stands

1098
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:32,383
How its chain

1099
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:36,223
20 left

1100
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:41,343
Setting up my job to keep it going

1101
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:45,951
Admission is not changed at all we are still looking to build the conscious home

1102
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:47,999
To take care of

1103
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:50,559
Turn the World Around It that has not changed

1104
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:52,095
Is anything actually

1105
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:56,191
How do you build that given

1106
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:56,959
The market that we

1107
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:59,263
We have today which is super fragmented

1108
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:01,311
And Boolean products

1109
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:04,383
From a bunch of different places and maybe different operating systems

1110
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:05,663
Mobile devices in the

1111
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:08,223
I don't see them

1112
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:11,551
Yes there's a lot of different varieties of Technologies out there

1113
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:15,135
But at the time the most important level witches have a user's level

1114
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:17,439
That you were able to tie them all together so

1115
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:19,743
Fireworks at Nest program has

1116
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:24,863
Even now

1117
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:28,959
Things to Google assistant so with the apis for the Google Assistant

1118
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:34,591
Michael Anderson

1119
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:42,783
And we'll start school

1120
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:45,599
Most homeowners never have to worry about that because

1121
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:46,623
It's our jobs

1122
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:47,647
To make it all works

1123
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:50,719
Okay and how do you think most homeowners are going to interact

1124
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:52,767
Because I agree with you that a lot of this

1125
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:58,655
Taking place it still feels kind of far off for like an easy user interface but voice was a big deal

1126
00:45:58,911 --> 00:45:59,679
So how do you think

1127
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:00,959
Will call

1128
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:04,543
Intuitive homemade I don't know what to think about this

1129
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:05,311
How are you

1130
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:06,591
Peking that will exist

1131
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:07,615
People winter

1132
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:15,551
Voice is great but you can't use it for everything

1133
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:17,599
So the reality I think we need to have

1134
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:19,135
Variety

1135
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:23,743
But people use phones don't really important

1136
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:25,023
Watches

1137
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:28,607
Interacting with something

1138
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:32,447
And that one day hopefully we will use our watches to tag in and out of her house

1139
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:33,215
An example

1140
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:35,263
Del Sol TVs are greater face

1141
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:36,543
Actually watching video

1142
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:38,079
Everything about having

1143
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:44,479
3 cameras in your home for cameras watching the

1144
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:45,247
TV

1145
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:46,783
Is a fantastic experience

1146
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:51,135
You want to be able to tie all these things together

1147
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:57,023
We have to have teams working on all these different

1148
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:58,047
It's worth it

1149
00:46:58,303 --> 00:47:00,095
I don't disagree with it being worth it

1150
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:04,959
Okay what's a homekit the biggest question that I see coming in is about

1151
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:06,495
These Multi-Device household

1152
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:08,543
Or should I buy homekit

1153
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:10,591
Or should I limit my device

1154
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:12,127
Purchases only those that are

1155
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:16,735
Our home should be locked into anyone platform

1156
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:17,759
You changed

1157
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:19,807
Smartphones every year every two years

1158
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:22,367
But your home is probably most expensive purchase

1159
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:25,183
It's your longest turn asset

1160
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:26,207
Tire home

1161
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:27,231
Switch phones

1162
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:28,511
It doesn't make any sense

1163
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:34,143
So you obviously have a great presence in Iowa

1164
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:35,935
And we're always talking about Apple

1165
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:39,263
Integrated home care experience

1166
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:41,567
We're not there today but one day we will be

1167
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:43,615
