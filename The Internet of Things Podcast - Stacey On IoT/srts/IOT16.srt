1
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:09,984
Hey everybody this is the intern

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,032
Things podcast with your house

3
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:13,312
Kevin tofel

4
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:17,152
Stacy Higginbotham somehow we switched roles

5
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:19,968
I decided I decided I'd I switch it up a little

6
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:21,504
Because today I am a

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,832
Recording for my hotel room in Aspen and Kevin Ware YouTube

8
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:28,928
In the home office in Pennsylvania

9
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:35,840
It is truly wonderful I am here for Fortune's brainstorm Tech event where I've I'm hoping to bring back all kinds of insights

10
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:38,144
About the internet of things that I would share with you next week

11
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,960
I should also note that this week we don't have a guest

12
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:44,032
Because travel uncertainties and we have

13
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:46,080
I guess a lot of the guests this week or traveling

14
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:48,384
Try really hard to become but

15
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,432
People were just like nope can't do it

16
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:51,456
Gone

17
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:55,040
Vacation time so you're going to have to make do with Kevin and I

18
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:58,880
Cuz we we ate are Wheaties this morning had a little too much caffeine

19
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:00,160
Say a little hyper

20
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:04,512
And you also have less oxygen than I do being at a higher altitude so this ought to be interesting

21
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:05,792
Superfund

22
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:07,840
Alright so this week show we're going to

23
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:13,984
Start with some news we're going to move into Target new Internet of Things store and we're going to talk about the wide world of

24
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,520
Sports in The Internet of Things

25
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:18,080
All right

26
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:18,848
So

27
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:19,616
News

28
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:20,896
This week

29
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:21,920
Red

30
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:23,712
We talked about it a little bit last week

31
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:25,504
This week

32
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:26,784
The red group

33
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,552
Which is

34
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:30,112
For those of you guys who did not listen last week

35
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:34,208
Is a wireless protocol kind of Bluetooth

36
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:34,976
4

37
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:37,536
Connecting devices in The Internet of Things

38
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:41,632
And these guys are announcing officially that they are

39
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,936
Launching a certification program

40
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:46,496
Suggest like Wi-Fi products are certified

41
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:48,544
Going to be certified

42
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,848
That certification program will be out

43
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,664
And developed for September of this year

44
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,968
They also announced that Qualcomm

45
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,040
Is joining the thread Group which means that

46
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,064
Companies like

47
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:01,088
Guest

48
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,112
Freescale

49
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:03,136
Silicon labs

50
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,416
Samsung

51
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,696
Everybody is everybody

52
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:08,000
Yes lots of people I'm I'm I'm drawing a blank

53
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,280
There's Big Ass Fans

54
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,048
Since mother company

55
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,584
Where to but Qualcomm

56
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:14,656
You know is it me or is Qualcomm

57
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:15,680
Trying to

58
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,264
Do what they do with wireless charging throw the best way to say it

59
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,360
We had three wireless charging standards and Qualcomm got involved with all three

60
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:25,408
Separate standards hoping to

61
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,200
You know I guess pick the winner

62
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:29,760
Can I get to the about on everywhere's you're bound to win something

63
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:35,904
I think they're doing this as well here because they already had all seen all join and

64
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,952
I'm going to stop you right there because

65
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,232
Austine

66
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:40,256
And all join

67
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:43,328
Qualcomm is a founding member of the all seeing Alliance

68
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:45,632
Call doll join

69
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:48,960
So all join is actually further up the stack

70
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,496
It's not a wireless

71
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:53,312
So it's a little bit different

72
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:54,592
EXO thread

73
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:56,128
Is a wireless protocol

74
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,944
Also that's just the radios and how they talk to each other

75
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:00,992
Is

76
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:01,760
Housing

77
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:06,368
How how once the radios are talk to each other this is actually how the software way up there

78
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:08,672
Talks to each other like how devices talk to each other

79
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:12,256
Alright so they're getting involved in a different layer in the stack but

80
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:13,792
Okay I get it

81
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:17,120
So thread competes with zigbee

82
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:18,144
Z-Wave

83
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,448
Bluetooth especially Bluetooth mesh

84
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,472
And

85
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:22,240
Wi-Fi

86
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:23,776
All seeing

87
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:24,544
Competes within

88
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,824
Games like iotivity

89
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:26,848
Probably

90
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:27,872
Brillo

91
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:30,432
We've we're not sure cuz we haven't seen that yet

92
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:32,480
Yeah probably homekit

93
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:34,272
So that's that's where those off

94
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,808
Right right right

95
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,672
I know

96
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:47,840
It's funny because you know one of the things that we said for years actually before we doing this show is this just so many stand

97
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:48,608
Nerds and

98
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:52,704
Methods and protocols and all it's all very confusing to the

99
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,496
For the young product buyer

100
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:59,104
It's challenging if your do-it-yourself or because you got a hope you're picking the right

101
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,664
Particle products and Salon

102
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:02,944
And

103
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:05,248
I like to see consolidation

104
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:08,576
So I guess in a way this is good but it really doesn't

105
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,368
Consolidate much at all dozen

106
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,136
Will wait

107
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:17,791
Okay I'm waiting here comes some more news that honestly if for the normal and consumer is it going to be

108
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:18,815
Mean much but

109
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,095
Silicon labs

110
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:22,399
Also this week is announcing

111
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,935
Pet products

112
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:26,239
Better made using silicon labs

113
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,775
Zigbee chips

114
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:30,335
They're releasing software that will make

115
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,615
Those chips

116
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:32,895
Updatable

117
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:33,663
To the

118
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:34,943
Thread standard

119
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,735
Through an over-the-air

120
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,063
Cell phone case with a safer bet if you go this route

121
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:43,647
So yes so it's possible that very soon

122
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:45,439
If you have zigbee chips and things

123
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:47,743
Those chips will be using

124
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:50,559
Threat but you as a consumer will never know

125
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:53,887
Right and because there's a certification process

126
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:56,191
You shouldn't have to worry about standardization in the Prada

127
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:59,519
Right and you as a consumer aren't going to actually be looking for assertive

128
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,311
Vacation until after September

129
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,871
Because while they announce the certification program

130
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,151
It doesn't actually

131
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:07,199
This. This is another case

132
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:10,015
Announced thread-like over a year

133
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:12,831
So

134
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:14,879
Again it does not pay to be on the

135
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,159
It's just very mental

136
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:20,255
It's new and it's very expensive that I can attest to and nsu's head

137
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:23,583
We don't know nothing about weave and Brillo because that's

138
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,119
A token question of a will

139
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,655
That work with red

140
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:27,423
Or not

141
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:28,959
I imagine

142
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:29,983
It has to

143
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:32,543
Because they are working with nest

144
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,079
It's separate from

145
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,127
But

146
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:41,503
I can't imagine that Google would spend 3.2 billion dollars on nest

147
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,271
West Indies

148
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:44,063
Was one of the founding members of

149
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,111
Thread for you would be like

150
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,391
Yeah you know what let's

151
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,183
Let's do something to totally does

152
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:56,607
You would think so I agree with you that makes sense however I wouldn't have expected the big nest news

153
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:57,887
The month ago to be

154
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:04,543
We've branded are cameras with Dropcam cameras is nest dropcam's and we've got a slightly updated

155
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:07,359
Well I would expect that that is Tony fadell all over

156
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,639
That is like

157
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:11,711
I have learned so much from my dears at Apple

158
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,991
Let us make a baby

159
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:13,759
HooHa

160
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:14,527
Overall apus

161
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,879
+

162
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:21,695
You know kind of geeky kind of nerdy

163
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,231
Here's some less nerdy

164
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:25,023
This is

165
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,839
Sort of if you like these products

166
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,375
The Amazon

167
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,143
Echo

168
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,423
Now works with

169
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,031
Which we talked about last week not knowing

170
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,311
They were going to do this

171
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:42,431
We were actually talking about will you mention that you spent I think $180 on

172
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,967
120 on

173
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:46,527
Lync light bulb switch work with wink

174
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:51,647
And they also work with the Philips Hue so with your Hue bridge and your Echo you could

175
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:52,671
I'll say

176
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:54,463
Unofficially control you

177
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,743
Wink bulbs

178
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,047
But now you can officially to it

179
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:00,607
Right in doing that actually

180
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:04,191
Also last week or maybe the week before noticed

181
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:07,519
Wink support was listed on the Amazon Echo website

182
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:11,359
I didn't think it was a big deal I just thought oh hey

183
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,639
There's wink support there

184
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:17,247
But then I made a hoo-ha about it last week

185
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,039
I had a scoop and didn't realize it

186
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,575
I did not get it

187
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,903
Will update the although

188
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:28,255
So after I guess over a week of turning my GE link

189
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:30,047
Light bulbs on and off

190
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:32,095
What do little

191
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:34,911
What I know I'm going to go out and buy some

192
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:35,935
What's going on

193
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:38,751
So what's happening is I'll tell Alexa

194
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:41,055
How to turn the light kitchen lights off

195
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:43,615
In all but one will turn off

196
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,919
Let me stop you right there

197
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:46,687
Okay

198
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:51,039
There's something I did learn and covering the non scoop news last week was

199
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:57,695
Where do you have some groups because you can't group them in the Wink app you have to group them in the Alexa app

200
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:59,231
They are grouped in the Alexa

201
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,767
Oh that's a glitch

202
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,559
It is it's

203
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,119
Popping up more and more often is a Different Light

204
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,143
Every time

205
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:08,447
So I have to tell it to turn off twice

206
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,471
To get all the lights off

207
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,263
I'm kind of wondering

208
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:15,615
If there's kind of like you know how it in your browser settings or something you might clear your

209
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,151
Cash

210
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,687
Just clean everything out

211
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:23,551
I'm kind of wondering if there's like a the equivalent in a smart home likely work settings

212
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:26,367
Or in Echo I have no idea cuz it

213
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,903
It kind of feels like that

214
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:28,927
Terror

215
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:31,487
I would say it's worth a shot if you don't mind

216
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:35,583
You know unlinking all of your lights and and rediscovering them and regrouping them

217
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,375
I'm going to bet you that works

218
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:40,959
So again in Aspen now but this is this is the reporting

219
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:41,983
The tappening

220
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:46,079
EXO next show I'll have regrouped and see if that pops up again in

221
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:49,663
You know if this is something I have to do every week I'm going to be like guys

222
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,431
This is

223
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:51,967
This is not

224
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:53,247
This is no bueno

225
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:58,367
Don't you actually don't sweat it while you're in Aspen I can use use the backdoor that that hacker created on the

226
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:00,927
Was it Nightline I forget what TV show

227
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:02,463
They never stopped they never got my

228
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:05,279
We didn't tell you that they got to be honest

229
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:12,447
I could I could do it except for I have to have a physical a person physically there

230
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,007
Button

231
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,871
Or maybe a Roomba with an extension

232
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:26,527
That's what I do I need to build it like a little Servo motor

233
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,831
You don't have it set up to hit the button for me

234
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:30,879
Little bits

235
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:33,183
What you don't have a telepresence robot like the rest of us

236
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:35,231
I do not

237
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,767
Alright so

238
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,839
Next news item which is something cool

239
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:43,935
Spending a lot of time

240
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,471
Target

241
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:46,495
This

242
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:48,287
Is what I've been waiting for

243
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,055
I think

244
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:53,407
I have to go to San Francisco to see it but it sounds like what I've been waiting for

245
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,175
Which is

246
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:54,943
Target

247
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,223
Has introduced

248
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:58,271
A store concept called

249
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,807
Open house

250
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,855
At the San Francisco

251
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:05,951
City Target which is on 4th Street

252
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:09,023
Crossing mosconi Woodbury always get the clothes we didn't

253
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,071
Remember to pack on a trip to San Francisco

254
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:11,839
Exactly

255
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:18,239
If this is a retail concept for selling the internet of things and right now they've got about 50 company

256
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,007
He's in there

257
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,591
So if you listen to the show you are familiar with a lot of these

258
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,127
Companies like

259
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:26,431
Yonomi tile August

260
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,479
Ring Whiting

261
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,271
High IQ

262
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,551
Keep going on I'm

263
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:34,111
Sonos Philips Hue

264
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:37,439
Mimo which is a baby monitor kind of concept

265
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,487
Jawbone

266
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:44,607
I got the whole lineup in there are so many

267
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:45,631
It looks

268
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:46,399
Amazing

269
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:51,007
This is a story-within-a-story concept right kind of like how Samsung

270
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:53,823
Puts in their little mini stores in Best Buy's and such

271
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,871
Yes now this is the only one

272
00:10:56,383 --> 00:11:01,503
This is not a concept that is going to expand for now this is a in the basement of this

273
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,807
The single Target in San

274
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:07,135
The idea is there working with these vendors

275
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:10,463
To show off connected devices you can go in and buy them

276
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,999
But what's really cool

277
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,279
Is a setup

278
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:17,119
Scenarios where you can see exactly how the stuff

279
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:17,887
Can work

280
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,679
Singly and

281
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:20,703
Importantly

282
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,727
How it works

283
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:22,495
Together

284
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:24,031
So it won't show you

285
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:29,151
Onesti's partner so it will show you things like how I always talked about like the works with Nest concept

286
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:32,991
With like the Philips Hue Lights that I like so much where if you're

287
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,527
Nest set to away

288
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:36,063
Your Philips Hue Lights will just

289
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,087
Turn off

290
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:41,439
Or if it's a two-way for more than a day your Philips Hue Lights will go into like a random

291
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,719
Keto on and off pattern

292
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:44,511
Should I boil burglars

293
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:47,583
So it shows you those things are shows you that

294
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,863
Sonos working in

295
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:55,263
Conjunction with the mimo baby monitor so if your baby starts stirring the Sonos can be turned on to play White Noise or

296
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,055
Lullaby so maybe the baby will go back to

297
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:57,823
Asleep

298
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,103
Maybe you can make your phone ring

299
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:02,687
I was like that is actually not my phone ringing that is that is Street noise

300
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:03,711
Permit Aspen

301
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:05,503
There's apparently a

302
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:09,087
But they had a pray for you very nice very nice

303
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:15,487
I love this idea for two reasons one of the obvious reason is it shows and expose of the cancer

304
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:18,303
Consumer to really what's going on in the iot world premiere

305
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,351
A retail level of a real

306
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,399
Use case experiential kind of

307
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,423
Kind of thing

308
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,703
More importantly though

309
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,239
I see these types of

310
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:29,055
Concept homes every year

311
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:31,103
At the Consumer Electronics Show

312
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,895
The difference here is

313
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:36,479
When I go to CVS I go to one vendor's Booth such as

314
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:39,039
Spell can they show me their home field with WeMo

315
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:41,599
Going to go to somebody else's Booth me show me all of their products

316
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:44,927
This is showing all of the different vendors working

317
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,975
Gather and that's really key

318
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:52,351
So the closest I've come to this is Donna which is the back-end behind Staples connect

319
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,143
Possibly some other

320
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:54,911
Products

321
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:59,263
Where they located are located in Pennsylvania I believe

322
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:05,151
That's right I do remember them asking me to come out I guess I should go over you should go see it it's it's this concept in Pennsylvania

323
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,223
It's actually really

324
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:12,063
So you could see this without going to Sanford

325
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:14,623
But it is so powerful to see this

326
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,903
Because most people

327
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,183
Do not buy these

328
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,975
Product you're going to buy a device

329
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:20,511
The one-off reason

330
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:23,583
And the one on his case and sometimes that one-off use case

331
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,887
Is really not that compelling

332
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:30,751
Paying 60 bucks for a light bulb because it changes color

333
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,799
Or because it's connected to your phone

334
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,847
Ridiculous

335
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:40,479
If Stacey doesn't weekly sorry

336
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:45,343
It's because I have all of these other people's voices in my head

337
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:48,415
With other people

338
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:50,463
A lot from a person to be like

339
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:54,815
Yes I know that my connected doorbell will flash the lights when it rings

340
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:57,375
Alerting me to who's at the Emmy that's

341
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,143
That's just

342
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,727
Angry people have it in their head up a smart home is

343
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:06,079
You know something like The Invasion on Star Trek for example where everything does work together

344
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,615
All these different things going on

345
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:10,687
And yet then they go in their buy one product or like this isn't what

346
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:14,271
Gene Roddenberry promised me this is a light bulb that changes colors what do I do

347
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:18,111
Showing the whole home showing how these things work together is

348
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,391
Really the value at

349
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,439
And showing which things

350
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:26,047
Work with which other things so the only other place that does that is Amazon

351
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:32,959
Because it's online you can actually separate in their home automation Channel which products work with which other products

352
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:34,239
I spend a lot of time

353
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:38,335
And it's one of my favorite places to buy devices because

354
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,127
A good prices

355
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,663
It shows

356
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:44,479
What other things can work with what other things in

357
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:49,087
Most retailers don't have the resources to either constantly update that

358
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:51,647
I mean like when I come into Home Depot a lot of the time

359
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,975
Is like the cencap jumble that is like hassled out

360
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:57,535
Spot it hasn't been updated

361
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,327
3 months am

362
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:03,679
So target has basically combined the information

363
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,727
Hopefully it stays up to date

364
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:06,751
Did Amazon

365
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:07,519
Can provide

366
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,287
With

367
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:10,335
Feel like demos that CES off

368
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:13,407
With like some clear lucite furniture that

369
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,431
Looks cool I guess

370
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:17,759
And like the ability to play with all these products in real life

371
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:18,783
In real life in this

372
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,575
The store experience

373
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:21,855
And

374
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:26,719
It's supposed to be disliked living lab so if you buy stuff and you hate it or it's glitchy like

375
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:29,535
My GE link lights are right now

376
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,815
You can bring them back

377
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:32,863
And there's no restocking fee

378
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:36,191
When I talk to you David Newman who I'm hoping to get on the podcast

379
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:36,959
He was like

380
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:43,359
You know we're going to look at that as an opportunity to do consumer research you know you bring them back you tell us what happened and we're going to talk to the

381
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,383
Manufacturing be like

382
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,919
Hey what's up

383
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:46,943
Awesome

384
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:50,527
I love it I love it guys I think this is just amazing

385
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:51,807
It's a lot of work

386
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:52,575
But

387
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:54,367
I think it's a really interesting

388
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:56,671
I'm telling right step in for the startups

389
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:59,999
Hopefully when you man comes on the show Hill talk about how startups

390
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:02,559
Can get involved because he wants to actually have

391
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:08,959
Startups come and show off their products even before their maybe even available to do consumer research which would be gracemore

392
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:09,983
And it's March

393
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:14,079
And this is at the Metreon Target in San Francisco and it's in the basement you say

394
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,103
Yes in the

395
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:17,919
That sounds dank and dark but it's not thinking

396
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:22,783
If they have a glass stairway I mean you know there's a good chance it'll be successful

397
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:25,343
It took last year

398
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:27,647
Just saying if it's lucite

399
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:30,463
Clear acrylic Furniture everywhere

400
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,999
They Stitch you stuff looks great

401
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:35,071
All right so I'm excited about this I can't wait

402
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,095
To go and see it

403
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,631
If you guys are in Sanford

404
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:38,399
Francisco

405
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:40,959
Check it out report back

406
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:41,983
Can let us know

407
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:42,751
And

408
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:43,775
When we have to

409
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,823
Keep listening because sometime this summer

410
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:46,591
David Newman

411
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:50,943
Who's in charge of this is going to come on the show and tell us all about what they've learned so far hopefully

412
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:51,967
And how you guys can

413
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:55,039
Thinking about all right final news item for the day or not

414
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,063
Just things

415
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,599
We're talking about thinking about is

416
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:58,879
Wimbledon

417
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,415
Or specifically tennis

418
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:03,743
I guess it would be tennis specifically with

419
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,023
Yeah that works too

420
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:07,071
Yeah yeah I don't play tennis

421
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,095
Well I did one

422
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,167
What about you

423
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:18,847
Play on occasion I'm away from the ratchet tennis courts down the street public tennis courts so every once in awhile when running

424
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:21,151
Get some exercise will go and I'll head ball

425
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,711
Really that's my problem I can never hit the ball

426
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:26,271
That's kind of thumb the most important part

427
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:27,551
That's that was my

428
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:30,623
So is there something in the iot world I can help you with the ball

429
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:31,903
Maybe

430
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,695
There is there are connected raqqa

431
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:36,511
I think my general hand-eye coordination

432
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,535
Even the information

433
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:38,303
Connect

434
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,631
I was reading this

435
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:43,935
Put out a piece of content marketing

436
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:44,959
Antenna

437
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:45,983
And

438
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,287
Contact Marquis

439
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,359
This was actually really interest

440
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:52,639
And

441
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:53,407
He talked about

442
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,943
And I don't know how to say this

443
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:58,015
Babolat

444
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:00,063
Belittle

445
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:04,671
So this is a I believe it's actually a French

446
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:07,743
Direction compass

447
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:12,607
Connected tennis racket

448
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:14,655
And because they make

449
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:17,215
Connected tennis rackets they believe that by 2020

450
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,519
Everybody will be using smart tennis racket

451
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:22,591
That's because they are just so amazing and what they do

452
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:25,151
How you move the racket

453
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:28,479
How the ball hits the racket the strength of your serve all of this

454
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:29,247
Information

455
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:32,063
And they're transmitting it to the players

456
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:38,207
Real-time but also making video analysis immediately after the matches available to them

457
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:40,255
Yeah this is a this is actually a

458
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:41,535
Market that we

459
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:47,423
Probably should talk about more when we talked about IRT and and big data and such as a sports Market

460
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,727
Because there's so much information

461
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,519
Available or

462
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,567
Well it's hard to get that information

463
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:57,407
Without sensors in you know the tennis ball soccer balls whatever maybe

464
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,711
Golf clubs now on tennis rackets

465
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:05,599
You know that's all feedback to athletes didn't even Spectators I mean like I'm always watching golf

466
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:09,439
And they have the little ball Tracer that shows where the ball is going after

467
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:12,511
It's been hit the swing speed the height and all this

468
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,047
It's just amazing and it

469
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:15,839
It's more immersive experience both

470
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:18,655
Observer and probably as an athlete

471
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:20,959
To travel information it's just we don't

472
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:22,751
I don't think about it that much

473
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:28,895
What I thought was really kind of interesting as IBM talks about giving some of this data out to like

474
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:32,991
Coaches so you could actually coach someone playing against arrival

475
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,271
Based on this data

476
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,575
Yeah so

477
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:38,623
I mean if you feedback in the incredible

478
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:39,391
Inside

479
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,927
That that to me was just kind of

480
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:41,951
Crazy so

481
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:49,631
Idea was imagine playing against big Champions like Rafael Nadal

482
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:51,935
Which

483
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,983
I don't think that's possible and so

484
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,519
If the other thing is

485
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:58,079
This kind of information from the racket

486
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:00,127
Befuddled real-time 2

487
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:02,943
You know a smartwatch which could deliver

488
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:04,735
Haptic feedback to a person

489
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:08,319
But I know that on Wimbledon you know they don't allow coaching

490
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,087
For the sidelines

491
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:10,879
And I don't

492
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:13,951
No sale of smart watches at Wimbledon but you know

493
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,511
You can get coaching almost immediately

494
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,279
From a smartwatch

495
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,047
Watch which means

496
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,399
I think they would disallow that in competitions but it you know it's 4

497
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,423
Amateur

498
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,447
Regular people

499
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:25,983
That's pretty useful

500
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,007
Yeah

501
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:29,311
Well it is not just your equipment

502
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:31,359
I mean equipment is the first thing

503
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:32,383
Because you know you

504
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:33,663
You've got

505
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:37,247
It's obvious that the instrument equipment

506
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,271
PocketInvEditor

507
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:43,647
It's also something that people already spend a lot of money on if you're even a amateur

508
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:46,207
Actually if you play a sport very seriously

509
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:48,767
You're willing to spend a crazy amount of money on it

510
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:49,535
Oh yeah

511
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:52,095
So we're going to start seeing like sensors in clothing

512
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:53,887
You can already buy

513
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:55,423
Sensor embedded shirts

514
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:57,983
Socks 511

515
00:20:58,495 --> 00:20:59,007
Oh yeah

516
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:02,335
How do you make the

517
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:03,359
Best

518
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:06,687
That has sensors and it to monitor my heart rate

519
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:09,759
And my respiration rate and so on so when I go for a run

520
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:12,575
It's real time sending that information right to my phone

521
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:13,599
Did it help you

522
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,623
I got tired

523
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,232
Give me good feedback

524
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:25,632
All joking aside I like to work in certain heart rate zones for certain types of workouts like my Speedway

525
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:27,168
Working at Temple work

526
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:30,752
And I'm going too fast or I'm working too hard. I shouldn't

527
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:33,056
Be running out fast for temple workout

528
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:36,384
I can keep that speed up for 3 miles then obviously

529
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,408
It's going to be a wasted effort

530
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:40,224
So long-term yes I can help absolutely

531
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,528
Did it give you feedback right away

532
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,552
Pick it up later

533
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:44,832
No real son

534
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:49,440
I would think some sort of it wasn't a screen or was it have

535
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,464
On screen

536
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,488
So haptics

537
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:58,912
Sure if I if maybe you could set Target zones for the heart rate and have the data sent to the watch and when I

538
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:02,240
Too high new mattress too high you need to slow down

539
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:05,568
How do you get a double tap if I'm going too slow and get a single tap Shore

540
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,104
Cuz that's that's what I think

541
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:09,152
Really awesome

542
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:15,808
Absolutely and you know all these sensors don't have to be embedded in these things going back to the tennis bed and I and I said

543
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:19,904
Because there was a Kickstarter That was supposed to deliver in January still hasn't so

544
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,464
I'm not advocating go get this by any means but

545
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:28,608
They have a company came out with a shot stats Challenger to a way to make your tennis racket smart

546
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,168
It literally is it it looks like a

547
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:34,496
A racket dampener for people who do play tennis and what that is

548
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:38,080
Except it has a small screen on it's got sensors inside and you can

549
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:41,920
Measure you know the speed of your swing the speed of your servant

550
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:44,992
The angle of the racket when you hit the ball and so on so

551
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:48,576
Yeah you can add these to regular tennis rackets

552
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:53,952
I'm sure it goes for all types of sport II I've seen things you can attach the golf clubs for personal information so

553
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:57,280
If we don't have to embed all this right in this equipment is what

554
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:01,632
I'm really intrigued by a kind of all of these option

555
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:03,424
Where they might come from

556
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,752
Eventually you should be able to stream all this data into Lake

557
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:08,800
Android Fitbit or Android Wear

558
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:10,080
Is it a better way

559
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:12,128
Which one which one

560
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:13,152
Google Fit

561
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:13,920
On Android

562
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:16,224
Google Fit Android Wear or

563
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:17,248
Healthkit

564
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:19,040
And perhaps

565
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:19,808
You know

566
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:22,880
You could use that to track you know your burgeoning shoulder injury

567
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:23,648
Who knows

568
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,184
If that's a potential

569
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,976
I wish I had more to say about the

570
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,768
But since I don't play tennis or

571
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,048
I don't that

572
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:33,888
Let's let's be honest Thrillers were talking about is cuz it's kind of cool name babala

573
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:35,680
Baba black sheep

574
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:36,704
I was excited

575
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:38,496
Window tinting idea

576
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:40,544
Play ideas like how this changes

577
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:42,336
And how it changed

578
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:43,872
Because

579
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:47,200
There's a lot of ways that Sports

580
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:48,736
With the Advent of

581
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:51,296
More data like it changes the way you

582
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:52,832
Plan your defense

583
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:57,696
It also changes the way that you could

584
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:58,976
Potentially

585
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:00,000
Compete

586
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:03,072
Can a single person Sports so Lake

587
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:05,376
You know what everyone has SmartWatches coaching them

588
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:09,216
How does that change the nature of the game does it make it faster does it make it

589
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:11,008
You know more precise I don't know

590
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:14,336
Will sit in some sense once you add the technology

591
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:18,432
Kind of brings a different way of competing at if you look at you know formula

592
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:22,272
1 cars and all the technology they have in there I mean these guys

593
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:25,344
Are constantly tweaking the code of their cars to make them

594
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:28,672
Have an advantage over other people's code in their cars and

595
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:35,072
It's going to be very interesting to see how that develops in terms of competitive Sports in general

596
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:39,168
You know every time I've gone to a supercomputing show I always see the Formula One guys

597
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,496
Actually there it's like the the racing teams

598
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:44,032
They're there because that's

599
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,312
Important

600
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,080
Cardiff

601
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:46,848
Competition

602
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:48,640
It would be very interesting

603
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:50,176
Sensors become such

604
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,456
An important part of

605
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:56,320
Cheating because these Sports don't normally kind of give a nod to technology

606
00:24:56,576 --> 00:25:00,160
We need to link change sensors on the NASCAR so we don't have any accidents no no

607
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:01,696
I don't know if you are

608
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:06,304
I am just going to date that you're very more mechanical and electronic in those car

609
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:07,328
It's very

610
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:09,376
I still use manual

611
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:12,448
Tachometers for example they don't even have speedometers so

612
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:16,800
It's very much a mechanical sport compared to say Formula One

613
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:18,592
I don't people like the exit

614
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,128
Isn't that part of the

615
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:22,688
People in them certainly do not but

616
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:25,504
Yeah I mean I'm not going to lie there's a there's definitely

617
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,320
Portion of a Nascar fan base or racing fan base that

618
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:30,624
Watch it for the big one

619
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:35,488
It's kind of a Bittersweet saying I don't like you probably don't know this

620
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:37,792
Mention it

621
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:40,608
I'm not this past weekend but the weekend before there was a

622
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:42,656
Terrible accident where

623
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:43,936
At the finish line

624
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:44,704
Karwan

625
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,032
Up and over to other cars and into the catch fence at

626
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:49,056
Daytona

627
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:51,360
And literally the entire car

628
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:54,688
Went to Pieces the engine flew out for example

629
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:55,968
The front end was gone

630
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:59,552
Basically nothing was left with the roll cage in a little bit of sheet metal and

631
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,600
Thankfully do the safety

632
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:04,416
The driver did not get hurt he walked out of it but it was

633
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:08,512
Touch and go for the first 30 seconds after that happened me people thought this man was dead

634
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:09,792
And there were actually

635
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:11,072
Spectators that

636
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:14,912
Were injured from debris that didn't get caught by The Catcher And so

637
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,216
I mean it's nice to hope for these accent

638
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:18,240
Sputnik

639
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:20,032
Can be careful what you wish for yes

640
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:26,944
Well gosh that is such a grim. I kind of don't want to end the podcast I will send you that the YouTube video this crash and you

641
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,248
You will be will be scared for this person's life

642
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,552
Of course you know at this point he's okay but yeah

643
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:33,856
All right we'll add that to the show notes

644
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:34,624
Maybe

645
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:36,416
I'm like

646
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:42,048
I don't even know rather Grim so let's let's bring finish the show on an uphill and say it one more time

647
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,072
Pop-A-Lock

648
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:45,632
Or father later

649
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,424
No actually I

650
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,192
I realized

651
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:49,984
Time 45 minutes

652
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:50,752
Device

653
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:51,776
Review

654
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,080
All right

655
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,360
This week's device

656
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:58,944
Home connected doorbell

657
00:26:59,200 --> 00:26:59,712
It's actually

658
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:00,992
It's the doorbell.

659
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:07,136
And to get the doorbell you actually have

660
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,160
To sign up for their monitor

661
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:09,696
Security system

662
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:12,000
But

663
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:13,536
People likes this

664
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:17,888
Doorbell so much they actually got 40,000 new sign ups

665
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:21,472
Jasper the freaking doorbell which is amazing

666
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:24,032
Just so you know what you're getting into

667
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:26,336
What you do Vivint offers

668
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:27,872
Connected homes

669
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:29,664
This is not a DIY project

670
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,712
Normally I don't mess with these but

671
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,552
I thought it was either I was kind of going through a connected doorbell phase

672
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:37,856
And I thought it was so interesting that

673
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:39,904
They were one of the first to offer

674
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,440
A video doorbell

675
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:43,488
I did I decided to happen

676
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:45,792
Install it so they came out and installed it be

677
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:47,584
Because this is that kind of product

678
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:53,216
They charge between 54 and $70 a month for a monitored home security product

679
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:55,776
The pricing differential there's three levels

680
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:58,080
It basically offers you can feel

681
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:59,360
Levels of storage

682
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:01,152
I'm in different levels look like

683
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,688
Connected devices

684
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:03,968
So they work with

685
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,248
Z-Wave devices

686
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:09,856
So they will also connect you up with other Z-Wave devices in your house

687
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:11,648
Nice which is kind of cool

688
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:14,720
Actually set up my SmartThings controller is a secondary

689
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:16,768
Controller it will actually go into that

690
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:19,584
Completely different podcast

691
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:21,888
Because it's it's worth talking about

692
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:23,936
The doorbell

693
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:24,960
Because

694
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:25,984
I liked it

695
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,776
It's a nice-looking doorbell

696
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:29,568
The most doorbell

697
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:33,408
Video connected doorbells it is the smallest of the

698
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,176
Ring

699
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:35,712
Skybell

700
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:36,992
Didn't

701
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,528
Doorbell trifecta

702
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:40,064
It is

703
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:42,368
About an inch and a half across

704
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,160
It's about 3 in tall

705
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,208
It looks like a doorbell

706
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,488
Which is really important

707
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,512
Because

708
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:50,560
Sometimes people get to my door

709
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:51,328
And they're like

710
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:54,400
Button

711
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:55,936
What do I do

712
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:59,520
The other nice thing about this is they come in and install it

713
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:02,848
They also is installed with a

714
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,176
And again you're going to be paying for it every month

715
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:10,528
So when it's installed

716
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,808
What happens is

717
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:13,600
If someone Rings your doorbell

718
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:18,464
It comes up on a security panel that they install in your house as well so you could video honest

719
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,768
On the security panel to touch screen panel

720
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:24,352
You also get it on any of the phone's you hook up to the doorbell

721
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:27,424
So I get a notification on my phone it rings on my phone

722
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:29,728
I'm in it sounds like a doorbell chime you can

723
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:32,032
China variety of chimes

724
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:33,824
And it will also bring

725
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:35,360
Your

726
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:37,408
Manual doorbell chime if you want

727
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:38,688
At 2 actually

728
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:39,712
No it does

729
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:41,504
It only rings through the

730
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,040
Doorbell chime

731
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:44,576
Sound through your touchpad

732
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:46,112
I like you guys

733
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:48,928
Forget that forget the

734
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,232
Ndk

735
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:53,280
Video it is instantaneous

736
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,304
So

737
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,072
It's pretty sweet

738
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:57,632
I will say because I spent a lot of time on the phone

739
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,960
That feature is less exciting to me because

740
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:02,496
I'm on the phone so

741
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:03,520
I'm not able to

742
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:06,336
You you can open Allina conversation with someone

743
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:09,408
You know what they're at your door and be like hey what you doing

744
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:11,456
Upstairs come on Inn

745
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:12,736
Hey

746
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:13,504
I'm busy

747
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,784
Leave the package at the door

748
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:18,624
Can you do that through the the display panel you can

749
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:22,976
Okay so you could you know hope put your phone call on hold or whenever mutant

750
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:25,280
Kind of. You just can't do it with the phone when

751
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:30,144
And I particularly can't because I have some weird phone issues

752
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:31,424
Attleboro

753
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,448
Well I have

754
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:34,240
I have the Moto X

755
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:35,264
Second generation

756
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,032
Verizon

757
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,312
Which

758
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:40,128
What's Mia it takes me off of the data Network when I'm going to

759
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:42,176
Recess

760
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:43,968
But that's a very

761
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:47,296
Unique it's a Unique Ink although if you

762
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:51,904
And everyone in your family has on the Verizon Moto X 2nd generation or a

763
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,304
That's better get fairy

764
00:30:58,816 --> 00:30:59,840
What is interesting though

765
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:01,376
And if you hate

766
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:04,448
Having if you don't want to do if you don't want to go DIY

767
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:05,728
This is a crate

768
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,288
Product because they will actually set up

769
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:10,080
Garage door open

770
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:14,176
They set up a garage door opener so it's like the UPS man

771
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:15,200
Ring doorbell

772
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:19,040
You can actually from your phone or the control panel

773
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:22,624
Open your garage and tell the UPS due to leave it in your

774
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,184
Garage and then close the garage door behind the

775
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:29,792
You can do that from your office like 20 miles away from your house you can do it

776
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:31,072
Inside your house

777
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:31,840
It's pretty sweet

778
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:32,864
Sandy

779
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:33,888
Attendee

780
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,168
So

781
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,216
Night vision on this thing is nice

782
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,776
Steel division on it is nice

783
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,080
What other questions do people have

784
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:43,616
About connected doorbells Kevin

785
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:45,152
Is it hard wire

786
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:50,016
Or is it is there a battery it is hardwired into my existing doorbell

787
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:51,808
And that was a nice thing about having them

788
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:54,112
Install install took about an hour

789
00:31:55,648 --> 00:32:01,024
Yammy most people have a doorbell wired doorbell anyway I would think and so it's a replacement for that direct replace

790
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:01,792
Yes

791
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:05,888
If I'm not mistaken these are the folks who also

792
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:09,728
They're did you a whole package here I mean like as you said you got the doorbell and they have

793
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:12,288
The garage door opener they have connected door lock

794
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:15,104
Calm have in house wifi cameras

795
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,152
But I think they also offer internet service

796
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:20,736
They do they have actually internet service in some places

797
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:22,272
Yeah

798
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:24,320
And they have a whole home automation f

799
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:26,624
I'm thinking

800
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,648
And this is important

801
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,440
Unofficial open

802
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:33,280
Internet home automation service although they are

803
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:34,560
Planning

804
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:36,352
But they don't have it now

805
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,424
So while they actually hooked up my

806
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:40,960
The secondary key

807
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:41,728
Control

808
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:44,032
So I could tie my SmartThings in through this

809
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:45,824
I don't know what they would do that for every

810
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:46,848
Ketchum

811
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:48,384
Did you offer lotion

812
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,920
Motion sensors door window sensors

813
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:51,712
It all of it's based on Z-Wave

814
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:53,504
So if you're a Z-Wave

815
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:57,088
Send or have Z-Wave stuff they can link your existing Z-Wave stuff in

816
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,112
Got that

817
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:01,184
You know what that's it is not bad so if you're like

818
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,208
You're kind of like

819
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:06,304
I've been gandaras monitored home security so if you're getting your like

820
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,584
I like monitor homes

821
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,352
Security

822
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:14,496
And if you if you decide to go with these guys

823
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:16,288
And you're going to pay the monthly fee

824
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:21,152
Do they give you the hardware cuz that's a pretty common

825
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:27,552
There you go you sign up you pay this and think of you I think it's up to $1,500 worth of the hardware free

826
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:29,088
How to control panels like 9

827
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:29,856
Hundred of that hard

828
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:30,880
Wow

829
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:34,208
Yeah the sky control panel is $900

830
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:36,512
I'll stick with my iPad thank you

831
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:38,560
Yeah it's a nice nice piano

832
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:39,840
So

833
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:43,168
Gay that smoke alarms carbon monoxide

834
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:44,704
Video cameras

835
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:45,984
Thermostat

836
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:49,568
Why did their offer no package just like a lot of the

837
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:51,872
Traditional isps are starting to do now

838
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,992
Yeah and it it's got cellular backup and it's primarily a cellular system

839
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:58,528
Which is what a lot of

840
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:01,344
The modern ones are which is great people like me who don't have

841
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:06,464
Yeah that's we still have the old ADT system and no landline now so

842
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:09,280
We haven't used ATT system in years because of that

843
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,608
That is that is our

844
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:13,888
Our product

845
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:15,168
I like it

846
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:21,056
I think it's kind of fun if not convinced enough to pay $54 a month

847
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:26,688
Ford although my husband in this biscuits into something and we're actually talking about paying

848
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:28,736
The monthly fee for monitored security

849
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:30,528
So if we do that

850
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:34,880
I will probably use Vivint and I will do it because they have this doorbell product

851
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:36,160
So

852
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:42,304
I'm not in their target audience I'd rather do it myself but you can even with the struggles and

853
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:45,632
I was getting things to talk to each other but there is there's definitely a big Market

854
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:49,728
Yeah well and the fact that I can bring in my SmartThings stuff I'm kind of like

855
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,264
Hey

856
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:53,056
