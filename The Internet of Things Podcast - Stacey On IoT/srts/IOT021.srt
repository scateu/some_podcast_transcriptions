00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:12,032
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast

2
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:15,104
This is your host Stacey Higginbotham and your other hoes

3
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:16,384
Kevin tofel

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,432
And today show is going to be

5
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:21,760
How to say mostly about the Amazon Echo

6
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:23,040
We will call her

7
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:24,576
She who shall not be named

8
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:25,600
Because

9
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:32,000
I turn her microphone off so she can't hear me which is good but you're right today it's a it's a veritable potpourri of small

10
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:32,768
Smart home discussion

11
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:35,328
Indeed why was he better other

12
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:37,376
Our listeners who might be

13
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:39,424
They might also have

14
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,192
An echo

15
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:43,520
Oh yes yes

16
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:45,056
Or email sessions

17
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:47,104
Emails from people who are like

18
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,128
Nevermind

19
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:49,920
Turn down my echo

20
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:50,944
Knock it off

21
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:54,016
Will try really hard but you never know

22
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:56,064
I catch my husband actually all the time

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,112
Whatever

24
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:03,232
I do the same thing

25
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:05,792
It's okay people you can say thank you

26
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:07,584
Is it shows you're polite

27
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,864
Even to our robot

28
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:10,144
6

29
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:12,960
So this week's big news was that SmartThings

30
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:13,728
Which

31
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:17,312
Listen to the show you know that I am a huge fan of SmartThings

32
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:20,128
SmartThings support has come to the Amazon Echo

33
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:21,408
And

34
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,432
It's awesome

35
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:23,456
I

36
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:26,016
Promptly when I saw it hooked it up

37
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:28,320
And have been playing with it and

38
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:30,880
I'm going to say it was a bit of a let-down

39
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:34,720
Show that build up and it was just a little

40
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:38,304
Why what's the matter say I don't have any smart things stuff here

41
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:41,632
So I will say I live in a smart home divided

42
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:42,400
Because this

43
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:45,984
So I have already moved over all of my lights

44
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,800
To the wink Hub because the wink had been

45
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:49,568
Hooked into the app

46
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,128
So I've been playing with my lights

47
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:53,920
For the last couple weeks

48
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:54,944
I'm

49
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:56,992
So I had no lights on

50
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:58,528
SmartThings

51
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:00,832
So when I moved

52
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:04,928
My SmartThings stuff over I was really curious like what would actually show up

53
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,976
In the answer was

54
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:08,256
My Sonos

55
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,328
Valley Vet because

56
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,376
Right now

57
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,912
The echo doesn't suck

58
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,960
Support a lot of the sensors

59
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:17,728
And

60
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:20,032
Z-Wave switches

61
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,824
That I have

62
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,896
In my smart my SmartThings gear is mostly

63
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,688
Motion detectors

64
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:29,760
Samsung smartthings multi-sensor

65
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,296
My zwave locks

66
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:32,576
And

67
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,880
Z Wave automated blinds

68
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:38,720
And I didn't I meant to hook up my Z-Wave

69
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:43,072
Outlets to see if I could turn the coffee pot on and off from it but I did get a chance to

70
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,864
So say to next

71
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:46,656
So

72
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:48,448
None of them showed up

73
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,984
And there's actually a really

74
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,264
Good reason for this

75
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,544
Well for some of it

76
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:57,920
Amazon decided that you know maybe it's a bad idea if you say something like

77
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,200
Alexa

78
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:02,016
Open the back door unlock the back door

79
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:05,088
There's no like password or anything

80
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,160
Associated with that so you know anyone could just like

81
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:14,816
Turn open window shop for the echo to unlock your back door that's okay that's a fair point

82
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:17,632
So it was kind of a security

83
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:19,424
Concern

84
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,704
Maybe that's why

85
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:21,984
See that

86
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,008
Coming anytime soon

87
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:23,776
Perhaps

88
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:26,848
The downside is you can't do something like

89
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,128
Alexa

90
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,152
Go to bed

91
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:29,920
Or

92
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,456
Get upset your house

93
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:32,480
Good night

94
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,040
Make a scene

95
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,064
Yeah

96
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,856
Don't make a scene

97
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:40,160
She will not be making any seeds

98
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:42,720
So

99
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,768
In what I send you the locks which I actually

100
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:48,608
We just installed you will find that I actually put one on the wink

101
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,912
Just to see if the wink would actually

102
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,448
Except the

103
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:54,752
Z-Wave locks as well it doesn't

104
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:56,288
Oh now.

105
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:58,080
You're gone but you're still getting the locks

106
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,616
Deal with it

107
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,176
Okay

108
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,480
So that is

109
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:05,760
That is what I learned

110
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,296
Interesting

111
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,576
Well guess what's this

112
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:13,440
It's funny because a blog post on the SmartThings blog Ashley went live

113
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:18,303
Before Amazon officially announced it and then the block was pulled because

114
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:24,191
Amazon I guess was ready to announce it so we knew this was coming last week and then shortly after

115
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,983
Ibloom we we found out

116
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:28,031
But there weren't a lot of details on what

117
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,567
What SmartThings

118
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:33,663
Devices where I should support you says the Hub and some devices

119
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,991
And I'm still digging on Amazon site can't find it

120
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:40,063
I did just want something very interesting though it's interesting

121
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,623
Yay but also disappointing boo

122
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:49,023
Brightness control is now support on the osram a19 bulb which is bulbs that I bought because those are the ones that are color

123
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,047
Tunable color temperature

124
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:52,351
Shoe Carnival

125
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:55,935
Connect to the osram a19 bulb Astra actual blood

126
00:04:56,191 --> 00:05:02,335
They spell it wrong on their website vlug

127
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:05,407
Means require SmartThings Hub so even with my wink hub

128
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:07,199
I have the right pelvis but not the Hub

129
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,991
Who is getting frustrating now

130
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,271
Oh well

131
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:16,671
It's okay because at the end of September it looks like SmartThings is going to have a new

132
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:19,999
Hub as a SmartThings consumer I got an email

133
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:21,279
Last week

134
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,559
I want to say

135
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,351
Let me

136
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:26,143
Pre-order a new hub

137
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,423
From SmartThings

138
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,983
That would be out by the end of

139
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:36,383
Two things here and moon is going to be a step back just I know it meant to SmartThings before I just want to

140
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:39,711
Real quick to the history this is the

141
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:43,039
Brand that went on Kickstarter 2 or 3 years ago

142
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,575
One of the earliest brands

143
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,111
In this market I think

144
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:49,695
And was later purchased by Samsung so everytime we say smart things

145
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:52,767
What time does Samsung own property to show folks know that

146
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:56,351
And secondly my question is for what is the new Hub going to bring

147
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,399
Okay I knew you were going to ask

148
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:00,703
I'm sorry

149
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,031
I'm allowed to make a scene

150
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:06,079
Okay so

151
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,615
I was testing SmartThings

152
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:08,639
In my house

153
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:09,663
Sign June 23rd

154
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:12,223
So that's what that's how old the hub's a Time

155
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,247
Currently running

156
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,807
I know it's like ancient

157
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,087
Old man

158
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,391
Now the new hub

159
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,951
I talked to Alex Hawkinson

160
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:24,511
The CEO of SmartThings

161
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,791
Back at CES

162
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,607
And he told us it was going to have

163
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:30,911
Couple new radios in it

164
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,703
Mostly to keep it

165
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:36,287
Online so right now if my SmartThings Hub goes

166
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,567
Loses power

167
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:41,151
And internet access it goes offline

168
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,199
And it won't do anything

169
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:43,967
I think so

170
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:44,735
Now it gets

171
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,759
A full-on brain

172
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,295
Naked cellular backup

173
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,063
If I want it

174
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,111
If I want it

175
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,135
I don't need it

176
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:52,927
Cost a lot more extra

177
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:56,767
In the Hubble add Bluetooth smart

178
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:57,791
Now

179
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:01,375
This was all back at CES that they talked about this

180
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,399
And

181
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:04,703
It was supposed to launch in May

182
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,751
But I think what happened was

183
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:10,079
Adding support for homekit kind of push this back of the

184
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,871
So

185
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,479
I think what's what we're seeing again is that that delayed homekit kind of

186
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,247
Time frame

187
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:21,087
I'm expecting that will hear more from smart

188
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,111
Things very soon

189
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,927
I've reached out to them hopefully

190
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:25,951
Willard Moore

191
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:26,975
And

192
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:29,279
I know that I will probably be in line to

193
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:31,583
Order myself a brand new SmartThings Hub

194
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:34,655
In keeping with that house divided theme

195
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:39,519
So back to the Echo and kind of the SmartThings integration because people with

196
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:40,799
A Sonos

197
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:42,591
Might be interested to discover

198
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,127
How this works

199
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:46,431
Yeah I'm curious I don't have a Sonos

200
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:49,247
And I probably won't get my meds so curious how they integrated

201
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:50,527
So

202
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:53,343
Sonos through SmartThings is known as a lab

203
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:56,159
Which means it is not officially supported

204
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:58,207
Because Sonos doesn't officially

205
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,487
Support anybody's

206
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,535
We're all very hopeful

207
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:02,815
All of us being

208
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:03,583
Domino's Pizza

209
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:06,655
So what it does is right now

210
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,959
You can use your Sonos

211
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:11,775
Speakers is basically like the voice of your smart home

212
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:12,543
And

213
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:15,615
You can also play a existing playlist

214
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,663
So if your Sonos

215
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:18,943
Is currently playing

216
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:21,503
My Sonos one or any one of my Sonos

217
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,319
Sonos is always playing one of my daughters like

218
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:26,111
Top 40 pop hits playlist

219
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:27,647
Anyone

220
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:30,463
So now I can tell Alexa

221
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,023
Sorry I

222
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,583
Just wake up everybody staying as a bad person

223
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,375
I can tell the Amazon Echo

224
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,399
Play

225
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,423
Kitchen

226
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,727
Oh no I have to say turn on

227
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:42,495
Kitchen

228
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:43,775
Sonos

229
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:47,359
Cuz that's in my in my SmartThings

230
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:49,151
It is labeled kitchen Sonos

231
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:51,711
Okay and you have to use the same nomenclature

232
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:54,271
Sure is the same keywords kind of

233
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,039
As

234
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:57,855
Lights turn on kitchen Sonos turns it on

235
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:01,695
And it plays wherever it stopped playing last

236
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:02,975
Only place that playlist

237
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,279
And then I can say turn off

238
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:08,863
The only things you can do

239
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:11,167
Turn up the volume you cannot fast forward

240
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:18,079
So it's a very minimal it's an on-off switch essentially by voice at this point which is very similar to some of my lights even though they

241
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,359
They are dimmable I can't

242
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:21,151
Use the brightness controls got so

243
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:23,199
It's interesting that it was straight

244
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,991
Even though we're getting these integration

245
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:27,295
Since we're getting them piecemeal innocence and

246
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,575
Eminem

247
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,367
Probably okay for most people

248
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:33,183
There for you and I've been doing this kind stuff for several years

249
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,719
Anthony a little frustrating

250
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:39,327
Yeah the only thing basically the only thing I can do with the echo

251
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,863
Is lighting related

252
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,143
And DeSoto

253
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:42,911
Narcissus

254
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,215
I know it's Sonos

255
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:49,567
Don't make a scene

256
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,895
So that is

257
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:54,175
That is what we've discovered

258
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:55,711
Now I got

259
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:56,991
I want to say

260
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:00,831
15 or 16 devices now hooked into

261
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:01,599
The wink hub

262
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:02,623
Across

263
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,671
Sorry no

264
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:08,767
15 or 16 devices into my Amazon Echo

265
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,815
If I count the hue

266
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:11,583
As a hub

267
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:12,607
I've got it

268
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,375
3 hubs

269
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:16,191
Sonos devices are now

270
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,983
Going into the echo

271
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:21,055
Which allows me voice control basically

272
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,591
Of all of the lights

273
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,359
But I have Kinect

274
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,407
Which is actually pretty

275
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,687
Cuz now I have

276
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,735
Have a group for outside lights

277
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,527
Have a group for downstairs

278
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,807
Which turns off every light down

279
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,855
And I have a group

280
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,135
Kitchen living

281
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:35,903
Dining

282
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:39,231
Pizza Patron basically a group right

283
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:40,511
It's okay

284
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,047
You know I'm liking it

285
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,071
I think it's fine

286
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,095
And

287
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:45,631
Yeah

288
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:49,983
Blunt one other question I suspect your setup is similar to mine and that

289
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,799
You have one Amazon Echo not multiple units

290
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,591
You probably also have it

291
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:57,407
Either in your bedroom or your office or somewhere near that

292
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,431
I actually have

293
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,199
Have my downstairs

294
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:04,319
Oh okay well then it's opposite because I have mine right next to me in the home office

295
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,599
And

296
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:08,927
I kind of feel like I'm missing out because I when I'm downstairs

297
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:09,951
Not working

298
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:14,815
You know I'm basically using my smartphone apps to play with the lights and so on and so forth order on timers and such

299
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:17,119
You also have the remote

300
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:21,471
We do have the remote and we it's it's sitting on

301
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:23,519
It's actually in my bedside table drawer

302
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:27,359
And we don't actually use it because the Bluetooth in the remote

303
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:29,151
Because of the distance

304
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:31,455
I have a little dodgy

305
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,247
So

306
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:35,295
It works sometimes but

307
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,575
We're just kind of like

308
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:40,671
I've had good luck with Bluetooth radios and devices in my house

309
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,695
However

310
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,231
I'm still hurt

311
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:48,607
That I like the concept of the remote I'd rather maybe be Wi-Fi then if it can't be Bluetooth

312
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,399
Been up for training purposes

313
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,423
The moon Portland

314
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,447
Just put the

315
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,727
Microphone

316
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:56,287
Voice Control in the Amazon

317
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,567
Echo app

318
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,383
Your phone already has a microphone built into it

319
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,175
That's true and that would be

320
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,199
Actually

321
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:09,343
And I shall correct myself it is no longer the Amazon Echo app don't know if you noticed this when they have to SmartThings stuff

322
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:12,159
Elsa updated the app and is now called the Amazon

323
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,439
You know who rap

324
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:15,999
Oh it is I did not realize it was this

325
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,559
Who shall not be named

326
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:19,839
Yes Baltimore

327
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:21,375
Oh I should also say

328
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,399
Another thing

329
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:25,471
The things you cannot control via the echo

330
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:27,519
You cannot control

331
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,287
Finesse

332
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:31,871
In the Chamberlain so I have those hooked in through the wink

333
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:32,895
Same here

334
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:33,919
Can't control those

335
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:34,687
Nope

336
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:37,247
And I also I have the ecobee

337
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,783
My downstairs ecobee

338
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,319
Fear the SmartThings

339
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:43,391
And that is also not so anything that I

340
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,951
Lake-Link through an email

341
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:48,511
Assuming most of these are via a lot

342
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,047
Those don't

343
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,583
Tie into

344
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:55,423
I'm sure they will at some point just gets back to my point that

345
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:58,495
Our people have been waiting on this for so long

346
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:00,031
Piecemeal

347
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:02,847
Sure and I can't I can still control my

348
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:04,383
Nest through

349
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,735
Redeemable there

350
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:11,039
If I guess if I wanted a voice

351
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,063
Control thermostatic

352
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:12,831
Could have gone with the

353
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:13,599
Honeywell lyric

354
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,647
I just miss

355
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,695
Speaking of wings

356
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:22,047
I actually discovered my my issue that we talked about a couple weeks ago

357
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,327
With my

358
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,631
Inability to make a robot

359
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:31,007
That works with the wink system when calls their recipes for home automation robots

360
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:34,079
To make it so when my garage door opened that my porch light

361
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:34,847
Turned on

362
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:35,871
So

363
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:38,943
I finally had to break down and call the wink helpline beak

364
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:39,711
Because I

365
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:40,991
Figure out why

366
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,551
Sure and it's a known glitch with

367
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:46,623
Oh so anybody who's out there

368
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:50,975
With the wink system and is trying to do anything with the schedule

369
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:51,743
It runs

370
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,791
Overnight into the next day

371
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:56,607
It is having problems this is a tip for you

372
00:13:56,863 --> 00:14:00,191
We don't do it doesn't do that

373
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:02,239
Don't do it because it doesn't work

374
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:05,823
And that explains why I have not had a problem with my wink Hub because

375
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,615
My robot to schedules

376
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:11,199
Never go past midnight or from one night into the next day

377
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:16,063
They just added you things like checks to see if the lights are on at 10:45 or 11 p.m. and shut them all off

378
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:18,879
They never go into the next day so that makes sense

379
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,671
Cinderella

380
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,463
After midnight it turns into a pumpkin

381
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:24,767
Kids so I had wanted to have my

382
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,047
When my garage door open

383
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,839
I wanted my porch lights

384
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:32,959
To turn on and I wanted to do it when it was dark so between the hours of like 8:15 at night and

385
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:33,983
6 in the morning

386
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:36,031
And it it just wouldn't work

387
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,311
Tell me why

388
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,079
It didn't work

389
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,103
So

390
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:41,151
I called them and they explain that

391
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,175
And so what I did is

392
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:47,295
I now have it go away I have two robots one that goes from 8:15 at night till 11:59

393
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,831
And then another

394
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:49,599
Echoes from

395
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:52,671
It's a good worker and I mean it's not

396
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,695
Ideal core

397
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:55,487
But you can do what you wanted to do now

398
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:57,791
Yes I mean as long as there's a workaround

399
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,327
I won't complain

400
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:00,607
Slightly and

401
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:04,703
Do you like the only set up these robots a schedule one time

402
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:06,239
Basically so to me it's

403
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:10,079
That's a very minimal bit of effort for this work around

404
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,103
Flawless at work

405
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,127
It's very convenient

406
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,407
So gay on that

407
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,943
And we should get to

408
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,479
Will get to the new products

409
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:22,367
First up SEC filings show that there might be a new Nest Thermostat

410
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:26,463
We know very little about that butter buddy Dave's that's over at zatznotfunny

411
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:29,279
Man lives in the FCC database

412
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,303
Closet I'm guessing

413
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:32,607
I think he's a clerk for them it doesn't tell anybody

414
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:39,263
Seriously it is it's possible so he discovered that he actually also saw a new filing for it

415
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,055
An August Smart Lock that

416
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,591
May actually have a keypad

417
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,383
I know

418
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:47,711
I like to keep ads cuz they're good backup

419
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:49,503
Entry Point Casino

420
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:55,903
So those were two like worthwhile things that he found and then we should also talk about a brand new product that's out from Phila

421
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:58,207
It's a new product for their huge line

422
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:00,255
Is there Wireless dimmer kit

423
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:03,327
Which goes for 3995

424
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,351
It is

425
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,887
Going to be on sale

426
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:06,655
Next month

427
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,679
So September

428
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,215
And I have

429
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:10,751
I tested one

430
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,543
It's actually in my back

431
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,311
Right now

432
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:20,479
Don't even ask I was just going to say I don't know why you're doing lights in the bathroom with whatever you do is your business

433
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:22,271
Wake up when I go to the bathroom in the middle of the night

434
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:27,391
I guess so keep lights down low he and I just thought you were running out of room to Stew

435
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:29,951
You know testing this is also a problem

436
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:32,767
So the dimmer switch

437
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:33,791
So what this is

438
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:34,815
The kid

439
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,607
It comes with a Phillips

440
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:37,375
Lux

441
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:40,959
Light which is there white dimmable light that

442
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:42,495
Is Kevin pointed out is it

443
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,263
27

444
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,311
That's correct

445
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:47,103
Best soft white 2700

446
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,127
Calvin's

447
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,151
And it's it

448
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:50,943
Sunny and warm

449
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:58,879
And it comes with a remote control that affixes to a wall mount via

450
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,927
A magnet I'll cook it for you guys

451
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,231
Interesting

452
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:04,767
Click

453
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,047
Very high-tech

454
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,351
It basically has four buttons on it

455
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,375
On off

456
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,911
And then a brighter and a dimmers

457
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,191
And

458
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:13,215
I didn't like this product

459
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,775
Glad to hear

460
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:18,079
It's not laggy it works as advertised

461
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,103
It's just

462
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,383
As someone who

463
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,431
Has Lutron lighting

464
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,735
This did not behave like I wanted

465
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,527
A dimmer switch to be high

466
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,063
First of all

467
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:31,647
You can't start you can't turn the light on

468
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:32,671
Crumb

469
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:36,255
The dimmer position so you can only turn it on for the on position

470
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,815
And it remembers the last

471
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,887
You can turn it off from

472
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:44,191
Spot does that make sense

473
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:48,799
So does that mean this is a switch that turns the light on in office what was Tims it right or no

474
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:49,823
Yes but

475
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,871
In most dimmer switches you can

476
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:54,175
You can hit the dimmer switch

477
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,199
All the way down

478
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:57,759
Okay I see what you're saying

479
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:01,599
Here you hit the dimmer switch and it goes to as dim as it can go and then

480
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:04,159
But it's still on right now

481
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:04,927
Understood

482
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,719
I didn't know how to

483
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,767
But you did

484
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,559
I got there eventually

485
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,607
So that's that was

486
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:18,495
What kind of issue with it the other is that it just doesn't feel elegant the remote control is

487
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:19,519
A little thick

488
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:21,311
It's

489
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,847
If you wall mounted

490
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:23,615
The magnet

491
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:25,151
It's not tight so

492
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,687
Kind of cookie like

493
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,991
Here it is wall-mounted and when I

494
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,527
Punching it it kind of wobbles

495
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:33,599
Here when I do hear it wobbling

496
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:34,879
Yasso

497
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:36,415
So all of those things just

498
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:39,743
It is it feels cheap and it is

499
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:42,559
I mean the light the light

500
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:43,327
Is $20

501
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,119
Right

502
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,423
The switch and remote is $20

503
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,703
Basically

504
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,007
What I thought was in

505
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,031
Interesting two things

506
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,103
Is the Phillips Phillips's first remote

507
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:57,407
And it's the first thing that works without the

508
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,175
The bridge

509
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:02,271
Yeah I was going to say you know this doesn't tie into that goes directly to the light

510
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,319
No it can't work with

511
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,111
Okay you can breathe

512
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,135
The bridge but if you want

513
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,159
Buy this off

514
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:08,927
The Shelf

515
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:09,695
An atom

516
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:10,719
Dimmable light

517
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:18,911
Yeah so how do you link the the to the light bulb and the and the dimming switch

518
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:20,959
Contagious

519
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:22,239
Best work right out of the box

520
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,031
They're already prepared okay

521
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:30,175
3 - paired

522
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,991
Okay you could buy

523
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:33,759
That

524
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:36,575
And then a bunch of other Hue Lux lights and then boom

525
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:37,599
Your business

526
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:39,391
Would it work with the

527
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,927
Hue color bulbs or no

528
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,463
It will

529
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:44,511
I think when you add it to the app

530
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,279
I haven't

531
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:47,071
Play it around I haven't had a

532
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:49,375
Enough time with Bridge

533
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:53,215
I was going to say that probably requires the bridge anyway

534
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:54,751
Sugar so I haven't

535
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:55,775
I haven't done that yet

536
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:59,103
Cuz when you have disco night at your house you can dim the lights and what not

537
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:00,639
I guess so

538
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:03,711
Again I'm still waiting for extra settings to like

539
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:07,807
Get the bridge although I did download a new app so maybe we'll have hue

540
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,343
Shoe app date

541
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,879
Talk about some fun apps

542
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:12,159
Yeah

543
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:14,719
All right so that's a lot that we talked

544
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:16,511
I knew this was going to be a lot

545
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,815
But I feel like we've done a lot

546
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:19,583
Good things

547
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:20,351
Guess

548
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:22,143
Yes and we haven't made a scene

549
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,423
I feel like I made it

550
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:24,959
That's okay

551
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,775
I'm too overly dramatic when

552
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:29,567
I acknowledge it

553
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:33,407
All right so I think that's

554
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,991
That's it for this week so stay tuned for our guest

555
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,271

00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:09,759
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest we have

564
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:11,295
Claire Rowland

565
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:15,135
Who is the author of a book called designing connected products

566
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:17,184
Actually she's the lead author on this

567
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,464
Many others

568
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:20,256
Lots of them

569
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:22,304
And hi Claire how are you doing

570
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,608
I am doing very well thank you and you

571
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:27,424
Super well so you're in London where it's raining so if you guys

572
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,192
Start to feel

573
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,008
Sleepy during the podcast that is not us that is

574
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:32,544
Soft

575
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,568
Spits of rain

576
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:34,336
Polygon clear

577
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,664
But hopefully it will keep you engaged

578
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,432
This is a great topic

579
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,712
So

580
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:41,248
Clear in writing this book

581
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:42,784
What

582
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,552
Surprise YouTube

583
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:45,088
Oh well

584
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:46,368
So I guess

585
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:52,256
One of the things that inspired me to write this book Quizlet was things that I had learned at surprise me

586
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:55,840
Ux design of research shows

587
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:58,912
The Prototype S&M I previously been working in

588
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:02,752
What happened mobile inside and software answer

589
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:04,288
Cross-platform services

590
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:07,104
I'm going to start working in commercial iot

591
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:13,760
They remember things that this would have jumped out at me as the CDs at these are things I have not to think about before these are things only

592
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:18,112
Hadn't anticipated speed to be having to deal with tutu quite the expense

593
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:20,160
And I think I lost it then why

594
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:24,256
Alabama technical issues

595
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,792
Copesan white background but it was

596
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:27,072
It was things like

597
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,864
So the impact of

598
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,144
Things like networking

599
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,680
On wheel wells

600
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:36,032
What happens when you are trying to control a thing in the real world

601
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:40,640
And you I know and suddenly it might take the seconds to respond to you

602
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:42,432
So it might not respond at all

603
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:45,504
I know you saw those aren't there's a quiet visit

604
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:51,392
Things we take for granted I guess one way when were using the other what happened

605
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:55,744
Turn screen sometimes they're all these delays and failures

606
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,816
Are we supposed Rising but we we know what to do about this thing

607
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:01,120
Listen to Real World objects

608
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:03,424
Consult to feel quite broke

609
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:05,984
What is a mass-market

610
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,520
Consumerism scary things like

611
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:12,384
Turn the lights on and it takes 30 seconds to respond and sometimes it just doesn't respond

612
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:15,456
Sometimes Vamps having you a lights on when I say it's off

613
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:17,248
I know this is a really really weird things

614
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:23,648
But I think you know this is kind of every doctors at this time we supposed to type ground say but Ashley doesn't quite strange

615
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:24,416
Pocket uses

616
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:27,744
So that was that was nice I guess that was the kind of

617
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,816
The challenges of eventually making the stuff work

618
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:32,864
Reliably is

619
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:34,912
Pea flour market expected to

620
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:37,728
And then I was also

621
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:41,824
I think the other technical complexity so things like interoperability and just the

622
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,360
Another fight but we have to

623
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:49,760
I think it is designed as a kind of tend to approach this the stuff with disability lies vision of you know all this stuff just going to talk to each other when

624
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:53,856
That point yet

625
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:55,648
On the wrong reasons

626
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:56,416
Why

627
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:57,952
We might not be at that point

628
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:58,976
For example

629
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:04,096
Connected devices my run on batteries they may not be constantly connected to the network

630
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:10,752
So actually instead of one kind of great big system in which everything you know is what's best website and everything that is everything else is doing

631
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:13,056
San Francisco Museum

632
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:19,712
I think that the kind of states that license say the reliability the intro fertility in the kind of discontinuity Takashi

633
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:24,064
Really which I guess is this another suppose down to what happens when you put the network

634
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:24,832
Can things

635
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:30,720
Didn't work quite the way perhaps I'd expected it to I'm not cool to some really interesting issues design

636
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:31,744
Okay so

637
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,024
This for you is like

638
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:33,792
Wow

639
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:35,840
This is really broken so it's

640
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:36,608
The challenge

641
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:44,288
Yeah I mean I think that's the thing that I don't say it's entirely broken but I think that there are sesame some chili

642
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,568
Challenges in

643
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:50,432
Bringing it to a mass-market Williams Show cyanotic particularly in the home which is a

644
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:53,504
And I really wish people really don't want you breaking my things

645
00:24:54,784 --> 00:25:00,160
I know probably raising somebody watching the book was that I wasn't saying that you wasn't seeing some of these challenges being told about else by

646
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:01,952
Okay

647
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:05,536
How pretty is the internet of things for consumer

648
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,352
The way you're talking about it it feels like

649
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:09,120
Maybe it's

650
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:10,400
Not that ready

651
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:12,448
I think it will get better

652
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:14,752
I think it's behind snots

653
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:17,056
I think it's in the process of guessing that

654
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:18,336
I think there are

655
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:19,872
Challenges in making

656
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:20,896
King sings work

657
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:22,688
As well as

658
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,712
Staplehouse

659
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:26,528
It never stops my smoke it wouldn't synthetic spice

660
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:27,552
I think probably won't

661
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:30,624
Say is it in the in the case of certain products

662
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:34,720
Conductivity out in connectivity outside and go intelligence will make

663
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:39,072
Perfect sense within the context of a product with a ready welder signs

664
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:40,352
Function

665
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:43,680
So something I can do about something I can.

666
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:44,960
8 mics

667
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:45,984
Perfect sense

668
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:52,384
To be able to wants to be able to access those things while you're

669
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,432
Leasing a car

670
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:55,456
Strong

671
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,224
I think

672
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,784
Will probably take more time to take off

673
00:25:59,296 --> 00:25:59,808
Is

674
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:00,576
Thesaurus

675
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:03,136
Vision of lots of interconnected systems

676
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:07,232
So are all systems out by which which which which which

677
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:11,328
Security which one of these things or these things still together

678
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,352
But I think

679
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:14,400
It's going to be awhile before

680
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:20,032
I think right now when I was at the point where we can make those things into quite well and it's it's not just a question of

681
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:26,432
Tell us a question of Designing Common Sense things for bicycle bicycle denied and keeping the

682
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:31,296
Let's talk about that because

683
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:32,832
I am so done

684
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:36,672
In most people look at me like I have grown a third head when I start

685
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,464
I always say

686
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,488
And it's really a second

687
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:42,560
The second head is probably what would drive

688
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:44,096
The third head

689
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,240
So I drove my second had a dealer like you're so crazy about the Internet of Things

690
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:53,568
Talk about why this is compelling

691
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,592
Because

692
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:58,688
I tried to explain to people you don't demand response and how being able to

693
00:26:58,944 --> 00:26:59,712
Control like

694
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:05,088
Electrical use in being able to space out you know my washer and my dryer

695
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:17,632
Let's find use cases where maybe it's systemic but let's get people excited about

696
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:18,912
Home automation

697
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:20,192
The internet

698
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,472
Because

699
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:24,032
You know again this is very exciting to me

700
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:27,616
So what's exciting about it to you what's the positive why are you do

701
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:33,248
I think it's about giving people more control over their wealth over their environments

702
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,296
About knowing what's happening

703
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:36,320
I think it's

704
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:38,624
About making less environment

705
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,696
Small so that it can it can do some of the

706
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:46,048
The kind of work that that we don't really want to have to do

707
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,072
I think it's

708
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:53,472
You know I have a I have a kind of have another thing as well that I kind of like the five of those computers and stuff in there talking to each other enough

709
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:59,360
What are the challenges at the moment is that it's really hard for people who are not

710
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:01,408
You don't have a programmatic mindset

711
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:08,064
Ashley to Tucanos to do go to the specific configuration involves systems that that do

712
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:10,624
Handle coordination between

713
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,672
Multiple things like Kenobi.

714
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:15,744
Counter stools and lighting and Security in

715
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,536
Ion safety Systems

716
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:21,376
Anticipating how old are those things should coordinate with one another

717
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:23,168
If you push up bad moms

718
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:29,568
It's going out to people to do that until I will let you know of course I want my I want my sprinklers to come on when I

719
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:35,968
Looking out the window

720
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:37,760
I want to come take you to schedule

721
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:44,160
I'm not scraping social condition some ass tonight then I don't have to worry about watching the god

722
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,696
You forgotten that not things running

723
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:49,024
Exceptional

724
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:55,680
There are always the problem is that realized I'm taking home I think he is quite is quite messy

725
00:28:56,704 --> 00:29:00,288
I'm particularly if you if you live in Ohio weather alerts of people coming

726
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:06,432
Those rules inside but I always want this thing, never want this thing happen

727
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:10,272
Until you stop casting to get what I want this thing to happen but not when X y&z

728
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:12,064
And then before you know it

729
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:16,928
So many exceptions and so many rules, things talking to a coordination how things

730
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:20,256
It's very easy to select again. New situation where you actually lost

731
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:22,304
Control rather than gain more of it

732
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:27,424
So I think that's one of the reasons aside I think Anna Anna in commercial and Industrial settings

733
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:33,824
It's often very much easier to to codify how things are supposed to be working until identify what's an exception is

734
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,640
What something is that that require someone's attention

735
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:43,040
And what's not to know when should an alarm one of the things I will continue to research with

736
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:44,576
People around security systems

737
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:46,880
One of the problems that people with teenagers have

738
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:50,464
Is the Titanic unassembled Hive it was tonight

739
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,792
I forgot that folks I forgot to phone spy forget

740
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:55,584
I forgot the code

741
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,936
Who is always true always triggering alarms in a lot B long shouldn't

742
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:02,240
Identify

743
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:07,616
Turn off someones that he shouldn't be bad but actually got somebody

744
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:10,176
But it really hurts what's it to identify the difference

745
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:10,944
Because you called

746
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,296
Will oil not person to be able to identify themselves through the conventional mean

747
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:19,392
I think that's why I say that I think the home is particularly complicated

748
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:22,976
But I take it you didn't trust me because it's a sizable challenge

749
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:24,768
I agree

750
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:27,584
Listen to I adjust written a story

751
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:30,400
And if we talked about this actually and why am I smart

752
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:36,544
And someone actually so I talked about reasons being social

753
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:39,360
And being like a lack of good AI

754
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:41,408
And kind of a lack of Interest

755
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:42,432
Stability but

756
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:43,968
Someone actually looks like

757
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:44,736
LCC

758
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:51,136
Why do you want your home to be that automated this idea that you want your home to know this much about you

759
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:53,184
Maybe that's just not the way to go

760
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,000
You know he has a point

761
00:30:56,512 --> 00:31:01,376
And maybe it wasn't she I don't I don't remember who it was but you know this person had a very good point where

762
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:04,192
I'm envisioning like my home really having

763
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,288
A wonderful sense of who I am and who is in the home

764
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:09,568
And being able to react

765
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:10,336
Accordingly

766
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:11,616
And I know that's

767
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:15,968
I know we're not because I actually live with all these devices and I know how dumb

768
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,760
I love them anyway

769
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:20,576
But I recognize that most people will not want to

770
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:22,112
Deal with that

771
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:24,672
I got to pick him like wokasch why do I want

772
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:26,976
Is it because I really hate turning on

773
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:27,744
Light switches

774
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,280
Is that so hard

775
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:36,960
I think in my case there is a passive and it's going to sound like

776
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,824
Does a bit of techno utopianism. I really wanted to be like that

777
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:48,480
Elias I want the United States to me that they won't survive all that just doesn't let just tell the boring stuff.

778
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:49,504
So I don't have to

779
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:50,784
I think it's

780
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,600
There is that kind of berries that kind of dream

781
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:56,416
It's just a you know I think that fool

782
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:58,976
Mainstream consumer right now

783
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:01,792
If you put it turns on

784
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:02,816
Cortisol

785
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:08,448
Sing is a nest of all star system is 100% reliable

786
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,240
And if you have something that's

787
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:13,312
Some of these systems only works maybe 90% of the time

788
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:18,688
Open maps know it's telling you I saw a real review of a of a connected X system

789
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:19,968
We shall remain nameless

790
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:23,552
I was just lost him masturbating Tuesday istick but Seth has

791
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:28,160
Vice versa

792
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:31,744
But it's okay cuz you were in the room at the same time so you can see whether the lights on or off

793
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:37,632
This is why we put the internet

794
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:44,288
Let's switch gears just a little bit and talk about in your book you have this this fun kind of chapter on

795
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:45,568
Different types of

796
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:47,104
Interactions that people

797
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,200
Can have and that's that's one of my favorite things to think about it because

798
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:53,504
I think when you're thinking about

799
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:56,064
We've had

800
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,344
Computers you had

801
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,880
Keyboards

802
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,744
Wow

803
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,792
Touch screen

804
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:08,352
Another category

805
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,168
And now we got voice and that's that's

806
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:13,984
Excited and thinking about the different ways you can interact

807
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,080
Other things really with wearables

808
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,128
Skin kind of

809
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:22,432
Talk to things you got the ability to lie

810
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:23,968
You know there's this

811
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:25,504
90

812
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,552
The thing that measures your heart rate

813
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:29,344
There's all kinds of ways you can

814
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:32,928
Stop so let's talk about some of the interactions out there

815
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:33,696
What did

816
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:34,720
Possible because

817
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:35,488
Dang it

818
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:36,768
I don't think we did that in

819
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:37,792
Beyond

820
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:43,168
It started to talk to me and respond

821
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:44,704
It's so

822
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,520
But ticket Beyond things like touchless

823
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:49,568
Let's talk about plausible you eyes for

824
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:50,848
Ashley lets slip

825
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:53,152
Straight to the weird Crazy Ones

826
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:55,968
Let's talk about what you think is probably

827
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:57,504
The top you eyes for the

828
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:58,528
Smart Home

829
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:01,600
Wow I think he is very much about

830
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:07,232
What about what's appropriate for what you're trying to do and that will be different for different types of system so

831
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:10,048
Think that one of the things I would hope

832
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:13,120
That we can do as much as possible as trying to

833
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:16,192
Alex light. During the Yuan question but I think

834
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:19,008
Is learn as much about contacts

835
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:20,800
Possible

836
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:25,664
Just as a kind of exhausting longest wooden it be nice if you can if you can do a fixative like

837
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:32,064
Gesturing to the audience to bring on all your

838
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,344
Hyman's timer system

839
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,208
In front of gas stove

840
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:42,560
Be quite fun on your I bet it would be kind of embarrassing in front of gas on its also

841
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:43,840
Just deserve it

842
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:49,216
Awesome whatever problems I think they're the kind of waving at the nest protect thing from in a year-and-a-half ago I think

843
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,824
People do when they're actually on fire

844
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:54,848
So

845
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:56,896
Yeah that's that's that's it.

846
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:58,176
Challenge invoices

847
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:00,480
Voice is kind of an interesting one because that's the

848
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:10,976
It can be quite noisy that can be call me to call 2 to get right it means that you've got to

849
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:12,512
People can hear what you doing

850
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:15,328
Which plants s area waste waste want

851
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:20,448
So I think that was the something about 70 something about devices being able to

852
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:21,216
Descendants

853
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:25,056
When you need them and infer from my contacts

854
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:31,712
I don't know if you've seen this the Concord Towers fixing who used to be a frog who produced a concept design for summer

855
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:35,296
Roommate

856
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:38,112
Jared and

857
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:39,904
Mark Rolston

858
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:41,696
Quesadilla

859
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:44,000
When they were frog that they invited me over

860
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:45,280
It was in Austin

861
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:52,448
Add a camera

862
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:57,056
And I believe it

863
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:02,432
It is interesting about Rumi was it Wilson spouse

864
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:06,272
August things go to Voice interface this thing has a gestural interface

865
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:08,320
You notice things using using

866
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:10,112
Tactile output

867
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:13,696
Breakdown for 8 it was about it was a combination of two message

868
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:15,744
So that you could point out alarm

869
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,280
On-site turn on

870
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:18,816
Stop Islam pea

871
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,352
Whatever it was

872
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:23,680
And between the combination of the cameras on invoice

873
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:25,472
Assistant

874
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:29,824
You you wanted to turn on my lamp and which lamp it was that you that you want to turn on

875
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:33,408
I think it's it's combining it's the combination

876
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:35,200
Interface types

877
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:40,064
On the understanding of the simple thing to do but in a minute it's a relatively simple

878
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,600
Inferences contacts

879
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:42,368
Foam mat

880
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,672
Makes a much more compelling cyst

881
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:48,768
I think with the ability to have like

882
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:49,792
Bluetooth mesh Network

883
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:52,096
Or if you want to say

884
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:54,400
I only say Bluetooth because we have

885
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:57,472
Do cheetahs kind of the accepted wearable standard

886
00:36:57,728 --> 00:37:01,824
So if you got Bluetooth sensors now in your light bulbs or

887
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:02,592
In

888
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:04,384
Little things around your home

889
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,456
Other bluetooth light bulbs are Bluetooth plugs

890
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:13,856
What you've got suddenly is the ability to do proximity sensing in a room so you can say hey this person's

891
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:14,624
In this room

892
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:16,160
And you can say

893
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:17,696
Just turn on the light

894
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:21,024
In the Assumption as you would be turning on the lights in this room

895
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:24,864
As opposed to right now when I'm turning on the lights I'm telling

896
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,400
I'm saying turn on living room

897
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:31,008
This is addressing one of the other problems which his everything in the home is connected

898
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:32,288
Said you got lots of things

899
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:37,664
Anna needs a friend not just to figure out which things you're addressing at 8 points and meet you end up please

900
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:39,200
You know can you can end up with

901
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:44,832
A massive zones and scenes in groups of elements and send some of these systems

902
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:51,488
But also then I'll just switch things am I addressing at the moment but I will say which things might I want to be doing something with it

903
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:54,048
Configuring something to happen to us another time

904
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,096
And so those kind of

905
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:58,400
Anything I can do to help

906
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:00,960
A little bit easier running is a scribe

907
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:05,824
But it's a ways that's always a challenge with contact sensitivity that you can

908
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,616
You can it's pretty easy to live

909
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:12,224
Well you know I make too many assumptions about what somebody wants in that moment

910
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:22,720
So I think it's

911
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:24,256
I think it's about

912
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:29,888
Combination bios I think it's about options and I wanted to say little things that's really I think

913
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:31,424
Quite interested in is

914
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:33,216
The option to choose

915
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,776
The interaction Channel

916
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:38,336
Best suits audio needs but also your

917
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:40,384
Abilities of disabilities

918
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:41,408
So

919
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:42,944
I think this is a kind of

920
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:43,712
Is it snowing

921
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:44,480
Beam

922
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:45,504
Taraji P

923
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:50,624
People walking in this area of of accessibility on

924
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:53,696
I think is it that some extremely powerful potential.

925
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:59,328
So if you think about it a kind of conventional heating controller for example which generally has a

926
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:01,120
Tikki bright LCD screen

927
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:03,680
Listen to somebody with low vision to see

928
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:10,080
If you can duplicate that functionality in a smartphone. We have I perhaps there that the phone will have Macy's accessibility

929
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:12,896
Pictures of stuff like my voice over on the on the iPhone

930
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:15,456
Channel that that person

931
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:20,832
Which is good for other people but it's also good to people who don't see the Box very well

932
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:21,600
Missy

933
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:24,160
So what kind of devices do you have

934
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:26,720
Your house is it is cluttered is mine

935
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:31,328
Which is very cluttered it's very toxic but it's not particularly houses with

936
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:32,608
Connect two things

937
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:35,424
I don't know if it's composite CSU pumps my fake

938
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:37,472
Does a couple of fitness trackers

939
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:40,032
But they kind of the sporadic to use

940
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,824
Is a pebble but again

941
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,104
Baby sporadic to use

942
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:46,176
Because I'm waiting for my watch to get off of work

943
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:48,224
Does the wangjing scale

944
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:50,272
Hue Lights

945
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:53,344
Amazon favorite Hue smart plugs

946
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:58,720
I've been testing home monitoring system so kind of spent the kits that

947
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:01,024
We have an unknown connect

948
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:07,424
Security alarm testing kind of stomach makes his stuff but I'm already gone to any of it suited to work as well as I would like to

949
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:11,264
Bissell so I was only featuring control up she's a British gas

950
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,800
At the British a product

951
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:16,384
It's not The Shining you e-file wanted state is the old one

952
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:20,736
So that's what we have to do we have anything else

953
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:24,832

You asked for the Internet of Things

958
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:33,024
The book is designing connected products

959
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:34,304
It is

960
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,840
There's a hefty tome

961
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:36,864
I'm not going to lie to you

962
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:41,472
But there is a lot of stuff in here I'm still reading it and I'm still learning a lot of stuff from it so
